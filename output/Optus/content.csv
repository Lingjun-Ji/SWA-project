While it has  been a challenging year for us, we are  committed to being transparent and  sharing the meaningful progress we  have made against our sustainability  strategy, as well as the challenges  faced. Our commitment to this is evident  through our actions, outlined here.  Taking bolder climate action  We have made progress reducing our emissions based  on our original Science Based Target initiative (SBTi)  targets set in 2017. During the year, together with the  Singtel Group, we renewed our emissions reductions  targets, validated by SBTi and aligned with the goals  of the Paris Climate Agreement, which aims to limit  global warming to 1.5°C. Together with the Singtel  Group, we have committed to achieve net zero  greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2045 (brought  forward from 2050). This includes a commitment to  further reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions  by 55% and Scope 3 emissions by 40% across our  operations and supply chain between FY23 and FY30.  Our efforts to reduce emissions are focused on  improving our energy efficiency, decommissioning  legacy systems and increasing our use of renewable  energy to help us achieve our Scope 1 and Scope 2  emissions reduction targets. Steps we have taken this  year include launching our National Solar Program at  five key exchanges and satellite sites and signing our  first Power Purchase Agreement, which is expected  to increase the share of electricity from renewable  sources to 42% from January 2025. We recognise  the importance of a multi-pronged approach to our  operational emissions reductions given the volatility  of the energy markets of the past few years and the  increasing challenges in the renewable energy sector  due to escalating supply chain costs and transmission  curtailment.  Digital enablement  We recognise the transformative power of  connectivity in bridging the digital divide and driving  socio-economic development. Through our flagship  initiatives like Digital Thumbprint and Donate Your  Data,™ we continue to educate young people on digital  safety, improve their digital wellbeing and expand  access and connectivity to those who need it most. In  FY24, we celebrated 10 years of our Digital Thumbprint  program, which has educated over 620,000 students  from over 1,100 unique schools. We also launched new  resources that provide our customers with practical  tools, such as our new First Phone Quiz and Guide,  to help parents and caregivers evaluate their child’s  readiness for their first phone. 4 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Overview  ===== PAGE 5 ===== Equity and inclusion  This year we launched our first Reflect Reconciliation  Action Plan (RAP), demonstrating our commitment  towards inclusivity and making meaningful progress  with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples,  communities, partners and businesses. Our RAP  Steering Committee and Working Groups will  ensure we continue to make progress against the  commitments outlined in our RAP.  We remain committed to respecting the human  rights of all individuals and maintaining responsible  supply chain practices. This year we released our  fourth Modern Slavery Statement, progressed the  development of our supplier engagement roadmap  and commenced the review of selected suppliers in  high-risk supplier categories.  Strengthening resilience and   reliability for our customers  Strengthening network resilience remains a priority   for our business following the cyber attack and  network outage our customers experienced last year.  The network outage on 8 November 2023 was a  challenging experience for our customers and for  our community. We are sorry that in this instance   we fell short of delivering the services the community  and our customers expect. We remain committed   to continuously strengthening the resiliency of   our network.  This year we also launched a new Australian-based  specialist care team to support our vulnerable  customers to access and maintain connectivity during  challenging times. The team has provided tailored  support to over 2,600 vulnerable customers in the  form of financial relief and specific connectivity issues.  Looking forward  As we look ahead, we remain steadfast in our  commitment to sustainability. We will continue  to innovate, collaborate and demonstrate that  responsible business practices are not only good for  people and the planet, but essential for long-term  business success.   We would like to thank all our amazing people and our  dedicated sustainability team at Optus, whose passion  and commitment continues to drive progress on our  sustainability strategy and targets. We also thank our  valued customers and stakeholders for their ongoing  support as they continue to journey with us.

This report  gives our stakeholders a closer look at  our sustainability strategy, targets,  initiatives and performance across  Environmental, Social and Governance  (ESG) matters and is aligned with our  sustainability strategy and six focus  areas: Climate Action, Circular Economy,  Digital Enablement, Sustainable  Innovation, Future of Work and Equity  and Inclusion. Optus is a subsidiary of Singapore Telecommunications  Limited (‘Singtel’). Our sustainability performance and  impact are outlined in this report, and our ESG data  and activities are integrated into the Singtel Group  Sustainability Report 2024 and the Singtel Group  Annual Report 2024. The Singtel Group Report also  contains further details of the reporting standards  used to guide our reporting, our employee policies and  our broader ESG focus as a Group. Since 2008 we  have referenced the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)  universal standards as a guide when reporting on  sustainability activities and outcomes. You can view  our activities against the GRI topics and indicators in  the Singtel Group Sustainability Report. We are aware  of the proposed Australian Sustainability Reporting  Standards (ASRS) and their key reporting domains  and are assessing their relevance and applicability   to Optus. As part of our Group reporting, EY Singapore has  provided limited assurance on a selection of our key  ESG disclosures. You can view their assurance report  in the Singtel Group Sustainability Report. We have  emissions reduction targets validated by the Science  Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and we use the  Business for Societal Impact methodology to measure  and report on our contribution to the community. The  Business for Societal Impact has verified that our  evaluation of our community investment contributions  is correct. Optus is a signatory to, or participant  in, various voluntary sustainability initiatives and  memberships. You can view the full list on our website.

These six focus areas were  identified through our materiality process conducted in 2020. We have committed to five-year sustainability targets within each focus area: Climate Action  Support and enable the transition  across our value chain towards a  net-zero emissions world and building  adaptation and resilience to the  increasing effects of climate change. Sustainable Innovation Help innovators address the most  pressing social and environmental  challenges through the power of  technology. Digital Enablement Empowering vulnerable and  disadvantaged Australians to  achieve, thrive and belong in the  digital world. Equity and Inclusion  Empower Australians of all ages,  backgrounds, gender, beliefs and  abilities to reach their potential.  Circular Economy From supply chain and product  packaging to general day-to-day  waste from our operations, there are  many opportunities to reduce the use  of resources and turn what may have  once been rubbish, into resource. Future of Work  Build knowledge and skills for  people to thrive in an ever-changing  digital world.  Our sustainability strategy We’re refining our sustainability framework  and strategy beyond FY25. This gives us a  meaningful opportunity to ensure our future  focus is on the sustainability issues that matter  most to our business and our stakeholders.   In FY24, we initiated an assessment to identify  our material sustainability-related risks and  opportunities. The assessment viewed our  potential material sustainability topics through  a dual lens: both how our business impacts  sustainability topics, and how sustainability  topics impact our business, and the financial  materiality of these impacts. The insights from this assessment will inform  and guide us as we refine and refresh our  sustainability strategy beyond FY25. We will  share an update on our new sustainability  strategy and targets in our FY25 annual  sustainability report.

However, due to various challenges, such as volatility of energy  markets and operating challenges, we have removed this goal from our sustainability strategy. 10 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Overview  ===== PAGE 11 ===== Climate action Circular economy Digital enablement FY24 sustainability performance highlights at a glance Updated our Singtel Group  commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse  gas emissions across our Singapore and Australian operations   by 2045 (brought forward from 2050) Achieved energy  efficiency  improvements estimated at 16.1 Gigawatt hours  per annum Increased the use of renewable  electricity across our operations  from 25.37%   to 27.50%  of our total consumption when mandatory   large-scale generation certificates (LGCs)   are included (6.7% to 8.5% when mandatory   LGCs are excluded) 85%  of packaging is recyclable,  reusable or compostable from approximately 300   Optus-branded products  Recycled or reused  97.8% of e-waste  from our operations including network sites,  corporate offices and retail stores Received over   37,830 devices   for recycling,  resulting in approximately  19.5 tonnes  of mineral resources saved Celebrated 10 years  of our Digital Thumbprint program Our Digital Thumbprint   program has educated over 60,500 students on digital safety Won the Contribution  to Society award  for the Optus Digital Thumbprint   program at the 2023 ACOMM Awards Our Donate Your Data™   program supported 45,225  vulnerable and disadvantaged   Australians, including  Over 5,700  First Nations participants  via our charity partners since 2019 11 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Overview  ===== PAGE 12 ===== Sustainable innovation Future of work Equity and inclusion FY24 sustainability performance highlights at a glance Partnered with   2022 Optus Future Maker,   Charopy to install six solar   powered smart  recycling bins  at our campus in Sydney to   minimise waste contamination Supported   Charopy  in piloting their smart   recycling bins in Thailand,  working with local social enterprise GEPP  as part of the Singtel Group regional future  makers program Our people continue to upskill with  525 new Optus U  accreditations Welcomed 61   new graduates Over 1,000 people  participated in a skilled  volunteering activity Awarded 5th place   in GoodCompany’s  Best Workplaces   to Give Back  award in October 2023 20,752 hours of volunteer work contributed 150 students  participated in our annual   Pathways 2 Employment program Launched our first  Reconciliation   Action Plan  demonstrating our   dedication to reconciliation Our Specialist Care team   supported over  2,600 vulnerable  customers  with financial relief and access to connectivity Finalist in the  Women Technology 2023   Employer of Change Award  demonstrating our commitment to promoting  women in technology, fostering an inclusive work  environment and driving innovation  12 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Overview  ===== PAGE 13 ===== Engaging with our stakeholders is about building  meaningful and transparent relationships. Our diverse  group of stakeholders provide us with insightful  feedback which is foundational to our sustainability  strategy and approach.  We proactively engage with our stakeholders in a  variety of ways, such as via face-to-face and virtual  meetings, roundtable discussions, forums, events,  surveys, customer success representatives and  direct feedback obtained via email sustainability@ optus.com.au  Our sustainability strategy is formed  in collaboration with our stakeholders through a  thorough materiality review every three to five years.  This enables us to prioritise the most relevant concerns  of our stakeholders and ensure that we are identifying  and addressing the issues that matter most to them.  Stakeholder engagement Our stakeholders Throughout this report, you will discover  our trusted partnerships and active  engagement with a range of stakeholders,  as we seek to collaborate on initiatives  where we can make a more meaningful and  sustainable impact by working together. We actively participate in industry  groups and networks, align with global  sustainability standards (Global Reporting  Initiative, Science Based Targets initiative,  GSMA to name a few) and seek to  collaborate on initiatives where collectively  we can make a bigger impact.

This RAP demonstrates and formalises our  commitment to reconciliation. Our Reflect RAP will guide us to make  meaningful progress and impact, further fostering and strengthening  relationships with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples,  communities, partners and businesses. Read more about our  commitments in our RAP and on page 62. 14 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Overview  ===== PAGE 15 ===== At Optus, in all areas of our operations,  including our sustainability activities, we  are committed to upholding corporate  governance practices that include clear  policies and processes, and robust  controls to establish accountability and  give our stakeholders peace of mind.  We strive to adhere to the highest standards of  personal and corporate integrity, outlined in our   Code of Conduct. We expect our people to embody  these principles in their actions and decision  making and to conduct themselves in line with our  organisational values.  In line with our Code of Conduct, we must comply  with all laws, regulations, codes of practice, and  legal, regulatory and licensing requirements, including  directions and orders of any government or statutory  or regulatory authority in the areas in which we  operate. This includes tax regulations in Australia. Our  Code of Conduct aligns with our Anti-Bribery and  Corruption, Fraud Investigation and Whistleblowing  policies, which are Singtel Group-wide policies. How sustainability is governed Optus is guided by Singtel Group’s sustainability  governance approach, which includes the management  of ESG sustainability governance and key performance  indicators (KPIs). The Singtel Board provides oversight  to the Group, along with the Management Committee  and Risk Management Committee, on material ESG  topics. The Group CEO provides the Board with regular  updates on various sustainability programs, upcoming  activities, and updates on global trends that have an  impact on our sustainability strategy. During the year,  Singtel Group revised the terms of reference of the  Board Risk Committee. Now known as the Risk and  Sustainability Committee (RSC), it assists the Board  in providing oversight of Singtel Group’s sustainability,  including climate, strategy, targets, programs and  performance, in addition to risk matters. For more  information, please refer to the Singtel Group  Sustainability Report.  At Optus, the Singtel Optus Pty Limited (SOPL)  Board and Executive Leadership have responsibility  for overseeing our ESG strategy and monitoring our  performance. This year, Optus also introduced an ESG  Steering Committee, made up of representatives from  our executive team with the delegation to govern,  endorse and approve on strategies and progress  relating to our material ESG topics. We also have a  range of advisory and active ESG working groups to  ensure continued progress against our sustainability  strategy and targets.  Management of ESG KPIs We recognise the key role that management plays  to ensure the success of ESG initiatives and that our  targets are met. As such, Optus as part of the Singtel  Group, has linked collective and common ESG targets  to KPIs and incentive plans of our top executives.   This helps us to advance the sustainability agenda   and foster greater accountability and ownership  across the company. •	 20% of our Top Executive’s long-term incentive  plan remuneration is tied to specific, time bound  KPIs, such as reaching 32% of female employees in  management by FY2025. •	 ESG targets for our Management Committee’s  short-term incentive plans represent 10% of their  annual balance scorecard performance. •	 The Management Committee’s KPIs are cascaded  down to their business units, departments and  employees, whose performance bonus and other  incentives are tied to their KPIs. These targets cover key sustainability themes,  however, the focus and weighting may vary for each  executive given their different levels of influence  and impact on these ESG KPIs. For example, energy  efficiency and decarbonisation targets carry more  weighting for management members with an energy  intensive function or a stronger role in influencing the  company’s decarbonisation strategy. For more information, please refer to the   Singtel Group Sustainability Report. Sustainability governance 15 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Overview  ===== PAGE 16 ===== Tax transparency  As a leading Australian technology and  telecommunications company, we recognise the vital  role that our tax contributions play in supporting public  finances and the social programs they fund. We are  committed to a high standard of tax governance and  compliance with applicable tax laws of the jurisdictions  where we operate. We acknowledge the need for sensible and  useful disclosure of tax information and that tax  transparency improves the community’s confidence  in the corporate sector. As a signatory to the Board  of Taxation’s voluntary tax transparency code, we  continue to publish Tax Transparency Reports and  have done so since FY18. You can find out more about  our approach to tax and our latest Tax Transparency  Report on our website. You can also view more  details about our Tax practices in the Singtel Group  Sustainability Report. Security, data privacy and whistleblowing Our Privacy Policy outlines our strict procedures  that govern the handling and protection of sensitive  customer information. We value the privacy of our  customers and their data, which is stored within our  networks and systems and we know that it is critical  that we make digital experiences safer. We have  safeguards and controls in place for the protection  of customer data including Call Stop, ScamWise and  Digital ID.  We continue to record customer privacy complaints  that are referred to us by our customers, staff, other  individuals or regulatory bodies. In FY24, we recorded  121 privacy related complaints. Of these, 17 cases  were referred by the Telecommunications Industry  Ombudsman (TIO). All complaints are thoroughly  investigated and where substantiated are remediated.  In all cases we engage directly with the customer to  understand and address substantiated complaints by  providing appropriate solutions for those individuals,  and where relevant provide information on how to  protect themselves online. We also take action to  understand and address underlying causes, including  reviewing policies and procedures, implementing  additional controls and through providing coaching  and training to our people to ensure processes are  understood and followed properly.  On one occasion we met the threshold to notify the  Office of the Australian Information Commissioner  (OAIC) in relation to a limited number of unauthorised  accesses to undertake fraudulent SIM card swaps. In  this case, Optus reversed the unauthorised SIM card  swaps, took steps to secure the affected accounts  and notified affected individuals and the OAIC. We  are reviewing further steps we can take to protect  customers from unauthorised SIM card swaps and  password resets.  In FY24, we received 70 whistleblower complaints, with  13 cases being substantiated, 38 not substantiated  and 19 carried forward at 31 March 2024. It is an  increase from the preceding years, with 41 and 62  complaints received in FY23 and FY22 respectively.   Of the 14 cases brought forward at the end of FY23,   11 were substantiated and three not substantiated.  16 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Overview  ===== PAGE 17 ===== Regulatory requirements   and self-reporting This year there were two instances where we  unfortunately did not meet the expectations of our  people and our customers.   In February 2024, Optus RetailCo Pty Ltd entered  into an Enforceable Undertaking (EU) with the Fair  Work Ombudsman (FWO) after it self-reported  to the FWO that a number of current and former  employees had received incorrect payments  and entitlements. The terms of the EU include a  contrition payment of $450,000 (paid in February  2024), an independent audit, additional compliance  training, and a commitment to improved payroll  systems and processes. Optus RetailCo Pty Ltd  has calculated the underpayments owed to current  and former employees and has made every effort  to ensure all entitlements have been or are in the  process of being corrected and paid with interest. In March 2024, the Australian Communications  and Media Authority (ACMA) announced that  it had found Optus Mobile Pty Ltd in breach of  its obligation to provide customer records to  the Integrated Public Number Database (IPND).  The enforcement action taken by ACMA against  Optus included an infringement notice penalty of  $1,501,500, a Direction to Comply with the IPND  rules, and a two-year Enforceable Undertaking which  includes obligations such as an external audit,   and six-monthly reporting to the ACMA. 17 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Overview  ===== PAGE 18 ===== Keeping Australians   connected  ===== PAGE 19 ===== As a leading telecommunications  company, Optus has a significant  responsibility to keep our customers  and the wider community connected.  We remain committed to enhancing the  customer connectivity experience while  also maintaining existing partnerships  and forging new ones to develop  future ways of connecting people and  communities. Learnings from the network outage  The network outage in November 2023 was  challenging for our customers and for our business.  We are very sorry that we fell short of delivering  the services the community and our customers  expect. We have taken decisive action since the  outage to ensure we provide seamless connectivity  for our customers. This includes conducting several  comprehensive technical reviews of systems and  processes alongside several global suppliers and  reconfiguring key equipment and protocols to prevent  a similar event happening again. Connecting  Australia  Highlights this year 5G National   Population Coverage 80.5% Over 4,200 5G sites 19 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Keeping Australians connected  ===== PAGE 20 ===== Expanding our coverage  with SpaceX’s Starlink Optus, in collaboration with SpaceX, which  designs, manufactures and launches some  of the world’s most advanced rockets and  spacecraft, announced an agreement in June  2023 to deliver mobile connectivity using  SpaceX’s Starlink satellite constellation.  Through this agreement, we will work to  expand the reach of customers’ mobile  connectivity to include the 60% of Australia’s  land mass* that currently has no mobile  coverage. This will be achieved through  a phased rollout of Starlink’s satellite  capability, starting with SMS in late 2024,  with voice and data to follow in late 2025.   The service will complement our existing  mobile networks, allowing customers to  connect to the SpaceX Low Earth Orbit  satellite-based network from their mobile  phone when outside the coverage area of   our terrestrial mobile network.  *Excludes Australian Radio Quiet Zone in Western Australia  where no service is permitted to be provided and Remote  Offshore Territories and Islands of Australia. Coverage  requires a clear line of sight to most of the sky. 20 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Keeping Australians connected  ===== PAGE 21 ===== Climate action Supporting and enabling the transition  towards a net-zero emissions world.  ===== PAGE 22 ===== Climate change is one of the most pressing global  issues of our time, with the effects of a warming  planet already being felt in many communities across  Australia. We know that we have an important role  to play in taking action towards achieving a net-zero  emissions world and building climate adaptation and  resilience in our network to combat the increasing  effects of climate change. To provide over 11 million telecommunications and  technology services across Australia every day, we  rely on a range of natural resources, including energy,  water, metals and minerals, and land. We understand  the impact this has on climate and nature, and we’re  continuing to take steps to reduce that impact and  helping our customers, communities and suppliers to  do the same.  This year, we continued working on energy efficiency  initiatives across our infrastructure, increased the  deployment of onsite and offsite renewable electricity  to power our operations and expanded the number  of hybrid vehicles in our fleet. We’ve also continued  to take additional steps to better manage the  environmental impact of our supply chain, and we’re  putting a greater emphasis on this going forward  following the development of our sustainable  procurement guidelines and roadmap.  We also know that our services will need to be  increasingly resilient to the effects of global warming.  Some parts of Australia are already experiencing an  increased frequency and severity of storms, floods,  cyclones, heatwaves, droughts or bushfires. So, we’ve  continued to focus on improving our adaptation and  resilience to a changing climate, including through  a focus on improving our emergency response  technology and collaborating with partners, such  as the CSIRO and Australian National University, on  strategies to mitigate the risk of bushfires.  Climate action  Highlights this year Updated our Singtel Group  commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse  gas emissions across our Singapore and Australian operations   by 2045 (brought forward from 2050) Achieved energy efficiency  improvements estimated at 16.1 Gigawatt hours  per annum Increased the use of renewable  electricity across our operations  from 25.37%   to 27.50%  of our total consumption when mandatory   large-scale generation certificates (LGCs)   are included (6.7% to 8.5% when mandatory   LGCs are excluded) Increased the number of   hybrid vehicles in our fleet to up from 94   last year 119   Contracted an initial  23% renewable  energy mix  above mandatory requirements   for years 2025–2029 22 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Climate action  ===== PAGE 23 =====   Progress against our 2025 targets Target	 Reduce by 25% absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) GHG emissions (tCO2e) FY25 Targets We will be resetting our environmental strategy targets to align  with the Singtel Group’s renewed SBTi-validated targets. For more  information, please refer to the Singtel Group Sustainability Report.  Progress In 2021, we set a goal to transition 100% of our electricity requirements  to be backed by renewable resources by the end of 2025. However, due  to volatility of the energy markets over the past few years, combined  with various market and operating challenges, this ambition has been  challenging to achieve. We have therefore removed this goal from our  sustainability strategy and will instead focus on reducing our Scope 1  and Scope 2 emissions by no less than an additional 55% between 2023  and 2030 in line with Group targets.  Progress Reduced Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 4.3% (location- based) and 9.7% (market-based). As part of our sustainability-linked loan, Optus has a target   to achieve a 25% reduction in its absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2  emissions (market-based) by FY25, from its FY15 baseline.

This standalone  report includes details on the Singtel Group’s climate  scenario analysis, adaptation and mitigation plans  for operations in Singapore and Australia. For more  information, please refer to the Singtel Group’s latest  TCFD report.  The Singtel Group’s commitment   to achieve net zero by 2045 This year, the Singtel Group, including Optus, renewed  its emissions reduction targets to align with the goals  of the Paris Climate Agreement, which aims to limit  global warming to 1.5°C. This raises the Singtel Group’s  level of ambition from its previous Science Based  Targets, which were aligned with a well below 2°C  pathway.  The Singtel Group has an updated commitment to  achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  by 2045. This requires a reduction of at least 90% in  absolute Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions from  an FY23 base year. Any hard to abate emissions may  be neutralised through the permanent removal and  storage of carbon from the atmosphere after the 90%  reduction target has been achieved. Achieving this ambitious goal will require deep and  meaningful emissions reductions across the value  chain. To enable this, Optus will continue collaborating  with our suppliers, customers and other value chain  partners on decarbonisation opportunities. Optus has  developed initiatives that drive energy efficiencies and  increase the use of renewable electricity. The Singtel Group which includes Optus, had its first emissions reduction targets  validated by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) in 2017. It included a commitment  to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 42% and Scope 3 emissions by 30% across  Singapore and Australian operations by FY30, from a FY15 base year. In December 2023, the Singtel Group’s renewed emissions reduction targets, which are  aligned with a 1.5°C pathway, were independently validated by the SBTi. Renewed emissions reduction targets The Singtel Group has also committed  to the following long-term targets:  Reduce absolute Scope 1,   Scope 2 and Scope 3 GHG emissions by  90%  by FY45 from an FY23 base year Reduce absolute Scope 3   GHG emissions from purchased goods   and services, capital goods, use of sold products,  downstream leased assets, and investments by   40%  by FY30 from an FY23 base year The Singtel Group, including Optus, has  committed to the following near-term targets: Reduce absolute Scope 1   and Scope 2 GHG emissions   by an additional  55%  by FY30 from an FY23 base year 24 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Climate action  ===== PAGE 25 ===== Scope 1 FY24 (tCO2e) FY23 (tCO2e) FY22 (tCO2e) Total Scope 1 emissions 1,741 1,591 1,579 Fugitive emissions (refrigerants)  258.1 48 195 Fuel combustion (stationary) 486.5 487 286 Fuel combustion (mobile) 996.7 1,056 1,098 Scope 2       Electricity (location-based) 350,491 366,357 425,015 Electricity (market-based) 308,331 341,792 392,674 Scope 3 Total Scope 3 emissions 808,328 1,635,165 4,209,290 Category 1: Purchased goods and services  224,905 788,700 2,397,584 Category 2: Capital goods  171,442 346,726 1,193,179 Category 3: Fuel and energy related services  38,337 40,605 43,007 Category 4: Upstream transportation and distribution 3,518 4,149 5,690 Category 5: Waste generated in operations  774 258 189 Category 6: Business travel  4,033 4,702 581 Category 7: Employee commute  774 5,103 3,011 Category 8: Upstream leased assets  N/A N/A N/A Category 9: Downstream transportation and distribution  N/A N/A N/A Category 10: Processing of sold products N/A N/A N/A Category 11: Use of sold products 361,515 442,040 562,523 Category 12: End-of-life treatment of sold products 593 697 1,027 Category 13: Downstream leased assets N/A N/A N/A Category 14: Franchises  2,478 2,185 2,499 Category 15: Investments N/A N/A N/A In FY23, only 85% of spend was included in Scope 3, categories 1 and 2. This has been restated in FY24 to include 100% of spend, using an assumed industry  specific emissions factor for the remaining 15% spend. Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions Optus’ main sources of Scope 1 (direct) emissions  include emissions from stationary diesel for back- up generators and transport fuel from our fleet,  with an additional contribution from refrigerant  gases. Scope 2 (indirect) emissions are those  associated with our electricity use and make up the  bulk of our combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Scope 3 emissions Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions (not  included in Scope 2) that occur in our value chain  and make up more than 70% of Optus’ overall  emissions profile. We recognise that there are  a range of challenges related to measuring and  reducing Scope 3 emissions, including our reliance  on suppliers for relevant information, gaps in data,  issues with data quality and our ability to influence  suppliers’ operational and commercial practices.  These are not challenges we can solve on our own,  and we continue to work with our suppliers and  partners to reduce our Scope 3 emissions. Optus has been disclosing our Scope 3 emissions  since FY22, and in FY24, we continue to make  improvements to our calculation methodologies  and data collection. We report against the majority  of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 3 categories  as set out in the table on the right. The reduction on our Scope 3, Categories 1  and 2 are mostly attributed to the improved  calculation methodology and emission factor  sources available. For more information about our  methodologies, please refer to our 2024 Data Pack  on our website. 25 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Climate action  ===== PAGE 26 ===== Reducing our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions In FY24, our Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based  emissions were 310,072 tCO2e, which accounted for  27.7% of our overall emissions footprint. We achieved   a reduction of 9.7% compared to last year.  This year, we continued our focus on reducing our  Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions through energy  efficiency measures, deploying onsite and offsite  renewable electricity, increasing our use of hybrid  vehicles, and exploring alternatives for our cooling and  emergency electricity generation needs. Driving energy efficiencies Decommissioning a range of legacy, redundant and  end-of-life network components, and implementation  of other energy efficiency technologies that we  estimate has enabled us to reduce our electricity  consumption by approximately 16.1 GWh (which is  equivalent to 10,476 tCO2e) annually. For example, we  deployed software across our 5G mobile network that  dynamically switches off broadcast elements when  there is no user demand for them. Decarbonising our operations 26 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Climate action  ===== PAGE 27 ===== Transitioning to renewable electricity In addition to our focus on improving energy efficiency,  we are committed to increasing our use of renewable  electricity to help us achieve our Scope 1 and Scope 2   emissions reduction targets. We acknowledge that  we are not on track to meet our previously stated  goal to source 100% renewable electricity for our  operations by the end of 2025. External factors such  as COVID-19 disruptions, fluctuations in global energy  prices and increased competition for access to clean  energy projects has led to significant price volatility  in Australia’s national energy market. And internal  factors, such as operational challenges, has meant  that we have been unable to deliver on our renewable  electricity goal in line with our original timeframe and  budget. Despite these challenges, we have continued to  take steps to increase our renewable electricity  consumption. This year, we proudly:  •	 Launched our National Solar Program to deploy  solar photovoltaic (PV) technology at five key  Optus exchanges and satellite sites, which will add  477-kilowatt (kW) peak capacity of onsite solar  in our operations. While this represents a small  amount of our electricity consumption, construction  is underway to further increase our onsite solar  capacity in the year ahead.  •	 Signed our first Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)  which will begin on 1 January 2025. When coupled  with the default renewable electricity available  from Australia’s national grid, we expect that  approximately 42% of our electricity consumption  will be backed by renewable sources.   Moving forward, our transition to renewable energy  will continue to remain part of our sustainability  strategy. Increasing our use of renewables is an  effective lever we can use to reduce our reliance on  fossil fuels and achieve our science-based Scope 1 and  Scope 2 emission reduction targets. Installing onsite  renewable capacity at key Optus sites will also be an  important way that we can improve the resilience of  our network operations if the national electricity grid is  disrupted by severe weather events.  We’ll continue to review and adjust our plans to  transition to renewable electricity on a regular basis,  and will share updates on our progress in our annual  sustainability reports. Other initiatives Added 25 hybrid vehicles to our Optus  fleet. We now have 119 hybrid vehicles   in our fleet, up from 94 hybrid vehicles in  FY23. Hybrid vehicles represent 76% of all  passenger vehicles in the Optus fleet.  We completed an engineering review  of our chillers fleet to understand the  options available to replace those  systems running on refrigerants with   high emission factors (e.g. R22, R134A). 27 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Climate action  ===== PAGE 28 ===== Sustainable financing linked to our   Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions Sustainability-linked financing is a type of loan where  the interest rate is tied to the achievement of certain  sustainability goals. This encourages companies to  invest in projects that promote sustainable growth  and development. In April 2023, Optus issued a A$100  million 5-year fixed-rate Sustainability-Linked Bond  (SLB). The SLB has been issued in accordance with the  Singtel Group Sustainability-Linked Bond framework  that was established on 14 October 2021. The interest  rate for this loan and bond issuance were linked to  Optus’ goal of achieving a 25% reduction in absolute  Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by FY25, from its FY15  baseline. We are on track to achieve this target.  Another instrument of the sustainable financing  program is the rollout in FY24 of our Internal Carbon  Pricing (ICP) program. This puts a price of carbon  (currently averaged at A$70/tCO2e) on emissions  intensive projects and technology so that the business  makes the right long-term decisions that help lower  both embedded and operational emissions. The ICP  is complemented by Singtel Group’s ‘Green Fund’  that further supports the decarbonisation of our  operations including the upgrade of technology across  our networks, the deployment of onsite solar PV  system in our exchanges and the decommissioning of  legacy infrastructure. Case study: Installing onsite rooftop   solar technology across our network  In FY24, with the financial support of over A$5  million from the Singtel Group's GreenFund, we  launched our national solar program to begin  installing onsite rooftop solar at key sites. Onsite  solar generation is a cost-effective, low-carbon  solution that supports our resilience to energy  market disruptions caused by factors such as  extreme weather events, power outages, energy  policy, and broader supply chain disruptions. We installed 477-kilowatt (kW) capacity of rooftop  solar at five key Optus exchanges and satellite sites  across Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and  Western Australia which are expected to generate  696,420 kilowatt hours (kWh) annually. While  this represents a small amount of our electricity  consumption in FY24, we will continue to roll-out  approximately 3,561-kilowatt (kW) capacity of solar  PV to 16 additional sites in FY25.  “Singtel’s GreenFund investment  has helped us take important steps  forward in creating additional solar  capacity in the market and improve  Optus’ energy independence as we  move towards a more sustainable  and reliable energy future.”  Martin Lamprecht   Vice President of Optus Network   Deployment and Infrastructure 28 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Climate action  ===== PAGE 29 ===== Case Study: Signing our first Power   Purchase Agreement (PPA) for offsite  renewable electricity In May 2023, we signed our first Renewable  Energy PPA with Snowy Hydro’s Red Energy,  which will supply Optus with a mix of solar, wind  and hydroelectricity from 1 January 2025. PPAs  are long-term agreements between renewable  electricity generators and businesses for  purchasing electricity. They are an important and  strategic focus for Optus as we increase the use of  renewable electricity for our network operations. PPAs can reduce our exposure to price volatility  in the electricity market, which is crucial during  supply chain, geographical or market disruptions.  PPAs also signal demand for renewables, which  can encourage the development of new renewable  projects. Optus is proud to be signalling this  commitment in the market as one of the largest  telecommunications companies in Australia. Optus’ PPA is expected to deliver 635GWh of  renewable electricity from 1 January 2025 to  31 December 2029, which will increase the share of  electricity from renewable sources to 42% in CY25  when mandatory LGCs are included (23% in CY25  when mandatory LGCs are excluded).   We will continue to explore additional PPAs in the  coming years, as well as consider other renewable  sourcing strategies, to support our ongoing  transition to renewable electricity. Snowy Hydro, Tumut NSW 29 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Climate action  ===== PAGE 30 ===== Reducing our Scope 3 emissions Scope 3 emissions are emissions that occur outside Optus’  direct operations – such as from our supply chain or from  customers using our products. As such, it represents  the majority of Optus’ emissions footprint. Optus is  committed to collaborating with key suppliers to reduce  the emissions in our supply chain, and we also encourage  our customers to do the same.  This year, we focused on improving our Scope 3   emissions by:  •	 Improving our data collection and calculation  methodologies for Category 1: Purchased goods and  services emissions. This involved product-specific  emission factors which provides a more accurate  estimate of actual emissions generated.  •	 Commencing the introduction of internal carbon pricing  in our Procurement processes by applying a shadow  average carbon price of A$70 in selected relevant  tenders. This supports the calculation of our Holistic  Cost of Ownership (HCO) alongside the Total Cost of  Ownership (TCO) to compare the submissions from the  vendors. For example, in a recent electronic equipment  tender we requested specific product carbon footprint  (PCF) information for the products offered by the  vendors to calculate the HCO of each of those products.  •	 Collaborating with our suppliers through the Carbon  Disclosure Project (CDP) Supply Chain Program. This  program has helped us to engage with some of our  most important suppliers to manage environmental  risks and impacts within Optus’ supply chain. Data  collected includes details of our suppliers’ emissions   and plans to reduce them as well as climate related   risks and opportunities. 30 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Climate action  ===== PAGE 31 ===== Optus Eco We continue to offer our consumer customers  Optus Eco, which enables them to reduce the  environmental impact of their mobile phone  service. Launched in March 2022, Optus Eco  allows customers, via the My Optus app to:  •	Choose to receive their bills and  invoices online to reduce paper waste  and carbon emissions.  •	Connect to a plastic-free digital eSIM  to reduce plastic usage and waste.  •	Offset some of their mobile phone’s  carbon emissions by supporting  Australian carbon reduction projects.  Together with our partner Green Collar, our  customers can support local offset projects  that have meaningful impact on the Australian  environment and adhere to the government’s  Australian Carbon Credit Unit (ACCU)  accreditation standards.  In FY24, over 13,900 customers joined Optus  Eco resulting in 997 tCO2e in emissions offset  through the surrender of ACCUs. Since the  program was launched, over 21,000 customers  have taken part in the program, with over 1,520  tCO2e in emissions offset. Optus Eco features on the My Optus app 31 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Climate action  ===== PAGE 32 ===== We are dedicated to ensuring that our network  remains robust, reliable and resilient. Earlier climate  change risk assessments undertaken in 2015, 2020  and 2021 have informed our network adaptation and  resilience initiatives to ensure we continue supporting  our communities and emergency service providers  to stay connected during times of crisis. For more  information, please refer to the Singtel Group’s  latest TCFD report. This year, we improved our disaster response   planning by:  •	 Continuing our collaboration with the CSIRO,  Australia’s national science agency, to mitigate  bushfire risks to telecommunications infrastructure  by applying CSIRO research on local bushfire  weather, fuel load, vegetation and topography to  identify telecommunications base stations that  are at greatest risk to the impacts of embers,  radiation and flames. This has been further  advanced with the Australian Government funded  CSIRO Telecommunications resilience investment  pilot that aims to develop enhanced approaches to  reduce the risk and build resilience to bushfires and  floods in the telecommunications sector. Optus will  be a key participant contributing to the CSIRO’s  research. •	 Continuing our collaboration with the Australian  National University to develop the Bushfire  Research Centre of Excellence, which shares  insights related to the early evolution of bushfire  ignitions, evaluates fire direction techniques  to inform early detection, and demonstrates  technology that can control and suppress bushfire  ignitions in deep bushland, and more. •	 Collaborating with the Department of Fire &  Emergency Services in Western Australia to  support the state’s response to extensive power  outages following two severe thunderstorms  in January 2024, which directly affected more  than 50 Optus mobile sites between Perth and  Kalgoorlie. The Optus incident management  team deployed a SATCAT unit to Narrogin, which  was one of four key sites impacted, as well as  portable generators and Optus field operations  professions to support communities and keep  them connected. The SATCAT was deployed for  three days serving the community.  Improving our climate   resilience and adaptation Natural disasters and   extreme weather Telecommunications and technology  services are vital to keep our communities  safe, informed and connected, especially  during times of emergency or disaster.  We understand that our role as one of the  largest telecommunications providers in  Australia means that Australians rely on  our services to keep businesses running and  people connected in their time of need.  Over the last year, Australia has experienced  natural disasters and extreme weather  events which have caused damage and  disruption to Australians and tested our  individual and collective resilience.  We have invested approximately   A$8.8 million this year into a range   of government-funded adaptation   initiatives in our network. 32 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Climate action  ===== PAGE 33 ===== Being prepared for natural disasters enables  Optus to minimise the connectivity disruptions  for customers and communities and enable an  efficient and effective response to restore services  when and where it is needed. On 13 December  2023, Tropical Cyclone Jasper passed through Far  North Queensland, leaving communities in areas  such as Mossman, Cairns and Tully without power  and facing flooding due to widespread heavy rain.  Preparations by Optus Field Operations in  the days prior had seen the shift of portable  generators from Brisbane to Townsville for  staging. This included four trailer generators  capable of supporting larger sites for extended  periods. Exercises to monitor fuel levels in fixed  generators already onsite at key locations  identified opportunities to pre-plan fuel drops and  ensure tanks were at capacity and facilitated long  run times on sites where critical infrastructure and  transmission are located. More than 12 portable  generators were utilised interchangeably based on  priorities and progress with utility power status.  The Far North Queensland SATCAT (trailer-based  mobile base station using satellite transmission  backhaul) was also staged in Cairns with an  upgraded radio ready to deploy in any suitable  circumstances if identified. Unfortunately access  to the worst hit regions like Mossman was cut off  to all vehicles which did not allow deployment of  the SATCAT in this instance. By the time access  was available, a portable trailer generator was  used to restore the Mossman area which also  supported the Daintree region. Following the cyclone, and in line with our disaster  response framework, Optus engaged with relevant  Queensland disaster coordination groups to  identify any site access issues for the worst hit  regions and communities, and to understand  timelines for the expected restoration of mains  power. We deployed trucks and other vehicles to  provide customers and communities with access  to devices, WiFi and Prepaid SIM cards and, for  eligible Postpaid mobile customers facing hardship,  an added 100GB of bonus data. Case Study: Keeping people connected through Cyclone Jasper “I am proud of our ongoing  commitment to supporting the  communities affected by Tropical  Cyclone Jasper. In times of crisis, our  focus remains on connecting people,  providing vital communication  channels, and helping to ensure that  communities can stay connected,  resilient and face the challenges  ahead with optimism.” David Morrissey  Optus General Manager  for North Queensland 33 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Climate action  ===== PAGE 34 ===== Circular economy From supply chain and product packaging  to general day-to-day waste from our  operations, there are many opportunities   to turn what may have once been rubbish,  into resource.  ===== PAGE 35 ===== We know that the traditional linear  ‘take-make-dispose’ economic model  is unsustainable over the longer term  as it relies on the consumption of finite  resources. We can have a positive impact  by shifting to a circular economy model  that is restorative and regenerative  by design, designing-out waste and  pollution, keeping products and materials  in use for longer, and contributing to the  regeneration of nature. The technology and telecommunications products and  services we provide our customers rely on a range of  natural resources including metals, minerals, water,  energy and land. From the raw materials used in  equipment manufacturing, to the way we package and  distribute products, and what we do when our products  are no longer needed – we understand that our value  chain impacts on climate and nature.  This year, we continued to focus on working with trusted  and ethical suppliers to identify opportunities to design- out single-use materials and packaging in our Optus- branded products. We continued our efforts to reduce  our waste sent to landfill by using smart bins, introducing  new waste solutions, educating our people to inspire  behavioural change, and improving recycling of our  e-waste and network infrastructure. We also continued  providing options to support our customers to reuse and  recycle their devices in our stores. Circular economy  Highlights this year Recycled or reused  97.8% of e-waste  from our operations including   network* sites, corporate offices   and retail stores. *Based on network waste data available in FY24. 85% of packaging from approximately 300   Optus-branded products. is recyclable, reusable   or compostable Developed  sustainable  procurement  guidelines  and supported our Optus- branded suppliers to enhance  their circularity principles.

We  take a holistic approach to our product stewardship  responsibilities, which considers our upstream and  downstream impacts across our value chain:   •	 Upstream – how we select and collaborate with  ethically, environmentally and socially responsible  suppliers, and how we bring to life our focus on the  effective use of resources.  •	 Operations – reducing the impacts of our products,  their associated packaging, and of our corporate,  retail and network operations.  •	 Downstream – seeking opportunities to reuse or  recycle our products to extend their useful life and  protect the value of natural resources.     Our commitment to product stewardship To support our commitment to product  stewardship, we have set three targets   to achieve by 2025. Our focus on environmentally   sustainable supply chains This year, our Sustainability team collaborated with  different teams across the organisation to enhance  our environmental supply chain practices. We achieved  this by looking at the supplier’s full life cycle including:  •	 Improving and simplifying our supplier questionnaire  to collect information from new vendors  participating in tenders so we can assess their  current and future environmental performance.  Building the knowledge and capabilities of our  teams through information sharing sessions about  packaging and alignment to the Australian 2025  Packaging Targets.  •	 Developing Circular Economy roadmaps for the  Retail, Networks and Corporate sites, which will  identify actions to be taken to enhance our resource  management performance.  •	 Ensuring contracts with new suppliers consider  the ‘end-of-life’ stage for the networks’ equipment  we buy so we can think ahead about how to  manage them when they are due for an upgrade/ replacement.  Our combined efforts show our commitment to  improving our environmental supply chain practices  and contributing to a circular economy in partnership  with our valued suppliers.  We have developed circular economy roadmaps for our  products (including for SIMs, modems, and mobiles),  our retail and marketing activities, and our networks  and corporate facilities, with specific actions to help  us achieve our three targets. Our roadmaps take a life  cycle view of the environmental impact of our products  before they reach our stores, during their usage, and  after their useful life. In FY24, we continued to make  progress towards the achievement of these targets,  but we still have more to do. 90% of our e-waste   reused and recycled 100% recyclable, reusable  or compostable packaging 90% waste diversion   from landfill 37 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Circular economy  ===== PAGE 38 ===== Reuse and Recycling e-waste Repurposing and recycling devices Repurposing previously loved devices is one of the best  ways that we can reduce landfill. Throughout FY24 we  continued to support the industry wide MobileMuster  initiative to encourage our customers to recycle their  devices including mobile phones, modems, smart  watches, smart home devices and gaming consoles.  Customers can recycle their old devices in-store, or via  reply-paid recycling satchels in Optus’ Prepaid mobile  bundles. Up to 99.3% of the materials in these devices  are recovered through our partners in our supply chain. In FY24, we received approximately 37,830 devices for  recycling, which accounted for approximately 19.5*  tonnes of mineral resources conserved. Recycling the materials from   our network sites In FY24, we continued to achieve our target of  recycling 95% of our network waste. We work closely  with our industry partners and customers to recover  technology and other e-waste for reuse and recycling.  As we upgrade our network, we identify recycled and  reuse opportunities for legacy technology, and work  with suppliers to extend the life of network technology.  In FY24, we diverted 509 tonnes of network equipment  from landfill.   *Approximate savings figure obtained from the MobileMuster  calculator using mobile devices as a proxy – noting that the  device number also includes modems, landlines and tablets  which may have used more or less mineral resources. Ensuring our packaging is recoverable We report annually to the Australian Packaging  Covenant Organisation (APCO), which includes  disclosures against the criteria of the Packaging  Sustainability Framework, such as design and  procurement, recycled content, recoverability,   disposal labelling and waste.  We also support the implementation of the  Australasian Recycling Label (ARL) in our products,  which requires clear labelling on how customers can  recycle our products, to continue improving kerbside  recovery in Australia. During FY24, we continued implementing the actions  identified in our Circular Economy Roadmap for  Packaging developed in FY22. For example, we  progressed:  •	 Our new generation of 5G modems are made  primarily from 95% recycled plastic, its packaging  has no single-use plastic and it is fully recyclable in  kerbside recycling across Australia.  •	 Reducing the number of plastic pillows used in  packaging our shipments to customers by replacing  them with paper-based alternatives. Our Circular Economy Roadmaps, which we continued  to implement in FY24, highlights opportunities to  reduce waste and provides actions across our supply  chain to minimise the amount of single-use packaging  and non-recyclable packaging used in Optus products. 38 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Circular economy  ===== PAGE 39 ===== In February 2024, we celebrated the  launch of our new Ultra WiFi 5G Modem.  This is our second modem made from at  least 95% recycled plastic (excluding the  electronic components in the modem  and the screen). The modem’s packaging  has no single-use plastic and is 100%  recyclable in general kerbside recycling  across Australia.   We worked closely with our suppliers  to find solutions to reduce the  environmental impact of our new  5G modems. This engagement with  our suppliers has strengthened our  relationships and we are optimistic about  identifying further opportunities for  collaboration and shared impact.  The new 5G modems also have ‘quick  start’ guides that encourage customers  to bring their old modems into any of our  Optus stores for recycling. Reducing waste generated   by our operations We have six waste streams across our corporate  offices: comingled recycling, organics, paper and  cardboard, e-waste, specialty waste and general  waste.  We continue to use outdoor smart bins at our  Optus Campus Sydney, which eliminate recycling  contamination, and improved how we manage  organic food waste at our Sydney campus (refer to  page 54 for Charopy smart bin case study for more  information). We transitioned away from using food  digesters which sends food waste through sewerage  networks, and instead have engaged a vendor that  uses anaerobic digestion technology which converts  food waste into a combustible gas, which can be  used as a fuel source to produce green electricity.  In FY24, we also had a strong focus on employee  awareness and engagement campaigns to improve  behaviours around waste and recycling. This included  a major national digital campaign, which included our  Optus Ambassador, Ian Thorpe, to create awareness  and improve our recycling behaviours.  Case Study: Our new 5G modem made from 95% recycled plastic “We listen to our customers and know  that many of them are increasingly  looking for more sustainable products.  That’s why we are so proud to  demonstrate our commitment to   using recycled materials through   our new Ultra WiFi 5G modem,”  Jack Shamoon   Associate Director, Partner   and Commercial Devices 39 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Circular economy  ===== PAGE 40 ===== Digital enablement Empowering vulnerable and disadvantaged  Australians to achieve, thrive and belong   in the digital world.  ===== PAGE 41 ===== As technology and digital innovation  transforms the world around us,  concerns around online safety and  security continues to rise. Issues  such as cybersecurity and scamming  threats, cyberbullying, and image-based  abuse continue to grow and deepen,  particularly through the impact of  artificial intelligence (AI) and generative  AI. Despite these issues, we know that  technology can play a significant role  in bridging the digital divide and enable  connectivity.  Our digital enablement strategy is two-pronged. We  are committed to helping equip Australians to be safe  and resilient online citizens, as well as helping bridge  the digital divide so that everyone can achieve, thrive  and belong in today’s digital world. Digital inclusion  is about affordability, access and the ability to use  technology, and while there have been improvements  in Australia’s digital inclusion, some groups of people  remain excluded. These include the one in eight adults,  and one in six Australian children living in poverty.  During FY24 through our flagship programs, Digital  Thumbprint and Donate Your Data™ and long-term  partnerships with not-for-profit organisations and  government, we continued to foster an inclusive  society where no-one is left behind when it comes to  connectivity and encourage positive and respectful  relationships online.

The program has been  endorsed by the eSafety Commissioner as a Trusted  eSafety Provider since 2016. Launched in 2013, it is one of the longest running  digital safety and wellbeing education program  in Australia. It recently celebrated its 10th year by  winning the “Contribution to Society” Award at the  annual Australian Communications Industry Awards  (ACOMMS) in July 2023, the communications industry’s  premier awards for excellence. Supporting digital safety and wellbeing “Our social impact focus has always  been driven with the aim of helping  young people to achieve, thrive  and belong in the digital world and  our Digital Thumbprint Program is  about creating both a positive and  lasting impact on the digital safety  and wellbeing of young people and  families all over Australia. This  award is yet another testimony of  the program’s success, and I’m so  proud of Optus and its partners  in delivering this free program to  schools across Australia.”  Helen Maisano,   Senior Director, Group Sustainability, Optus 44 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Digital enablement  ===== PAGE 45 ===== Digital Thumbprint resources   and guides for families  Optus’ Digital Thumbprint program extends  beyond the school gate by providing  families with free interactive and engaging  resources to support and encourage  important conversations about responsible  technology use.  In FY24, we introduced a range of new  interactive online materials to support  parents, young people and children as they  connect online. New materials include: •	 First Phone quiz and guide to help parents  start conversations about key milestones  like a child’s first phone. Our interactive  quiz evaluates the child’s digital safety  and wellbeing awareness, providing  parents with a personalised readiness  score for their child. •	 Cyberbullying quiz and guide to empower  children to be an upstander (someone  who chooses to support a person who is  being abused or harmed) when it comes  to cyberbullying and learn what to do  about it when they see this occur. •	 Hackers, scammers and fake friends   quiz and guide to teach children that not  everybody is who they claim to be online  and to help them stay safe online. A full list of program resources can be found  on our website digitalthumbprint.com.au Digital Thumbprint   workshops for schools Through facilitator-led and teacher-led digital  interactive workshops, the Digital Thumbprint  program teaches primary and high school students  core principles around online safety and wellbeing, and  encourages positive online behaviour around privacy,  security and responsible technology use.  In FY24, 60,592 students took part in a free Digital  Thumbprint workshop. This takes our total student  participation to 620,468 exceeding our target of  reaching 550,000 students by FY25. Educating young  people and their families about digital safety is one  of our key areas of focus and we’re proud that these  results reinforce this commitment. With hackers and scammers increasingly targeting  children via game chat and social media, we launched a  new workshop – Protecting Your Personal Information  – to help students understand what personal  information is, and the actions to take to protect  themselves from identity theft and scams. Since  launching, 10,351 students have completed the new  workshops. 45 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Digital enablement Thumbprint Optus Digital Supporting digital safety and wellbeing   ===== PAGE 46 ===== Measuring the Digital Thumbprint   program’s impact In FY24, we engaged an independent expert  to evaluate the Digital Thumbprint program’s  impact on student attitudes and behavioural  change on digital safety and wellbeing. Over  2,300 students participated in the research,  and we are proud that the results show that  the program is having a positive impact on  changing student behaviours:  Digital Thumbprint program’s impact on students: 92% of primary students who completed the  Cyberbullying and Respectful Relationships  Online and Protecting Your Personal  Information Online workshops have more ideas  about where to go for help to stay safe online. After completing the facilitator-led  Cyberbullying and Respectful Relationships  Online workshop, 94% of secondary students  said they will try to use social media in a more  positive way. Eight out of 10 secondary students surveyed  have more ideas about where to go for help  to stay safe online after completing Digital  Thumbprint workshops online. “Before the Digital Thumbprint  workshop I didn’t care as  much about others online.   I was just on there to use it  and have entertainment.   After the workshop, I got  more perspective of the  viewer and creator of a post  and who that other person is.” Year 8 student, Victoria. 46 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Digital enablement  ===== PAGE 47 ===== Case study: Digital safety and  Satellites careers team In FY24, we’ve partnered with the Optus  Satellites team to provide early secondary  students with learning on digital safety and   a career in space technology.  Students participated in our new Protecting Your  Personal Information workshop to learn about  digital safety and heard from the Satellites team  on the role of satellites in telecommunications  services, and career pathways in satellites.  Over 300 students joined in person at our  campus in Sydney with Supercars Driver and  Optus Ambassador, Chaz Mostert – another  1,062 students attended virtually. Watch a recap of the event here. 47 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Digital enablement  ===== PAGE 48 ===== We believe everyone deserves the chance to reach  their potential and be supported in times of crisis  and disasters. Our aim is to help bridge the digital  divide by enabling free connectivity to up to 100,000  disadvantaged youth and families by 2025. We  launched our Donate Your Data™ program in 2019 to  support Australians who don’t have or cannot afford  regular access to the internet.  In collaboration with our long-term charity partners  like The Smith Family, Good360 Australia, and KARI  Foundation, we provide free calls, text and data  to young people, families and other Australians,  facilitating their access to essential services,  education, job opportunities and social connection. We  also provide free connectivity during times of natural  disaster. It is a powerful way that Optus, together with  our customers, can support the community in ensuring  no one is left behind when it comes to digital inclusion. In FY24, Optus’ Donate Your Data program provided  over 15 million GBs of data, connecting an additional  6,335 individuals and families, donated by 204,335  unique customers. To date, over 60 million GBs of  data has been donated by 744,935 unique customers  through the Donate Your Data program since its  launch in 2019. Working with our charity partners, Optus has reached  over 45,000 Australians including young people and  their families through The Smith Family, First Nations  people across the Eastern seaboard through KARI  Foundation, and working with Good360 Australia  reached those experiencing homelessness, escaping  family and domestic violence, furthering education and  training, and a host of other needs. Bridging the digital divide Increasing digital inclusion for First Nations  people is part of Target 1, Access to  Information, under the National Agreement  on Closing the Gap. The First Nations Digital  Inclusion Plan (2023-2026), released in 2023  was informed by a range of stakeholders  including the First Nations Digital Advisory  Group. Their Initial Report to government  highlights the need for placed-based  approaches to providing digital inclusion  access to First Nations people. Through  our partnership with the KARI Foundation,  we have been providing Donate Your Data  access since 2019 and launched our placed- based program support with the KARI  Foundation in 2023. This program sees Optus  volunteers working with the KARI Foundation  at community events across New South  Wales and Queensland to help participants  activate their Donate Your Data SIMs and get  connected.  In FY24, 5,704 First Nations people have been  supported by the Donate Your Data program. Case Study: Place-based support to connect First Nations people 48 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Digital enablement  ===== PAGE 49 ===== Donate Your Data™ Through the Donate Your Data program, we also  provide participants with digital literacy knowledge  through Digital Thumbprint workshops, upskilling  on topics such as online scams, digital defence, safe  internet usage, and other foundational cybersecurity  content to support their connectivity experience.  Participants also gain access to personalised  support from our newly established Australian- based Specialist Care Team. Please refer to page  71 for more information on how our new Specialist  Care Team is supporting our vulnerable customers. We are incredibly proud of our Donate Your Data  program, including the feedback it received in FY24  from participants like Yasin. “The internet is a very big part of all the  work we do at school. The world is moving  forward and it's all through the internet,  all through technology – and it's just  going to keep getting more important.  It would be impossible to finish school  without the internet today. “When I didn’t have a device or the  internet, I definitely felt like I wasn’t  getting the education the other kids were  getting. I did worry about my future. “But then Optus supplied the free online  data, that really helped. And when   I didn’t have a reliable device to use,   The Smith Family supplied me with one.   I’m still using that laptop today.   “Donate Your Data has allowed me to be  able to make calls and texts and also do  schoolwork on the internet for free. It's also  helped the rest of my family because they  have access to it, too. “Because of Optus Donate Your Data,   I can easily research and do all my online  work that I have from school. If I need to  do something online, I can always do it –  whether I’m at a restaurant or on a trip   at school or something like that. “Thank you Optus and your customers for  helping me and my family, it’s really made   a big difference in our lives.” Yasin   Donate Your Data participant   supported by The Smith Family 95%  of parents of participants  reported satisfaction with   the free SIM and data plan.  93%  of parents of participants  reported that the SIM  assisted their child with online  learning and education.  82%  of parents of participants  reported that the SIM aided  their child in participating in  The Smith Family’s programs.  96% of parents of participants  would recommend the  Donate Your Data program  to other families.  *Impact data from The Smith Family’s  2023 Evaluation Report Key findings: Impact data   from the Smith Family Optus Donate Your Data continues to be  highly successful in achieving its intended  goals of enabling access to technology and  data, demonstrating sustained outcomes  for participants over multiple years: 49 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Digital enablement  ===== PAGE 50 ===== Sustainable innovation Supporting innovators in addressing the most pressing social and environmental challenges through the power of technology.  ===== PAGE 51 ===== Sustainable innovation We are dedicated to developing new technologies and supporting impact start-ups that harness  technology and innovation to find sustainable solutions in today’s digital era.

In FY24, we continued to  work with our 2022 Future Makers, exploring potential pilot opportunities and  speaking together at sustainability events. During the year, we continued to work  closely with Charopy Pty Ltd, an Optus 2022 Future Maker, to roll out their solar  powered smart bins at our Sydney campus. Read more in the case study below. Singtel Group Future Makers In November 2023, Optus participated in the Singtel Group Future Makers  program. This program aims to foster collaboration across the Singtel Group  of companies across the Asia Pacific region. These companies include Singtel,  Optus, Globe Telecom, Airtel, AIS and Telkomsel. In FY24, the program was  held in Singapore and Future Makers alumni from the Singtel Group attended  a week-long program and explored the use of 5G, artificial intelligence (AI)  and Internet-of-Things (IoT). Two of our Optus Future Makers alumni, Virtual  Psychologist and Charopy attended the event. The program concluded with a  Demo Day showcase and pitching of solutions to our panel of judges from the  Singtel Group of companies including Singtel, Optus, Globe and Telkomsel, with  corporate partners, investors and government agencies in attendance. The top  award of SGD$40,000 (A$45,280) was awarded to our 2017 Optus Future  Maker, Virtual Psychologist, a text-based counselling service integrated with  wearable technology, to help with expanding its solution to new markets in Asia.  VP currently provides virtual counselling to Globe Telecom staff in the Philippines  through Hope Chat. They were recently awarded an inaugural contract by the  Queensland Government to provide mental health support across the state. In addition to the grants, all start-ups received support from Singtel Group and  our associates in the form of mentorship and access to a combined customer  base of over 770 million mobile users to scale their solutions or pilot new  initiatives regionally. Our 2022 Future Maker, Charopy, which offers a smart  recycling bin solution, was granted SGD$10,000 (A$11,320) to explore piloting  their solutions for deployment at Singtel and was awarded an additional  SDG$10,000 to work with AIS start-up, GEPP, on a smart bin pilot in Thailand. 53 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Sustainable innovation  ===== PAGE 54 ===== We believe in the importance of empowering  social innovators. Through the Future Makers  program, we provide socially and environmentally  focused start-ups with mentoring, upskilling and  grant funding to help them grow and scale their  technological solutions.  In September 2023, Optus supported a 2022  Future Makers program finalist – Charopy Pty  Ltd – by piloting its solar powered smart bins on  our Sydney campus. These innovative bins, which  are equipped with in-built scanning technology,  reduce recycling contamination by determining  the suitability of items for recycling prior to their  disposal. If the item is recyclable, the lights on the  bin turn green and a recycling chute opens, which  allows the item to be disposed and recycled. If  the item is not recyclable, the lights on the bin  turn red and the chute remains closed to avoid  recycling contamination.   Since the pilot’s inception, the smart bins at our  Sydney campus have diverted 260kg of waste  from landfill. For every item recycled through  Charopy bins, Optus’ charity partner the KARI  Foundation, which champions Aboriginal culture  and achievement, receives a donation through the  NSW Government’s container deposit scheme.   For more information on the FY24 Singtel Group  Future Makers Program, read the Singtel Group  Sustainability Report.  Case Study:  Charopy smart bins on campus  “Receiving a grant from the  Future Makers Program, plus  an order for this product from  Optus, enabled us to ‘lift’ our  level of product development  and come up with a totally  new recycling bin product  for use in high profile, high  visibility public areas.   Without Optus, it is unlikely  this product would have ever   come to life.”   Martin Collings   Founder & CEO of Charopy 54 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Sustainable innovation  ===== PAGE 55 ===== Toowoomba Internet of Things (IoT)   smart water meter solution With water being one of Australia’s most precious –  and increasingly costly – resources, finding a way to  save water and detect leaks early is a shared priority  for residents and local councils.  In a major upgrade to Toowoomba Regional Council’s  water infrastructure, a smart new metering solution  from an Optus-led consortium provides a way to do  both. This Toowoomba project is the first telco-led  consortium to be awarded a contract for such an  Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) solution. To deliver this critical project, Optus partnered with  IOTA, ETS Electrical Services, GreenBe and Security  Communication Solutions Intl P/L Trading as M2M  Telecoms (M2M Telecom) on the staged deployment  of 68,000 new smart water meters for Council.  The rollout began in mid-2022 and will take four years  to complete. The deployment leverages Optus’  NB-IoT network, IOTA’s blockchain-powered IoT  devices, GreenBe’s user experience platform,  installation services from ETS Deployment Services  and more. The initial stage of the meter deployment involved  residential, industrial, and commercial volunteers from  the local community, allowing for testing and fine- tuning of the system before mass deployment.  Once completed, Council will be able to operate  the water network more efficiently and residents  will be able to monitor their own water usage more  effectively. Residents of the Toowoomba region will  be able to use a web portal or app to see their water  usage in near real-time, plus receive early notification  of any leaks – a key benefit for any home or business  owner whose first warning of a hidden leak has been  an unexpectedly large water bill. These meters will  help support their future water efficiency efforts as  they can also see from the time-based water usage  report which activities are using lots of water – from  long showers to watering the garden or even using  an inefficient washing machine. Smart Water   Meter features: •	 Residents can monitor water   usage more effectively •	 View water usage in near real time   on web portal or app  •	 Receive early notification   of any leaks   •	 Time-based water usage report –  from long showers to watering the  garden or even using an inefficient  washing machine *Internet of Things (IoT) describes physical objects embedded with sensors and actuators that communicate with computing systems via wired or  wireless networks – allowing the physical world to be digitally monitored or even controlled.

We have three  Optus capability and development focus areas –  Technology, Business, and Personal Excellence – to help  our people bring their learning and skills development  opportunities into one place. Our commitment  to growing our capability is supported by our key  performance indicator for all our people to complete   12 hours of learning across the year. In 2021, we introduced Optus U to provide our amazing  people with the opportunity to grow and strengthen  their capabilities in digital and future focused skills.  Optus U is part of our strategic capability offerings  and is one of the ways we deliver engaging learning  experiences for our people to invest in their future and  grow their skills.  In FY24, 525 Optus U accreditations were attained by  our people, bringing the total number of accreditations  to 1,500 since the program’s inception. Accreditations  have been attained by our amazing people in fields  such as Customer Experience, Data and Analytics,  Intelligent Automation, Cyber Security, Finance,  Product Management, Micro MBA subjects, Manawari  Aboriginal Cultural Safety, Sustainability and  Innovation.  Every year we hold an annual Learning Fiesta to  encourage our people to challenge themselves to  invest in their own growth and career mobility. The  theme for this year was ‘own your growth’. We had a  huge line up of over 100 in-person and virtual learning  opportunities, covering topics across our three  capability focus areas.  We also launched a new initiative called Job  Architecture – a simple and transparent framework  for classifying roles and skills at Optus. Through this  program we launched a jobs and skills portal, to help  our people chart their own course and have greater  visibility of potential career pathways. We want our  amazing people to feel empowered and proficient  in their current job and feel excited to challenge  themselves and grow personally and professionally. We recognise that the needs of our business will  continue to evolve and change and during FY24 we  continued to optimise our operating model, accounting  for the reshaping of our workforce. This resulted  in a decrease in our workforce between FY23 and  FY24. During this time, we supported our people with  career transition information, which was tailored  to meet individual needs, provided access to the  Optus Employee Assistance Program and offered  retrenchment packages in circumstances where they  were unable to be redeployed.  Since launching in 2020, the Talent Ambassador  Program has continued to grow and evolve. In FY24 we  now have over 200 active Optus ambassadors. Our  mission is to develop our amazing people’s personal  brand and equip them with the skills to play a pivotal  role in attracting and retaining employees at Optus  through the hashtag #OptusLife on LinkedIn. In FY24  the program generated over two million organic views  from #OptusLife ambassador posts – the highest  engagement with the hashtag in the history of the  program. We have seen over 50,000 post reactions  and an increase of 12,000 followers of the Optus  LinkedIn page.

Day speaker event with almost 900 participants.  Throughout the week there were blood glucose tests,  optical, in-body and bone density scans completed,  with bowel cancer kits provided. The week culminated  in the launch of the Optus Wellbeing Community,  dedicated to continuing to elevate the tools and  benefits available to employees and their families  and challenge us all to invest more in our mental,  physical, financial and social wellbeing. In FY24 we  also refreshed our mental health eLearn to provide  our employees and leaders information, resources and  support in creating a mentally healthy workplace. During FY24 we continued to make progress in  managing our workplace injuries. We successfully  completed audits for our Rehabilitation Management  System and Case Management System with no non- compliance. We are proud to uphold our AS45001  certification, the Australian Safety Management  Standard. These standards are highly regarded  worldwide and locally for occupational safety and  health systems. Our return-to-work rate remains at  100%, and we offer voluntary rehabilitation support  to our people. Our workplace injury frequency rate was  2.2 (up from 1.5 in FY23). Our workplace fatality rate  remained at 0 in FY24, and the absenteeism rate is  0.02, which is consistent with prior years.  60 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Future of work  ===== PAGE 61 ===== Community impact $241,000  Workplace giving and   fundraising donations 284 charities that received  donations through Optus  workplace giving portal,  yes4good *Includes a combination of cash, time volunteered, in-kind donations and associated management costs   (all verified by B4SI), employee fundraising and revenue forgone on fees, products and services. 576 students  participated in ABCN  mentoring programs $31.3m  Total community  contributions* in FY24 20,752 volunteer hours  contributed Highlights this year Commitment to Service  award and Commitment to  Reconciliation award 2 KARI   Foundation  awards Awarded 5th place   in GoodCompany’s  Best Workplaces   to Give Back  award in October 2023 61 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Future of work  ===== PAGE 62 ===== KARI Foundation The Optus and KARI Foundation partnership was  established in 2018, and together we launched  scholarships for Year 10 students to provide mentoring,  financial support and workshops to help upskill young  First Nations people in digital literacy, employability  and goal setting. Since then, over 100 First Nations  youth in NSW have been supported through this  scholarship program. The partnership aligns with our  mutual community investment in First Nations youth  and focuses on increasing their future employability  skills through programs like Pathways 2 Employment,  upskilling digital literacy through a tailored Digital  Thumbprint workshop and increasing their confidence  and communication skills through various mentoring  opportunities. This year we also hosted Pathway 2 Employment  sessions with KARI Foundation to build employability  skills. Our Pathways 2 Employment program provides  disadvantaged and vulnerable students with retail and  employability skills and the confidence to find a job,  either at Optus or in the broader retail sector. We’re  pleased to report that 65% of participants now have  casual employment.  This year we were proudly recognised for our ongoing  support to the KARI Foundation at their annual  Corporate Partner Thank You event. The two awards we  received were: •	 The Commitment to Reconciliation award recognising  our work on our Reflect Reconciliation Action Plan; and  •	 The Commitment to Service award recognising the  variety of ways in which we have provided ongoing  support to the KARI Foundation in the last five years. Read more about our work with the KARI Foundation in  the case study below.  62 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Future of work  ===== PAGE 63 ===== In support of our focus on reconciliation, Optus  has had an ongoing collaboration with the KARI  Foundation since 2018. The KARI Foundation is a  not-for-profit organisation that designs and delivers  a range of programs that celebrate Aboriginal culture  and achievement.   Together, we have delivered cultural awareness  training, distributed over 2,000 free Donate Your  Data SIM cards to First Nations people, and provided  funding for a range of other sustainability initiatives,  such as in-kind donations and donations collected  from our recycling container deposit scheme at our  Sydney campus. Now in its fifth year, our partnership  continues to support the KARI Scholarship program  aimed at providing financial support, career and  employability coaching for Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander youth who are in their final years of secondary  school and living in low socio-economic areas.   In FY24, we offered fully funded scholarships to  23 students in Year 10 across three high schools in  New South Wales. The program involved a series  of workshops which focused on building digital  literacy and supporting students to prepare for  future employment. We invited special guests to  the workshops, including Optus’ Chief Inspiration  Officer, Ash Barty, to share her insights on her career,  achievements and role as an indigenous leader in  the community. Optus Ambassador and captain of  the Matildas, Steph Catley, also ran a soccer clinic  for the students and mentors as part of a focus on  collaborating in the workplace.   Over the last 12 months, 20 Optus team members  took part in this program, volunteering over 60  hours of mentoring and support to students.  All students who participated in the program  completed their Year 10 studies and began their  Higher School Certificate in Year 11.  For more information on our reconciliation efforts  please read our Reflect Reconciliation Action Plan. Case Study – KARI Scholarship Program “Being part of the KARI and  Optus scholarship program  has been an enriching  learning journey, The mentors  created a welcoming and  comfortable atmosphere  as we delved into yarns,  cultural activities, workplace  insights, digital skills and  mock interviews.” Student participant 63 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Future of work  ===== PAGE 64 ===== Workplace giving Through our yes4good workplace giving program, our  generous people donated $241,000 to 284 charities  and causes, including The Pyjama Foundation,  World Vision, Jodi Lee Foundation and ABCN. Optus  matches all employee giving through our yes4good  program (up to $300 per person, per year), taking  our total charitable giving in FY24 to $298,000.  While we have seen a decrease in total charitable  giving from last year, largely due to our workforce  reshaping, we remain committed towards investing  in our community through our in-kind support and  volunteering involvement.  Optus was a founding member of the Australian  Business and Community Network (ABCN) in  2005. The ABCN is a not-for-profit that brings  businesses and schools from low socio-economic  backgrounds together to run workplace-based  mentoring programs. This aligns with Optus’  commitment to improve opportunities for  students to reach their full potential in the future  world of work.   In FY24, 211 Optus people volunteered as mentors  with the ABCN, committing 1,036 hours to  support 576 students from 50 schools across  Australia. Optus mentors have helped students to  understand their various pathways to university,  supported them with goal setting, had discussions  on future career paths, explored financial  management and more.   In FY24, Optus mentors took part in a wide range  of programs, including:   •	 Cultural and vocational literacy programs  for students from non-English speaking  backgrounds.  •	 Career planning and upskilling programs for  regional, rural and remote students.  •	 Career planning, workplace skills and life skills  for First Nations students.  Lindsay Smith   Mentor and ABCN Taskforce Lead from  Optus’ Complex and Specialist Care Team  which supports vulnerable customers,  has been part of the ABCN programs in  South Australia for 18 years. Case Study: Mentoring for the future with the   Australian Business and Community Network “It has been a privilege to be  involved with ABCN over such  a long period. Supporting  mentoring in our schools brings  such a great sense of purpose to  all our mentors. Being a mentor  is one of the most rewarding  opportunities that I have had  with Optus, especially when you  are able to see the transition  of the students and know that  you have had influence on their  growth and development. And  I look forward to continuing to  work with ABCN to help shape  the future of our young people” 64 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Future of work  ===== PAGE 65 ===== Equity and inclusion Empowering Australians of all ages, backgrounds,  gender and abilities to reach their potential.  ===== PAGE 66 ===== Equity and inclusion Our team’s diverse backgrounds, perspectives, skills and life experiences enable us to develop meaningful  connections with our customers and communities, innovate new products and services, and make better- informed business decisions. We want to drive and demonstrate equity in all areas of our business and the  communities we interact with and service, including our supply chains.

This year we have continued to measure the  diversity of our workforce, strive for greater gender  equity, demonstrate our commitment to reconciliation  and increase our efforts to make our workplace, retail  stores and community a more inclusive and accessible  place for all. Included@Optus Through our Included@Optus program, we use a mix  of virtual reality experiences and group discussions to  help our people challenge biases and take ownership  of the role they play in creating a safe, inclusive and  respectful culture. We are proud that 65% of our  people have completed this program. Going forward,  we will be expanding the program to our Retail  Frontline and onshore Contact Centres.  Diversity census In September 2023, we conducted our first voluntary  diversity census – a survey for our people designed to  help us better understand how truly diverse we are.  We were pleased that 62% of our people participated  to volunteer information, covering a broad range of  diverse identifiers including gender, First Nations,  cultural/ethnicity, disability and neurodiversity, sexual  orientation, religious affiliations, parenting and  caring responsibilities and military/voluntary services.  The census is an important step in our journey to  understand more deeply who we are and help inform  how we can improve our employee experiences, as well  as provide a baseline from where we can continue to  measure progress. Employee networks and communities Our diversity employee networks and communities are  employee-led volunteer groups that bring together  people with shared identities and their allies. We  have eight employee networks and communities  representing women, LGBTQIA+, culture and heritage,  disability, First Nations people, young professionals,  veterans and first responders and wellbeing. With the  oversight of 15 executive sponsors, the networks have  built membership to over 3,000 people (approximately  44% of our workforce). They have celebrated and  recognised over 11 key diversity dates of significance  and have contributed to over 2,000 hours of learning  for our people. Our United network supports veterans and first  responders. In FY24 we opened a new memorial garden  at our campus in Sydney. As part of our Remembrance  Day commemorations our people made poppies and  laid a wreath at the site. United continues to build  strong community partnerships with Invictus Australia,  supporting and participating in events across FY24.  Further, we continue to provide employment pathways  and opportunities through our Gold partnership with  Soldier On, presence at Australian Defence Forces  Transition Seminars and we remain a signatory to the  Veteran Employment Commitment. Our Culture Connect network celebrates the diverse  culture and heritage of our people, and for the first  time we participated in National Refugee Week in  June 2023 by collaborating with Settlement Services  International and its start-up Ignite to help refugees  and people living with a disability start businesses  and achieve financial independence. Culture Connect  continued to celebrate and recognise Lunar New  Year, Easter, Ramadan, Eid, A Taste of Harmony and  Diwali nationally. The network focused on increasing  cross cultural leadership capability by drawing on  senior leaders lived experiences. Network members  supported our customer teams to translate policies  into a range of different languages for customers.

In FY24,  we continued to strive towards a gender balanced  leadership team, closely maintaining our 25% target,  achieving 24.4% this year. We have also increased  gender representation year on year in our graduate  program from 42% in FY23 to 58% in 2024. We also remain committed to advancing women  leaders through our Emerging Executive Women  and Executive Women sponsorship programs,  with more than 60 participants over the last two  years. These bespoke programs aim to bolster our  pipeline of women stepping up into more senior  roles and increasing their exposure and education.  Program components include skills and strength  based assessments, group workshops and webinars,  professional coaching, learning pathways, mentorship  and sponsorship. Our employee network championing  women, Elevate, continues to rapidly grow in support  of empowering and elevating women at Optus. In FY24  Elevate membership grew by 66%, exceeding 600  members.  This year we also welcomed and acknowledged the  Workplace Gender Equality Amendment (Closing  the Gender Pay Gap) Bill 2023 as a significant step  in accelerating our journey towards a more equitable  workplace. The Gender Pay Gap (GPG) is an important  indicator, pinpointing areas for improvement in our  commitment to gender equality. In 2023, we continued  to see year-on-year progress in narrowing the GPG and  remain committed to reducing the GPG. You can read  about our progress in our media statement here.   Accessibility and inclusion In 2023 we completed the Access and Inclusion Index,  delivered by the Australian Network on Disability of  which we have been a member since 2016. The Index  measures an organisation’s access and inclusion  journey and is Australia’s foremost corporate  benchmarking tool. We will use these results to help  shape our next Access and Inclusion Action Plan 2024- 2029. We have already taken some immediate steps  such as releasing accessible Optus brand guidelines  in early 2024, to ensure our communications are  accessible and inclusive to all. Additionally, efforts to  enhance accessibility in retail environments, such as  refurbishing over 30 Optus-owned retail stores, have  demonstrated our focus on exceeding accessibility  standards. We have audited all of our Optus-owned  retail stores for accessibility options such as wheelchair  access, quiet times and hearing accessibility, and these  stores are also now accredited through the Hidden  Disability Sunflower Initiative to support customers  with hidden disabilities. We are committed to promoting greater inclusion for  individuals with disabilities. We continue to support  and participate in programs such as PACE Mentoring,  WhatAbility, the Hidden Disability Sunflower initiative  and the Stepping Into Internship Program to help  our people gain a better insight and understanding  of people living with a disability. Additionally, we are  proud participants in the Disability Confident Recruiter  Program, working towards eliminating barriers in the  recruitment process and creating a more accessible  and inclusive environment for individuals with  disabilities. Commitment to Reconciliation In FY24, we proudly launched our first Reflect  Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP). Our RAP formalises  our commitment to reconciliation. Additionally, we  have created a governance framework to ensure that  the requirements and aspirations of our reconciliation  journey are met. This framework brings together  leaders from Optus, First Nations leaders in the  community and our Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander employees. We continue to make progress on our RAP  commitments with highlights including; the  establishment of the Yarn First Nations employee  network and allies, introducing Manawari Aboriginal  Cultural Safety training into Optus U, with over 50  graduates to date,  launching an Acknowledgement  of Country guide, deepening our investment in early  career pathways through awarding scholarships  to First Nations Macquarie University Students,  embedding changes to our procurement policies to  connect our people with Indigenous businesses and  celebrating National Reconciliation and NAIDOC  weeks. Optus’ progress was recognised by the  KARI Foundation, being awarded two awards –  the Commitment to Reconciliation award and  Commitment to Service award in December 2023. 69 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Equity and inclusion  ===== PAGE 70 ===== LGBTQIA+  In January we were awarded Bronze status in the  Australian Workplace Equity Index recognising our  impact on LGBTQIA+ inclusion in our organisational  culture. We are proud to be recognised for our efforts  to make Optus an inclusive and engaging place for  LGBTQIA+ people to feel safe and be able to bring  their true selves to work. We have updated key policies,  terminology and standards with inclusive language and  benefits and developed inclusive dress code guidelines  for our frontline team. Our Express Yourself Network   is running strong in its third year and continues to bring  together people to foster a more diverse and inclusive  work environment. We are proud of our role as a major partner with  Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, offering a  moment for our amazing people to embrace their  individuality with pride. Optus float at the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Parade 70 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024 Equity and inclusion  ===== PAGE 71 ===== We know that staying connected is critical to our  customers, especially in times of challenge. In  November 2023, we established our Australian- based Specialist Care Team to support our  vulnerable customers to access and maintain  connectivity in challenging times, such as when  they are experiencing the loss of a loved one,  financial hardship, natural disaster events,  domestic and family abuse, homelessness or  health issues. Participants in our Donate Your  Data™ program now also have access to this  Specialist Care Team.   To ensure our Specialist Care Team is equipped  to provide effective support to our customers,  we engaged external expertise to assess and  enhance the team’s capabilities and rolled out  tailored training for both the Specialist Care  Team and other Optus frontline teams to help  them identify, refer and support vulnerable  customers. Since its inception, our Specialist Care Team has  provided tailored support to 2,667 vulnerable  customers. We’re encouraged by the positive  feedback we’ve received from our customers  and look forward to continuing to enhance our  services and support options in future.  “Often customers who are  going through a challenging  time are unaware of the  external support that is  available to them. Being  part of the Specialist Care  Team means that I can help  customers with their specific  connectivity issues provide  financial relief and provide  customers with information  about support groups who  can help them through their  particular circumstances.” James Wilson   Senior Specialist Care Team Expert Case Study: Introducing our Specialist Care Team  71 | Optus Sustainability Report 2024  ===== PAGE 72 ===== Modern Slavery and Human Rights  Providing a safe and  equitable workplace Our commitment to respect the human rights of all  individuals means that we prioritise the identification and  management of potential risks associated with modern  slavery in our operations and supply chain. In FY24, we  released our fourth Modern Slavery Statement and  progressed the development of our supplier engagement  roadmap and commenced the review of selected suppliers  in high-risk supplier categories. We also want to ensure that our people are equipped to  identify and manage modern slavery risks. In January  2024, we updated our modern slavery e-learning module  to further tailor the content to Optus context and its  identified modern slavery risks.  In addition to all people leaders, we have extended this  required training to include our people in additional  business units which play a role in our modern slavery  response, such those working in Devices, Regulatory and  Public Affairs, and People and Culture. In FY24, 8,172  learners completed the module, of which 2,841 are staff  (42% of our workforce). We are committed to continuous improvement, learning  along the way, and strengthening our engagement with  suppliers to address ongoing challenges around modern  slavery. While we had no reported instances of modern  slavery relating to our operations or supply chain during  the reporting period, however, we understand this does  not mean no risks exist. Going forward, we remain committed to continuous  improvement, including delivering on key elements of  our action plan in the coming year. You can read our  2023 statement here, and we will be releasing our 2024  statement in September 2024.

As part of this, Optus are committed to  serve our community and have a positive  impact through our sustainability programs  and initiatives. Many of our sustainability  initiatives provide our customers with options  that positively increase their own impact  on the environment and community.  Optus sustainability strategy –  delivering to our commitments  We can achieve a more sustainable future when we  work together. As a business we have developed  a Sustainability Strategy that drives shared value  between our customers, the community, and the  environment. We focus on measurable and tangible  ways to make positive impact through our six pillars –  Climate Action, Circular Economy, Digital Enablement,  Sustainable Innovation, Future of Work and Equity  & Inclusion. We are proud to have achieved and even  exceeded some of our FY25 targets this year outlined  throughout this report. Connecting people is at the heart of everything we do,  and this year a key focus for us has been connecting  our customers with sustainable causes they care about  through our services. Here are some ways we have  progressed against our sustainability commitments  and engaged our customers in positive social and  environmental activities: Climate Action At Optus, we recognise the role we play in linking our  community to a future with reduced carbon emissions.  We have a long-time commitment to enhancing the  environmental sustainability of our operations and  assisting our community in joining us on the path  towards a sustainable and robust future. Through  initiatives such as Optus Eco, customers have power  to personalise their experience and, in a positive  way, amplify their environmental impact through the  My Optus App, including by supporting local offset  projects that are meaningful to them. In FY23 we reduced our absolute (market-based)  emissions by 12.9% year-on-year, getting us closer  to our target of 25% reduction by FY25, in line with  Scope 1 and 2 Science-Based Targets. Singtel Group  was one of the first companies in Asia (ex-Japan) to  have carbon emission reduction targets approved by  the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) in 2017.  During the year, we completed an internal review of  our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emission targets to be in line  with a 1.5-degree global climate scenario alongside  a roadmap to achieve this. We are in the process of  engaging SBTi with these updated 2030 emissions  targets and will share details in due course.  Another important aspect of climate management  is ensuring access to communications infrastructure  during natural disaster weather events. We invested  in nine additional Satellite Cell and Trailers (SATCATs)  to substantially strengthen our disaster response  capabilities and provide mobile network connection  where traditional infrastructure was damaged.   FY23 was another difficult year for many rural  communities exposed to various natural disaster and  extreme weather events. We’ve been able to adapt  quickly and introduce resilient systems to withstand  outages. The expansion of our SATCAT fleet has  allowed us to provide immediate connectivity support  to affected areas during this year’s flooding in rural  New South Wales and Queensland. Read more about  our disaster response on page 33. Circular Economy Our commitment to circular economy principles for  waste reduction remained steadfast this year. Through  our Circular Economy Roadmap, we established a plan  to attain our targets of making all Optus branded  products packaging 100% recyclable, reusable or  compostable by FY25.  This year, a key milestone was the launch of our first  environmentally friendly modem, made from 95%  recycled plastic and packaging that is 100% recyclable  with no single-use plastics. This gives our customers  the choice to purchase products that will reduce their  own environmental footprint. Closing the loop, we  also offer customers options to recycle or repurpose  their old handsets through our Donate Your Device and  MobileMuster programs. Our IT and Networks teams have also contributed  significantly to reuse and recycle our e-waste, with 97.3%  of our e-waste from Networks and 100% from IT diverted  from landfill, a proud achievement as we have already  exceeded our goal of recycling 90% by FY25. Sustainable  Innovation Digital   Enablement Circular   Economy Climate   Action Connecting  Australia Future   of Work Equity and   Inclusion Overview 3     |     Overview  ===== PAGE 4 ===== Digital Enablement We continued our commitment to educating young  people to be safe digital citizens online. Our Digital  Thumbprint program delivered free facilitator-led  and online learning workshops to 80,547 young  people across Australia, exceeding our FY25 target of  educating 550,000 young people. Our whole team is  incredibly proud of this achievement. We expanded  the program this year to deliver in-person facilitated  workshops to schools in more regional areas across  Australia. More of this on page 45. The Living Network’s Donate Your Data program  continues to be one of the most effective ways to  address the digital divide that exists for vulnerable  and disadvantaged individuals and families. This year  our customers donated over 12 million gigabytes (GB)  of data to those who don’t have regular access to the  internet, were caught in natural disaster crises or are  experiencing domestic and family violence. Sustainable Innovation We know that technology is a great enabler in  addressing social and environmental challenges  that we face in society. Through our Optus Future  Makers program this year, we funded five new  social innovators to build and scale their social and  environmental tech innovations. As a business we have   partnered with three of our Future Makers alumni to  pilot their solutions since the program started in 2017.  Read more about this year’s pilots on page 52. This year we also launched a $1.4 billion sustainability- linked revolving loan facility – the first of its kind in   the Australian telecommunications industry. This   gives us great insight into investor’s sustainability   goals, the type of commitments they want to see,   and directly aligns our financing strategy to the   group’s sustainability targets.  Future of Work Optus adopts a proactive stance in readying for the  workforce of the future. We recognise that digital  platforms, which now simplify daily life - such as  AI, machine learning and cloud services - will be the  foundation of this workforce transformation. Our  approach provides our employees opportunities to  acquire new skills, sculpt their careers, and prosper   in a digital future where prioritising customer  experience is paramount. To equip us for the constantly evolving digital  landscape, we are providing our people with the  opportunity to obtain micro-credentials through   Optus U. This year, we introduced new streams-of- learning within Cyber Security, Data Science and  Artificial Intelligence (AI). We also tripled our Tech  Talent Graduate intake, welcoming 54 students in  Software Engineering, Cyber Security, Digital and  Data & Analytics. By providing access to advanced  learning, our people can gain verified recognition of   in-demand capabilities, allowing them and their  careers to thrive in the future digital world. Future of Work also focuses on how we can lend  a helping hand to disadvantaged individuals and  communities, empowering them to develop their  own future focused skills. These initiatives revealed  overwhelming feedback from our amazing Optus  people who welcome the opportunity to volunteer,  mentor and champion those in need of real support.  A huge thank you to all our people who put their hand  up to volunteer this year through our programs and  initiatives. Find out more about this on page 59.  Equity and Inclusion We believe that the strength of our business stands  on the foundation of our diverse, vibrant and talented  workforce. These diverse backgrounds, life experiences  and perspectives of our people enable us to better   service our customers, produce innovative offerings,   and make better business decisions. Fostering diversity  within our team generates a beneficial ripple effect  within the larger community.  This year our team designed and developed our first  Reflect Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP). To launch  in early FY24, the RAP is our guide to fostering and  strengthening relationships with Aboriginal and   Torres Strait Islander peoples, communities,   partners and businesses. We have been investing into the next generation  of leaders, through our Pathways 2 Employment  program and partnership with the Australian Business  and Community Network, having also exceeded our  FY25 target in supporting career aspirations through  mentoring, skills transfer and employment opportunities  for 5,000 disadvantaged youth.  Over the last few years, we have also highlighted the  importance of respecting the human rights of people,  both within our immediate network and supply chain.   In FY23 we released our third Modern Slavery Statement,  outlining our progress against our action plan to respect  the human rights of all people within our areas of  influence and reach.  Sustainable  Innovation Digital   Enablement Circular   Economy Climate   Action Connecting  Australia Future   of Work Equity and   Inclusion Overview 4     |     Overview  ===== PAGE 5 ===== Cyberattack In September 2022, Optus suffered a cyberattack by  a determined, skilled cybercriminal who targeted our  customers’ personal information. Data privacy and  protection have always been important elements of  our ESG commitment. Our customers are our most  important ‘social stakeholder‘ and respecting and  protecting people’s privacy is important to us. We  are deeply sorry the attack impacted our customers,  and we are committed to taking the action needed  to do better in the future. We have learned a great  deal through the experience, and we have committed  to sharing those learnings in the spirit of making  Australia stronger and better. Once we realised the attack had occurred, we were  laser-focused on preventing our customers from harm  through the potential misuse of their information, and  that objective guided all our decisions and actions. It led us to announce what had happened quickly to  put customers on alert. It led us to engage extensively  with the government and financial institutions to  work together to protect customers, and it led us to  communicate openly and transparently even when we  didn’t have all the answers. We also proactively helped  each person understand what was recommended by  the authorities for their specific situation and covered  the costs to customers of replacing identity documents  where advised to do so. It wasn’t the year many of us at Optus expected, but  its challenges brought even stronger comradery and  dedication from all our Optus people.     Our resilience has been on full display this year,   showcasing our unwavering challenger spirit which is  an intrinsic part of who we are. We have continued to  connect with our customers, communities, network,  and each other as we navigate through what has  happened, and looking ahead identify where we can  improve. And most importantly, we have never lost  focus on our customers and our commitments which  we continue to honour. Through the challenges and accomplishments of   this year, we are united as a team and are optimistic  about the future. We remain steadfast in our vision  to power optimism with options. Thank you to all our  customers, stakeholders, partners, and Optus people.  What we can achieve together is greater than we can  ever achieve alone. We hope you enjoy reading about our continued  sustainability journey and progress and always  welcome your feedback.

When we  come together with our customers, network and  community, we can create a future we can all be  optimistic about. We believe that we can make the  biggest impact through our six focus areas – Climate  Action, Circular Economy, Digital Enablement,  Sustainable Innovation, Future of Work, and Equity  and Inclusion. These six focus areas were identified  through our materiality process, which you can read  more about in our ‘Sustainability Governance’ section.  We have committed to five-year   sustainability targets within each focus area: ''The Optus  sustainability strategy  and our targets focus  on the areas where we  believe we can have the  most significant impact  – for our customers,  people, planet and  communities in which  we live and work.''

By building meaningful  relationships, we can gain insightful feedback  from stakeholders, which informs our   decision-making as a business and helps  to build trust. We proactively communicate with our diverse   range of stakeholders in a variety of ways,   such as face-to-face and virtual meetings,  roundtable discussions, forums, events, surveys,  customer success representatives and direct  feedback obtained via email (sustainability@ optus.com.au). Our sustainability strategy is  formed in collaboration with our stakeholders  through a thorough materiality review every  three to five years. This enables us to prioritise  the most relevant concerns of these groups and   ensure that we are identifying and addressing   the issues that matter most to our stakeholders.  Our stakeholders Throughout this report you will discover our  trusted partnerships and active engagement  with a range of stakeholders, as we seek to  collaborate on initiatives where we can make  a more meaningful and sustainable impact by  working together.

We recognise that First  Nations people have been part of Australia’s history  for over 60,000 years. Before telecommunication as  we know it today, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  peoples communicated through word of mouth, art,  celebrations, and corroborees. Given this connection, we aim to deepen our  relationships with First Nations communities and  cultivate a deeper understanding of Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander cultures within our organisation.  This is integral to our organisational culture and  fulfilling our commitment to being Australia’s   most loved everyday brand with lasting   customer relationships. Reflect Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) Reconciliation Australia’s Reconciliation Action Plan  (RAP) framework is an opportunity to detail our  central vision, purpose and strategic commitment  to delivering measurable positive outcomes for First  Nations peoples, Optus, our customers and broader  community. In FY23 Optus designed and developed a  Reflect Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP). Launched in  early FY24, the RAP focuses on how Optus will forge  a long-term commitment to meaningful and positive  outcomes for and with Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander peoples. Optus’ mission for reconciliation is “to ensure  this future leverages the power of inclusivity. It is  with courage, respect and a commitment to listen  and to learn that we strive to provide meaningful  opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander peoples to develop, contribute and be part  of the digital economy. We will use our RAP to make  meaningful progress and impact, further fostering   and strengthening relationships with Aboriginal   and Torres Strait Islander peoples, communities,  partners and businesses.” We encourage you to read our Reflect Reconciliation  Action Plan and commitments via our website. KARI Foundation Since 2018, Optus has partnered with the KARI  Foundation to provide educational opportunities for  Aboriginal youth, supporting them to achieve, thrive  and belong. Each year Optus provides financial and  mentoring support to 20 Indigenous students entering  their final years of high school. The financial support  covers educational-related expenses for students,  including excursions, books and materials, and the  mentoring support provides an avenue for young  people and Optus employees to share perspectives   and build relationships. Optus and KARI have also come together -   through a series of co-designed workshops to  create a shared cultural awareness with employees,  and canvass greater opportunities for mentored  scholarship students. Furthermore, KARI Foundation is also a partner in our  digital inclusion program, Donate Your DataTM. The  program provides a free 4G SIM so participants can  access the internet and stay connected to friends and  family via free calls and texts. Over 1,000 Indigenous  young people and families were supported through the  KARI Foundation using Donate Your DataTM. Find out  more about Donate Your Data on page 48. Engaging an Indigenous supplier network As outlined in our RAP, we aim to increase Aboriginal  and Torres Strait Islander supplier diversity to support  improved economic and social outcomes for these  communities. Our plan involves developing best  practices to promote and build confidence across the  business to engage with Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander suppliers, and to further integrate our existing  Supply Nation membership within Optus’ procurement  policies and processes.

As  a member of the UNGC, we are committed to  playing our part in progressing the Sustainable  Development Goals (SDGs). Along with the multitude of governments who have  committed to achieving the 17 SDGs aimed at tackling  significant global issues by 2030, we also advocate  for the crucial role of businesses in adopting a new  mindset and implementing necessary changes at both  the strategic and operational levels to attain the SDGs  and measure their impact. In FY18, we conducted an SDG prioritisation exercise  and identified 9 SDGs that require the most attention  in our countries of operation and supply chains to  create sustainable change.

We strive to adhere to the highest  standards of personal and corporate integrity,  outlined in our Code of Conduct.  We expect our people to embody these principles  in all their actions and decision-making, to conduct  themselves in line with our organisational values.  Our people participate in Appropriate Workplace  Behaviours compliance training as part of their  onboarding process which covers our Code of  Conduct. Employees have access to the Code  via our website and the Code is referenced in  the various compliance learning modules that  each individual must complete annually. In line with our Code of Conduct, we must comply  with all laws, regulations, codes of practice, and  legal, regulatory and licensing requirements, including  directions and orders of any government or statutory  or regulatory authority in the areas in which we  operate. This includes tax regulations in Australia –  more on this on page 22. Our Code of Conduct aligns with our Anti-Bribery and  Corruption, Fraud Investigation and Whistleblowing  policies, which are Singtel Group-wide policies.   In FY23 41 complaints were reported to our  Whistleblower service, with 12 cases being  substantiated, 15 not substantiated and 14 carried  forward at 31 March 2023. Of the 14 cases brought  forward at the end of FY22, 5 were substantiated  and 9 not substantiated. It is a decrease from the  preceding years, with 62 and 87 complaints received   in FY22 and FY21 respectively. How sustainability is governed Optus is led by Singtel Group’s sustainability  governance and management of ESG and  sustainability governance key performance indicators  (KPIs). The Singtel Board provides oversight to the  Group, along with the Management Committee and  Risk Management Committee, on material ESG topics.  The Group CEO provides the Board with regular  updates on various sustainability programs, upcoming  activities, and updates on global trends that have an  impact on our sustainability strategy.  Optus has a Group Sustainability team to focus on  ESG and sustainability-related activities in Australia  and bridge the local strategy to the Singtel Group  sustainability strategy. The Australian and Singapore  sustainability teams regularly come together to drive  and collaborate on sustainability programs and share  best practices across the Group. The Singtel Group  sustainability governance structure is available   within the Singtel Group Sustainability Report. Management of ESG KPIs Many sustainability issues are consistent across   the countries in which the Group operates, and  therefore we have linked collective and common   ESG targets to KPIs, such as: 	• 20% of our Top Executive’s long-term incentive  plan remuneration policies are tied to specific,  time-bound key performance indicators (KPIs)  such as reaching 32% of female employees in  management by FY25 	• ESG targets for our Management Committee’s  short-term incentive plans represent 10% of  their annual balance scorecard performance 	• Management Committee’s KPIs are cascaded  down to their business units, departments and  employees, whose performance bonus and  other incentives are tied to their KPIs. These targets cover key sustainability themes such as: 	• Climate change and environment - as measured  by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) 	• Reputation and responsible business practices -  measured by the MSCI ESG Index 	• Community impact, in terms of our digital  inclusion and enablement targets 	• Talent and people including diversity   and talent retention.

We acknowledge tax transparency improves  the community’s confidence in the corporate sector.  As a signatory to the Board of Taxation’s voluntary tax  transparency code, we’ve published Tax Transparency  Reports since FY18. You can find out more about our  approach to tax, and our latest Tax Transparency  Report on our website. You can also view more details  about our Tax practices in the Singtel Group Report. Security and data privacy Our Privacy Policy outlines our strict procedures  that govern the handling and protection of sensitive  customer information. We value the privacy of our  customers and their data, which is stored within our  networks and systems, as our customers may come   to harm if their data is compromised or misused.  We have in place safeguards and controls for the  protection of customer data. We continue to record customer privacy complaints  that are referred to us by our customers, staff, other  individuals or regulatory bodies. In FY23 there were 77  cases of non-cyber-related complaints, categorised as  privacy incidents. Of these, nine cases were referred  by the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman  (TIO), and one case from the Office of the Australian  Information Commissioner (OAIC). We met the  threshold to notify the OAIC on one occasion, which  was related to the Optus cyber incident, and reported  a Notifiable Data Breach relating to the personal  information of 9.8 million customers. In September 2022, Optus suffered a cyberattack  that resulted in the exposure of some customers'  personal information. We communicated openly and  transparently with all stakeholders affected and  worked closely with the government and financial  institutions to protect our customers. We took  immediate corrective action to prevent similar   cases from recurring. We also committed to covering the cost of replacing  identity documents, such as drivers licences, for  customers advised to do so. In April 2023, a class  action against Optus was filed in the Federal Court  of Australia on behalf of customers in relation to  the cyberattack. We will defend the proceedings. In  addition to the measures already taken, we continue to  provide support for customers impacted by the attack. Fair and ethical marketing In FY23, Optus did not receive any fines from the  Australian Communications and Media Authority  (ACMA). However, we were subject to one sanction  from the Australian Competition and Consumer  Commission (ACCC) during the year: Optus was fined  $13.5 million for allegations of false and misleading  representations in relation to the sale of NBN plans in  2019 to about 20,500 customers. The ACCC alleged  Optus made representations that customers who  acquired an Optus plan would obtain a speed estimate  before the line was activated, that Optus would check  the speed of the line after connection and that Optus  would provide alternate options if the estimated speed  could not be met, and that Optus wrongly accepted  payments from customers. As a result of Court orders  and declarations regarding Optus’ breaches in respect  of the contraventions to ss 29(1)(g) and (m) to the  Australian Consumer Law (ACL), Optus was required  to pay a penalty of $13.5 million, plus $100,000 in  costs, to undertake a customer remediation program,  maintain and update our compliance program. This  matter was heard in court on 10 November 2022.  Sustainable  Innovation Digital  Enablement Circular  Economy Climate  Action Connecting  Australia Future  of Work Equity and  Inclusion Overview 22     |     Overview  ===== PAGE 23 ===== Connecting Australia  ===== PAGE 24 ===== Our Network Network coverage –   enhancing our 5G Network As a leading telecommunications company, Optus  has a significant responsibility to keep our customers  and the wider community connected. We remain  committed to enhancing the customer connectivity  experience while also maintaining existing and forging  new partnerships to develop future ways of connecting  people and communities. We are committed to building Australia’s fastest 5G  network, because a fast and reliable network creates  possibilities. It can accelerate impactful innovation,  increase productivity for businesses; enable powerful  knowledge sharing, and help to build meaningful  personal and community connections. This year, Optus rolled out an additional 1,200 5G  sites, bringing our total to over 3,000 5G sites. We  have broadened our 5G reach to include additional  regional towns and upgraded keysites that many  of our customers rely on the most, such as Sydney,  Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide airports.  To serve more customers in areas where mobile  coverage would usually be challenging, we have  upgraded almost 1,000 sites with a 900Mhz low   band spectrum, which extends our 5G coverage   by 20% per-site basis.  5G Standalone Network  After almost a year of testing and several customer  trials, this year we launched our 5G Standalone  network. Our new 5G Standalone network doesn’t  rely on the 4G radio and core network, which means  more of our customers’ devices can communicate  simultaneously at higher speeds and, in future,   can connect to 5G in more places. As the technology matures, our customers will  experience even faster speeds, greater reliability   and lower latency. These capabilities will create  an ideal environment for delivery of richer user  experiences, like gaming, Artificial Reality (AR),   Virtual Reality (VR) and Extended Reality (XR).  Looking forward, we are developing additional   5G Standalone features such as network slicing.  This will enable customers to slice the network into  different virtual segments, allowing each slice to be  uniquely configured to optimise speed, reduce data  lags and latency, and increase flexibility.  Greening our 5G Network  Upgrading our 5G networks to provide the best  coverage increases our energy demands and resulted  in an increase of emissions. Given this, we are  progressively upgrading our network with state- of-the-art hardware to enable energy efficient site  solution deployment. This addresses both sustainability  and site deployment challenges, by reducing total  footprint, materials used, and power consumption.  This modernisation of hardware, along with its energy  saving features, show a reduction of 42.5kWh - which  is equivalent to 31kg CO2eq per site per day - resulting  in a realised energy reduction of 31% in the cost per  gigabyte (GB).

Sustainable  Innovation Digital   Enablement Circular   Economy Climate   Action Overview Future   of Work Equity and   Inclusion 24     |     Connecting Australia Connecting  Australia  ===== PAGE 25 ===== Radio Access Network (RAN) Optus and Ericsson have deployed a unique   radio access network (RAN) solution to leverage  lightweight, new generation ratios and basebands   that reduce energy consumption by up to 25%.  This solution supports the sustainable growth of  Optus’ mobile network whilst contributing to Optus’  sustainability commitment to reduce carbon   emissions by 25% by FY25.  Following the initial deployment at the Moorebank  site, Optus is beginning to upgrade equipment at sites  across its network: resulting in a decrease in energy  consumption, aiming to save approximately 40kWh  per day when coupled with energy-saving software  features. You can read more about this carbon  reduction project on page 29. Resilient Network We continue to undertake extensive climate scenario  analysis to pre-empt worsening natural disasters  and invest in adaptation of our network for climate  resilience, indicated in our inaugural Task Force on  Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report,  published in FY22. In FY23 we continued collaboration  with our stakeholders across the infrastructure  ecosystem and have together identified vulnerable  sites which will be incorporated into a microgrid pilot.  This will help to ensure our sites remain operational  at times when the main power supply is affected by  extreme weather events. New Satellite technology While we have a strong track record in delivering  services to rural areas, Australia’s vast landmass   and rugged terrain have made it difficult to provide  mobile coverage everywhere needed, especially   in remote locations. This year we successfully conducted a live  demonstration of satellite direct-to-mobile technology.  This technology enables a standard mobile device  located outside of the terrestrial network to access  the satellite network, offering a much-needed solution  for customers and communities not covered by the  existing network. This will benefit those living in   remote communities, and even those out at sea   off the Australian coast, allowing them to stay  connected. We will continue to explore the rollout   of this technology in FY24. ''At Ericsson, sustainability is integral to our business  and has become a fundamental part of how we operate  and innovate. This new RAN deployment represents an  important step toward our mission to achieve net-zero  across our value chain by 2040 and cut emissions by 50%  in our portfolio in use and supply chain by 2030. We are  proud to have collaborated with Optus in creating a RAN  solution that will continue to support the development of  Australia’s sustainable future.''

Our two targets drive our strategic focus on Climate  Action: to reduce 25% of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions,  and to procure 100% of our electricity requirements  from renewable-backed sources by the end of 2025.  Aligning with SDGs 9, 11, and 13, we aim to reduce  our organisational carbon footprint, and provide  opportunities for our customers to reduce their  individual carbon footprint in partnership with us.  Through initiatives such as Optus Eco, customers   have the power to personalise their experience and  amplify their environmental impact through the  My Optus App, including by supporting local offset  projects that are meaningful to them. The Singtel Group was one of the first companies  in Asia to have carbon emission reduction targets  approved by the SBTi in 2017. During FY23, we  completed an internal review of our Scope 1, 2 and 3  emission targets against a 1.5-degree global climate  scenario. The refreshed target will be announced in due  course when revalidated by SBTi. We are continuing  to engage with our suppliers on our shared emissions  and are working collaboratively to build a roadmap to  guide future emission reduction strategies that we   can achieve together between FY24 and FY30.

We have seen the Ukraine War unfold and  the energy crisis that followed, as well as supply chain  challenges. These developments have resulted in cost  increases in electricity and renewable energy project  developments which have significantly changed the  economics and supply capacity of our energy needs,  including our renewable energy plans, which we will  share in due course.  Despite these challenges in FY23, we signed our first  Renewable Energy Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)  with Red Energy, including their TrueGreen product,  for approximately 158GWh of our national load. Our  contracting pipeline for additional renewable energy  PPAs is currently a work in progress. While this may  pose supply and inflationary risks to our original RE  targets, we will continue to update and disclose the  developments of RE contracting with our customers  and other stakeholders as we progress. Case Study: Embodied Carbon – Upstream Supply Chain emissions  This year we worked closely with Nokia and Ericsson  to better understand and quantify the embodied  carbon emissions associated with our 5G network  infrastructure. Embodied emissions include emissions  associated with the construction processes and  materials used in building and upgrading our mobile  network. We are also working with our major suppliers  to refine the embedded emissions allocations to  understand their own emissions reduction targets   and commitments.  As a result of this collaborative engagement, we  now have a more comprehensive understanding  of our emissions inventory and clear insights on  targeting future emissions reduction improvements.  This will ensure that, together with our suppliers, we  are focused on maximising the emissions reduction  opportunities that have the most impact on our   shared environmental ambitions.  Energy reduction initiatives  In FY23, we continued to make progress on our   energy reduction target by initiating a project to  identify opportunities throughout our network.  Through this project, we realised a reduction of  18.9GWh of electricity from the decommissioning   of legacy, redundant, defunct and end-of-life network  elements and their associated components.

Scope 3  represents Optus’ largest emissions source, making   up 81% of our total emissions.   In FY23, our Scope 1 and 2 (market-based)   emissions decreased by 0.4% and 12.9% respectively  compared to FY22, resulting in an overall reduction  of 50,889tCO2e from the previous year. In addition,  we made improvements to our Scope 3 accounting  method for Category 1 and 2 which resulted in lower  estimated emissions this year when compared to FY22. We have also seen an increase in our Category 5, 6   and 7 emissions as staff return to work and business  travel resumed after COVID-19 restrictions eased.   The table, right, depicts the performance of our   Scope 1, 2 and 3 since FY21.  1 Restatement: We are reporting our emissions from transport and distribution to Category 4 from Category 9 from last FY, following the GHG protocol Scope 3  calculation guidance - ' Outbound logistics services purchased by the reporting company are categorized as upstream because they are a purchased service'. 2 Restated FY21 and FY22 Category 11 figures to reflect suitable power consumption for modems sold.

Customers have the option to  offset some of their mobile phone’s environmental  impact and support Australian carbon reduction  projects, which is further amplified by Optus   matching what our eligible customers offset. In the My Optus App, customers can: 	• Go paperless by opting to receive their   bills and invoices online to reduce paper   waste and carbon emissions 	• Connect to a plastic-free digital eSIM   to reduce plastic usage and waste 	• Offset some of their mobile phone’s   carbon emissions by supporting Australian  carbon reduction projects, with additional  offset-matching provided by Optus to   eligible customers Combating climate change is a collective effort and   we all have a role to play to halt and reduce global  carbon emissions. Our support of selected Australian  carbon reduction projects is in addition to, and  amplifies, our existing climate action commitments  to meaningfully reduce our emissions and switch to  renewable energy. Together with our partner GreenCollar, we invest in  local offset projects that have meaningful impact  on the Australian environment and adhere to the  government’s accreditation standards. We purchase  Australian carbon credit units (ACCUs) to offset our  carbon emissions and invest in, and support, locally   run sustainability initiatives. ''Our research shows that consumers   want to take tangible environmental  action, but they don’t always know  how to go about it. Optus Eco is a  simple and transparent mechanism for  Optus customers to contribute to the  environment and support high quality,  local projects focused on restoring native  bushland and supporting habitats.”  GreenCollar 13,375 participants in FY23 555 tonnes CO2 eq offset in total 364 tonnes CO2 eq offset  through Boonora   Downs, NSW 191 tonnes CO2 eq offset  through Tallering  Station, WA Sustainable  Innovation Digital   Enablement Circular   Economy Connecting  Australia Overview Future   of Work Equity and   Inclusion 31     |     Climate Action Climate   Action  ===== PAGE 32 ===== Case Study: Our road to   reduced transport emissions  This year we continued our progress towards reducing  the emissions associated with our Optus vehicle fleet.  As of 31st March 2023, Optus has 92 hybrid vehicles,  equating to 51% of passenger vehicles in the Optus  fleet. A further 51 hybrid vehicles are expected for  delivery in FY24 and 7 more are projected for FY25. As Optus’ regional network operations require vehicles  that can carry heavy equipment loads, there are  limited commercial electric vehicle options available  in the Australian market. While this makes setting a  target to fully electrify our company fleet challenging,  we were excited to pilot our first electric vehicle (EV)  with our Sydney-based Networks Building Operations  team, to evaluate which vehicles best support our  sustainability practices whilst maintaining operational  efficiency. The key factors for consideration are the  vehicles’ fit-for-purpose features, battery range,  business usage and the availability of public EV  charging infrastructure. At this stage our transition plan continues to be an  ongoing process, but we remain optimistic about  the potential electric vehicles have in enabling our  sustainability goals. In addition, at our Sydney Campus  we have made EV chargers available in our employee  car park for our staff to use at no additional cost. Switching to LED lighting In line with our focus on reducing energy consumption,  this year our Retail Property and Operations team  rolled out LED lighting upgrades across our retail  stores and network sites nationally. This not only  provides excellent lighting levels for our employees   and customers, but significantly reduces our   overall energy consumption. By the end of FY23,   we completed lighting upgrades in 12 retail stores,  and in 98% of all network sites across Australia.  Sustainability-linked financing Sustainability-linked financing refers to debt  instruments for which the interest cost is linked to  the achievement of predefined sustainability targets.  They are designed to encourage entities to invest in  initiatives that promote sustainable growth   and development. In FY23, a $1.4 billion sustainability-linked revolving  loan facility was launched by Optus under 'Olives',  Singtel’s sustainable financing program. This is the  first sustainability-linked revolving loan facility by   an Australian telecommunications company. The interest rate discounts are linked to Optus’  achievement of reducing its absolute greenhouse gas  emissions by 25% (Scope 1 and 2 in tCO2e) by FY25,  compared to its 2015 baseline. Optus was supported  for this loan by a syndicate of 12 banks. This $1.4 billion sustainability-linked loan facility is  a continuation of our $300 million bond which was  issued in FY22. This extension will help us achieve our  goals and allow our investors to participate in our  sustainability practices. Sustainable  Innovation Digital   Enablement Circular   Economy Connecting  Australia Overview Future   of Work Equity and   Inclusion 32     |     Climate Action Climate   Action  ===== PAGE 33 ===== Natural disasters &  	 extreme weather events Case Study: Supporting communities during   natural disasters and extreme weather events Maintaining connectivity during a natural disaster  can be a lifeline for those affected. To support  our customers and communities, Optus invested  in additional disaster response innovations to  keep our network strong and resilient, and to  keep people connected with their loved ones and  disaster relief services. We are proud of the role  we play in supporting people in their time of need.  Doing so is about living our purpose, supporting  our community and inspiring our people.  We have invested in nine additional Satellite  Cell and Trailers (SATCATs) to substantially  strengthen our disaster response capabilities,  bringing our total fleet to 13. SATCATs act as  backup mobile network connections when  traditional infrastructure is damaged: they  provide temporary mobile coverage and public  WiFi for customers and communities. The portable nature of the SATCATs allows us to  deploy them rapidly to communities in disaster- affected areas. Over the past 12 months, we  have proudly supported communities isolated by  floods and other natural disasters across New  South Wales, including Lismore, Gooloogong,  Wisemans Ferry, Cattai, Windsor and Eugowra. We also designed and manufactured six Disaster  Recovery Skids (‘DR Skids’) through a co-funded  strategic initiative with the Federal Government.  DR Skids are mobile sites that can be deployed  to provide longer-term connectivity in regions  affected by natural disasters. Our DR Skids  utilise solar energy as a complementary energy  source to standby generators, which extends  their standby power and means communities’  connectivity is supported for longer.  The first DR Skid was deployed in November  2022 in response to the severe flooding in  Gooloogong, New South Wales. The DR Skid  helped Gooloogong customers and the broader  community to remain connected in challenging  times while the existing telecommunications  infrastructure was under repair. Further, to minimise mobile outages when the  power grid fails in affected areas, we have  invested in innovative backup battery solutions.  These solutions ensure that transmission  mobile sites have power and connection for an  additional 10 to 20 hours of service during a  power outage.  Telecommunications services are vital to keeping  our communities safe, informed, and connected,  especially during times of emergency or disaster.  We understand that our role as one of the largest  telecommunications providers in Australia means  that Australians rely on our services to keep  businesses running and people connected in   their time of need. Over the last year, Australia has experienced natural  disasters and extreme weather events at an increasing  frequency and intensity. Extreme weather events  and natural disasters caused damage and disruption  to many Australians and tested our individual and  collective resilience. Previous climate change risk assessments undertaken  in 2015, 2020 and 2021 have informed various network  adaptation and resilience initiatives that have enabled  us to continue serving our communities and our  emergency service providers to stay connected   during times of crisis.  At Optus, we are dedicated to ensuring that our  network remains robust, and resilient. Our climate   risk work is included within the 2022 Singtel Group  TCFD report (Task Force for Climate Risk Related  Financial Disclosures), which provides details about   our Governance, Strategy, Risk Management and   the Metrics and Targets we use to adapt to a   changing climate. Sustainable  Innovation Digital   Enablement Circular   Economy Connecting  Australia Overview Future   of Work Equity and   Inclusion 33     |     Climate Action Climate   Action  ===== PAGE 34 ===== Severe weather in   the Kimberley region  Early in 2023 residents in the remote Kimberley region  of Western Australia experienced severe weather  conditions, which resulted in many people evacuating  their homes and losing power due to heavy rain and  flooding. Our people worked to ensure impacted  customers were kept connected during this challenging  time by maintaining network resiliency and offering  additional support.  Despite the flooding, our network services continued  to operate as usual for our customers. We had two  autonomous mobile base stations (SATCATs) ready  for deployment at Lockridge Exchange, along with  a generator and technical support on standby at a  mobile hub site in Broome in case conditions worsened. We also provided impacted customers with additional  support including data boosts, internet assistance  kits, one month access free credit to assist covering  the cost of setting up temporary phone or internet  services, and power banks for use in evacuation  centres in the region. Supporting our customers and community in this  way was a cross-functional and collaborative effort,  bringing to life what we can achieve when we are  united by our challenger spirit, thinking ahead, and  going the extra mile to put our customers first. Eugowra flooding After flooding in Eugowra, NSW Health needed help  providing extra telecommunications coverage to the  local hospital. We deployed three Field Operations  employees to Eugowra to commission our SATCAT  mobile tower to provide coverage during the outage.  Many flood victims were displaced and were staying at  Orange Ex-Services Club. To support these people, we  provided at no cost 15 prepaid devices with $30 SIM  recharge cards included, 50 rechargeable power banks,  50 multi-charger cables, 5 power surge boards for  people to plug into, 25 reusable drink bottles and   50 prepaid $30 SIMs.  In partnership with the local Orange Harvey Norman  and the Optus Business Centre, we also provided 20  wireless modems to local businesses to help keep them  connected. View our SATCAT case study page 33 to  find out more. Case Study (continued)  This provides power authorities with  additional, and much-needed time to  restore services, or to allow Optus to access  a site safely with a portable generator. Optus Mobile Deployment Engineering  Manager, Michael van der Lit shares,  ''The new DR Skids are a  leap forward in terms of  emergency telecommunications  infrastructure. They bring together  in-house engineering innovations  that enable off-grid power,  high-speed deployment, and a  solution that can quickly restore or  provide new coverage to support  customers and communities in the  event of a natural disaster and in  their time of great need.” Sustainable  Innovation Digital   Enablement Circular   Economy Connecting  Australia Overview Future   of Work Equity and   Inclusion 34     |     Climate Action Climate   Action  ===== PAGE 35 ===== Expanded satellite connections  for NSW Emergency Services This year we expanded our partnership with the  New South Wales Telco Authority, by increasing the  reach of the Authority’s current regional network to  provide lifesaving communication solutions for the  state’s emergency services. This partnership ensures  we can keep Australians informed and connected  during state emergencies like bushfires and floods. In line with this, we supplied the Authority with   an additional eight ruggedised Kymeta U8 flat   panel antenna (U8 antennas) to use in times  of state emergencies. This type of antenna is a  portable ‘Comms on the Move’ antenna, which  we provide in a ruggedised case to allow for easy  transport and setup. The U8 antenna will enable the Authority to leverage  the vast Optus satellite footprint to establish  a virtual point-of-presence, supporting critical  communications even when existing infrastructure  is compromised. The antenna is also easy to deploy  with minimal technical expertise required, and it will  primarily support data connectivity for deployable  Cell on Wheels infrastructure. Optus already provides a managed satellite network  to the New South Wales Telco Authority, supporting  the agency in carrying its radio-over-IP traffic, as  well as its 4G traffic, for fixed, transferable and  temporary locations. With the additional Authority  deployments, we are building further on our position  as the largest commercial supplier of Kymeta  antennas in Australia and New Zealand, with a  strong presence in regional Australia to provide  seamless, cost-effective access. ANU Optus Bushfire   Research Centre  Due to Australia’s high risk of bushfire disasters,   Optus partnered with the Australian National  University (ANU) in late 2020 to develop the ANU- Optus Bushfire Research Centre of Excellence. The  Centre was formed under the university’s School of  Engineering, for students majoring in Environment  Studies to participate.  The project is focused on the development of   bushfire management strategies using various  platforms of technology. In FY23, the Centre focused  on projects such as autonomous drones for water  control, evaluation techniques, tower-based camera  video analytics, ground-based IoT (Internet of   Things technology), and an extension of the   drone fire response. This research project will be completed in 2025, and   we will share the Centre’s developments in due course.

We believe that  by replacing, reusing and recycling, we can create  a more sustainable and resilient future for all.  Our Circular Economy strategy is driven by our   three goals: to divert 90% of our waste from landfill;  to reuse and recycle over 90% of our e-waste; and  to use 100% recyclable, reusable or compostable  packaging in our Optus products by FY25. These  targets support SDGs 11 and 12 – ‘Sustainable Cities  and Communities’, and ‘Responsible Consumption and  Production’ – which drives our focus on the broader  global effect of our actions.

This roadmap takes a lifecycle view, which  encompasses the environmental impact of   our products before they reach our stores,   during our operations, and after their useful life.  We are collaborating with Charopy, one of   the five finalists in our Optus Future Makers  program in FY23, to deploy smart bins in the  outdoor spaces of our Sydney Campus.   This collaboration is helping us to eliminate   the contamination of the materials we recover  and support the recycling of valuable materials  from our operations for re-use in the future.   Read more about Charopy on page 53. Simply Cups Simply Cups is Australia’s first coffee cup  recycling program, allowing businesses and  schools to close the loop on coffee cup usage.   We continued running this program at our Sydney  Campus in FY23 and also rolled it out to our  new Adelaide Campus. Since we partnered with  Simply Cups, we have recycled over 63,000 coffee  cups. This is a great way to reduce the amount   of coffee cups ending up in landfill – a direct link   to our 2025 target. Ensuring our packaging   is recoverable We report annually to the Australian Packaging  Covenant Organisation (APCO) and support the  implementation of the Australasian Recycling  Label (ARL) in our products to continue  improving kerbside recovery in Australia.  During FY23, we continued implementing the  actions identified in our Circular Economy  Roadmap for Packaging developed in FY22.  The roadmap highlights key opportunities to  reduce waste and provides actions across our  supply chain streams to minimise the amount  of single-use and non-recyclable packaging used  in Optus products. In FY24 we will continue to  implement our roadmap and, where practical,  update it with new initiatives as identified by  our stakeholders. A critical component of our Circular Economy  strategy is collaborating with our suppliers and  finding ways to design waste out as much as we  can. We have included material requirements  in our contracts, so we continue working with  those suppliers who are taking active steps  towards the elimination of single-use plastic  and supporting the increase of recycled content  in the packaging of their products.

However, the devices we use to  access the internet, such as modems, can have a  significant impact on the environment.  In partnership with Arcadyan and Sagemcom,  the Optus Home Devices team developed Optus’  first environmentally friendly modem, made with  95% recycled plastics. All the modems’ packaging  is single-use plastic free. This is an important  contribution towards our target of using 100%  recyclable, reusable or compostable packaging in  our Optus products by FY25. Jack Shamoon, Optus Associate Director in the  Supplier and Commercial Devices team shares, ''Our modem sustainability strategy  makes Optus Home devices central  to delivering future solutions to help  combat environmental impact. It is one  of the ways we are enabling customers  to reduce and offset emissions to deliver  a more sustainable world.” Creating a more sustainable future is important to  Optus. Our Home Devices team has now embedded  recycled materials and plastic-free requirements  in all ongoing device-sourcing initiatives and  agreements with supplier partners.

Our Donate Your Device  program leverages the impact of our Donate Your Data  program, providing donated devices to Australians in  need to help bridge the digital divide. Find out more  about our Donate Your Device and Donate Your Data  in our Digital Enablement section of this report. MobileMuster As a founding member of MobileMuster, this year  we continued to support the nationwide initiative  to recycle old mobile phones and accessories to  minimise landfill. The industry-wide collaboration and  stewardship scheme allows customers to recycle their  mobile phones at any Optus retail store.  We also continued to encourage our customers  to recycle their old devices by including reply paid  recycling satchels in Optus prepaid mobile bundles.  This makes it easier for our customers to return their  unwanted devices to us to recycle, at the same time  that they are upgrading to a new device. Further, we expanded our in-store recycling program   to include modems, smart watches, smart home  devices and gaming consoles. Customers can now  recycle these electronics with confidence, knowing  that up to 99.3% of the materials in their devices are  recovered through our partners in the supply chain. In  FY23, we received over 26,832 devices, equivalent to  almost 40 tonnes3 of mineral resources saved – a great  effort from our customers.  Case Study: Providing digitised options   to our customers using eSIMs With over 4 million SIM cards ordered by  customers each year, we continue to investigate  how to reduce the amount of plastic used in  our products. Reducing plastic in our SIM cards  not only reduces waste, it can also improve our  customers’ experience. During FY23 we collaborated with our SIM  suppliers to design and launch SIM cards that are  less than half the size of the traditional SIM card.  This has resulted in a 52% reduction of plastic per  unit, which equates to an overall reduction of 10  tonnes of plastic across the year. Steven Small, Optus Strategic Portfolio   Manager shares, ''Our proactive approach to  sustainability best practice in the  Optus SIM space has produced a  plastic reduction result we are   very proud of.” In addition, we continue to offer our customers  the option to use electronic SIMs (eSIMs),  including our wholesale customers who can now  connect to the Optus 4G and 5G network more  quickly and more sustainably. Optus is the first  mobile network provider in Australia to offer  eSIMs to the customers of our Mobile Virtual  Network Operators (MVNOs) partners. This  latest SIM card evolution allows customers to  immediately activate their eSIM by scanning a  QR code. eSIMs also allow customers the option  to have two contact numbers on one device,  which can eliminate the need to carry both a  work phone and a personal phone, and also  reduce device wastage in the longer term.  Ben White, MD of Optus Wholesale,   Satellite and Strategy shares,  ''We are launching eSIMs because  our MVNO partners want to offer  their customers a more simple,  sustainable and convenient way to join  Optus’ strong, nationwide network.  Now, customers of our wholesale  partnerships will have a simple new  way of connecting without needing  to acquire a physical SIM card. It  also provides more Australians with  new ways to make sustainable,  environmentally friendly changes to  their everyday lives.” In FY23 our Optus Wholesale team was named  ‘Best Host Operator’ globally at the 2022 MVNO  World Congress in Berlin. The award recognises  the very best in operational achievements,  innovation, and excellence in the industry around- the-world. We are so proud of this achievement  as we continue to find new ways to serve our  Wholesale customers. 3 The environmental benefits are calculated only for the total of mobile  phone components (handsets, mobile phone batteries and accessories) and  do not include the expanded range of devices collected through the program  such as modems, smart home and landline phones.

Our Digital Enablement  strategy allows us to improve digital inclusion  for those in need and support young people to  be safe and confident online, through our many  initiatives we continued to progress in FY23. Digital   	 Enablement We know that in today’s digitally connected  world, access to technology and digital skills   are critical for education, job opportunities,  business success and staying connected with  friends and family. We have set goals to accelerate digital enablement  for disadvantaged individuals and communities.  By FY25, our Digital Enablement goals are to  “support 550,000 young people to participate safely  online” and to “connect 100,000 disadvantaged  youth and families to help close the digital  divide and support Australians in crisis”. We are dedicated to supporting the next generation  in achieving their potential in this digital era.  The digital divide exacerbates existing social and  economic inequalities which creates a cycle of  disadvantage that can be difficult to break. This is  why we are working towards bridging that digital  divide to ensure everyone has equal access to  the opportunities that digital technologies offer  to all Australians. We are committed to helping  prepare and educate young people to be safe online  and provide them with resources to help them  become confident and resilient online citizens.

This program has been endorsed by the   eSafety Commissioner as a Trusted eSafety Provider.   Through facilitator-led and teacher-led digital  interactive workshops, students learn about the  importance of cybersecurity, digital identity, digital  discernment, digital balance, cyberbullying and  respectful relationships online. In FY23, 80,547 primary and secondary   students participated in a free Digital Thumbprint  workshop. This takes our total student participation  to 552,071, exceeding our target of reaching 550,000  students by FY25. Optus’ commitment to educating  young people and their families about digital safety   is one of our key areas of focus as we continue to  rebuild consumer trust in Australia, and these results  reinforce this commitment.  This year we announced an expansion of the program,  to provide more opportunities for regional Australian  students to learn about digital safety and well-being.  We had 20,122 regional students participate in a  Digital Thumbprint workshop. This expansion also  offers a variety of resources for parents, teachers,   and trusted adults to facilitate conversations with   kids about digital safety and well-being. We also expanded our teacher-led digital interactive  for primary students, launching workshops on ‘Staying  safe on games and apps’ and ‘Keeping my information  private online’ for Years 3 and 4 students, and a  ‘Cyberbullying and respectful relationships’ for   Years 5 and 6.

The program is designed to  support disadvantaged individuals and families in  crisis, providing them with SIMs fuelled with data  that has been donated by Optus and our customers.  Recipients have access to free calls, text and 10 GB  of data provided by Optus, plus an additional 40 GB  through customer donations. In FY23, our Donate Your DataTM program has   provided over 12,007,408 GB of data to those in need.  Since its launch in December 2019, the program has  supported over 38,870 individuals, including 13,497  individuals in FY23. Through our partnerships with  charities such as The Smith Family, Good360 Australia,  and the KARI Foundation, this program provides much- needed internet access to young people, families and  other Australians who might be doing it tough, so they  can access education sites, look for work and connect  to vital services and their loved ones.  The Smith Family's 2022 Evaluation Report shares  some of the impact Optus' Donate Your DataTM  program has on their participant families.   View these key findings on the right.  “I cannot thank Optus and this program  enough everything is so expensive at the  moment and it's very good not to have to  worry if my children can call me when they  need me it's great not to have to worry  about another bill to pay.”  Parent/carer of DYD participant  supported by The Smith Family Donate Your DataTM is one of the most powerful   ways Optus, together with our customers can support  the community in ensuring no one is left behind when  it comes to digital inclusion.

Through our Donate Your  Device program, Optus customers can donate their  spare mobile phone devices to someone in need. Together with our partner Good360 Australia, donated  devices are distributed to disadvantaged individuals  and families who can then use the devices to access  education, employment opportunities or vital services.  This year we saw over 900 devices donated; these  were paired with a Donate Your DataTM SIM. To  participate, customers bring their old device into an  Optus store, where our team refurbishes the device for  donation. We then pair the device with a Donate Your  DataTM SIM so it’s ready for the new owner. This is one  of the most tangible ways our Optus customers can  make a direct impact on someone else’s life.  Within the business, older laptops and monitors   which were previously used by our Optus people   were donated to disadvantaged schools and charities.  Many older, but good quality monitors were unable   to be redistributed within the business, so our  Operations team instead donated 120 monitors   to a selection of charities. Ukraine crisis In response to the war in Ukraine, Optus supported  newly arrived Ukrainians displaced by the war through  the donation of 900 mobile phones, paired with  Donate Your DataTM SIM cards. Optus supported activation events across South  Australia, Queensland, Victoria, and New South Wales  in collaboration with our charity partners Good360  Australia, the Australian Federation of Ukrainian  Organisations (AFUO), Welcoming Australia (SA) and  St Vincent de Paul (Queensland). At these events we  helped to connect newly arrived Aussies with loved ones  and support their access to vital programs and services. Our people collaborated to create this outreach  by volunteering their time at the Ukrainian events,  distributing phones, and activating SIM cards. The Donate Your DataTM and Donate Your Device  programs are both part of Optus’ Living Network,  which play a role in bridging the digital divide  experienced by many Australians in need. Read more  about these initiatives in the Digital Enablement  section of this report.  Digital Inclusion Roundtable In May 2022, Optus held its annual Digital  Inclusion Roundtable: “Empowering vulnerable and  disadvantaged Australians to thrive in the digital  world.” The Roundtables are a critical forum that bring  together the Optus CEO, senior leaders including our  Sustainability team, and our charity partners who are  helping deliver our digital inclusion programs of Donate  Your DataTM and Donate Your Device to those in need.  The session covered topics such as digital literacy, and  the participation for vulnerable cohorts.  Charities shared the positive difference the programs  are making to those experiencing disadvantage,  and insights into vulnerabilities faced by different  cohorts such as First Nations peoples, refugees and  new Australians. Also discussed were opportunities  for charities to work together and share learnings  as a collective; and building digital knowledge and  capabilities within staff and participants.

This year we ran our sixth Optus Future Makers  program, supporting five new social innovators  who have developed solutions to address one  of the following categories: ‘good health and  wellbeing’, ‘environmental sustainability’, and  ‘supporting vulnerable communities’.  This six-month program is open to social innovators  within start-up enterprises, social entrepreneurs  and not-for-profit organisations who are ready to  grow and scale their technology-based minimum  viable product. The program ran face-to-face  workshops with Optus mentors covering go-to- market strategies, product development and pitch  training. At the end of the program, the five Future  Makers program finalists had the opportunity to  pitch for a share in a $200,000 funding pool. An  additional financial bonus of $10,000 for the Yes  Impact People’s Choice was awarded to the finalist  with the most votes on the night. For a summary  of the event, you can view our media release here. Our FY23 Future Makers: 	• Danielle Owen-Whitford (NSW) – Pioneera’s  AI bot ‘Indie’ uses linguistic analysis and  psychology to improve workplace mental  health and well-being. 	• Colin Pudsey (VIC) – SilVR Adventures seeks  to eradicate loneliness and isolation in elderly  adults through meaningful and shared virtual  reality experiences. 	• Fiona Holmstrom (QLD) – STEMPunks TV is a  worldwide online streaming platform for STEM  education aimed at school students. 	• Sarah Conron and Jane Strangward (VIC) –  My Family Unit is a therapeutic intervention  solution providing organisations with a way   of supporting mothers in the workforce. 	• Martin Collings (NSW) – Charopy aims to   solve the problem of out-of-home recycling   bin contamination through its Internet of  Things technology.

One of our FY23 Optus Future  Makers finalists, Charopy, aims to eradicate  recycling bin contamination by limiting the items  that can be disposed of in out-of-home recycling  bins. Since the completion of the Future Makers  program, Optus is partnering with Charopy to pilot  their smart bins at our Optus Sydney Campus.  This will significantly reduce the amount of  contaminated recycling waste from our campus.  This pilot will be rolled out in mid-FY24. StandbyU Foundation We continued our collaboration this year with   our 2017 Optus Future Maker finalist ‘StandbyU’.   We understand that the recent Optus cyberattack  could escalate danger for our customers experiencing  domestic violence, and we wanted to ensure our  customers could access additional help and safety  support if they need it. StandbyU works with people experiencing domestic  violence by providing them with solutions to support  prevention and protection. One of their innovations  is the ‘StandbyU Shield’ – a discrete device that  vulnerable Australians can use to trigger help from  their network of safe people in times when they   are in danger.  Chris Boyle, founder of StandbyU Foundation, also  worked with our people to deliver vulnerable customer  support training with our Customer Response Teams.  The training equips our customer-facing people with  effective responses when a person experiencing  domestic or family violence reaches out to them.  In FY23, 130 Optus people attended these training  sessions, which provided practical resources for our  team on how to support customers in these instances.  Our Customer Response Team has also created a  Domestic Family Violence Playbook, which educates  our people on the considerations and solutions we   can offer customers experiencing domestic or   family violence.

Spreading optimism in Lismore We’re proud to support customers in the moments  that matter, and help communities keep connected.  This year we extended our support to the Lismore  community which was devastated by the NSW   floods, to help them get back on their feet after   such a challenging time. Our connections at Channel 7 Sunrise alerted us to   a group of school children from Blakebrook Public  School in Northern NSW who sadly couldn’t attend  their excursion to Canberra due to the impacts of the  recent flooding in their area. Out of the 18 children in  Years 5 and 6, 14 families had either lost their home   or their job, or both. At Optus, we’re guided by our purpose – to power  optimism with options – so we decided to surprise the  students by donating the $15,000 funding needed so  they could go on their much-wanted excursion, as well  as donating a few extra items to support them, such  as backpacks, sugar glider toys and water bottles. Thanking our First Responders Optus recognises the important contributions that  our veterans and volunteers have made to our local  and national communities. In June 2022, we wanted  to show our support for the extraordinary work that  people in our communities do, so we partnered with  the Australian Retailers Association to celebrate their  First Responders Day in June 2022. We offered eligible consumer and business customers  who are First Responders access to an exclusive offer  of 10% off plan fees for the first 12 months on selected  mobile plans when they sign up or recontract on a new  plan with Optus. This is just one small way we can say  thanks for their service to our communities.

We  continued our partnerships with universities to offer  high-impact, future focused micro-credentials in   areas like Data & Analytics, Customer Experience,  Cyber Security and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Through the Institutes, we have had 1,908 employees  complete various programs, courses and activities  across several strategic capabilities including:   Cloud, Data & Analytics, AI, Cyber Security and 5G. Our people Our people at Optus continue to have access to digital  learning platforms like Percipio, Udemy and Coursera,  where they can access a multitude of courses, books  and audio libraries on a wide range of topics. This  enables flexibility for learners as they can create their  learning pathways and study at their own pace. Optus U is our partnered university academy that  delivers on micro-credentials. Since November 2021,  our Optus U micro-credential program has grown  significantly and in FY23 we had 595 employee  accreditations, bringing us to just under a thousand  Optus people having received accreditations since   the program’s inception.  These learning and development offerings are one   of the many ways we make personal and professional  development accessible for our people.

We believe we have a part to  play today in securing the quality of employees  for the future, which is why we have set the  target of providing “formal future focused skills  development for 1,500 employees” by FY25. A key focus throughout FY23 was the  development of the Tech Talent Incubator  program - an intensive two-year program that  recognises the unique needs and expectations  of our Tech Talent pipeline, but also the  broad spectrum of skills and experiences our  business needs now and in the future.  Optus’ Tech Incubator graduates will bring their  acquired skills, testing and using them in our  rapidly changing environment to develop applied  agility and innovation, as well as broaden their  capability in a professional environment. The Tech Incubator Program is the key to our  Early Careers focus and allows graduates  to develop their skills, invest in their career  paths, and make a real impact within our  business and the broader community. This year, we: 	• Tripled our tech graduate intake, welcoming  a total of 54 new graduates in positions  of Software Engineering, Cyber Security,  Digital and Data & Analytics. This program  includes boot camps, hackathons, seminars  and certification opportunities, as well  as tangible hands-on experience with our  talented team of Optus people. Optus has  committed to hiring 50 tech graduates  again in FY24 and FY25. 	• We began a three-year partnership with   42 Adelaide, an innovative free coding  school disrupting traditional education  models, requiring no prior experience  and pioneering peer-to-peer learning  in Australia. This program is designed  to jumpstart the careers of software  engineers. Through this partnership,   Optus will offer valuable on-the-job  experience to cadets from 42 Adelaide. 	• We have also grown our Winter and  Summer Internship programs and  University Co-Op Scholar program across  the business as we continue to invest in  building a cohort of future leaders. 	• We are proud to have been placed in  the Top 100 GradConnection/Australian  Financial Review Graduate Employers   list, and in the Top 10 for our industry  category this year.

Highlighting the impact of leadership can help   us live our purpose, achieve our vision and foster   a positive behavioural culture.  At Optus, we’ve created a framework called  ‘Leaders At Optus’, to lift our leadership  capacity, strengthen our impact and build better  relationships across the business. This framework  describes the specific role of leaders, four  leadership expectations, and supports our leaders  with success elements, learning experiences and  daily practices. Our Leaders at Optus mantra is  “energise and empower people to  create lasting value for our customers,  our business and each other”. Throughout FY23, there were opportunities for  Optus leaders to engage in learning programs   to enhance their capability, strengthen their  impact, and build collaborative relationships  across the business. The four leadership expectations we have  implemented across the business are to be:   Clear, Connected, Capable and Courageous   (known as ‘The 4Cs’).  	• Clear – cut through complexities and align  priorities to Purpose and Vision 	• Connected – bring people together on the  things that matter 	• Capable – secure the critical skills, talent,  time and resources, to execute great work 	• Courageous – create conditions for  openness, challenge and innovation Optus and LaTrobe   Cyberskills course Through our focus on developing future focused skills,  Optus has been working with LaTrobe University to  increase cyber skills through a range of cyber short  courses. Partnering with other industry partners  such as Quantum Victoria, CISCO, Wiley, GHD,  War on Wasted Talent and Practera, the Cyber  Security Project is designed to increase cybersecurity  capability in the industry, as part of a Commonwealth  Government Cyberskills Grant Fund program.  The Project is split into three streams, focusing on  upskilling high school students, cyber professionals,  and university student placements. High school  students are introduced to cyber concepts and  education, with over 100,000 high school students  having participated in the program. 6,805 industry  professionals have enrolled in the micro-credential  program and 166 industry-based work placements   are open for university students for completion   by the end of FY24.

This year we had 125 Talent Ambassadors, which   is our biggest cohort yet. Our Talent Ambassadors  shared authentic stories about how proud they are   to work at Optus and what their day-to-day job looks  like as part of the team. Through posting on social  media, our Talent Ambassadors have celebrated,  promoted and showcased their careers at Optus  through a united hashtag #OptusLife. The program generated over 1.5 million organic views  from #OptusLife posts, and we saw over 25,000 likes  and 5,000 comments from Ambassador posts. This  exposure has driven engagement in company-driven  content, increasing the Optus LinkedIn page followers  to over 138,000. As part of the Talent Ambassador Program, our people  were given behind-the-scenes views of Optus’ newest  initiatives and were provided with tailored training   and networking opportunities to amplify their personal  brand and social media marketing skills.  Veronica Redman, Optus Talent Ambassador   Program Manager shares,   “This program is proving to be a successful  two-way exchange – our Ambassadors are  standing out from their colleagues and our  Talent Acquisition Team is receiving more  applications from top talent in the market.” As we continue to focus on the future of our workforce,  creating opportunities to elevate our people’s voices  will always remain a priority. Through showcasing their  work, they become proud promoters of our optimistic  team culture, while showcasing Optus as an employer  of choice in the market.

Our team’s diverse  backgrounds, perspectives, skills and life  experiences enable us to develop meaningful  connections with our customers and communities,  innovate new products and services, and make  better-informed business decisions.  Gender equality remains a dedicated focus for  Optus. We continue to strive for gender equality  in the workforce, and this year we retained our  Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WEGA) status.  In FY23 we exceeded our FY25 goal of 25% of  executive roles being held by women, with 27.3%  of roles held at the close of the year. This is just  the beginning for Optus – as we continue to grow  as a business we continue to aim for a greater  proportion of women in leadership positions.  Future focused equity and inclusion strategies are  important to us. Providing employment opportunities  for the next generation of workers will help to set  them up for a favourable working career, which is  why we aim to provide pathways to employment  for 5,000 disadvantaged youth by FY25. As part of our strategy to enhance equity and inclusion  at Optus, we want to drive and demonstrate equity  in all areas of our business and network, including  our supply chains. Modern Slavery is a human rights  issue, and one of the ways we aim to address this is  through regular assessment of operations and supply  chain risks. Our target to have zero human rights  incidents in our operations and with major suppliers  reaffirms our commitment to human rights at Optus.

The program takes an  innovative, positive and proactive approach to inspiring  employees to think about what inclusion means to  them, and our collective role in fostering an inclusive  culture where we all belong. The program combines virtual reality, workshop  activities and powerful conversations with a   virtual reality (VR) experience enabling employees   to metaphorically ‘walk in someone else’s shoes’ to  elicit empathy and enable employees to feel and  experience the world from other perspectives. Since commencing the program, almost 3,000  employees have participated. It has a Net Promoter  Score (NPS) of +74 and a favourability rating of 98%.  These results make this one of the most popular  programs delivered at Optus. Case Study: Diversity   Employee Networks Optus’ Diversity Employee Networks drive engagement  and understanding and create a two-way conversation.  Employee Networks ensure our people have a place to  come together, celebrate who they are, connect with  others, innovate and elevate engagement and inclusion.  Diversity Employee Networks have been established  across five key pillars, each with   an Executive Sponsor:  	• Culture Connect – building greater  understanding and appreciation for the rich  culture and heritage diversity we have at Optus 	• Disability Network – empowering people  living with a disability or caring for those   with disabilities 	• Elevate – for those who champion   and support women in the workplace 	• Express Yourself – nurturing a safe and inclusive  environment for the LGBTQIA+ community 	• United – supporting and uniting veterans,  volunteers and their families who have or  currently serve in the Armed Forces, Police Force  or Emergency Services These Networks aspire to create an inclusive Optus  community that empowers and elevates our people  through meaningful connections and opportunities   to develop, grow and create impact.  To support our investment in early career talent,   Optus also launched a Young Professionals Community  – focused on fostering a supportive and inspiring  community for the next generation of Optus leaders  and game changers.

We  engaged with our partners at the KARI Foundation  to participate in a Cultural Awareness Workshop  on Aboriginality to increase our knowledge and  understanding of Aboriginal people, diversity, and  protocols. KARI also shared a wonderful artefacts  display and held live performances with Eric Avery   at our Optus Sydney Campus.  Our celebration of Reconciliation Week and NAIDOC  Week is just one way we demonstrate our support  for reconciliation and celebrate First Nations  cultures and histories. Our partnership with First  Nations peoples plays an integral role in paying  our respects and working towards reconciliation.  Read more about our Indigenous and First Nations  engagement on pages 57 and 65 of this report. Supporting the   Veteran community Optus is a signatory to a Veteran Employment  Program. As an extension of this commitment,  Optus is a Gold Pledge Partner with Soldier On –   a not-for-profit providing support services to   current and former defence force personnel and  their families. We have also expanded our existing  health insurance partnerships with BUPA, nib and  AIA to now include Navy Health. Our involvement  in these partnerships amplifies our existing  initiatives that drive veteran-friendly recruitment,  transitioning, retention and providing a supportive  workplace culture for all. Celebrating International Day  of People with Disability and  partnering with What Ability Supporting our mission to be Australia’s most loved  everyday brand with lasting customer relationships,  we want to ensure we are accessible and inclusive for  our people, customers and communities. Our Disability  Network formed last year to help empower Optus  people living with or caring for those with a disability. International Day of People with Disability (IDPwD)  was celebrated at Optus this year with employee  engagement events and activities. IDPwD is an  opportunity to challenge the way we think about  disability and continue to enhance our inclusive  workplace practices.  The day involved many diverse activities, including   a wheelchair basketball game hosted by Wheelchair  NSW/ACT, with our amazing people taking up the  challenge to play a game against each other.   We also had a live panel discussion which featured  special guest Ellie Cole, Optus Ambassador and  Paralympian, along with Steve Dresler, former  Parramatta Eels player and founder of What Ability,  and Optus’ own Shantel Sager, Director of Product  Development and Disability Network Deputy Chair.  Other guests included Paralympic Boccia player,   Scott Ellsworth, who our Optus people had the  opportunity to verse in a game or two. We also  welcomed disability support organisations Cerebral  Palsy Alliance and the Australian Network on Disability  (AND), Bus Stop Films and Friendship Bakery to be  part of the day’s festivities.  As part of IDPwD, we announced our sponsorship   of What Ability – an NGO service that specialises   in community access and providing disability   support to Australians.  Case Study:   Executive Women Growing our executive women population  and accelerating the growth and  development of women talent is a key  priority for Optus. Executive Women targets  are set across the organisation and are  embedded into Key Performance Indicators  to drive progress and accountability.  We have an Executive Women in Leadership  program for senior executives to support  this priority. This program involves formal  assessments of potential, coaching,  mentoring, and bespoke learning initiatives  for identified gaps or areas of aspiration.  This year we launched an Emerging  Executive Women Leaders which aims to  bolster our pipeline of women stepping up  into executive roles. In this crucial transition,  the program includes both group learning  and individualised assessments as well   as mentorship.  In alignment with the performance  management framework, there are  dedicated talent and succession discussions  specifically focussed on women in leadership  and talent pipeline. Our Executive hold  annual discussions focussed on top women  talent, their development and mobility  options across the business.

Our Elevate Employee Network led  the celebrations. As part of the event, we hosted a panel discussion  around the ‘Embrace Equity’ theme, which showcased  how we can all play a part in actively seeking out  difference as a necessary and positive enabler to  success. Our panel included four diverse speakers -  Robyn Stubbs (Executive Coach and Mentor at SMG  and ASX200 Board Director, HomeCo Daily), Asifa  Sherazi (Head of Technology, Westpac), Louise Vidal  (CEO & Founder, 42 Schools), and Andrew Buay (Group  Sustainability Vice President, Optus).

Vogue Codes This year, Optus again partnered with Vogue Codes –  an event series that profiles female industry leaders  and technology innovators to Australians through  virtual events, panel discussions, personal profiles and  in-person conferences. Across the year, Optus was  involved in their Vogue Codes Summit, Vogue Codes  Campus, The Visionary Women’s Dinner and Vogue  Trajectory Series. The Vogue Codes Summit is a STEM-focused career  series which featured some of our amazing Optus  talent, including Theresa Eyssens (Optus VP, Customer  Solutions & Cloud), Kate Aitken (Optus VP, People and  Culture), and Belinda Lofts (Optus Senior Director,  Mobile Data Service Engineering). This forum was an  opportunity to encourage women in STEM and provide  a platform for them to have a voice in the competitive  technology industry. Optus also participated in the Vogue Trajectory  Series – a digital content series featured on Vogue, to  highlight the importance of female roles in STEM. Four  of our Optus people participated, showcasing their role  at Optus and their vision for women in STEM.  These opportunities empowered our female employees  who were chosen to speak on important topics and  amplified the voice of women looking to pursue a  career in STEM. In particular, our Group Sustainability  Senior Director, Helen Maisano was featured in the  August edition where she shared the importance and  impact of social and environmental sustainability. Our Employment   Partnership Agreement We’re committed to creating an environment at Optus  that is the right place for the best people to do their  best work. Our Employment Partnership Agreement  (EPA) – approved by the Fair Work Commission – is an  integral part of how we create and foster our workplace  culture and maintain our employee relationships. Our EPA includes several benefits for   our people, including: 	• Connected Day – a day for our people to  connect with the things that they love most,  whether it’s culture, family, health or well-being 	• Blood donation leave – allows employees to  take up to 2 hours of paid leave up to 4 times a  year to donate blood 	• Increased Partner Leave – from 2 weeks to 4  weeks of paid leave 	• Kinship – recognised for employees taking  bereavement and compassionate leave 	• Primary Carer Leave – increased from 12 weeks  to 14 weeks paid leave 	• Gender Affirmation Leave – up to 4 weeks for  employees to dedicate time to transition 	• Emergency Services Leave – enhanced by  providing an additional day of paid leave   to rest and recover 	• Family and Domestic Violence Leave –   provides certainty of 10 days paid leave   a year if required Sustainable  Innovation Digital   Enablement Circular   Economy Climate   Action Connecting  Australia Overview Future   of Work 68     |     Equity and Inclusion Equity and   Inclusion  ===== PAGE 69 ===== Case Study – ABCN Mentoring Optus is committed to empowering the next  generation to reach their full potential. In   line with our company purpose to power optimism  with options, we provide a range of employment  pathways for disadvantaged youth, and one of the  ways we do this is through our Australian Business  and Community Network (ABCN) partnership and  mentoring programs. As a founding member company of ABCN, we  celebrated 17 years of collaboration and investment  into the next generation. We work closely with  ABCN to support students from low socio-economic  backgrounds with the support of our amazing Optus  people who volunteer their time   to mentor these students.  Throughout the 2022 school year, Optus ran over 40  programs in primary and secondary schools across five  states. We had 229 Optus people who were voluntary  mentors, enabling us to reach 897 students in total  across the school year.  Optus people participated in ABCN’s Regional,   Rural and Remote (RRR) programs, now in their   second year. 60 students living in remote areas  participated in this program covering four workshops,  developing the student's confidence,   skills and aspirations.  Optus people also continued to support ABCN’s  ‘Focus’ program. The ‘Focus’ program is designed  to build leadership skills for young women in Years  10-11, teaching them how to set goals and develop a  sense of belief in their potential. During FY23, Optus  implemented five ‘Focus’ program workshops. Some of the impact results included:  “The most important thing I have learnt in  the [ABCN] Accelerate program is – don’t  be afraid to ask. I have been privileged to  work with an amazing mentor who guides  me and provides a comfortable and safe  space to talk.”  Leilani, ABCN student “This is exactly what our students need,  opening their eyes to what’s out there for  them. You can’t be what you can’t see.   For these kids’ experiences like this are   so important.”  Teacher, Western Australia We are grateful to our Optus people who have offered  their support, and for the ABCN students who allow  our people to grow their mentoring skills.

An initiative  developed in collaboration with our community  partners, including ABCN, to empower disadvantaged  students. The program not only enables Optus to tap  into a diverse talent pool, we provide opportunities  for these students to develop employability skills,  gain confidence and experience and potentially  secure employment as a Christmas casual in an  Optus retail store, or the broader retail sector. In FY23, 150 students participated in  eight P2E workshops across Victoria, New  South Wales and Queensland, bringing our  reach to a total of 741 students who have  participated in the program since 2016.  One of the workshops delivered this year was exclusive  to our First Nations scholarship students from the  KARI Foundation. Following their participation,  over 50% of the students involved were able to gain  part-time employment in a retail environment.  76 of our Optus people volunteered to mentor  P2E students this year. As part of the program  the mentors help the students to identify their  strengths and develop non-technical skills required  for their future careers, such as public speaking.  One mentor shared that it’s “inspirational to see the students try   over and over to perfect presentations   and watch their confidence grow.” A teacher from Copperfield College, one of the  participating schools in Victoria shared, “The Optus Pathways 2 Employment  program was fantastic! Our students  greatly benefitted from all the activities,  tips and mock interviews.”  Together with our ABCN program, this initiative  has enabled us to exceed our FY25 target, having  now provided pathways to employment for 5,418  disadvantaged youths.

Optus is dedicated to respecting the  human rights of all people throughout our  operations and supply chains, including  the right to freedom from slavery.  Identifying and managing potential risks related  to modern slavery is fundamental to our people- focused approach as a business. As part of our  Sustainability Strategy, our FY25 goal within  our ‘Equity and Inclusion’ pillar is to have “zero  human rights incidents in our operations and with  major suppliers”. Combating modern slavery also  aligns with one of our priority UN SDGs: ‘Goal 8:  Decent Work and Economic Growth’ (see more on  page 20 – ‘Sustainable Development Goals’).  In FY23 we published our third Modern Slavery  Statement, followed by a human rights risks  assessment to better understand our business  and supply chain risks. The FY23 Optus Modern  Slavery Statement is a consolidated description of  the actions we have taken to address our modern  slavery risks, and is published as a joint Modern  Slavery Statement in accordance with section 14 of  the Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth)(MSA). We have  also undertaken a risk assessment of our major  suppliers, which includes the issuance and assessment  of questionnaires to our suppliers to inform our risk  management response and ongoing training. In FY23, we also undertook a salient human rights  assessment to enhance our understanding of the  areas where we may be at risk of involvement in  human rights harm. In line with the United Nations  Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights  (UNGPs), we define our salient human rights issues  as those areas where the most severe actual or  potential human rights impacts could occur through  Optus’ activities or business relationships. The assessment involved a collaborative, cross- functional consultation process across our business,  including a series of interactive workshops and a  desktop review of relevant Optus materials. As a  result, we identified six salient human rights issues   as outlined below. Our salient   human rights issues Completing the salient human rights assessment has  supported us to deepen our understanding of how  our actions to manage modern slavery risks align  with our broader work to respect all human rights. This year, we updated and expanded our content  for our employee training on modern slavery, to  help empower our people to better understand our  approach to modern slavery and our whistleblower  processes. All people leaders are required to  undertake annual modern slavery training through  online learning modules that we have developed. Optus is committed to providing for, or cooperating  in, remediation where we identify that we have  caused or contributed to human rights harm  such as modern slavery, and during this reporting  period we developed an internal Modern Slavery  Incident Response Plan. This Response Plan  provides us with a framework to help guide our  response to any future modern slavery incident or  allegation and we continued to promote the Optus  Whistleblower Hotline through relevant materials. We have continued to focus on enhancing our  modern slavery response, guided by our Modern  Slavery Action Plan. We will continue to improve  our knowledge and strengthen our actions, through  training, reviewing our current modern slavery  contract clauses focusing on suppliers and countries  with higher modern slavery risks, and exploring  opportunities to work collaboratively with our  suppliers to strengthen knowledge sharing and  capacity building to better manage our shared risks.

Through their Industry Impact hub in conjunction  with members, issues of large social importance are  addressed as an industry, with the current issues being  the reduction of modern slavery in supply chains as  well as the reduction of domestic and family violence. Optus is involved in both streams of work. This year,  along with the CEOs of 17 other telecommunications  companies, Optus signed the Telco Industry Domestic  and Family Violence pledge. One of the commitments  of this pledge is to produce an action plan using the  DFV Action Framework developed in conjunction with  TTF and its members. In conjunction with four other Australian telcos, Optus  is part of an initiative to roll out a software platform,  provided by FRDM (pronounced “Freedom”) and  managed by Telco Together Foundation. The software  allows member companies to identify, address,  segment, manage and report upon potential modern  slavery risks throughout all tiers of their supply chain. Addressing this issue as an industry can have the  greatest impact in reducing the occurrence of modern  slavery by identifying and managing the risk. As well  as this, the other objectives are to reduce duplication  amongst members and reduce supplier fatigue in  answering questionnaires.
