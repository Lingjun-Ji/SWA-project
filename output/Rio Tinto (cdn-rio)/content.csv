In 2024, we laid out the  pathway to a decade of growth, gained clarity on the portfolio, and  ensured we are in excellent financial health even as we execute more  projects worldwide than ever before. Even with more global volatility,  the underlying drivers of population growth, an expanding global middle  class, the push for more localised manufacturing, artificial intelligence,  and the energy transition continue to underpin demand for what we do.  The world needs the copper, aluminium, iron  ore, and minerals we provide; our business  is evolving in line with this demand, recently  with our lithium business and the proposed  acquisition of Arcadium. Our robust results  and capital discipline demonstrate our  ability to grow organically and inorganically,  and to diversify and decarbonise our  business while creating significant  shareholder value. We have a lot of  momentum, and I am confident we can  deliver further value now and in the long  term by following our strategy and  continuing to focus on our 4 key objectives:  to become Best Operator, striving for  impeccable ESG credentials, to excel in  development and to deepen our  social licence.  That said, we are devastated that there  were 5 fatalities in the year, a tragic  reminder of why a relentless focus on safety  is so important in our industry. We are  committed to learning from these fatalities  to improve our processes everywhere.  Our purpose in action As a Board, we have spent a lot of time in  2024 focusing on Rio Tinto’s strategy to  ensure we have the right portfolio of  commodities, clear milestones for success,  and are building capacity to meet the  increasing demand. We have seen this in  action on many site visits. For example, in  March, Ben Wyatt, Dean Dalla Valle and I  visited the Simandou project in Guinea  and witnessed early construction of the  620-kilometre railway. Less than a year on,  we have signed the co-development  agreements, crushed the first iron ore,  built a 275-metre-long bridge, inaugurated  7 new schools and with a workforce of  over 13,000 people, around 81% of whom  are Guinean.  As we build, we are working with  governments, communities and civil society  groups on biodiversity and socioeconomic  development. We are certainly not perfect,  but we are taking the necessary steps to  deepen our social licence. We cannot solve  our biggest challenges alone, and it is  important that our partnerships are  mutually beneficial for all our stakeholders.  A positive workplace culture is also key to  operational performance. So, while there is  still a long way to go, I am encouraged by  the progress we are making on our culture  change journey. Well positioned in an uncertain  landscape We are clearly in a time of significant  geopolitical volatility with conflict, trade  tensions and polarisation at domestic and  international levels. There will be further  volatility in 2025, but we are working on  what is within our control and Rio Tinto is  well-positioned to manage risk. I am  confident we have the right strategy to  meet the many opportunities and navigate  the challenges. Because, ultimately, what we  do is increasingly in demand and will remain  so, despite the hurdles we must deal with  along the way, such as slow permitting. Decarbonisation is core to our strategy.  We have ambitious targets to reduce our  emissions by 50% by 2030 and reach net  zero by 2050, and getting there will be  hard. But we have developed a roadmap  that should enable us to achieve our  targets while reducing energy uncertainty  and improving the underlying economics  for our assets. Our portfolio of  decarbonisation initiatives is focused  on value, giving us confidence that our  investments here are not only better for  the environment, but better for our business  for the long term. Considering the  complexity of the challenges before us,  innovation is becoming an even more  important part of our approach across Rio.  This is being driven by our Chief Innovation  Officer and our strong research and  development team, who are testing future  technologies and considering how we can  scale them competitively. A team effort In 2025, Rio Tinto will continue to focus on  building a culture where everyone feels  safe, respected and empowered, because  that is how an organisation delivers great  performance. We will also continue to forge  partnerships that enable us to grow and  deliver further attractive shareholder  returns. We cannot do this alone, and I  want to thank every one of our partners,  customers, suppliers, investors, governments,  communities and Indigenous Peoples who  supported us in 2024. Above all, I want to  thank our colleagues across the globe who  are helping us to find better ways to  provide the materials the world needs. Dominic Barton  Chair 19 February 2025 Follow Dominic on LinkedIn linkedin.com/in/dominicsbarton Strategic report  Chair’s statement Annual Report 2024 4 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 7 ===== When I look back at 2024, I am proud of the progress our team has  made. The portfolio is evolving, production is growing, and we are  developing our technical skills and getting more disciplined at cost  management as we focus on becoming Best Operator, learn from  building major projects, and advance our decarbonisation agenda. It is in Rio Tinto’s DNA to deliver quality  assets of scale, at the lowest part of the  cost curve, and to find better ways to  provide the materials the world needs. In  2024 we tapped into this DNA to deliver  profitable, stable growth and significant  shareholder value. We are unfolding the  historic strength of Rio Tinto, and this  strength is clear in our financial results. However, we still have much to learn and  improve, including on safety. We are  heartbroken by the loss of our colleagues in  2024, and deeply committed to learning  from every safety event. Evolving our portfolio  We are continuing to align our portfolio with  the commodities where demand growth is  strongest, including lithium, a cornerstone  mineral of the energy transition. At the  Rincon project in Argentina, we went from  greenfield to first lithium in only 32 months,  and we are now expanding the plant. Along  with the proposed acquisition of Arcadium,  Rincon shows our commitment to building a  world-class battery minerals portfolio. Building major projects We are becoming much more skilled as an  organisation at executing projects at scale,  on time and to budget. Simandou has  progressed rapidly and is on track for first  production at mine gate in 2025. At Oyu  Tolgoi, we delivered first ore on the  conveyor to surface in October, and  production at the copper mine is expected  to grow by more than 50% in 2025. In  Canada, we are expanding the use of our  low-carbon AP60 aluminium smelting  technology. And these global teams of  experienced project-building professionals  are capturing and embedding their learnings. Towards Best Operator We are also determined to realise the full  potential of our existing assets, which  means accelerating the drive to become  Best Operator. We made good progress on  this objective in 2024, achieving consistent  iron ore production in the Pilbara, and  reaching nameplate capacity at the Amrun  bauxite mine. Of course, Best Operator is  not only about production but also cost  competitiveness, and we are becoming  more disciplined at managing our costs.  We will move further and faster on this  objective in 2025, and seek to stabilise  assets such as Iron Ore Company of  Canada and Kennecott, which present huge  opportunities to unlock value. As we go  deeper into our sites with the Safe  Production System (SPS), we see how  much potential there is across our assets. Impeccable ESG and social licence  Societal factors heavily influence our ability  to operate, which is why we are continuing  to move the dial on impeccable ESG and  our social licence. Decarbonising our  business is deeply physical and complex,  but we are starting to deliver projects to  reduce emissions while retaining value. We  can only achieve our ambitious targets by  working closely with stakeholders, so I was  encouraged by the agreement with the  Queensland Government to support Boyne  Smelters, and our efforts to secure the  long-term future of the Tiwai Point smelter  in New Zealand. It is up to others to judge  our progress, but I do sense we are  becoming a partner of choice globally. We  can win more hearts and minds by actioning  our purpose, finding better waysTM, that are  more sustainable and are mutually beneficial. Staying the course on culture change Culture is fundamental to how we realise  the full value of our assets. The release of  the Everyday Respect Progress Review in  November was important, helping us  understand where we are on our culture  change journey. It is unacceptable that  colleagues are still experiencing harmful  behaviours, but we are encouraged that  many believe we are heading in the right  direction. We will stay the course, creating a  culture where everyone feels safe,  respected and empowered. Delivering growth while creating value We have considerable momentum heading  into 2025, and all the building blocks for an  incredibly strong, diversified and growing  business. We will continue taking actions  that ensure we remain strong in the short,  medium and long term, while paying  attractive returns to our shareholders. We will have a laser focus on unlocking the  full potential of our assets as we go deeper  with SPS, deliver improved cost  management, and learn from executing  complex projects. We will improve our  culture and safety processes as part of an  accelerated drive to become Best Operator.  This way, we know we can afford to grow,  decarbonise, and build a portfolio of  materials the world needs, positioning us to  be more competitive as we grow. Jakob Stausholm Chief Executive 19 February 2025 Follow Jakob on LinkedIn  linkedin.com/in/jakobstausholm Strategic report   From the Chief Executive Annual Report 2024 5 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 8 ===== Strategic context Our strategy is informed by a deep analysis of the interplay of global megatrends, explored  through the lens of plausible scenarios. These allow us to explore potential futures for our  industry and inform our portfolio decisions. Our success relies on our ability to strengthen  our resilience to changing externalities while building partnerships and capabilities that  enable us to capture emerging opportunities.  Our scenario approach We use global scenarios in our strategy  and capital allocation processes to  stress test our portfolio and investment  decisions under alternative  macroeconomic settings. These are  created collaboratively, using Group- wide expertise to capture important  market-specific trends and insights.  Our scenario framework focuses on 2  prevailing forces: the speed of global  economic growth and the trajectory of  climate action, each heavily influenced  by global geopolitics, governance and  technology. In 2024, we updated our  methodology, replacing our 2 former  core scenarios (Competitive and  Fragmented Leadership) with  Conviction and Resilience scenarios,  which inform our industry and project  evaluations under 2 distinct  macroeconomic settings:  – Conviction Scenario consists of  elements of both our former core  scenarios, envisaging a degree of  industry fragmentation and  increasing government intervention  in key markets, but also significant  progress in the development and  deployment of energy transition  technologies, in part driven by  heightened global competition. – Resilience Scenario represents a  lower-growth world, where prevailing  geopolitical uncertainty and populist  and nationalist movements result in  weaker governance, fragmented  global trade, and less effective  climate action.  Additional scenarios provide sensitivity  analysis. These include our  Aspirational Leadership scenario,  which allows us to explore decisions in  a world that remains on track to limit  the global average temperature rise to  1.5°C (above pre-industrial levels) by  2100. We also test our analysis against  consensus forecasts to explore our  level of conviction against the market  and identify emerging opportunities  and risks. These scenarios allow us to examine  the robustness of our investment  decisions, identify opportunities for  protecting against the downside,  gauge against market conviction and  evaluate areas where we see upside  potential beyond our peers. Policy fragmentation and  climate action In 2024, we continued to see strong  government intervention in the market and  an increasingly fragmented policy  landscape as countries competed to  strengthen their position in key sectors. In  the 2 years since the US Inflation Reduction  Act was signed, tax credits have been  announced for a range of sectors, and  hundreds of billions of dollars of additional  investments have been announced by US  and foreign companies. Other regions have  continued to respond with legislation  designed to accelerate decarbonisation,  bolster local manufacturing and enhance  supply security (such as the recently  announced EU Net Zero Industry Act). While these initiatives have helped support  the energy transition in some ways, such  as by increasing electric vehicle (EV)  production capacity and renewable  projects, the fragmented climate policy  landscape and current economic  uncertainty have hindered global  momentum on decarbonisation. Global CO2  emissions are expected to increase  moderately in 2024, in line with the past  2 years. This is particularly apparent for  sectors that require significant capital to  switch to fossil-fuel alternatives. In 2024,  we have also seen policy support,  particularly in the US, continue to drift away  from climate action and towards sectors  deemed critical to national security, such as  defence, communications and computing. Western reindustrialisation To date, Western reindustrialisation in  processing (smelting and refining) and  manufacturing has been limited due to  strong low-cost international competition  and the widening capital intensity gap with  China, where participants continue to hone  their project development and  technological capabilities. To address these  challenges, Western governments have  adopted increasingly protectionist  approaches to support regional  competitiveness and reduce import  dependencies for strategic sectors.   In 2024, the US announced tariff increases  on a range of Chinese goods, including  semiconductors and solar cells (tariffs  increased from 25% to 50%), EV batteries  (from 7.5% to 25%) and EVs (from 25% to  100%). The EU also announced an increase  in tariffs on imported EVs from a 10% base  rate to up to 45.3% for some Chinese-built  EVs. Importantly, both the US and EU have  increased tariff and safeguard measures to  ensure their remaining processing base in  steel and aluminium smelting is preserved.  This is vital in reducing raw material supply  bottleneck risks.  Access to materials In 2024, we also saw continued heightened  fears around raw material supply  disruptions, triggered by escalating  conflicts and retaliatory trade measures  (ie increased tariffs or export quotas on  critical minerals). In response, governments  and downstream participants in key  demand jurisdictions (the US, EU, China,  Japan and South Korea) have shown an  appetite to partner with metals and mining  companies to secure new sources of  supply. We have seen 3 key approaches: – Reshoring of mining: Governments have  increased subsidy availability and state  support for domestic mining projects to  limit trade exposure risks. However,  attempts to reshore mining have been  limited due to resource quality and  capital constraints and prevailing  permitting challenges, particularly in  developed economies.  – New projects in the “Global South”:  Governments have increased efforts to  forge new bilateral and multi-lateral  partnerships, to help access high-quality  resources in developing economies.  This trend is driving strong competition  for high-quality projects and fuelling  demand for metals and mining partners  that can deliver projects while maintaining  regionally aligned ESG priorities. – Recycling: For governments and original  equipment manufacturers, recycling  provides a potentially low capital, low  risk, and more socially acceptable  pathway to secure additional supply  while continuing to support the global  decarbonisation agenda. While China  has continued to build scrap-processing  capacity and capabilities (including  through the recently established China  Resources Recycling Group),  deindustrialisation, smelter closures  and inadequate collection schemes in  the West have weighed on progress.  To address this, several governments  initiated policies and strategies in 2024,  including Germany’s National Circular  Economy Strategy and the US’s Battery  and Critical Mineral Recycling  Grant Program.

We cannot  solve all the challenges we face alone, and  we value the strength these partnerships  bring in helping us meet our goals. Section 172(1) statement This stakeholder section, together with our  stakeholder pages in the Governance section  (pages 106-108), explains how the Board  takes account of stakeholder interests. These  comprise our “Section 172(1) statement”. Our people  55,0001  Employees across 6 continents  (2023: 55,000) We are building an environment of trust,  where everyone, everywhere feels safe,  respected and empowered to have a good  day, every day. We do this by creating a  safe and inclusive environment for  everyone, by having a common way of  doing what we do everywhere, and living  and leading with our values every day. In  2024, we conducted the Everyday Respect  Progress Review to understand the  progress we have made, and areas we need  to improve, towards a safe, respectful and  inclusive work environment. We launched  our global recognition program, RockStars,  to celebrate colleagues who demonstrate  our values in action, and Inclusive Voices,  our Employee Resource Groups, to amplify  diverse voices throughout Rio Tinto.  Our people survey is one of the tools that  helps us understand how our employees  experience working for us. In our most recent  survey conducted in Q4 2024, our employee  satisfaction rating (eSAT) was 74 points (Q4  2023: 74). For more information see page 78. Communities 27.7% Increase in spend with Indigenous businesses  in Australia  (2024: A$926m, up from A$725m in 2023) Communities are the places and the  people who make up where we live, work  and call home. We work in partnership  with communities to understand how our  activities impact their lives, culture, land and  environment, and how we can help create  better social outcomes such as more jobs  and local procurement. Over the past few years, we have focused  on our own standards of open and  transparent engagement. We are finding  better waysTM to work with communities  and Indigenous Peoples, promoting greater  recognition and inclusion of Indigenous  Peoples in our decision making. We are  targeting for all sites to co-manage  cultural heritage with communities and  knowledge holders by 2027. And for all our  people to complete annual human rights  awareness training as part of our Code of  Conduct learning.  Civil society organisations 20+ CSOs took part in our 2024 roundtables in  Melbourne, London and Montreal, in person One way we can help address the world’s  many complex environmental, social and  governance (ESG) challenges, such as  climate change, human rights violations,  bribery and corruption, is through  collaboration with civil society organisations  (CSOs) and other stakeholders. Our senior  leaders regularly engage with CSOs, and  although our opinions may differ from time  to time, we respect different views, and are  open to constructive, fact-based feedback  and challenge from civil society on our  operations and performance across our  business. Our yearly roundtable discussions  with CSOs in Australia, Europe and North  America are one of the ways we make sure  we are listening to civil society perspectives.  Governments $77bn Paid in taxes and royalties globally over  the past 10 years (2023: $76bn) Governments – national, state and  provincial, and local – are important  stakeholders for our business. They  regulate our operations, are among our  commercial partners, and receive revenue  from our taxes and royalties. Our economic  contribution can be significant for national  budgets and local development priorities,  such as job creation and skills training. We  engage with officials on issues such as how  we explore, mine and process ore;  conditions of land tenure; health, safety and  environment; taxation; intellectual property;  competition and foreign investment; data  privacy; conditions of trade and export; and  infrastructure access. Investors $6.5bn  Total dividends declared to shareholders (2023: $7.1bn) Our investors include pension funds,  global fund managers, bondholders, and  tens of thousands of individuals around the  world, including approximately 36,000  Rio Tinto employees.  It is important that we understand our  investors’ needs and their vision for the  company. We therefore communicate and  engage extensively with them throughout  the year, both in person and through virtual  forums across multiple jurisdictions. In  addition to our annual general meetings in  the UK and Australia, we also held our  2024 Investor Seminar in London, where  our Executive Committee provided an  update on our progress against our  strategy and how we are advancing our  decarbonisation program.  Customers 1,730  Customers across multiple industries  and countries (2023: 1,7702) Our customers’ needs are central to our  operational decision making. We leverage  insights generated from everything we  buy, sell and move around the world.  We collaborate closely with customers  to ensure we deliver products that meet  their specific requirements and help  accelerate their decarbonisation goals.  Where possible, we partner to co-develop  solutions that support our ESG commitments.  To address customer needs for supply chain  traceability, we have expanded the scope of  our START™ sustainability label to cover  copper cathodes, metal powders and salt.  Similar to our aluminium products, we are  now providing ESG metrics associated with  sourcing and producing these materials from  mine to market.  Suppliers  $31bn Spent with suppliers globally in 2024 (2023: $29bn3) By improving how, and what, we buy we are  able to support our assets to become Best  Operator. This means reducing costs and  improving transactional efficiency while  improving the quality of what we purchase.  As part of this approach, we partner with  local and Indigenous businesses where  possible. This supports our efforts to have a  positive impact where we operate, so that  we help to create stronger communities that  support our operations, while giving them  the opportunity to share in our success. Working in partnership with our suppliers  helps us to advance our day-to-day  operations to ensure we are delivering  solutions that best support our product  groups. These strong relationships will also  allow us to decarbonise our business faster.  We work hard to build trusted relationships  with our suppliers that align with our values  and strategic objectives.  1.

Strategic report   Annual Report 2024 9 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 12 ===== Progressing our 4 objectives Becoming Best Operator What we are focusing on – Eliminating fatalities, preventing catastrophic events and  reducing injuries. – Executing our strategy to deliver attractive shareholder returns  and build a stronger, more diversified, and growing business. – Safely and sustainably realising the full value of our assets,  through our Safe Production System (SPS). In 2024 Safety – Our all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) was 0.37 in 2024 (consistent  with 0.37 in 2023).  – Tragically, there were 5 fatalities in our business in 2024, and we  continue to see serious events where people are exposed to  potential fatal incidents. Operational performance Our overall operating performance improved, and we delivered 1%  production growth and a 3% increase in sales volumes, both on a  copper equivalent basis (based on long-term consensus pricing). – Some assets continued to face challenges, particularly Iron Ore  Company of Canada, Kennecott and Rio Tinto Iron & Titanium. At the end of 2024, we had commenced deployment of SPS at 31 (80%)  of our sites. These sites account for over 95% of the production uplift  opportunity identified: – At our Pilbara iron ore operations, we achieved our SPS target  of 5 million tonnes, and Gudai-Darri reached 50Mtpa rates. – 6% year-on-year increase in good anodes produced at  Kennecott (excluding shutdowns and 2023 furnace rebuild). – Record annual production at Amrun. Our priorities for the future Safety – Continuing to support contractor safety, further integrating  contractors into our safety culture and learning from them.  – Continuing to strengthen our safety control framework to align  with our evolving risk profile. – Improving the governance of our aviation safety and  assurance programs. – Further evolving our safety maturity model. Operational performance – Continuing to strengthen the business as we execute our  strategy to deliver profitable growth. – Driving further consistency across our global operations.

Our priorities for the future – We will carry on exploring new approaches, technologies, renewable  energy and partnership opportunities. Our aim is to discover,  progress and develop high-quality projects supporting future  growth through the cycle, in close consultation with communities. – In 2025, we will invest in new partnerships with Chinese suppliers to  trial new construction methods, innovations and technologies –  including artificial intelligence – to develop orebodies faster and  reduce our capital intensity.  – We will manage our pipeline of opportunities to deliver high- quality growth options, focusing on materials needed in a  decarbonising world, including: • delivering first ore at Simandou in line with our 2025 plan • optimising the next tranche of replacement mines in the Pilbara • completing the Western Range project in the Pilbara • managing key closure projects at Argyle, Gove and Ranger • beginning operations at the Rincon starter plant, and beginning  construction of the Rincon expansion plant  • completing the acquisition of Arcadium Lithium and  integrating Arcadium Lithium’s pipeline of development  projects, subject to acquisition completion. – We will continue building our teams’ capabilities needed to  achieve these. Strengthening our social licence Strengthening our social licence underpins each of our objectives,  and our ability to operate.  Our social licence is the extent to which we have the acceptance, support, and trust of multiple  categories of stakeholders in countries that are most relevant to us. These stakeholders include  our workforce, the communities in which we operate, civil society organisations, governments,  investors, customers and suppliers.  For more on who our stakeholders are, what is important  to them, and how we engage and partner, see page 9,  and pages 106-108.

Strategic report  |  Progressing our 4 objectives Annual Report 2024 11 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 14 ===== Key performance indicators We use a range of financial and non-financial metrics to measure Group performance against our 4 objectives: to be Best Operator; to strive  for impeccable ESG credentials; to excel in development; and to strengthen our social licence. Alignment to our 4 objectives and associated risks key l Best Operator l Impeccable ESG  l Excel in Development l Social Licence All-injury frequency rate  (AIFR) per 200,000 hours worked   0.37 0.40 0.40 0.37 0.37 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 ll Definition We define AIFR as the number of injuries  per 200,000 hours worked by employees  and contractors at our managed  operations. It includes medical treatment  cases, restricted workday, lost-day injuries,  and fatal injuries. Relevance to strategy  The health, safety and wellbeing of our  employees and contractors is at the heart  of everything we do. We are committed to a safe work  environment by focusing on eliminating  fatalities, preventing catastrophic events,  and reducing injuries. To support this, we  continue to implement and embed key  programs, including our safety maturity  model (SMM), critical risk management  (CRM), and the Safe Production System  (SPS) - all of which help us to build a  physically and psychologically safe and  healthy workplace, built on trust,  transparency and collaboration. We also continue to share lessons and  strengthen our partnerships with industry  and associated committees, contracting  partners and local communities to improve  health, safety and wellbeing outcomes. Link to executive remuneration AIFR and SMM are included as performance  metrics in the safety component of the short- term incentive plan (STIP) (see pages 130-133). Our performance in 2024 and  forward plan Our AIFR remained at 0.37 in 2024,  consistent with 2023 (2023: 0.37). However,  tragically, there were 5 fatalities in our  business. We remain deeply committed to  learning from these events, while also  continuing to renew our focus on our CRM  program and further evolving our approach  to SMM across our business.  Total shareholder return  (TSR)¹ measured over the preceding 5 years  (using annual average share price) 110.1% 263.3% 134.3% 103.4% 79.8% 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 llll Definition TSR is a combination of share price  appreciation (using annual average share  price) and dividends paid and reinvested to  show the total return to the shareholder  over the preceding 5 years. Relevance to strategy  Our strategy aims to maximise shareholder  returns through the commodity cycle, and  TSR is a direct measure of that. Link to executive remuneration TSR is reflected in the long-term incentive plan  (LTIP), measured against a mining-based index  (the EMIX Global Mining Index historically and  from 1 August 2023 the S&P Global Mining  Index) and a broader-based index of large  global corporates (the MSCI World Index)  (see page 134). Our performance in 2024 and  forward plan  TSR performance over the 5-year period  was driven principally by movements in  commodity prices and changes in the  global macro environment. Rio Tinto  outperformed the EMIX/S&P Global Mining  Index and marginally underperformed  against the MSCI World Index over the  5-year period. We will continue to focus on generating free  cash flow from our operations. This allows  us to return cash to shareholders (short- term returns) while investing in the business  (long-term returns). Underlying return on capital  employed (ROCE) % 27% 44% 25% 20% 18% 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 ll Definition Underlying ROCE is a non-IFRS measure  defined as underlying earnings excluding  net interest divided by average capital  employed (operating assets). For more  information and a reconciliation of  underlying ROCE to the nearest  comparable IFRS measure, see Alternative  Performance Measures (pages 269-273).  Relevance to strategy  Our portfolio of low-cost, long-life assets  delivers attractive returns throughout the  cycle and has been reshaped significantly in  recent years. Underlying ROCE measures  how efficiently we generate profits from  investment in our portfolio of assets. Link to executive remuneration In the near term, underlying ROCE is  influenced by underlying EBITDA, which is  included in the STIP. Underlying earnings as  a component of ROCE influences TSR,  which is included in the LTIP (see page 134). Our performance in 2024 and  forward plan Underlying ROCE decreased by 2  percentage points to 18% in 2024,  reflecting a decrease in underlying earnings,  principally due to lower iron ore prices,  combined with an increase in operating  assets due to capital expenditure on key  growth projects and maintaining our  operating capacity. We remain focused on delivering our  strategy to generate attractive shareholder  returns over the long term as we diversify  our growing business and invest with  confidence in the long-term demand for  materials crucial to the global energy  transition.  1. The TSR calculation for each period is based on the change in the calendar-year average share prices for Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited over the preceding 5 years. This is consistent with  the methodology used for calculating the vesting outcomes for Performance Share Awards (PSA). The data presented in this chart accounts for the dual corporate structure of Rio Tinto.

Underlying earnings represents net earnings  attributable to the owners of Rio Tinto,  adjusted to exclude items that do not reflect  the underlying performance of the Group’s  operations. For more information on these  exclusions and a reconciliation to the nearest  IFRS measures, refer to Alternative  Performance Measures (pages 269-273). Underlying EBITDA is a segmental  performance measure and represents profit  before taxation, net finance items,  depreciation and amortisation, and adjusted  for exclusions. Exclusions from underlying  EBITDA and a reconciliation to the nearest  IFRS measures can be found in note 1. Relevance to strategy  These financial KPIs measure how well we  are managing costs, increasing productivity  and generating the most revenue from each  of our assets. Link to executive remuneration Underlying EBITDA is reflected in the STIP.  In the longer term, both measures influence  TSR, which is the primary measure for the  LTIP (see pages 130-134). Our performance in 2024 and  forward plan Underlying earnings of $10.9 billion were  $0.9 billion lower than in 2023. Underlying  EBITDA of $23.3 billion was $0.6 billion  lower than in 2023. The 2% decrease in  underlying EBITDA was primarily due to  lower iron ore prices, partly offset by higher  prices for copper and aluminium, higher  copper volumes and lower market-linked  costs.  We remain disciplined and focused on  managing costs across our portfolio as we  continue to generate consistent margins  and maintain attractive shareholder returns. Net cash generated from  operating activities $ millions 15,875 25,345 16,134 15,160 15,599 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 l Definition This KPI refers to cash generated by our  operations after tax and interest, including  dividends received from equity accounted  units and dividends paid to non-controlling  interests in subsidiaries. Relevance to strategy  This KPI measures our ability to convert  underlying earnings into cash. Link to executive remuneration Net cash generated from operating  activities influences the free cash flow  measure included in the STIP. In the longer  term, the measure influences TSR, which is  included in the LTIP (see pages 130-134). Our performance in 2024 and  forward plan Net cash generated from operating  activities of $15.6 billion was 3% higher than  2023. This was driven by improved working  capital management and higher dividends  from Escondida, partly offset by the impact  of a lower iron ore price. We remain focused on our consistent cash  flow generation as we execute our strategy  to deliver organic growth through our major  projects, while continuing to drive for  efficiencies across our existing assets. Free cash flow $ millions 9,407 17,664 9,010 7,657 5,553 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 ll Definition Free cash flow is a non-IFRS measure  defined as net cash generated from  operating activities minus purchases of  property, plant and equipment, intangibles,  and payments of lease principal, plus  proceeds from the sale of property, plant  and equipment, and intangible assets. For  more information and a reconciliation of  free cash flow to the nearest comparable  IFRS measure, see Alternative Performance  Measures (pages 269-273). Relevance to strategy  This KPI measures the net cash returned by  the business after the expenditure of  sustaining and growth capital. This cash can  be used for shareholder returns, reducing  debt and other investment. Link to executive remuneration Free cash flow is included in the STIP. In the  longer term, the measure influences TSR,  which is included in the LTIP (see pages  130-134). Our performance in 2024 and  forward plan Free cash flow decreased by $2.1 billion to  $5.6 billion in 2024, primarily due to  increased capital expenditure as we ramp  up several major growth projects, slightly  offset by increased net cash generated  from operating activities.  We remain focused on our consistent cash  flow generation as we execute our strategy  to deliver organic growth through our major  projects, while continuing to drive for  efficiencies across our existing assets.

For more information and a reconciliation of  net (debt)/cash to the nearest comparable  IFRS measure, see Alternative Performance  Measures (pages 269-273). Relevance to strategy  This KPI measures how we are managing  our balance sheet and capital structure.  A strong balance sheet gives us the  flexibility to take advantage  of opportunities as they arise and return  cash to shareholders. Link to executive remuneration Net (debt)/cash is, in part, an outcome of  free cash flow, which itself is reflected in the  STIP. In the longer term, net (debt)/cash  influences TSR, which is reflected in the  LTIP (see pages 130-134). Our performance in 2024 and  forward plan Net debt increased by $1.3 billion to  $5.5 billion. This was largely the result of  free cash flow of $5.6 billion, offset by  dividends of $7.0 billion. We remain focused on our consistent cash  flow generation as we execute our strategy  to deliver organic growth through our major  projects, while continuing to drive for  efficiencies across our existing assets. Gross Scope 1 and 2  greenhouse gas emissions (adjusted equity Mt CO2e) 35.2 34.7 34.0 33.9 30.7 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 lll Definition We measure our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse  gas emissions on an equity basis. It includes  the equity share of Scope 1 and 2 emissions  from managed and non-managed  operations expressed in million metric  tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. Relevance to strategy  Climate risks and opportunities have formed  part of our strategic thinking and investment  decisions for over 2 decades. The low-carbon  transition is at the heart of our business  strategy. We focus on growing production in  the materials that enable the transition,  decarbonising our operations and partnering  with our customers and suppliers to  decarbonise our value chains.  Link to executive remuneration Climate change is included in our ESG  metrics for executive remuneration with a  weighting of 10% of the STIP (see page  130). We also have a decarbonisation  measure as part of our LTIP with a 20%  weighting. See pages 133-136 for further  information.  Our performance in 2024 and  forward plan Our adjusted gross Scope 1 and 2  emissions were 30.7Mt CO2e in 2024, which  is 14% below our 2018 baseline of 35.7Mt  CO2e. In 2024 we made significant progress  and reduced our emissions by 3.2Mt CO2e.  This has primarily been achieved by new  renewable energy contracts, including the  limited use of unbundled renewable energy  certificates in locations where new  generating assets are under development  or where power purchase agreements have  been agreed. In addition we have made commitments to  projects that are expected to deliver  abatement of around 3.6Mt per year in  future periods mostly through renewable  electricity and biofuels. In addition,  imminent investment decisions could deliver  further abatement by 2030 and include new  energy solutions at BSL and fuel-switching  and electrification in the Queensland  Alumina Limited (QAL) and Yarwun  alumina refineries.

Relevance to strategy  Our sustained performance and growth rely  on having workforce diversity that is  representative of the communities in which  we operate and having a workplace where  people are valued for who they are and  encouraged to contribute to their  full potential. Link to executive remuneration In 2024, our target was to have 25.8% of  our workforce represented by women. This  aspiration was included as a measure in our  Group STIP scorecard with a 5% weighting.  For more information see pages 130-133. Our performance in 2024 and  forward plan The representation of women at Rio Tinto  increased from 24.3% in 2023 to 25.2% in  2024, which is short of our target of 25.8%.  We saw improvements across all levels of  the organisation, with senior leaders  increasing from 30.1% to 32.0%, and  operations and general support increasing  from 17.7% to 18.9%.  Our target to increase the proportion  of women in our workforce year-on-year  gives us continued focus on both the  attractiveness of Rio Tinto to women and  the environment they work in.  We continue to work to strengthen our  applicant pipeline of women by partnering  with external sector groups and local  technical colleges, universities and  communities, and building awareness of  both Rio Tinto and the mining sector to  encourage more women to apply for vacant  roles and join us. We are working to more  deeply understand the drivers of attrition of  women across the organisation. 1. In 2020, we updated our definition of our total  workforce to include those employees who were  unavailable for work (eg on parental leave) and  temporary contractors. Note: less than 1% of the  workforce gender is undeclared. 2. Baseline reset with definition for 2020 to 2024  gender diversity.    Strategic report  |  Key performance indicators  Annual Report 2024 14 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 17 ===== Chief Financial Officer’s statement The consistency of our earnings and cash flows gives us confidence  in our ability to invest in disciplined growth while remaining true to  our shareholder returns policy and retaining a strong balance sheet. Strategy execution delivering strong,  consistent earnings and cash flows 2024 was another year of successful  execution, with our total copper equivalent  production increasing by more than 1% over  2023, on a copper equivalent basis (based  on long-term consensus pricing). This  reflected the ramp-up of the Oyu Tolgoi  underground copper mine and further  deployment of our Safe Production System.  We have prioritised our Best Operator focus  on operations that generate the most cash,  with particular success at our Pilbara iron ore  business and increased operational stability  at our Aluminium operations, including record  bauxite production at Amrun and Gove. We  remain focused on our cost competitiveness  while intensifying efforts to address system  bottlenecks and strategic challenges at  underperforming assets. For 2024, we are reporting net cash  generated from operating activities of  $15.6 billion, underlying earnings of  $10.9 billion and profit after tax attributable  to owners of Rio Tinto of $11.6 billion.  We ended the year with net debt of  $5.5 billion, which is modest relative to  recent history. This balance sheet strength  enables us to run our business consistently  and maintain investment through the cycle,  offering resilience and creating optionality,  such as our proposed acquisition of  Arcadium. We have chosen not to have a  net debt target, but have a principles-based  approach to anchor the balance sheet  around a single A credit rating. We are intensifying our focus on becoming  Best Operator and how we are delivering  profitable growth from major projects. We are  derisking our assets through disciplined  execution of our decarbonisation program,  finding ways to lower capital intensity and  increase overall returns. These actions are  creating significant value, enhancing our cash  flows and supporting consistent capital  allocation and balance sheet strength. Consistent and disciplined capital  allocation We will continue to allocate the capital  generated by our operations with discipline  and remain committed to attractive  shareholder returns. We have consistently  applied our financial framework, which has  been in place for more than a decade. It is  straightforward and serves us well,  underpinned by our three priorities. Essential  capital expenditure remains the first priority -  sustaining capex to ensure the integrity of  our assets, high-returning replacement  projects and investment for decarbonisation.  The second priority is the ordinary dividend  within our well-established returns policy,  where we now have a nine-year track record  of paying out consistently at the top end of  the policy range at 60% of underlying  earnings. The third involves testing  investment in compelling growth against debt  management and further cash returns to  shareholders. In 2024, our share of capital investment  rose to $9.5 billion, driven by increased  investment in replacement projects,  including Western Range in the Pilbara and  AP60 in Quebec, and the accelerating  development of the Simandou iron ore  project in Guinea. We believe that  Simandou's high-grade, high-quality  product will position us well for the  decarbonisation of the steel industry. It is  critical to ensure we have the right,  diversified portfolio to keep creating value  for decades to come, so we can benefit  from increased demand from both  traditional sources and from the energy  transition. We spent $0.9 billion on  exploration and evaluation, with greenfield  projects mainly focused on copper and  lithium, while evaluation prioritised projects  with near-term investment decisions.  We remain very committed to our capital  framework including our dividend policy  and practice. Our financial strength means  that we can reinvest for growth, accelerate  our decarbonisation and continue to pay  attractive dividends through the cycle.  For  2024, we are returning 60% of underlying  earnings to shareholders, which equates to  a full-year ordinary dividend of 402 US  cents per share, or $6.5 billion.  Robust financial health as  investments support future cash  flows Our existing business is generating strong  cash flows, which will be enhanced by the  delivery of our growth projects.  Our strategy is about growing in the  materials the world needs. This will ensure  Rio Tinto remains strong in the short,  medium and long term with the ability to  invest for the long term while also paying  attractive returns.

This financial performance indicator is a non-IFRS (as defined below) measure which is reconciled to directly comparable IFRS financial measures (non-IFRS measures). It is used internally by  management to assess the performance of the business and is therefore considered relevant to readers of this document. It is presented here to give more clarity around the underlying  business performance of the Group’s operations. For more information on our use of non-IFRS financial measures in this report, see the section entitled “Alternative performance  measures” (APMs) and the detailed reconciliations on pages 269 to 273. Our financial results are prepared in accordance with IFRS — see page 154 for further information. Financial performance Income Statement  Net earnings and underlying earnings refer to amounts attributable  to the owners of Rio Tinto. The net profit attributable to the owners  of Rio Tinto in 2024 was $11.6 billion (2023: $10.1 billion). Financial strength through greater diversification To provide additional insight into the performance of our business,  we report underlying EBITDA and underlying earnings. Underlying  EBITDA and underlying earnings are non-IFRS measures. For  definitions and a detailed reconciliation of underlying EBITDA and  underlying earnings to the nearest IFRS measures, see pages 168  and 270, respectively. The principal factors explaining the movements in underlying  EBITDA are set out in this table. US$bn 2023 underlying EBITDA   23.9  Prices   (1.6)  Exchange rates   0.3  Volumes and mix   0.2  General inflation (including net impact on provisions)   (0.6)  Energy    0.2  Operating cash unit costs    0.6  Exploration and evaluation expenditure (net of profit from  disposal of interests in undeveloped projects)   0.3  Non-cash costs/other   0.1  Change in underlying EBITDA   (0.6)  2024 underlying EBITDA   23.3  Financial figures are rounded to the nearest $100 million, hence small differences may  result in the totals.   In 2024, we started to see the benefits of our diversified portfolio and  operational improvements. Higher prices for copper, bauxite and  aluminium together with rising copper and bauxite volumes, and our  focus on cost discipline helped to offset much of the impact of the  iron ore price decline, leading to underlying EBITDA of $23.3 billion. Lower iron ore price partly offset by stronger copper,  bauxite and aluminium Movements in commodity prices resulted in a $1.6 billion decline in  underlying EBITDA compared with 2023, reflecting the impact of a  lower iron ore price, which was partly offset by higher prices for  bauxite and LME copper and aluminium.  We have included a table of prices and exchange rates on page  330. The monthly average Platts index for 62% iron fines converted to a  Free on Board (FOB) basis was 11% lower, on average, compared  with 2023. Average LME prices for copper and aluminium were both 8% higher,  the bauxite index was 26% higher and the gold price was 23%  higher compared with 2023.  The Midwest premium duty paid for aluminium in the US declined by  17% to $427 per tonne. Strategic report   Annual Report 2024 16 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 19 ===== Marginal benefit from weaker local currencies Compared with 2023, on average, the US dollar strengthened by 1%  against the Australian and Canadian dollars. Currency movements  increased underlying EBITDA by $0.3 billion relative to 2023. Rising copper volumes A 3% rise in copper equivalent sales volumes led to a $0.2 billion  increase in underlying EBITDA. This was underpinned by 25% higher  copper sales volumes, along with increases in gold, driven by the  steady ramp-up of the Oyu Tolgoi underground mine and higher  copper grades at Escondida, which, together with a 7% rise in  bauxite volumes, offset the impact of 1% lower iron ore shipments  from the Pilbara.  Impact of inflation partly offset by lower energy  prices The impact of inflation on our cost base lowered underlying EBITDA  by $0.6 billion. The easing of diesel prices and lower prices for  natural gas partly offset this, with a favourable impact to underlying  EBITDA of $0.2 billion.  Lower market-linked raw material prices, in particular  for aluminium and alumina We remain focused on cost control, in particular maintaining  discipline on fixed costs. Overall, lower operating cash unit costs  benefited underlying EBITDA by $0.6 billion. This was driven by  lower unit costs in Aluminium from the easing of market-linked raw  materials prices, such as caustic, coke and pitch, in conjunction with  higher bauxite volumes. Higher Copper volumes led to greater cost  efficiencies, where we saw a 27% reduction in Copper C1 net unit  costs. Partially offsetting these were slightly lower volumes in the  Pilbara and Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC), along with  diamonds and titanium dioxide feedstocks as these businesses  managed through weaker markets, leading to fixed cost  inefficiencies. Continued investment in exploration and evaluation  Our ongoing exploration and evaluation expenditure was $0.9  billion, compared with $1.4 billion in 2023. The decrease was mainly  attributable to the capitalisation of exploration and evaluation  expenditure for Simandou from October 2023. 2023 also included a  gain on disposal of 55% of our interest in the La Granja copper  project in Peru ($0.2 billion, pre-tax).  Net earnings The principal factors explaining the movements in underlying earnings and net earnings are set out below. US$bn 2023 net earnings   10.1  Changes in underlying EBITDA (see above)   (0.6)  Increase in depreciation and amortisation (pre-tax) in underlying earnings   (0.8)  Decrease in interest and finance items (pre-tax) in underlying earnings   0.3  Decrease in tax on underlying earnings   0.5  Increase in underlying earnings attributable to outside interests   (0.3)  Total changes in underlying earnings   (0.9)  Changes in items excluded from underlying earnings (see below)   2.4  Movement in impairment charges net of reversals   0.1  Movement from consolidation and disposal of interests in businesses   0.9  Movement in closure estimates (non-operating and fully impaired sites)   1.0  Movement in exchange differences and gains/losses on derivatives   0.5  Other   (0.1)  2024 net earnings   11.6  Financial figures are rounded to the nearest $100 million, hence small differences may result in the totals.   Increase in depreciation Higher depreciation was due to an increase in capital expenditure in  prior years, production growth at Kennecott and lower capitalised  depreciation, which resulted in underlying earnings being $0.8  billion lower than 2023. Modest decrease in tax on underlying earnings The effective tax rate on underlying earnings of 28% (2023: 30%)  primarily reflects the mix of profits across different jurisdictions.  This, coupled with lower profits, resulted in tax on underlying  earnings being $0.5 billion lower than 2023. Increase in underlying earnings attributable to  outside interests In 2024, expenditure at Simandou was capitalised whereas until  September 2023 it was expensed, resulting in a year-on-year  decrease in costs attributable to outside interests following the  capitalisation. Strategic report  |  Financial review  Annual Report 2024 17 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 20 ===== Items excluded from underlying earnings The differences between underlying earnings and net earnings are set out in this table (all numbers are after tax and exclude amounts  attributable to non-controlling interests).   2024   2023  Year ended 31 December US$bn US$bn Underlying earnings   10.9   11.8  Items excluded from underlying earnings Net gains on consolidation and disposal of interests in businesses   0.9   –  Impairment charges net of reversals   (0.5)   (0.7)  Foreign exchange and derivative gains/(losses) on net debt and intragroup balances and derivatives not qualifying for  hedge accounting   0.2   (0.3)  Change in closure estimates (non-operating and fully impaired sites)   (0.1)   (1.1)  Other   0.2   0.4  Total items excluded from underlying earnings 0.7   (1.7)  Net earnings 11.6 10.1 Financial figures are rounded to the nearest $100 million, hence small differences may result in the totals.  On page 270 there is a detailed reconciliation from net earnings to underlying earnings, including pre-tax amounts and additional  explanatory notes. The differences between profit after tax and underlying EBITDA are set out in the table on page 168. Net gains on consolidation and disposal of interests in businesses of $0.9 billion primarily related to a gain following the increase in  ownership of Tiwai Point Smelter (NZAS), New Zealand, the sale of Sweetwater, a former uranium legacy site in Wyoming, United States, and  the sale of Dampier Salt’s Lake MacLeod operation in Western Australia.  We recognised impairment charges net of reversals of $0.5 billion (after tax), mainly related to our alumina refineries in Queensland: a review  was triggered by studies for the double digestion project indicating increased capital costs. In 2023, we recognised impairment charges net  of reversals of $0.7 billion (after tax), also mainly related to our alumina refineries. The full analysis is set out in note 4 to the consolidated  financial statements.  Foreign exchange and derivative gains were $0.2 billion in 2024 compared to a loss of $0.3 billion in 2023. Exchange losses are largely  offset by currency translation gains recognised in equity and vice-versa. The quantum of US dollar debt is largely unaffected and we will  repay it from US dollar sales receipts. In 2023, we excluded $1.1 billion of closure cost charges from underlying earnings, of which $850 million related to the closure update  announced by Energy Resources of Australia (ERA) on 12 December 2023. This was considered material and was therefore aggregated with  other closure study updates in the second half of 2023 which were similar in nature. These other updates were at legacy sites and at the  Yarwun alumina refinery, which was expensed due to the impairment earlier in the year. Net earnings and underlying earnings refer to amounts attributable to the owners of Rio Tinto.

For more information on our use  of non-IFRS financial measures in this report, see the section entitled ''Alternative performance measures'' (APMs) and the detailed reconciliations on pages 269 to 273. Simandou iron ore project We commenced capitalising qualifying costs attributable to the Simandou project in Guinea from the fourth quarter of 2023. In 2023, we  expensed $0.5 billion.  Central and other costs Pre-tax central pension costs, share-based payments, insurance and derivatives were a $0.2 billion credit, mainly associated with the  premiums paid by the business to our Captive insurers. This was largely unchanged from 2023: although there was an insurance charge  relating to the Captive's payout of the process safety incidents at Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium (RTIT) and the forest fires at IOC in 2024, this  movement was offset by unrealised derivative gains recognised in 2024 (unrealised loss in 2023). On a pre-tax basis, restructuring, project and one-off central costs increased modestly as we continue to drive productivity by investing in group-wide  projects. Other central costs of $0.8 billion(pre-tax) decreased by 18% compared to 2023, reflecting lower costs across a number of our functions  together with higher central recoveries.  On an underlying earnings basis, net interest was a credit of $0.4 billion (2023: credit of $0.3 billion) with the variance between the two years  being additional costs associated with the refinancing of Oyu Tolgoi in 2023. Sustained investment in greenfield exploration We have a strong portfolio of greenfield exploration projects in early exploration and studies stages, with activity in 17 countries across eight  commodities. This is reflected in our pre-tax central spend of $0.2 billion. The bulk of this expenditure was focused on copper in Angola,  Australia, Chile, Colombia, Kazakhstan, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the US and Zambia, nickel in Australia, Brazil, Canada and Finland, lithium in  Australia, Brazil, Canada, Finland, Rwanda and the US, potash in Canada, diamonds in Angola, heavy mineral sands in South Africa  and  rutile-graphite in Malawi. The Rio Tinto operated Nuevo Cobre joint venture copper project in Chile continues to make good progress with  permitting advancing alongside ongoing geological field programs.

This was driven by favourable working capital movements (+$0.1 billion in 2024; -$0.9 billion in  2023), along with higher dividends from Escondida ($1.0 billion in 2024; $0.6 billion in 2023). We managed our inventory levels down in  2024 to a more optimised level, which included processing concentrate at Kennecott following the smelter rebuild in 2023. – Taxes paid of $4.2 billion, which were $0.5 billion lower than 2023, mainly reflected lower profits in Australia.  – Purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (capital expenditure) of $9.6 billion comprised $2.7 billion of growth,  $2.5 billion of replacement, $4.2 billion of sustaining and $0.2 billion of decarbonisation capital (in addition to $0.3 billion of  decarbonisation spend in operating costs). We funded our share of capital expenditure in 2024 from internal sources.

Strategic report  |  Financial review  Annual Report 2024 20 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 23 ===== Retaining a strong balance sheet Net debt1 of $5.5 billion at 31 December 2024 increased by $1.3 billion compared to 2023 year end.  Our net gearing ratio1 (net debt to total capital) was 9% at 31 December 2024 (31 December 2023: 7%). See page 273. Our total financing liabilities excluding net debt derivatives at 31 December 2024 (see page 198) were $13.8 billion (31 December 2023: $14.4  billion) and the weighted average maturity was 11 years. At 31 December 2024, 76% of these liabilities were at floating interest rates (84%  excluding leases). The maximum amount within non-current borrowings maturing in any one calendar year is $1.67 billion, which matures in  2033. We had $8.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents plus other short-term highly liquid investments at 31 December 2024 (31 December 2023:  $10.5 billion). Provision for closure costs  At 31 December 2024, provisions for close-down and restoration costs and environmental clean-up obligations were $15.7 billion  (31 December 2023: $17.2 billion). There was a revision of the closure discount rate to 2.5% (from 2.0%), reflecting expectations of higher  yields from long-dated bonds, including the 30-year US Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a key input to our closure discount rate. This  resulted in a $1.0 billion decrease, most of which was adjusted against capitalised closure costs, with a $0.2 billion credit reflected in  underlying EBITDA relating to our closed and non-operating sites. The provision further reduced by $1.1 billion due to the strengthening of  the US dollar against local currencies. During the year, there was a $1.1 billion spend against the provision as we advanced our closure  activities at Argyle, ERA, the Gove alumina refinery and other legacy sites, along with progressive closure activity across our operations. Our shareholder returns policy The Board is committed to maintaining an appropriate balance between cash returns to shareholders and investment in the business, with  the intention of maximising long-term shareholder value.   At the end of each financial period, the Board determines an appropriate total level of ordinary dividend per share. This takes into account  the results for the financial year, the outlook for our major commodities, the Board’s view of the long-term growth prospects of the business  and the company’s objective of maintaining a strong balance sheet. The intention is that the balance between the interim and final dividend  be weighted to the final dividend.   The Board expects total cash returns to shareholders over the longer term to be in a range of 40% to 60% of underlying earnings in  aggregate through the cycle. Acknowledging the cyclical nature of the industry, it is the Board’s intention to supplement the ordinary  dividend with additional returns to shareholders in periods of strong earnings and cash generation.

On 17 April 2025, we will pay the 2024 final ordinary dividend to holders of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited ordinary shares and holders of Rio  Tinto plc ADRs (American Depositary Receipts) on the register at the close of business on 7 March 2025 (record date). The ex-dividend date for  Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited holders is 6 March 2025. For holders of Rio Tinto plc ADRs, the ex-dividend date is 7 March 2025. Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited shareholders may choose to receive their dividend in US dollars, pounds sterling, Australian dollars or  New Zealand dollars. Currency conversions will be based on the prevailing exchange rates seven business days prior to the dividend  payment date. Shareholders must register any changes to their currency elections by 27 March 2025. ADR holders receive dividends at the declared rate in US dollars. We will operate our Dividend Reinvestment Plans for the 2024 final dividend (visit riotinto.com for details). Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited  shareholders' elections to participate in the Dividend Reinvestment Plans must be received by 27 March 2025. Purchases under the  Dividend Reinvestment Plans are made on or as soon as practicable after the dividend payment date and at prevailing market prices. There  is no discount available. 1.

Ltd (46%) in the Pilbara  to sustain production of the Pilbara BlendTM from Rio  Tinto's existing Paraburdoo hub. $1.3bn (Rio Tinto  share)1 Approved in September 2022, the mine will have a capacity of 25 million tonnes per  year. The project includes construction of a primary crusher and an 18 kilometre  conveyor connection to the Paraburdoo processing plant. Construction is now 90%  complete, with fabrication and overland conveyor belt installation finalised.  We continue  to focus on completion of the new crushing and screening facilities, with first ore from  that new system on plan for the first half of 2025. Investment in the Simandou high-grade iron ore project in  Guinea in partnership with CIOH, a Chinalco-led consortium  (the SimFer joint venture) and co-development of the rail and  port infrastructure with Winning Consortium Simandou² (WCS),  Baowu and the Republic of Guinea (the partners) for the export  of up to 120 million tonnes per year of iron ore mined by  SimFer's and WCS's respective mining concessions.³ The  SimFer joint venture⁴ will develop, own and operate a 60 million  tonne per year⁵ mine in blocks 3 & 4. WCS will construct the  project's ~536 kilometre shared dual track main line, a 16  kilometre spur connecting its mine to the mainline as well as the  WCS barge port, while SimFer will construct the ~70 kilometre  spur line, connecting its mining concession to the main rail line,  and the transhipment vessel (TSV) port. The conditions for this  investment were satisfied in July 2024.  $6.2bn (Rio Tinto share) Announced in December 2023, first production at the SimFer mine gate is expected  in 2025, ramping up over 30 months to a 60 million tonne per year capacity (27  million tonnes Rio Tinto share)⁵. For the SimFer mine, bulk earthworks are progressing to plan. All mine construction  contracts are complete, and the two initial crushers are now commissioned, with first  ore crushed on 1 January 2025. For the SimFer infrastructure scope, all construction milestones for the period  stipulated by the Government of Guinea were achieved. In connection with SimFer’s  construction of the ~70 kilometre spur line, which will connect Simandou’s mine  operations to the shared mainline, with the arrival of track laying locomotives, 8.5  kilometres of rail was installed. In October 2024, construction of the 275 metre Milo  River bridge was completed. Tunnel excavation activity on the SimFer scope is now  more than 75% complete, with construction at the port continuing to advance on the  TSV wharf and rail car dumper infrastructure. Expectations for delivery of the first  TSVs remain on plan.  Aluminium Investment to expand the low-carbon AP60 aluminium  smelter at the Complexe Jonquière in Quebec.

Commissioning is expected in the first half of 2026, with  the smelter fully ramped up by the end of that year. Once  completed, it is expected to be in the first quartile of the  industry operating cost curve. $1.1bn Approved in June 2023, AP60 expansion construction activities remain on schedule.  Once completed, the project will add 96 new AP60 pots, increasing capacity by  approximately 160,000 tonnes of primary aluminium per year by the end of 2026.   This new capacity, in addition to 30,000 tonnes of new recycling capacity at Arvida  expected to open in the fourth quarter of 2025, will offset the 170,000 tonnes of  capacity lost through the gradual closure of potrooms at the Arvida smelter from  2024.  Copper Phase two of the south wall pushback to extend mine life at  Kennecott in Utah by a further six years. The project largely  consists of mine stripping activities and includes some  additional infrastructure development, including a tailings  facility expansion. The project will allow mining to continue  into a new area of the orebody between 2026 and 2032. $1.8bn Approved in December 2019, stripping commenced in 2020 and will continue  through 2027. In March 2023, a further $0.3 billion was approved to primarily  mitigate the risk of failure in an area of geotechnical instability known as Revere,  necessary to both protect open pit value and enable underground development. Investment in the Kennecott underground development  of the North Rim Skarn (NRS) area.  $0.6bn Approved in June 2023, production from NRS⁶ is expected to commence in mid-2025,  delivering around 250,000 tonnes through to 2033⁷. A further $0.1 billion was approved in  December 2024 for additional infrastructure and geotechnical controls. Development of the Oyu Tolgoi underground copper- gold mine in Mongolia (Rio Tinto 66%), which is expected  to produce (from the open pit and underground) an  average of ~500,000 tonnes⁸ of copper per year from  2028 to 2036. $7.06bn First ore on the conveyor to surface belt was achieved in October 2024, with the  conveyor system now able to transport ore to the surface from a depth of 1,300 metres.  Load and production testing of the conveyor system is progressing. Construction works  for the concentrator conversion remain on schedule, with commissioning activities  commencing in the fourth quarter of 2024 and forecast to be progressively completed  through to the second quarter of 2025. Construction of primary crusher 2 is  progressing to plan and remains on track to be completed by the end of 2025. Minerals Expansion of the Rincon project in Argentina to 60,000 tonnes  per year of battery grade lithium carbonate, comprised of the  3,000-tonne starter plant and 57,000-tonne expansion plant.  The mine is expected to have a 40-year⁹ life and operate in the  first quartile of the cost curve.  $2.5bn Approved in December 2024, construction of the expanded plant is scheduled to begin  in mid-2025, subject to permitting. First production from the expanded plant is  expected in 2028 followed by a three-year ramp-up to full capacity.

Strategic report  |  Financial review Annual Report 2024 22 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 25 ===== Future options Iron Ore: Pilbara brownfields Over the medium term, our Pilbara system capacity remains  between 345 and 360 million tonnes per year. Meeting this range,  and the planned product mix, will require the approval and delivery  of the next tranche of replacement mines over the next five years. We continue to work closely with local communities, Traditional Owners and governments  to progress approvals for these new mining projects. We continue to advance our next  tranche of Pilbara mine replacement studies at Hope Downs 1 (Hope Downs 2 and  Bedded Hilltop), Brockman 4 (Brockman Syncline 1), Greater Nammuldi and West  Angelas. Funding for the full execution of the Brockman 4 project was obtained in fourth  quarter of 2024. Early works and design are underway for the Brockman 4 and Hope  Downs 1 projects. Environmental and heritage approvals are progressing and timelines  remain subject to receiving these approvals. The Greater Nammuldi project continues to  progress at a rate behind the original development schedule. Iron Ore: Rhodes Ridge In October 2022, Rio Tinto (50%) and Wright Prospecting Pty Ltd  (50%) agreed to modernise the joint venture covering the Rhodes  Ridge project in the Eastern Pilbara, providing a pathway for  development utilising Rio Tinto’s rail, port and power infrastructure. In December 2023, we announced approval of a $77 million pre-feasibility study (PFS).  The PFS continues to progress with good engagement with Traditional Owners and  government. The PFS, which is targeting an initial capacity of up to 40 million tonnes per  year, subject to relevant approvals, remains on track to be completed in 2025. First ore is  expected by the end of the decade.  Longer term, the resource could support a world-class mining hub with a potential  capacity of more than 100 million tonnes of high-quality iron ore a year. Lithium: Jadar Development of the greenfield Jadar lithium-borates project in  Serbia will include an underground mine with associated  infrastructure and equipment, as well as a beneficiation chemical  processing plant. The Board committed funding in July 2021, subject to receiving all  relevant approvals, permits and licences. The studies and capital  estimates will need to be updated before project approval.  On 16 July 2024, the Constitutional Court of Serbia issued a decision stating the 2022  decree by the Government of Serbia to abolish the Jadar project spatial plan was  unconstitutional and illegal. Subsequently, the Government of Serbia has reinstated the  spatial plan to its previously adopted form. Following the decisions, we have continued to  focus on consultation with all key stakeholders, including providing comprehensive  factual information about the project. The application process for obtaining the  Exploitation Field Licence (EFL) continued during the fourth quarter of 2024. The EFL is  essential for commencing fieldwork, including detailed geotechnical investigations, while  cultural heritage and environmental surveys have resumed. The Environmental Impact  Assessment process for the scoping and content for the mine progressed through the  public consultation phase. This step includes legally mandated consultations, which the  project supports, to encourage an open, fact-based dialogue.  Mineral Sands: Zulti South Development of the Zulti South project at Richards Bay Minerals  (RBM) in South Africa (Rio Tinto 74%). Approved in April 2019 to underpin RBM’s supply of zircon and ilmenite over the life of the mine.  The project remains on indefinite suspension, while a feasibility study refresh is underway. Copper: Resolution The Resolution Copper project is a proposed underground  copper mine in the Copper Triangle, in Arizona, US (Rio Tinto  55%). We continue to await a decision from the U.S. Supreme Court on the petition filed by the  Apache Stronghold requesting to hear its case to stop the land exchange between  Resolution Copper and the federal government. Separately the Supreme Court denied a  petition from the San Carlos Apache Tribe, asking the Court to review a decision by the  Arizona Supreme Court regarding a water discharge permit issued to Resolution Copper.  We continue to progress the Final Environmental Impact Statement with the United  States Forest Service, however they have yet to advise on the date of republication. We  also advanced partnership discussions with several federally-recognised Native American  Tribes. While there is significant local support for the project, we respect the views of  groups who oppose it and will continue our efforts to address and mitigate concerns.  Copper: Winu In late 2017, we discovered copper-gold mineralisation at the Winu  project in the Paterson Province in Western Australia. In 2021, we  reported our first Indicated Mineral Resource. The pathway  remains subject to regulatory and other required approvals. In December 2024, we signed a Term Sheet with Sumitomo Metal Mining for a Joint  Venture to deliver the project. A pre-feasibility study with an initial development of  processing capacity of up to 10 million tonnes per year is expected to be completed in  2025, along with the submission of an Environmental Review Document under the EPA  Environmental Impact Assessment process. Project Agreement negotiations with  Nyangumarta and the Martu Traditional Owner Groups remain our priority.     Copper: La Granja In August 2023, we completed a transaction to form a joint  venture with First Quantum Minerals (FQM) that will work to  unlock the development of the La Granja project in Peru, one of  the largest undeveloped copper deposits in the world, with  potential to be a large, long-life operation. FQM acquired a 55% stake for $105 million and will invest up to a further $546 million  into the joint venture to sole fund capital and operational costs to take the project  through a feasibility study and toward development. All subsequent expenditures will be  applied on a pro-rata basis in line with shared ownership. FQM is currently progressing  community engagement and engineering studies. Aluminium: ELYSIS ELYSIS, our joint venture with Alcoa, supported by Apple, the  Government of Canada and the Government of Quebec, is  developing a breakthrough inert anode technology that eliminates  all direct greenhouse gases from the aluminium smelting process. We will install carbon free aluminium smelting cells at our Arvida smelter in Quebec using  the first technology licence issued by the ELYSIS joint venture. We will design, engineer  and build a demonstration plant equipped with ten pots operating at 100 kiloamperes  (kA), for a total investment of $285 million (Rio Tinto $179 million, Government of Quebec  $106 million). The plant will have an annual capacity of 2,500 tonnes of commercial  quality aluminium, with first production targeted by 2027. The joint venture is continuing its R&D program to scale up the ELYSISTM technology. It  has begun commissioning the larger prototype 450 kA cells at the Alma smelter, with the  start-up sequence set to begin in 2025 (previously 2024). Status Strategic report  |  Financial review Annual Report 2024 23 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 26 ===== Iron Ore We are one of the world’s leading producers of iron ore,  the primary raw material in steelmaking. In the Pilbara region  of Western Australia, we operate a network of 17 iron ore  mines, 4 port terminals and a rail network spanning nearly  2,000 kilometres. Steel remains essential for ongoing  urbanisation and will support the global shift to decarbonise. We also continue our work to build a  mentally healthy, safe, and supportive  workplace. Our focus is fostering a  strong reporting culture where our  people feel safe to speak up.   We continue to develop the capability of  our leaders, empowering them to identify  and address psychosocial risks.  Our psychosocial incident investigation  process and related tools have been  developed and tested, with  implementation across our operations  now well underway, reflecting the  importance of these risks.    Market insights In 2024, global steel demand reversed its  2023 gains, contracting by -1% year-on- year, as weak construction steel  consumption in China outweighed gains  in other end-use sectors and regions. China’s steel exports exceeded 110 million  tonnes for the first time since 2015, which  supported crude steel production. China  imported around 1.3 billion tonnes of iron  ore for the 5th consecutive year, while  port inventories accumulated to 3-year  highs of 156 million tonnes. This dynamic  was also driven by a record 1.6 billion  tonnes of seaborne supply.  The major iron ore producers shipped  almost 1.23 billion tonnes in 2024, up from  1.21 billion tonnes in 2023, but still below  the 1.24 billion tonnes in 2018. Seaborne  supply from all other, typically higher- cost, producers hit a new high of 340  million tonnes in 2024. Since around half  of this supply was relatively high cost and  price elastic, average annual iron ore  prices were close to or exceeded  $100/dmt FOB Western Australia  for the 5th consecutive year. Snapshot of the year Safety With a focus on preventing fatalities, we  have an unwavering commitment to the  safety and wellbeing of all workers across  our operations.    We continue to learn, improve and focus  on opportunities to verify and strengthen  our critical risk management (CRM) to  more effectively prevent fatality risks. We have structured our fatality prevention  around risk management to ensure we  build capability when undertaking high  risk work within our operations.   Overall, we maintained a lower frequency  of potential fatal incidents (PFIs), which  improved slightly to 12 in 2024. Falling  objects and potential falls from height  accounted for most of these events.  Vehicle-related risks, previously our  primary exposure, were successfully  managed, resulting in zero PFIs related to  this risk. Our all-injury frequency rate  (AIFR) increased slightly to 0.67 (0.61  in 2023). Our commitment to safety includes the  contractor partners who represent a large  part of our total workforce. Together, we  are finding better waysTM of working  safely – enhancing road safety in the  Pilbara, introducing innovative tools to  reduce injuries and ensuring consistency  in training and qualifications.

The Simandou iron ore project in  Guinea reports to the Chief Technical Officer and is reported outside the Reportable segments. 2. The Pilbara underlying free on board (FOB) EBITDA margin is defined as Pilbara underlying EBITDA divided by Pilbara segmental revenue, excluding freight revenue.  3.  Capital expenditure is the net cash outflow on purchases less sales of property, plant and equipment; capitalised evaluation costs; and purchases less sales of other intangible assets. 4. Underlying return on capital employed (ROCE) is defined as underlying earnings excluding net interest divided by average capital employed. Financial performance  Underlying EBITDA of $16.2 billion was 19%  lower than 2023, primarily due to lower  realised prices ($2.7 billion) and marginally  lower shipments.   Unit costs of $23.0 per tonne were $1.5 per  tonne higher than 2023, driven by lower  iron ore production and inflation.   Our Pilbara operations delivered an  underlying FOB EBITDA margin of 65%,  compared with 69% in 2023, largely due to  the lower iron ore price and lower volumes. We price the majority of our iron ore sales  (78%) by reference to the average index  price for the month of shipment. In 2024,  we priced approximately 10% of sales with  reference to the prior quarter’s average  index lagged by one month with the  remainder sold either on current quarter  average, or other mechanisms. We made  approximately 75% of sales including freight  and 25% on an FOB basis. We achieved an average iron ore price of  $89.6 per wet metric tonne (2023: $99.7  per wet metric tonne) on an FOB basis,  equivalent to $97.4 per dry metric tonne,  with an 8% moisture assumption (2023:  $108.4 per dry metric tonne). This compares  to the average price for the monthly  average Platts index for 62% iron fines  converted to a FOB basis of $98.4 per dry  metric tonne (2023: $110.3 per dry metric  tonne). Segmental revenue for our Pilbara  operations included freight revenue of $2.3  billion (2023: $2.1 billion). Net cash generated from operating  activities of $11.7 billion was 17% lower than  2023, driven by the same drivers as  underlying EBITDA. After capital investment,  which included $0.4 billion increased  investment in Pilbara replacement projects,  free cash flow of $8.6 billion was $2.8 billion  lower than 2023. Review of operations Pilbara operations produced 328.0 million  tonnes (100% basis), 1% lower than 2023.  Shipments (100% basis) were also 1% lower.  Production was affected by depletion,  predominantly at Paraburdoo as we  transition to Western Range and  Yandicoogina, as well as higher than  average rainfall. The Safe Production  System target of 5 million tonnes for 2024  was achieved for the second consecutive  year. Gudai-Darri demonstrated 50 million  tonne per annum rates during the fourth  quarter. Sustaining production at these  rates is subject to the timing of approvals  for planned mining areas and heritage  clearances, and continuation of the  debottlenecking program at the main plant.   We grew our portside business in 2024, with  total iron ore sales in China of 29.9 million  tonnes (23.3 million tonnes in 2023). At the  end of December, inventory levels were 7.1  million tonnes (6.4 million tonnes at the end  of December 2023), including 4.9 million  tonnes of Pilbara product. In 2024,  approximately 89% of our portside sales  were either screened or blended in Chinese  ports (86% in 2023).  In December 2024, we completed the sale  of Dampier Salt Limited’s Lake MacLeod  operation to Leichhardt Industrials Group  for consideration of A$375 million. For more information about our capital  projects and future growth options,  see pages 22-23. Valued partnerships positioning  us for a more sustainable future  Together with the Ngarluma Aboriginal  Corporation, we’re progressing the  development of an 80MW solar farm on  Ngarluma Country, near Karratha, to supply  renewable energy to our Pilbara operations.  When complete, this project has the  potential to reduce the amount of natural  gas currently used for generation across  our Pilbara operations by up to 11%, and  could reduce Rio Tinto’s emissions by up to  120kt CO2e. We're also exploring a renewable energy  project with the Yindjibarndi Energy  Corporation (YEC). Currently in  development by YEC, the project includes  75MW of solar on a greenfield site located  west of Millstream Chichester National Park  on Yindjibarndi Country.  It’s the first project we’re exploring together  since we signed a memorandum of  understanding to collaborate on a range of  potential renewable energy opportunities,  including wind and solar power, as well as  battery energy storage systems. For more information see  riotinto.com/pilbararenewables Strategic report  |  Iron Ore Annual Report 2024 25 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 28 ===== Aluminium As a global leader in low-carbon aluminium, we are uniquely  positioned to further decarbonise our business and support  the world’s transition towards a lower carbon footprint.  A critical material – lightweight and highly recyclable –  aluminium is set to play an increasingly vital role in our lives.  We’re providing a diversified portfolio of primary and  secondary aluminium solutions used to manufacture a wide  range of products, including solar panels and transmission  lines, jet engines, electric vehicles and smartphones. Market insights After a relatively stable first quarter, the  aluminium price rallied in the 2nd quarter  due to sanctions against Russian metal  but fell in the 3rd quarter on weaker  global manufacturing data. The price rose  at the end of the quarter after an interest  rate cut by the US Federal Reserve and  stimulus measures in China, and was  supported in the 4th quarter due to high  alumina costs.  World semi-fabricated demand rose 2%  year-on-year. Primary aluminium demand  increased at a similar rate. Scrap spreads  tightened in 2024 on low inventories and  tight availability, resulting in lower margins  for secondary producers. Ex-China  demand fell in building and construction,  and remained weak in automotive, but  performed well in packaging and power  infrastructure. Global aluminium demand  will continue to be driven by the energy  transition, particularly electric vehicles,  and renewable energy.  China is producing aluminium close to its  self-imposed capacity cap of  approximately 45 million tonnes, while  growth in the rest of the world moderated  on supply disruptions. Overall, the primary  aluminium market was balanced in 2024,  with visible inventories at low levels.  The alumina price reached a multi-year  high in the 4th quarter due to closures,  supply disruptions, and constrained  bauxite supply in China. The price  corrected at the end of the quarter as  supply improved but remained at a high  level compared to the historical norm.  China is the largest import market for  bauxite, and seaborne bauxite prices into  China performed strongly in 2024. Guinea  exports to China increased approximately  10% year-on-year, accounting for around  70% of bauxite exports to China.  However, supply growth could not keep  pace with demand and China import  bauxite prices surged in the 4th quarter.  Snapshot of the year Safety In 2024, our all-injury frequency rate  (AIFR) increased from 0.33 to 0.38, largely  reflecting challenges at our Kitimat site in  Canada. To help address these  challenges, we engaged external safety  consultants during Q4 to provide  targeted support, focused on leadership  and stabilising safety performance.  Overall, our safety performance generally  improved across our Aluminium  operations. We continued to focus on  uncovering and addressing systemic  weaknesses and the root causes of our  potential fatal incidents (PFIs). In  particular, the focus we started in 2023 to  promote more proactive PFI2 reporting,  and to improve the quality of PFI  investigations has helped move us from 5  worker injuries in PFI events in 2023 to 2  in 2024.   Looking ahead, we remain focused on  reducing inherent risks in our business to  drive lasting safety impacts for our  workforce. By prioritising engineering  design, strategic capital investment, and  ongoing research, we will continue our  work to eliminate hazards and remove  people from the areas of greatest  safety risk.

Financial performance  Overall we delivered a significant uplift in  profitability for our Aluminium business with  a 61% increase in underlying EBITDA to $3.7  billion, underlying EBITDA margin rising nine  percentage points to 30% and underlying  ROCE of 10%. We saw an 8% increase in the  average LME price with price support from  high alumina costs and the cancellation of  Chinese VAT rebates on the export of semi- finished goods. Market-related costs for  key materials such as caustic, coke and  pitch moderated with some of this flowing  through to underlying EBITDA, offsetting  some of the impact of a higher alumina  price. Higher bauxite volumes from record  annual production at Gove and Amrun and  increased bauxite pricing were partially  offset by lower alumina production  following the breakage of a third-party gas  pipeline in Queensland.  We achieved an average realised aluminium  price of $2,834 per tonne, 4% higher than  2023. The average realised aluminium price  comprises the LME price, a market premium  and a value-added product (VAP) premium.  The cash LME price averaged $2,419 per  tonne, 8% higher than 2023, while in our  key US market, the Midwest premium duty  paid, which is 59% of our total volumes  (2023: 57%), decreased by 17% to $427 per  tonne (2023: $512 per tonne). Our VAP  sales represented 46% of the primary metal  we sold (2023: 46%) and generated  product premiums averaging $295 per  tonne of VAP sold (2023: $354 per tonne). Our cash generation also improved  significantly, with net cash generated from  operating activities of $3.0 billion, a rise of  53%, compared with 2023. Free cash flow  of $1.3 billion reflected capital investment in  the business of $1.7 billion. Review of operations Bauxite production of 58.7 million tonnes  was 7% higher than 2023, exceeding our  guidance. We delivered record annual  production at Gove and Amrun following  implementation of the Safe Production  System.  We shipped 40.9 million tonnes of bauxite  to third parties, 10% higher than 2023.  Segmental revenue for bauxite increased  28% to $3.1 billion. This includes freight  revenue of $0.5 billion (2023: $0.5 billion). Alumina production of 7.3 million tonnes  was 3% lower than 2023, due to the  impacts to our Gladstone operations from  the breakage of the third-party operated  Queensland Gas Pipeline in March. Gas  supplies to our Gladstone operations from  the third-party operated Queensland Gas  Pipeline were meeting 100% of our  requirements by year-end.  As the result of sanction measures by the  Australian Government, Rio Tinto has taken  on 100% of capacity of Queensland  Alumina Limited (QAL) for as long as the  sanctions continue. This results in use of  Rusal’s 20% share of capacity by Rio Tinto  under the tolling arrangement with QAL.  This additional output is excluded from the  production tables in this report as QAL  remains 80% owned by Rio Tinto and 20%  owned by Rusal.  Aluminium production of 3.3 million tonnes  was 1% higher than 2023. At our New  Zealand Aluminium Smelter (NZAS),  production continued to ramp up following  a previous call from Meridian Energy to  reduce electricity usage in August 2024, for  which we are compensated. As previously  reported, we expect the ramp-up to run  through to the second quarter of 2025.   We completed the previously announced  acquisition of Sumitomo Chemical  Company’s (SCC’s) 20.64% interest in  NZAS on 1 November 2024 and now fully  own the Tiwai Point aluminium smelter. We also completed the previously  announced acquisition of SCC’s 2.46%  stake in Boyne Smelters Limited (BSL). The  completion of this transaction, along with  the recently completed acquisition of  Mitsubishi’s 11.65% stake in BSL, brings Rio  Tinto’s total interest in BSL to 73.5%. Production is reported including these  changes in ownership from 1 November  2024. For more information about our capital  projects and future growth options, see  pages 22-23. Installing ELYSISTM carbon-free  smelting technology Our ELYSIS joint venture with Alcoa is  progressing the development of a  breakthrough inert anode technology  that eliminates all direct greenhouse  gas (GHG) emissions from the aluminium  smelting process. In 2024, we announced a $285 million  investment, including $106 million from  the Government of Québec, to build a  demonstration plant equipped with 10 ELYSIS  pots at our Arvida smelter. These pots,  operating at 100kA, replicate the technology  that has successfully produced commercial- purity aluminium at the ELYSIS Industrial  Research and Development Center. The  demonstration plant will have the capacity to  produce up to 2,500 tonnes of aluminium per  year, with first production targeted by 2027. This project is part of our phased approach  to support the development of the  technology. It will allow us to conduct further  tests and to build expertise in installing and  operating the ELYSIS™ technology towards  future industrial-scale implementation.

By the end of the decade, we aim to deliver  1 million tonnes of copper per year from our global portfolio of  assets and projects spanning 4 continents. We are focused on  maximising value from our existing assets, delivering profitable  growth by unlocking projects, and investing in quality  partnerships across the copper value chain. In 2025, we will look to prioritise building  care, capability and trust to further  improve ongoing risk management  efforts and first line assurance  implementation. Assurance plans are in  progress for Oyu Tolgoi and Kennecott,  while Resolution and Winu will also move  to implement first line assurance plans  for key critical risks. Market insights Copper prices climbed to a record high in  late May following a series of high-profile  supply disruptions and strong Chinese  imports. Financial flows into copper  amplified this rally, with copper demand  seen as a major beneficiary of both the  energy transition and data centre  investment for AI. Prices subsequently  retreated as supply outperformed  expectations, US rate cuts continued to  be delayed, and exchange inventory rose  to a 4-year high.  The refined copper market was in a small  surplus across 2024. Supply rose  modestly, despite high-profile disruptions  early in the year. Production growth from  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  was notably strong. Demand from data  centre and energy-transition exposed  segments remained positive despite some  headwinds from substitution and thrifting  as technologies mature. Traditional  segments such as residential construction  had a more challenging year. Despite this,  copper prices averaged 415 US cents per  pound in 2024, up 8% from 385 US cents  per pound in 2023.  In contrast, copper concentrate was  undersupplied in 2024, due to significant  smelter capacity additions in China and  other Asian countries. Treatment and  refining charges fell sharply as a result  and turned negative from April until  August as smelters competed for material. Snapshot of the year Safety In 2024, we recorded 24 potential fatal  incidents (PFIs), an increase from 22 in  2023. Notable critical risks associated  with these events were: fall from height,  uncontrolled releases of energy, and  falling objects.  Our all-injury frequency rate (AIFR)  dropped slightly to 0.33, a modest  decrease from 0.35 in 2023, with an AIFR  of 0.27 for employees, and 0.37 for our  contractor workforce. Ongoing  monitoring to identify continuous  improvement opportunities includes two- way learning with our contractor partners.  Our Critical Risk Management program  and Safety Maturity Model underpin our  absolute focus on preventing fatalities  and serious events. During the year, key  achievements included simplification of  critical control tools, as well as capability  building through our Leadership in the  Field program.  At the asset level, we progressed site- specific hazard exposure reduction  strategies, which involved mitigating the  potential for exposure to silica dust at  Oyu Tolgoi, and to sulphur dioxide at  Kennecott. Our Winu project team also  piloted a psychosocial risk management  framework, reinforcing our commitment to  a safe, healthy workplace.

Accountability for Rio Tinto Guinea, our in-country external affairs office, remains with Bold Baatar, and has therefore moved from the Copper product group to “Other operations”  following his change in role to Chief Commercial Officer. Accordingly, prior period amounts have been adjusted for comparability. 3. Net cash generated from operating activities excludes the operating cash flows of equity accounted units (EAUs) but includes dividends from EAUs (Escondida). 4. Capital expenditure is the net cash outflow on purchases less sales of property, plant and equipment, capitalised evaluation costs and purchases less sales of other intangible assets.  It excludes EAUs. 5. Underlying return on capital employed (ROCE) is defined as underlying earnings (product group operations) excluding net interest divided by average capital employed. Financial performance Improved financials benefited from the  steady ramp-up at Oyu Tolgoi, the strong  performance at Escondida and the  successful restart of the Kennecott smelter,  following the rebuild in 2023, releasing  working capital through the drawdown of  inventories, enhancing operating cash flow.  Underlying EBITDA increased by 75%  compared with 2023 and free cash flow  turned positive supported by a strong LME  copper price and higher volumes. Overall,  mined copper production rose by 13% and  refined copper production by 42%. Copper C1 net unit costs, at 142 cents per  pound, reduced by 53 cents per pound, or  27%, from 2023, reflecting cost efficiencies  on the higher mined copper production at  Oyu Tolgoi and Escondida, and higher  refined copper production at Kennecott,  following the smelter rebuild in 2023. We generated significantly higher net cash  from operating activities of $2.6 billion,  which included higher dividends from  Escondida. Review of operations Mined copper production, at 697 thousand  tonnes, was 13% higher than 2023,  reflecting the ramp-up of Oyu Tolgoi  underground and increased production  from Escondida due to higher grades fed to  the concentrator (0.99% versus 0.83%).  This offset geotechnical challenges at  Kennecott as instabilities in the pit wall  impacted the mining sequence from the  second quarter of 2024. Refined copper production increased by  42% to 248 thousand tonnes with the  Kennecott smelter and refinery returning to  normal operations following the successful  rebuild in 2023. Oyu Tolgoi underground project In 2024, we delivered 6.5 million tonnes of  ore milled from the underground mine at an  average copper head grade of 1.94% and  34.5 million tonnes from the open pit with  an average grade of 0.39%. The ramp-up  remains on track to reach 500 thousand  tonnes of copper production per annum  (100% basis and stated as recoverable  metal) for the Oyu Tolgoi underground and  open pit mines for the years 2028 to 20361. We continue to see good performance from  the underground mine. We completed  drawbell construction at Panel 0, with a  total of 124 drawbells opened. The sinking  of ventilation Shafts 3 and 4 was completed  in April 2024 following the breakthrough to  surface. Both shafts were commissioned in  the second half of 2024. In November 2024, Oyu Tolgoi successfully  concluded Collective Agreement  negotiations, marking a historic milestone  as the first agreement involving two trade  unions at the operation. The agreement will  remain in effect for the next three years. For more information about our capital  projects and future growth options, see  pages 22-23. 1. The 500 thousand tonne per year copper production  target (stated as recoverable metal) for the Oyu Tolgoi  underground and open pit mines for the years 2028 to  2036 was previously reported in a release to the  Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) dated 11 July  2023 “Investor site visit to Oyu Tolgoi copper mine,  Mongolia”. All material assumptions underpinning that  production target continue to apply and have not  materially changed. Advancing Winu with Sumitomo  Metal Mining In December, we announced a new  partnership with Sumitomo Metal Mining  (SMM) to deliver the Winu copper-gold  project in Western Australia. Under the  Term Sheet signed between the partners,  Rio Tinto will continue to develop and  operate Winu as the managing partner,  with SMM to acquire a 30% equity share.  Located in the Great Sandy Desert, near  our Pilbara iron ore operations, Winu is a  low-risk, long-life deposit that is highly  prospective for expansion. In 2025,  alongside finalising the joint venture  definitive agreements, we will advance  regulatory approvals for an initial  processing capacity up to 10Mtpa. Environmental Review Document  preparation under the Environmental  Protection Authority of Western Australia’s  Environmental Impact Assessment process  will take place in parallel with ongoing  Project Agreement negotiations with the  Nyangumarta People, Traditional Owners  of the land on which the Winu deposit is  situated, and the Martu People, Traditional  Owners of the land home to the  Karlkayn airstrip.  As part of our renewed relationship with  SMM, we have also entered into a letter of  intent to explore broader value chain  opportunities for commercial, technical, and  strategic collaboration across copper, other  base metals and lithium. For more information see riotinto.com/winu Strategic report  |  Copper  Annual Report 2024 29 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 32 ===== Minerals Our Minerals portfolio produces materials essential to a low- carbon future from a global suite of assets and projects well- positioned to support the electrification of the world’s economies.  We are developing and growing a world-class lithium business  at an accelerated pace: producing first lithium from our Rincon  Project, Argentina in December. We also produce long-life,  high-grade, low-impurity iron ore pellets and concentrate,  titanium dioxide, speciality borates and diamonds from our  operations in Canada, Madagascar, South Africa and the US. Market insights Titanium dioxide market fundamentals  stabilised in 2024, with downstream and  midstream producers noting improving  sales and margins. Elevated inventories  limited feedstock purchases and put  downward pressure on prices.  Borates demand improved in 2024,  evidenced by increasing shipments into  key consuming regions. Weakness in  pricing resulted from stronger supply  availability after supply chain disruptions  were cleared.  A softer demand and pricing environment  for steel impacted the high-grade iron ore  fines and pellets segments in 2024. Blast  Furnace (BF) steelmakers sought to  reduce exposure to higher quality, higher  cost inputs, with seaborne pellet  consumption falling year-on-year. This  resulted in lower BF-grade pellet  premiums than seen in 2023. Meanwhile,  Direct Reduction grade pellet premiums  were supported by stable demand in the  MENA (Middle East and North Africa)  region which, although cooler than the  previous year, continued to support  seaborne demand and prices.   Lithium carbonate prices remained subdued  in 2024, largely due to slower growth in  electric vehicle (EV) production despite  record sales of 17 million units. While lithium  demand and supply grew by about 25%  year-on-year, the market faced an  oversupply. Increased supply from earlier  investments contributed to this imbalance,  leading to the suspension of several lithium  projects and production cuts by existing  producers. Nonetheless, long-term market  fundamentals remain strong, supported by  government policies and expanding EV  adoption. Additional investment will be  essential to address future supply shortfalls. Snapshot of the year Safety Tragically 4 of our colleagues and 2 crew  members lost their lives in a plane crash  while travelling to our Diavik diamond mine  on 23 January. We are currently awaiting  the investigation findings from the  Transportation Safety Board of Canada,  which are expected in 2025. In 2024, the number of potential fatal  incidents (PFIs) dropped to 26, compared  to 27 in 2023 with the most common  involving risk of vehicle collision or  rollover and falling objects.  We continue  to focus our efforts on mitigating these  risks, implementing targeted safety  measures and corrective actions informed  by thorough investigations. Our all-injury frequency rate (AIFR)  increased to 0.31, compared to 0.24 in 2023,  reflecting an increase in injuries among both  employees and contractors. The rate of  injuries in our contractor workforce  increased from 0.20 in 2023 to 0.27 in 2024,  and our employee injury rate rose from 0.28  in 2023 to 0.35 this year. In 2025, we will  continue to build on our progress by  leveraging the safety maturity model to drive  further enhancements. Along with this, we will  place a stronger emphasis on health,  environmental responsibility, and security to  ensure a safer, more productive environment  for both our employees and contractor  partners. Our commitment to these areas will  be key to achieving our goals.

Underlying return on capital employed (ROCE) is defined as underlying earnings (product group operations) excluding net interest divided by average capital employed. Financial performance  Underlying EBITDA of $1.1 billion was 24%  lower than 2023, primarily due to lower  pricing across most commodities, in  particular titanium dioxide feedstocks,  borates and iron ore. Underlying demand  for titanium dioxide feedstocks remains soft  while the borates market is recovering from  supply chain disruptions. Net cash generated from operating  activities of $0.7 billion was 29% higher  than 2023, when a build in working capital  took place. Further investment is being  made to develop our battery minerals  business, resulting in negative free cash  flow of $126 million. Underlying EBITDA and net cash generated  from operating activities in 2024 include  $0.2 billion1 insurance proceeds relating to  the process safety incidents at RTIT and the  forest fires at IOC which took place in 2023.   Review of operations Production of iron ore pellets and  concentrate at IOC of 9.4 million tonnes  was 2% lower than 2023 primarily due to an  11-day site-wide shutdown driven by forest  fires in mid-July, resulting in a revised mine  plan and maintenance schedule. We also  experienced operational challenges in the  mine and concentrator throughout the year.  Annual rail haulage was 36.4 million tonnes,  7% higher than in 2023, driven by  continued operational improvements to  meet increasing third-party and IOC  demand.  Our focus going forward is to  stabilise the operation and achieve safe,  cost-effective and consistent production. TiO2 slag production of 990 thousand  tonnes was 11% lower than 2023, primarily  due to reduced market demand. A furnace  reconstruction, starting in the first quarter  of 2024, continues at our RTIT Quebec  Operations. Through 2024, we operated six  out of nine furnaces in Quebec and three  out of four at Richards Bay Minerals (RBM). Borates production was 2% higher than  2023 supported by recovering market  demand, and despite unplanned plant  downtime in April 2024.  Our share of carats recovered was 17%  lower than 2023. Diamond production was  impacted by the tragic plane crash earlier in  2024, as well as cessation of A21 open pit  mining in the third quarter of 2023. First lithium was produced from the Rincon  project starter plant in Argentina in  November 2024. First commercial  production is targeted for the first half of  2025. For more information about our capital  projects and future growth options, see  pages 22-23. 1. There is no overall financial impact to the Rio Tinto  Group, with the offset reflected centrally. BlueSmelting’s game-changing  potential  In 2024, we continued developing  BlueSmelting™, a groundbreaking ilmenite  reduction technology. BlueSmelting has the  potential to reduce up to 70% of the  Rio Tinto Iron & Titanium (RTIT) Quebec  Operations' global greenhouse gas (GHG)  emissions, representing a decrease of  approximately 670,000 tonnes of CO2  equivalent compared to 2021 emissions. BlueSmelting™ technology creates the  possibility of producing high-grade titanium  dioxide feedstock, steel, and metal powders  with a drastically reduced carbon footprint. The BlueSmelting process being  demonstrated at RTIT Quebec Operations  is a world-first technology, developed in- house, that adds a step before the  traditional smelting process – pre-reduction  – leading to an overall decrease in the site  GHG emissions. It combines mature in- house technology, found in other processes  used on-site, with new innovations.  BlueSmelting uses fluid bed reactors to  reduce the coal required for the traditional  smelting process, meaning less coal and  electricity are used to complete the ore  reduction. The BlueSmelting demonstration plant – the  largest of its kind in the world – is capable of  producing up to 40,000 tonnes of ilmenite  ore a year, with drastically fewer emissions.

This responsibility underpins everything we  do and drives our commitment to  embedding sustainability considerations  into every stage of our business – from  exploration to closure. To do this, we align our priorities and  performance with society’s evolving  expectations. Each year we complete a  materiality assessment to understand what  ESG topics matter most to our stakeholders  and our business. This process includes  gathering information from internal and  external stakeholders through interviews,  surveys and publicly available information  to understand what impacts, risks and  opportunities are important now and what  they think will be important in the medium  to long term.   It’s essential we manage these ESG topics  well as we strive for impeccable ESG  credentials and a strong social licence, with  the insights gathered through this process  helping us to strengthen our approach and  contribute to the long-term sustainability and  success of our business for all stakeholders.  For more information see riotinto.com/ sustainabilityapproach The United Nations Sustainable  Development Goals (UN SDGs) Our ESG framework describes how we  manage and report externally on these  topics and how we contribute to the UN  SDGs, which are recognised as the global  blueprint for a sustainable future.  The SDGs are a useful reference point,  helping us to prioritise our efforts to align  with society’s expectations and deliver  meaningful impact. We focus on goals we  feel are most relevant to operating our  business responsibly and where we can  make the greatest difference. Our 2 lead  goals are SDG 12 (responsible consumption  and production) and SDG 8 (decent work  and economic growth).  Our operations also contribute to 8  supporting SDGs (3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13 and 15),  while SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals)  reflects our approach to sustainability and is  fundamental to the way we run our business.  What’s important now Our internal and external stakeholders are  broadly aligned on 4 highly material ESG  topics: climate change1; respecting human  rights; cultural heritage management; and  health, safety and wellbeing. Additional material topics for us as we strive  to build a sustainable business include:  biodiversity and ecosystems; business  integrity and governance; ESG  transparency and disclosure; inclusion,  diversity and equity; local community  relations, tailings and mineral waste  management; business performance; and  water management. What will be important in the future Stakeholders feel climate change will  continue to increase in importance over the  next decade, alongside biodiversity and  ecosystems; the impact of technology;  respecting human rights; risk management  and cyber security; business integrity and  governance; supply chain transparency; and  end-to-end materials management. Water  management will also remain an important  topic due to the reliance of local  communities and our operations on this  increasingly scarce resource. 1.

Supply chain  transparency Strategic report  Annual Report 2024 32 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 35 ===== Reporting our performance Our materiality assessment records the  threshold at which an issue or topic  becomes important enough for us to  report on externally. The importance of  a topic is based on the significance of  its impacts on, and risks and opportunities  for, stakeholders. Our ESG materiality  assessment considers our impacts  externally and, conversely, the effect of  external factors on our business.  As an ICMM member, we commit to  reporting on our ESG performance against  the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)  standards and implementing the ICMM  Performance Expectations (PEs). The ICMM  Mining Principles framework focuses on the  implementation of systems and practices  related to a broad range of ESG areas. In  2022, we disclosed that we prioritised 26 of  our 29 operating assets for validation within  the 3-year cycle (2023-2025). There are  now 30 operating assets and we have  prioritised one additional asset for  validation in 2025, thereby resulting in a  total of 28 out of our 30 operating assets  being prioritised for validation. Since 2022,  we have been progressing the validations  according to plan. In 2024, on-site third-party validations were  completed for 12 of our priority operating  and refining assets. The validation reports  demonstrate a high level of alignment  between the self-assessment and validation  outcomes, with identification of relevant  areas for improvement. Information for the  2023 and 2024 validation results is  presented in the ICMM PE Summary tab in  the 2024 Sustainability Fact Book. In 2024,  we have also introduced a new tab showing  the Towards Sustainable Mining (TSM)  outcomes for 3 of our Canadian sites and  all of our Pilbara iron ore sites. We have  continued to improve our reporting to meet  additional disclosure requirements,  including the ICMM Social and Economic  Reporting Framework (SERF). In 2024, we  have disclosed our performance against the  SERF indicators in the ICMM SERF tab.  The majority of our ESG reporting is  incorporated into this Annual Report and  supplemented by our 2024 Sustainability  Fact Book, containing current and historical  data on topics including health, safety,  environment, climate, communities, human  rights, responsible sourcing, ICMM PEs  and transparency. Governance and assurance The Sustainability Committee oversees  strategies to manage social and  environmental impacts, risks and  opportunities, including management  processes and standards. The Sustainability  Committee reviews the effectiveness of  management policies and procedures  relating to safety, health, employment  practices (apart from remuneration, which is  the responsibility of the People &  Remuneration Committee), relationships  with neighbouring communities,  environment, tailings, security and human  rights, land access, political involvement  and sustainable development. Given its  strategic significance, climate change is  overseen directly by the Board.   For more information about our  Sustainability Committee see pages  117-118. This year, the Group’s auditor, KPMG, was  engaged to provide the Directors of Rio  Tinto with assurance on selected  sustainability subject matters. KPMG’s  limited assurance statement satisfies the  requirements of subject matters 1 to 4 of  the ICMM assurance procedure. For more information about our external  auditors and internal assurance see   pages 321-324.

Reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas  emissions by 15% by 2025 and by 50% by 2030  (when compared to 2018 levels), and achieve net zero  emissions from our operations by 2050.1 The 2024 adjusted gross Scope 1 and 2 baseline emissions are 30.7 Mt  CO2e, a reduction of 5.0 Mt CO2e (14%) relative to our 2018 base year. After  carbon credits are applied, the net Scope 1 and 2 emissions are 29.6 Mt  CO2e, a reduction of 17% against our target. (2023: 5.5%). Achieve our global Communities and Social  Performance (CSP) targets2 as follows: – Year-on-year increase in contestable spend sourced from suppliers local3 to our operations.  – All sites to co-manage cultural heritage with communities and knowledge holders by 2027. – 70% of total social investment to be made through strategic, outcomes-focused partnerships by 2027.  – All employees in high-risk human rights roles to complete job-specific human rights training annually  by 2024. – All employees to complete general human rights training by 2027.  – 100 Indigenous leaders in Australia (managers and above) by 2026. – We sourced 14.75% of contestable spend from suppliers local to our operations, a decrease⁴ from 16.80% in 2023. Progress for each  product group is included in the 2024 Sustainability Fact Book. – More than 25 sites have completed a Cultural Heritage Maturity Framework self-assessment, to identify existing gaps and establish  actions to progress along the maturity continuum5. Two assets matured in  their performance in 2024 (others maintaining their performance from  2023) and 14 assets assessed themselves as L4 (Integrated) or above. – In 2024, more than 44% of current Group-wide social investment initiatives were identified as strategic partnerships, assessed against the  strategic partnering self-assessment tool.  – In 2024, a new mandatory Human Rights in Action learning program was assigned to higher risk roles, with 85% completions recorded for the year.  Other progress updates on human rights learning initiatives are in the  2024 Sustainability Fact Book. – At the end of 2024, we had 61 Indigenous leaders in our business in Australia. Improve diversity6 in our business by: – Increasing women in the business (including in senior leadership7) each year. – Aiming for 50% women in our graduate intake. – Aiming for 30% of our graduate intake to be from places where we are developing new businesses. – 25.2% of our workforce were women, up 0.9% from 2023. – 33.3% of our executive leaders were women, up 8.3% from 2023. – 32% of senior leadership were women, up 1.9% from 2023. – 42.8% of Board roles were held by women, up 12% from 2023. – 56.6% of our graduate intake were women, up 5% from 2023. – 20% of our graduate intake were from places where we are developing new businesses8, down 17.6% from 2023. Improve our employee engagement and satisfaction. No change to our employee satisfaction (eSAT9) score since 2023 (score  remains 74). (2023: 1 point increase). 1. Refer to the Climate Action Plan in our 2024 Annual Report for details on how we are progressing towards our greenhouse gas emissions targets. 2. In 2024, we progressed initiatives towards our 2026 CSP targets.  We also extended those targets for one year, to conclude in 2027, to accommodate Group-wide productivity and  culture initiatives. 3. We take a site-centric view of the definition of local, which allows operations to establish their own definition, based on a set of common principles. These principles require that each  operation, in defining “local” takes into consideration its geographic, social and economic area of impact as well as ownership. For example, suppliers located within the Pilbara region of  Western Australia are defined as “local” for our iron ore product group's Pilbara Operations. This approach is consistent with international best practice and aligns with the ICMM SERF  guidance. 4. The decrease is due to reductions in commodity rates, cost reduction initiatives, and changes in the supplier mix at some operations. 5. The cultural heritage co-management maturity framework sets out a maturity model consisting of five levels of maturity – from ''learning the practice'' to ''leading practice''. A rating of  Level 4 (Integrated) reflects functioning co-management with a shared vision and common purpose. 6. From 2021, the definition used to calculate diversity was changed to include people not available for work and contractors (those engaged on temporary contracts to provide services  under the direction of Rio Tinto leaders), excluding project contractors. 7. We define senior leadership as Managing Directors, General Managers, Group Advisers and Chief Advisers. 8. Identifying with a nationality is not mandatory. More than 48% of our graduates have not formally reported a nationality. 9. eSAT (Employee Satisfaction) is a measure of “how happy an employee is to work at Rio Tinto”. It is calculated by averaging the responses on a 1-7 scale and expressing this out of 100. Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG Annual Report 2024 34 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 37 ===== Environment We know our operations, throughout their life cycle and associated value chains,  can impact nature and surrounding environments both directly and indirectly.  We also depend on healthy, functioning ecosystems to provide the resources  we need for our operations and supply chains.  We focus on being responsible stewards of  these shared natural resources, ensuring we  protect the health, safety and livelihoods of  local communities, Indigenous Peoples, our  suppliers and our customers. This includes  managing risks to minimise adverse  environmental impacts from our operations  and playing our part to sustain these  shared ecosystems and natural resources  for future generations. While mining activities use less than 0.1%1 of  the world’s land, they are often in  ecologically and culturally sensitive areas.  That is why – in addition to our  Environmental Performance Standards,  which apply to all of our business units and  managed operations from exploration  through to post-closure – we have shared  our support for the ICMM’s Nature Position  Statement, and actively engage in several  partnerships that address both our own  and broader regional challenges in the  areas where we operate. Nature strategy The global threat of biodiversity loss and  ecosystem collapse is an urgent global  challenge, with the United Nations (UN)  Biodiversity Conference and the Kunming- Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework  (GBF) underscoring the need for bold  action. Given our extensive land holdings  and the nature of our activities, we have the  opportunity and responsibility to ensure our  environmental performance both aligns with  society’s expectations and contributes to  the restoration of the natural environment.  We are committed to playing our part in  contributing to nature-positive outcomes  for industry and society. In January 2024, we shared our support for  the ICMM’s Nature Position Statement. This  position sets out ICMM members’ approach  to contributing to a nature-positive future,  guided by GBF 2030 targets and ICMM’s  existing commitments in relation to  Indigenous Peoples, climate change, water,  and respecting human rights in line with the  UN Guiding Principles on Business and  Human Rights (UNGPs).     At its most fundamental level, nature  positive means “ensuring more nature in  the world in 2030 than in 2020 and  continued recovery after that”.1 In addition to our support for the ICMM’s  Nature Position Statement, and our role in  contributing to a nature-positive future, our  operations and decision-making is guided  by the following clear environmental-related  commitments: – We contribute to the global nature- positive goal of “halting and reversing  biodiversity loss by 2030 from a 2020  baseline, with a full recovery by 2050”.  – We do not explore or extract resources  within the boundaries of UNESCO World  Heritage sites. – All reasonable steps will be taken to  ensure future operations adjacent to  World Heritage sites are not  incompatible with the outstanding  universal value for which these sites are  listed and do not put the integrity of  these sites at risk.  – We respect legally designated protected  areas and ensure any new operations or  changes to existing operations are not  incompatible with the objectives for  which the protected areas were  established. – We do not undertake deep-sea mining,  and believe it should not take place unless  comprehensive scientific research refutes  currently held evidence that it will  create significant environmental and  socioeconomic implications. Building on our commitments and  recognition of the critical need for action, in  2024 we laid the foundation for our nature  strategy through consultations with  Indigenous Peoples groups, investors, civil  society organisations, conservation groups,  and our employees. This strategy will direct  our nature-related activities, detailing our  ambitions, commitments, and targets  program, ensuring we take a focused and  measurable approach.  As we formalise the strategy and approach  in 2025, we will continue to maintain an  open dialogue with stakeholders to ensure  society’s expectations inform our actions.  We also continue to develop and invest  in a global portfolio of nature-based  solutions to help address climate change  and nature loss, while generating positive  outcomes for communities in the regions  where we operate.  Nature target program Our nature target program is a core  component of our nature strategy,  acknowledging the interconnectedness of  the 4 natural realms – land, ocean, freshwater,  and atmosphere – and their ties to  biodiversity and society.  Building on the work of our 2023 water target  program, which was recognised externally as  industry-leading, we are widening our focus  to encompass nature more broadly. The  expanded program includes a Group-level  strategic target combined with a set of locally  focused, site-based improvement programs,  developed in collaboration with host  communities, Indigenous Peoples groups,  investors, civil society organisations, and  conservation groups. Our Group target Our Group target will focus on the health of  our receiving environments and surrounding  ecosystems for all managed operations  through an online dashboard, focusing on  biodiversity and the realms of nature. This  expands upon our interactive water  disclosure platform, released in 2023.  If we identify areas for improvement in the  receiving environment or ecosystem health,  we may also consider additional context- based improvement programs as part of  our future focus.

Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG Annual Report 2024 35 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 38 ===== Our site-based  improvement programs Our site-based improvement programs,  developed in consultation with stakeholders,  represent a subset of initiatives to drive  performance at operational sites.  These projects will be selected based on their  risk profile, current performance, external  commitments and the interdependencies of  local communities and the environment. Our nature target program helps us to  enhance the transparency of our nature  risk profile, challenges and management.  Progress on both the Group target and  site-based improvement programs will be  reported annually.  This approach, along with the data needed to  track progress, will help us contribute to a  nature-positive future.  Water Water is a shared resource critical to  sustaining biodiversity, people and economic  prosperity. Increasingly disrupted weather  patterns and more extreme weather events  due to climate change and a growing world  population, mean efficiently managing water  is more important than ever.  The way we think about water and manage  associated risks reflects the diversity of our  operations and geographic locations. A small  proportion of our assets operate in water- scarce regions, while others must remove  excess water to allow safe mining operations.  These are examples of the many potential  risks we manage across the life cycle of our  diverse operations. We share water with the communities and  ecosystems surrounding our operations, and  we aim to avoid permanent impacts on those  water resources by carefully managing the  quality and quantity of the water we use and  return to the environment. This means  balancing the needs of our operations with  those of the local communities and  ecosystems. We do this while considering the  impact of climate change, already felt in the  level of rainfall and water security at some of  our operations. We understand this  responsibility extends beyond the life of  our operations.  To address this complexity, we adopt a  catchment-level approach to developing  potential solutions and managing our  operational risks and impacts. We use 2030  water stress as determined by the World  Resource Institute (WRI) to identify  operational catchments of most concern. Group water risk profile (percentage of managed operations1) Water resource Is there enough water available for environment needs, community  needs and our operational use? Our aluminium operations in Gladstone, Queensland, Australia, are  supplied with water from Awoonga Dam. Water restrictions could be  imposed on the supply in the event of a persistent drought. The  water resource risk for these operations is assessed as high. Water quality and quantity Does the way we manage water on site, or discharge excess water,  cause environmental impacts or operational constraints? Our ilmenite mine near Havre-Saint-Pierre (HSP), in Quebec, Canada is  surrounded by ecologically and socially significant lakes and water  features. The quality and quantity risk for HSP mine is assessed as high  and excess water from the mine needs to be carefully managed. To  ensure water is released to the environment at a suitable quality, we are  working on a multi-year water management improvement project. Dewatering Does the removal of water from the operational areas of our sites  impact regional aquifers or our mine plans?  Impacts associated with dewatering and water supply activities in  the Pilbara, Western Australia, Australia are recognised as a very  high risk for our business. Returning water to the aquifers  impacted by our mining activities in a controlled manner is the  focus of a number of ongoing studies. We are also continuing to  work with Traditional Owners on water management. Long-term obligations Do our operational activities generate long-term or ongoing  obligations related to water? We may sometimes generate impacts that we are required to  manage over the long term, such as post-closure pit lakes in the  Pilbara, or potential seepage from our waste rock or tailings facilities  in our aluminium and copper sites. Our systems and standards aim  to ensure that risks are identified early and managed appropriately  and responsibly throughout the asset life cycle.  l Not applicable l Low risk l Moderate risk l High risk l Very high risk 1. Due to rounding, the sum may not total 100%. To manage our water impacts, we first need  to understand the specific risks at more than  50 operating sites, as well as our overall  Group impacts. To do this, we have  developed a water risk framework that  considers 4 risk categories: – water resource – water quality and quantity – dewatering – long-term obligations. We use this framework to identify, assess and  manage water risks. This comprehensive  approach extends beyond our mandatory  reporting obligations and allows us to have  relevant conversations about water risks  internally and with stakeholders in the  communities where we operate. In 2024, we  continued to embed the Group water control  library, a suite of critical controls and  associated performance requirements, to  manage our water risks. Our Group water risk profile shows the level  of exposure against each of the 4 risk  categories. Most of our water risks sit in the  low to moderate range. There are some in  very high and high categories for each.  Regardless of the level of risk, we apply  rigorous standards and processes to  manage them. Above, we give examples of  how the risk framework has been applied  across some of our assets.

The reported categories correlate with the  requirements of ICMM and the GRI.  We also report on our aggregated water  balance for sites in water-stressed areas.  We assess water stress using the WRI’s  Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas mapping tool. For more information see our  2024 Sustainability Fact Book at  riotinto.com/sustainabilityreporting Our water numbers Our total operational withdrawals for 2024  were 1,230 gigalitres (GL) (2023: 1,169GL).  Freshwater, or category 1 quality,  withdrawals accounted for 412GL or 33% of  this total (2023: 424GL). Freshwater is  generally suitable for consumption with  minimal treatment required. Where possible,  we aim to minimise our extractions from  water sources of this quality. Total discharges for 2024 were 668GL  (2023: 692GL). Total water recycled or  reused for 2024 was 300GL (2023: 303GL). Our activity In 2024, we completed our 2019-2023  water targets program by incorporating  2023 water usage data into our Surface  Water Allocation Disclosure dashboard. We  will continue adding new data to this  dashboard to maintain a rolling 5-year  history. We have also been working on  preparing an expansion of the same  dashboard to include groundwater data,  with an aim to release this update in 2025.  We progressed work on improving our  understanding of the cultural value of water  as part of an initiative being advanced by  our Australian Advisory Group. We also  continued to develop our Water Risk  Framework by enhancing our Group water  control library, as part of our Group-wide  refreshed assurance program.  For more information see riotinto.com/ water   Biodiversity We depend on healthy ecosystems to run a  sustainable business, and recognise our  responsibility to minimise and mitigate our  impacts on nature. We seek opportunities to  achieve no net loss of biodiversity, and protect  and restore ecosystems where we operate. We recognise that the interconnected  impacts of climate change and nature loss  pose significant risks both to people and the  environment on which we all rely. Biological  diversity (biodiversity) is the foundation of  healthy ecosystems, which provide valuable  services that directly benefit the environment,  society and industries, including ours. Healthy  ecosystems support vital processes such as  water purification, soil stabilisation and  climate regulation – key aspects that  underpin safe and efficient mining and  processing practices. We also embrace, and are responding to,  increasing societal expectations for  improving our environmental performance,  societal engagement, transparency and  accountability across our value chain. Managing biodiversity risk  Biodiversity impacts and dependencies are  crucial concepts in understanding the  interconnected relationship between  people and the natural environment, and  addressing these impacts and  dependencies are essential to developing  sustainable practices that conserve  biodiversity and support society.  Biodiversity impacts refer to the effects of  activities on the variety of life in a particular  habitat or ecosystem. While some impacts  are positive, there are several pressures that  need to be managed, including: – Ecosystems alteration: Urbanisation,  agriculture and industrialisation can  change water course, drainage patterns  and soil composition, affecting  ecosystem functions. – Pollution: Contaminants such as  chemicals, plastics, or discharges to air  and water can degrade ecosystems,  posing a risk to the health of species. – Climate change: Shifting climate  patterns and extreme events can disrupt  habitats, forcing species to migrate,  adapt or face extinction. – Overexploitation: Practices like  excessive fishing, hunting, and plant  harvesting, can reduce species  populations and diversity. – Invasive species: The introduction of  non-native species can disrupt  ecosystems by out-competing native  species, predating on them, or  introducing new diseases. – Fragmentation: The division of habitats  into smaller, isolated patches can reduce  species' range and hinder their ability to  reproduce, find food or adapt to  environmental changes. Biodiversity dependencies consider how  people and society rely on, or hold  connections to, ecosystems, which are vital  for both biodiversity and supporting various  industries, such as mining and processing.  Examples can include:  – Natural regulation: Processes such as  pollination, disease and pest regulation,  water purification, climate regulation,  carbon sequestration and soil stability. – Essential services: Access to food and  agriculture, raw materials, medicinal  resources, and fresh water. – Cultural connection: The deep connection  Indigenous and land-connected Peoples  have to, and their vast knowledge of, the  land, water and environment, as well as the  role nature plays in cultural traditions,  identity, and heritage.  – Supporting foundations: Nutrient cycling,  photosynthesis and soil formation. Understanding these impacts and  dependencies, we continue to assess our  nature-related risks across our operations  and associated activities. 2024 progress We are active members of ICMM and other  industry associations and working groups  seeking to drive improvements for our  industry. Our involvement in the  ICMM Taskforce on Nature-related  Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Working  Group, GRI Biodiversity Technical  Committee and the ICMM Nature Working  Group have also contributed to the  development of important industry  resources, including the ICMM’s Nature  Position Statement, the GRI Biodiversity  Standard, the draft Consolidated Mining  Standard, and the TNFD framework. We are stronger together in tackling these  challenges. For example, through our  ongoing membership of the ICMM Nature  Working Group and continued engagement  with the Proteus Partnership - a unique  partnership agreement between major  businesses and the UN Environment  Programme World Conservation Monitoring  Centre (UNEP WCMC), which aims to make  global environmental information available  to support better decisions - and our  longstanding partnership with BirdLife  International.  Progress highlights for 2024 include: – Revised biodiversity priority site  assessment of our operating asset  potential impacts in the areas where we  operate by using global datasets of  threatened species, key biodiversity  areas, and protected areas, developed  by the UNEP WCMC. Refer to the 2024  Sustainability Fact Book for the  assessment outcomes. – Natural capital assessment pilot for our  Gove operations in the Northern Territory,  Australia to inform the understanding and  development of the natural capital  decision-making process to support  nature value accretion for all stakeholders  through the mine closure process. – Development of a systematic  methodology and a consultative  approach in understanding biodiversity  material exposures and opportunities  across our value chain. For more information see riotinto.com/ biodiversity Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Environment  Annual Report 2024 37 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 40 ===== Land In 2024, we rehabilitated 37 square  kilometres (km2) of land, mostly at our bauxite  mines in Australia and iron ore mines and  exploration areas in the Pilbara, Western  Australia. We also developed a geospatial  dashboard for internal use that displays each  asset’s disturbance and rehabilitation  footprint, to help our business better  understand the impacts of our land  stewardship performance. In Mongolia, we have rehabilitated 2.1km2 of  abandoned mine workings based outside  our operational footprint, along valley floors  and river beds in the Darkhan-Uul province.  This is part of Oyu Tolgoi’s commitment to  the Government of Mongolia’s national  movement to plant one billion trees  by 2030. We built and transitioned to the community  2 tree nurseries in the South Gobi, with a  capacity to produce 750,000 saplings a  year. We planted one million trees and  distributed 80,000 trees to Oyu Tolgoi’s  employees, and provided 4 scholarships to  students to study forestry. In 2024, our land footprint – total disturbed  area – was 1,762km2, a decrease of 51km2  compared to 2023. This includes all  disturbances at our operating assets and  activities, such as exploration activities,  smelters, mines and supporting  infrastructure. Our rehabilitation teams continue to  partner with research centres and  universities to refine our rehabilitation  approaches and improve outcomes.  At our bauxite mines and refineries, we have  continued trials focusing on transforming  stored tailing material into soils that will  support plant growth. We also continued  trials using satellite and unmanned aerial  vehicle-derived data to test methodologies  aimed at providing insights to support  on-ground monitoring for vegetation and  erosion monitoring of rehabilitation. In  addition, 13 of our operations completed  rehabilitation trials to improve seed  germination, erosion and topsoil quality. For more information about our closure  work see page 39. Waste Waste and residues from our operational  activities are key areas of our environmental  risk management. In 2024, we continued to  focus on managing potential contamination  from these sources.  At some of our long-life assets, we continue  to evaluate waste management practices of  the past that have led to a need for  remediation in the present. We focus on  finding better ways™ to extract maximum  value and to transform waste and  by-products from our operations into  materials the world needs. One example is  our work to sustainably extract and produce  high-purity scandium oxide at Sorel-Tracy  and tellurium at Kennecott. We also continue to look for opportunities  to repurpose items we purchase at the end  of useful life. For example, over the last  2 years, we have partnered with a local  business to recycle end-of-life tyres and  conveyor belts used to move ore from our  operations across northern Australia.  Following a successful trial at the Argyle  diamond mine in 2023, we have expanded  the trial to Yarwun, Weipa and Boyne  Smelters Limited in Queensland. Some of our assets generate mineral waste  with the potential to be chemically reactive,  requiring careful management to prevent  environmental impacts. We conduct  independent reviews every 4 years to  assess the effectiveness of our risk  management programs and identify areas  for improvement. In 2024, we completed  this at 2 sites – Iron Ore Company of  Canada (IOC) mining operations in  Labrador City, Newfoundland and Labrador  in Canada, and QIT Madagascar Minerals  (QMM) near Fort Dauphin in the Anosy  region of south-eastern Madagascar.  Further opportunities to improve mineral  waste management will continue at both  sites in the short and long term. For more information about tailings  see page 39. Air quality Clean air is critical for the health of host  communities and the surrounding  ecosystems. We are working to improve air  quality management, focusing on emissions  of particulate matter and gases from our  operational activities, including mining,  materials handling, processing and  transportation. The potentially hazardous  emissions we monitor at operations are: – sulphur oxides (SOx), mainly at our  aluminium and copper smelters – nitrogen oxides (NOx), mainly from  burning fossil fuels – gaseous fluoride emissions from  aluminium smelters – respirable particulate emissions (PM10  and PM2.5), very fine particles from  mining and processing operations and  from burning fossil fuels. We focus on reducing emissions at source  by upgrading equipment to use the most  appropriately available technologies, adding  air pollution control equipment,  implementing mitigation measures and  using renewable energy or alternative feed  material where possible. Our air quality  management programs include monitoring,  sampling at source, incident tracking and  risk assessments.  Many of our assets have multi-year air  quality improvement projects in place. For  example, at IOC, there is a multidisciplinary  working group focused on assessing dust  abatement options. We are mitigating dust  at the source by introducing new dust  control technology. The working group is  also exploring new mitigation options to  further limit fugitive dust emissions from  our operations.  We have expanded our air quality  monitoring network at IOC’s mine in Labrador  City and at our Rio Tinto Iron & Titanium  Quebec Operations Sorel-Tracy plant. In some instances, we exceeded permissible  dust levels at nearby air quality monitoring  stations. We investigated all high dust  concentration events. Most resulted from  unusual forest fires, such as those close to  our operations in Labrador City, Canada,  where exceedances were observed over a  large region. Where IOC was found to have  caused the reporting exceedance, it was  due to calm winds and atmospheric  inversions when contaminants from the  induration stacks cannot disperse in the  atmosphere and remain close to ground  level. Improving our air quality monitoring  network over the coming years will help us  to prevent dust incidents in the future.

We measure and rate incidents according to their actual environmental and  compliance impacts using 5 severity categories: very low, low, moderate, high and very high. Very high and high environmental incidents are usually reported to the relevant product  group head and the Rio Tinto Chief Executive as soon as possible.  2. In 2024, we paid environmental fines from damage to water resources and pollution caused by using sub-standard seepage water for dust suppression on roads at Oyu Tolgoi,  Mongolia; penalty infringement notices associated with maintenance of a failed coke unloader, maintenance of a failed roof manifold, and release of a prescribed water contaminant at  Boyne Smelters Limited, Australia; contaminants release at an unauthorized point and failure to install and maintain required equipment, leading to non-compliance with environmental  authority conditions at Yarwun, Australia; facility acquired equipment without obtaining the required air permit approval at Boron operations, USA; discharge of pollutants into storm  drains and surface waters at Wilmington operations, USA; release of a contaminant into the environment exceeding the legal limit at Havre-Saint-Pierre, Canada; non-compliance with  Environmental Quality Act at Vaudreuil plant, Canada. 3. A reduction in cumulative disturbance from 2023-2024 is a result of the sale of Dampier Salt Limited’s Lake MacLeod operation.  Note: The numbers may change year to year and retrospectively due to reconciliations of data.  Mining and metals practices Tailings We engage with stakeholders throughout the  life cycle of our tailings storage facilities, from  design to closure. We also collaborate closely  with external bodies to improve the way  tailings are managed across our industry.  We operate 104 tailings storage facilities (TSFs)  across our global assets. Thirty-eight are active  TSFs, 24 are inactive and 42 are closed.  We work through technical committees and  joint venture relationships to support leading  practice in tailings management. Our full  tailings disclosure is available on our website.  We periodically update the list of TSFs to  reflect operational and ownership changes.  These include changes due to the transition  to closure or remediation obligations for  legacy assets, and reclassification of facilities.  Our facilities are regulated and permitted and  have been managed for many years to  comply with local laws, regulations, permits,  licences and other requirements. Tailings  management has been included in the Group  risk register since 2010, and our Group safety  standard for tailings and water storage  facilities has been in place since 2015. Our  internal assurance processes verify that our  managed TSFs operate in accordance with  this standard, which we updated in 2021. Our TSFs have emergency response plans –  tested through training exercises in  collaboration with stakeholders such as local  emergency services – and follow strict business  resilience and communication protocols. 2024 progress We have continued to progress our  implementation of the Global Industry  Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM).  This focuses on preventing tailings facility  failures, reducing the social and  environmental impacts of tailings facilities,  and improving engagement and  transparency on tailings with local  communities. We have also assessed our  progress on implementation through self- assessment and independent audits, using  ICMM’s GISTM Conformance Protocols.  In 2024, we completed implementation work  for the tailings facilities that have a “Very  High” or “Extreme” consequence  classification, except where longer-term  engineering works are required. However,  there is still work to do to embed the  changes made. The product group and  Closure implementation teams continue to  work towards full conformance for the  remaining tailings facilities by August 2025.  In August 2024, in accordance with Principle  15 of the GISTM, we updated our public tailings  disclosures for the “Very High” and “Extreme”  tailings storage facilities we operate.  We also updated our disclosures for the  other tailings facilities we operate that have  lower GISTM consequence classifications,  based on the Investor Mining and Tailings  Safety Initiative (IMTSI) request for public  disclosures on tailings. For more information see riotinto.com/ tailings In 2024, we:  – Continued to regularly convene the Tailings  Management Committee with our  designated Accountable Executives. This  provides coordinated governance of tailings  management practices across the Group. – Conducted multidisciplinary risk  assessments for all our “Very High” and  “Extreme” consequence facilities.   – Continued to play an active role in the ICMM  tailings working group, which provides  guidance to support the safe, responsible  management of tailings with the goal of  eliminating fatalities and catastrophic events.   Closure and repurposing We are committed to being responsible  operators throughout the entire life of our  assets, delivering value at every stage –  from discovery to closure. Today, we plan for the end right from the  beginning, incorporating closure in each  stage of the asset lifecycle in the way we  design, build and operate. We work with communities, governments  and other stakeholders to complete closure  activities and repurpose and renew sites for  their next use.  At the end of 2024, closure provisions on  our balance sheet totalled $15.7 billion  (2023: $17.2 billion).  2024 progress In 2024, we continued to mature our  closure practices and develop our expertise  through our approach.  Argyle diamond mine We are rehabilitating the Argyle diamond  mine on the traditional lands of the  Miriwoong and Gija People in Western  Australia. We have made significant  progress on reprofiling the former  processing plant area and waste rock  dumps, as well as capping the tailings  storage facility. We have reached over 60%  overall project completion, and plans are  underway to start removing the Argyle mine  accommodation facilities, airport and  utilities infrastructure in 2025.  We are continuing to review our contracting  strategy to increase work awarded to  Traditional Owner businesses and increased  our spend to A$44.9 million in 2024 (2023:  A$37 million).  Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Environment  Annual Report 2024 39 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 42 ===== Gove refinery and residue  disposal areas In 2024, we reached the halfway mark for the  demolition works at the Gove alumina  refinery in the Northern Territory, which is  Australia’s largest demolition project.  We have removed the refinery’s liquor  purification units and other structures,  processing around 63,000 tonnes of scrap  steel for recycling.  The majority of the rehabilitation of the  former tailings dam, Pond 5, is complete,  with the opening of 3 spillways to allow  appropriate drainage from the newly  capped surface. We continue to work  closely with Gumatj and Rirratjingu  Traditional Owners, and the Northern  Territory Government, to plan for a future  beyond mining. In 2024, we spent A$85.5  million with Traditional Owner businesses  (2023: A$94 million).  Ranger Rehabilitation Project In April 2024, we entered into a Management  Services Agreement (MSA) with Energy  Resources of Australia (ERA) to manage the  Ranger Rehabilitation Project with oversight  from the ERA board. The MSA builds on  ERA’s existing rehabilitation work and allows  us to directly share our technical expertise in  designing, scoping and executing closure  projects, including stakeholder and delivery  partner relationships.  In November 2024, ERA concluded its  entitlement offer and shortfall bookbuild, which  raised A$766.5 million (before costs) to fund  planned rehabilitation activities of the Ranger  Project Area until approximately the third  quarter of 2027. As a result of Rio Tinto taking  up its pro rata entitlements in the entitlement  offer and the level of participation by other  ERA shareholders, we hold approximately  98.43% of ERA’s shares. As previously stated,  we intend to move forward with compulsory  acquisition of all remaining ERA shares we do  not currently own.  Since commencing management of the  Ranger Rehabilitation Project in July 2024,  we have progressed work in Pit 3, preparing  the area for capping using amphirollers to  dry the area and starting the geotextile laying.  We remain committed to the successful  rehabilitation of the Ranger Project Area to  a standard that will establish an  environment similar to the adjacent Kakadu  National Park, a World Heritage site. We  continue to work with all key stakeholders,  including the Mirarr People to complete this  important rehabilitation project. Legacy assets We manage over 90 legacy assets in 9  countries and 35 tailings storage facilities  across our portfolio. For more information on  tailings management, see page 39. In 2024,  we progressed our study program to look for  opportunities to further optimise the long- term management of our legacy portfolio.  Our approach We proactively manage closure across our  business and make decisions based on the  full picture. This starts with strong  governance and a common approach  across our assets globally. In 2023, we made it easier for operating  assets to fund progressive closure work to  reduce our impact. In 2024 we saw an  increase in progressive closure spend of  40%. This important work helps to reduce our  impact and reduces closure costs long term.  We develop asset closure strategies to  identify potential future land uses and focus  on opportunities to reduce closure costs and  risks over the asset life cycle. We completed  4 additional asset closure strategies in 2024,  and now have these in place for 62% of our  active operations. All of our operating sites  have closure plans, and we are developing  closure plans for assets that have an  indefinite life, such as some port facilities. We  review these plans regularly to align with  stakeholder expectations and to incorporate  lessons learned from other closure projects.  At operations with joint ownership structures,  we endeavour to work in partnership with  other asset owners to ensure we consider  closure through asset design, planning  and operations. A Closure Steering Committee, with  senior representatives from across our  business and chaired by Kellie Parker,  Chief Executive Australia, provides  oversight to our approach and finds  opportunities for improvements and  alignment across the business. We actively manage risk and find  commercial opportunities within our  portfolio. In 2024:  – We sold our interests in Sweetwater, a  former uranium legacy site in Wyoming,  US, for cash proceeds of $175 million.  This supports the local economy with a  new owner who is actively expanding  operations in the region. – We signed an agreement with Alteo for  Rio Tinto to be the last operator of the  Mange-Garri bauxite residue disposal  area in France to manage rehabilitation  and support repurposing. Alteo will  continue to operate and retain  responsibility for the Gardanne refinery.  Through targeted research and  development, we work to solve the  challenges of the future to reduce our  liabilities and create better outcomes.  We continued partnering with research and  academic organisations, start-ups and  technology solutions providers to find better  ways to close and repurpose our assets.  These include opportunities to reprocess  mineral and industrial residues, selectively  recover minerals from mine-influenced  waters, augment our knowledge base for  closure, and improve the rehabilitation and  revegetation execution and monitoring. – We have been progressing our research  and development program, seeking to  remediate and unlock value from our mine- influenced waters. The initiative rethinks  widely established chemical water  treatment practices. It explores instead the  possibility of extracting selected  constituents, including potentially high- value ones, in a high-quality form that can  be commercialised. We are building a  testbed facility at our Kennecott copper  operations in Utah, US, to conduct the first  technology trials in a real environment. – We started a project with the University  of Queensland to develop new ways to  monitor mine residues using drones and  ground sensors, improving safety and  land rehabilitation across mine sites. – We initiated a broad-acre field trial  investigating the scalability of converting  bauxite tailings into technosol, a growth  medium used for rehabilitation. The objective  is to provide an alternative to imported  topsoil during progressive rehabilitation  activities. The trial builds on previous  greenhouse studies and incorporates local  knowledge to define success criteria. – We are developing digital tools that help  us track our progress and predict  trajectories towards rehabilitation and  closure completion criteria on mine sites,  and combine in situ and remote sensing. For more information about our closure  risks see page 94. Partnering for the future To meet our commitments now and into the  future we work in partnership: – We announced two new 5.25MW solar  farms in the Northern Territory, Australia  at our Gove operations, to secure a  more sustainable power supply for the  region beyond mining. – We progressed our partnership with the  University of British Columbia and Curtin  University to develop the capabilities  needed to support closure in the future  through launching a third unit in the micro- credentials program. Since the program  launched in late 2023, 141 Rio Tinto  students have completed it, and there has  been good uptake from other mining  companies and government agencies. – We partnered with Curtin University to  support the development of the  Undergraduate Certificate in Land, Sea,  and River First Nation Ranger  Management and Practice, designed to  enhance the skills of Australian  Traditional Owner and Ranger Groups  through a comprehensive range of  capability development options. – We expanded an end-of-life tyres and  belts recycling trial to Yarwun, Weipa and  Boyne Smelters Limited in Queensland,  Australia to proactively reduce our waste  inventory and explore circular economy  opportunities. This follows successfully  recycling 800 tonnes of end-of-life tyres  and conveyor belts from the Argyle  diamond mine in 2023.

Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Environment  Annual Report 2024 40 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 43 ===== Our 2025 Climate Action Plan The materials we produce and  the way we provide them to  society matter. We have  ambitious emissions reduction  targets and are now delivering  against those.  Decarbonisation is good for our business  and gives us confidence in the future. We  are a significant energy user and parts of  our portfolio are hard-to-abate, so it is  exciting to see some real momentum this  year, in both reductions in emissions and  project approvals. Since we set our targets, we have delivered  5Mt CO2e in operational emissions  abatement, and our gross emissions are  now 14% below 2018 levels, primarily from renewable electricity contracts. Additionally,  in 2024 we have committed to abatement  projects, totalling 3.6Mt CO2e which are  expected to contribute to our target to  reduce net emissions by 50% by 2030. The challenge is not straightforward - we  need to navigate a complex, rapidly evolving  regulatory landscape - but we are making  progress and maintaining financial discipline  while we do this. Despite the fragmented  policy landscape, decarbonisation can still be  good economics. Our projects are typically  net present value positive or neutral and  enhance the value of our business by  reducing our exposure to volatile fossil fuel  prices and higher carbon penalty costs.  Our decarbonisation investment process is  rigorous and rational and it aims to secure  structural, long-term, cost-efficient,  low-carbon alternative energy supplies. We are also supporting our customers  and suppliers in reducing emissions  from our value chain, particularly those  from steelmaking. We are acting now and  investing in breakthroughs such as  BioIron™ and electric smelting to scale up  these new technologies. While we still have a long way to go, I am  proud of the progress our teams have  made so far. Our Climate Action Plan  creates long-term value for our  shareholders which is why we are  recommending it for their approval at  our annual general meetings.  Jakob Stausholm Chief Executive About this Climate Action Plan and our reporting obligations Our first Climate Action Plan (CAP) was  approved by investors at our 2022 AGMs.  At that time, we included a commitment to  report on our progress annually and update  the CAP every 3 years. This updated 2025  CAP retains our commitments to  decarbonise our assets and work with  customers and suppliers to reduce our  value chain emissions. It also shows how  the energy transition is at the heart of  our strategy. The Board will put this updated CAP to  shareholders for a non-binding advisory  vote at the 2025 AGMs. In 2024, for the first time, we have fully  integrated climate disclosures into our  Annual Report. This aligns with our  commitment to continually improve our  reporting and align with emerging  standards, including the International  Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB)  International Financial Reporting Standard  (IFRS) for climate-related disclosures (S2).  We support the ISSB’s goal to harmonise  disclosures about transition plans, and have  also considered the key principles of the  Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT) Framework  in setting out our CAP. Our reporting is also  guided by the CA100+ Net Zero Company  Benchmark and their Standard for  mining companies.

This global shift to a low-carbon economy is driving unprecedented demand for our commodities. Our ambition is to grow  total production by ~3% per year on a copper equivalent basis1.      Highlights across our portfolio Iron ore – High-grade iron ore from Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC) and  Simandou in Guinea is essential for the production of low-carbon steel. – Investment in the development of our Pilbara operations and the  technology needed to produce low-carbon steel. Aluminium – Acquisition of a 50% stake in Matalco in 2023 supports the growing  demand for low-carbon and recycled products. – A US$1.1 billion investment in expanding the AP Technology™ AP60  aluminium smelter in Quebec.  – Investment in ELYSISTM technology development and trials. Minerals – The Rincon lithium project in Argentina achieved first production.  – Acquisition of the Burra™ Scandium Project in Australia.  – Our recent agreement to acquire Arcadium Lithium plc will, subject to  acquisition completion, enable us to provide many of the key materials  that go into electric vehicle batteries. Copper – Having increased our equity in 2022, the expansion of the Oyu Tolgoi  underground mine in Mongolia is a cornerstone of our copper strategy.  – Expanding underground mining at Kennecott, targeting an additional  250,000 tonnes of copper production over the next decade2.  – Joint venture with First Quantum Minerals on the La Granja project in  Peru, one of the world’s largest undeveloped copper deposits.  1. Ambition for compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for copper equivalent production from 2024 to 2033, including inorganic lithium growth. 2. The production target of around 250,000 tonnes of additional mined copper over the next 10 years (2023 to 2033) at Kennecott was previously reported in a release to the Australian  Securities Exchange (ASX) dated 20 June 2023 titled “Rio Tinto invests to strengthen copper supply in US”. Rio Tinto confirms that all material assumptions underpinning that  production target continue to apply and have not materially changed. Using scenarios to identify climate risks and portfolio opportunities Although climate change presents clear  growth opportunities for our commodities,  it also presents both physical and transition  risks to our portfolio if we fail to align our  business with a net zero future. The  transition to a low-carbon economy  impacts the commodities we produce and  how they are processed in our value chains  – particularly for carbon-intensive steel and  aluminium production. Carbon pricing  regulation is currently applied to our  operations and our customers. Increasing  climate policy ambition can therefore affect  our operational costs, markets and  technology development. Physical risks  such as extreme weather events, rising sea  levels and temperature fluctuations can  disrupt our supply chains, damage  infrastructure and impact the availability  and cost of raw materials. We use scenarios to identify and assess risks  and opportunities, including climate, that may  affect our business in the medium and long  term. To assess transition risks, we use  market analysis for our short-term outlook,  and our Conviction and Resilience scenarios  for our medium- and long-term assessment.  For physical risks, we use an intermediate  and high emissions scenario. For planning  purposes, we define short-term as up to 2  years, medium-term as 2 to 10 years and  long-term as beyond 10 years. Our short-term timeframe aligns with our  annual planning process. The medium-term  timeframe aligns to extended planning  horizons for our growth projects and emissions  abatement projects. Our long-term timeframe  considers the full lifespan of our mining assets  and infrastructure, and the continued impact  climate risks and opportunities are expected to  have on the business. Inevitably there is  increasing uncertainty in the assumptions and  projections further into the future, so there is  inherent uncertainty in the assessment of risks  and opportunities presented below. Short-term assessment: While scenarios  provide a valuable long-term perspective, our  short-term outlook is guided by market analysis.  This allows us to respond swiftly to immediate  market conditions and trends, ensuring we are  agile and competitive in the near term.  Medium- and long-term assessment:  We use these scenarios to: – Identify and evaluate risks: These  include climate-related physical and  transition risks, both of which can impact  our business model, financial  performance and market positioning. – Assess opportunities: Explore  opportunities for innovation and  adaptation, such as the development of  low-carbon technologies and the  transition to renewable energy sources. – Inform strategic planning: Inform our  strategic decisions and investments,  ensuring our business remains resilient  and able to adapt to, and mitigate, the  challenges posed by climate change. Our scenario approach is reviewed every year  as part of our Group strategy engagement with  the Board. We do not undertake climate  modelling ourselves, rather we determine the  approximate temperature outcomes in 2100 by  comparing the emissions pathways to 2050 in  each of our scenarios with the Shared Socio- Economic Pathways (SSP) set out in the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report. We also  consider the carbon budgets associated with  different temperature outcomes which are  inevitably uncertain.  In 2024, we updated the scenario framework  used to assess the resilience of our business  under different transition-related scenarios.  Our Conviction and Resilience scenarios  translate our beliefs of the future into  macroeconomic drivers and improve our  understanding of policy impacts. These  scenarios underpin our fundamental  assumptions about long-term trends and  we believe they cover a realistic range of  future outcomes. They reflect what we  anticipate will happen rather than our  aspirations. Our core scenarios are crucial  in guiding our investment strategies and  overall portfolio strategy.  Additional scenarios (including our 1.5°C- aligned Aspirational Leadership scenario) are  used to further evaluate the positive and  negative effects of the energy transition  across our portfolio. By considering various  future scenarios, we can identify risks and  opportunities, adapt to changes, and  maintain a resilient portfolio. Our short-term carbon pricing assumptions  align with consensus price forecasts in each  region, accounting for transitional assistance,  such as free allocation, where appropriate.  Medium- to long-term carbon prices are  determined by national climate targets, and  our understanding of the marginal abatement  costs and objectives for each scheme.  The temperature outcomes of scenarios  and sensitivities are derived from complex  modelling which continues to evolve and is  inherently uncertain. The emissions  pathways in Conviction and Resilience limit  temperature rises to around 2.1°C, and  around 2.5°C by 2100 respectively, roughly  aligning with IPCC’s intermediate emissions  scenario (SSP2-4.5). We also use the  SSP2-4.5 and highest emissions scenario  (SSP5-8.5) in our bottom-up asset-level  physical risk and resilience assessments.  See pages 66-69 for more information.  Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Climate Action Plan Annual Report 2024 43 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 46 ===== Our core scenarios Conviction This is our “central case” scenario and underlies strategic  planning and portfolio investment decisions across the Group.  Consequently we limit disclosure of our assumptions in Conviction.  In this scenario, countries will decarbonise at a moderate pace, with  greater awareness of climate-related physical damage triggering  more radical climate action over time. Real gross domestic product  (GDP) grows at 2.5% between 2023-2050, but energy intensity of  GDP reduces approximately 2.7% per year due to sectoral shifts  and greater efficiency. For the next decade, greenhouse gas (GHG)  emissions are slightly higher than those in the Resilience scenario  due to a higher GDP, but emissions then decline at a rapid rate due  to increased low-carbon electrification which supplies around half  of final energy by 2050. In Conviction, climate policies become  more ambitious and effective over time resulting in a temperature  rise of around 2.1°C in 2100. The impact on corporate balance  sheets will be mixed - overall, although carbon pricing varies by  region, it will increase costs. GDP growth and the global energy  transition are expected to increase demand for copper, lithium  and aluminium through to 2050. Steel demand is expected to  grow more modestly, and incentives to recycle scrap increase.  Lower quality iron ore products are expected to receive  greater discounts.  Resilience Although described as a scenario, Resilience is simply a  sensitivity analysis that is designed to test our annual plan  and investment proposals. Weaker governance, declining  global trade, and lower economic growth lead to less effective  climate action. Real GDP growth only averages 1.6% between  2023 and 2050. Lower economic growth and a slower energy  transition lead to lower commodity demand and prices across  all time periods compared to Conviction. Lower policy ambition  and the inability of the international community to tackle  carbon leakage without resorting to protectionism leads to  climate policies advancing sporadically and in an uncoordinated  way. Overall there is only a 30% reduction in GHG emissions  by 2050. The result is a temperature rise of around 2.5°C  by 2100. Consequently, climate-related weather events  and natural disasters become more frequent and severe  in this scenario but are met by fragmented and variable  policy responses.  Aspirational Leadership scenario 1.5°C  This scenario reflects our view of a world of high economic growth, significant social change and accelerated climate action that achieves  net zero emissions by mid-century. While GDP growth is similar to that in our Conviction scenario, significantly more ambitious climate policy  limits warming to 1.5°C (aligning with SSP1-1.9). This scenario affects our balance sheet in different ways and is subject to great uncertainty.  Overall, in Aspirational Leadership the Group's economic performance would fall between Conviction and Resilience. While higher scrap use  reduces the medium-term demand for Pilbara products, increased carbon pricing and penalties boost long-term demand for high-grade  iron ore. Aluminium demand growth is limited in the short term, but increases in the longer term. Copper demand grows due to increasing  electrification, strong GDP growth, and accelerated electric vehicle (EV) penetration. These trends also support minerals projects. Despite global agreements reached in Glasgow and Dubai, emissions today continue to rise, making the 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement  unlikely to be achieved. Our operational emissions targets align with 1.5°C, and consequently, so do our decarbonisation investment  decisions. However, we do not use Aspirational Leadership in our broader strategic or investment decision-making and so did not update all  the assumptions Aspirational Leadership in 2024. Overall, based on the Aspirational Leadership scenario pricing outcomes, and with all  other assumptions remaining consistent with those applied to our 2024 financial statements, we do not currently envisage a material  adverse impact of the 1.5°C Paris-aligned sensitivity on asset carrying values, remaining useful life, or closure and rehabilitation provisions  for the Group. It is possible that other factors may arise in the future, which are not known today, that may impact this assessment. Additional scenario parameters The next table shows some of the key data points that define our scenarios. The new central case “Conviction” scenario assumes climate  policy ambition is almost equal to that in our previous scenario “Competitive Leadership”. This reflects our observation of higher carbon  price expectations and more concrete national mitigation plans. These data points are derived from our internal macroeconomic and energy  models and form the basis for all our long-term commodity analysis.

Indicates annual % growth of total electricity generation and non-fossil electricity generation. Transition risks and opportunities are broadly higher in the Conviction scenario than in the Resilience scenario due to greater volatility.  In addition to the demand outlook, the main factors which influence whether operations stand to gain or lose from the energy transition  include how emission-intensive an operation is relative to its industry peers, its geographical location (affecting which climate policies it will  be subject to), and how suitable the product is for downstream decarbonisation.  There are no portfolio adjustments made to the Group’s medium to long-term plan under the various scenarios. Additionally, as our  macroeconomic modelling involves a range of variables, isolating and measuring the impact of specific climate risks and opportunities  is challenging. Therefore, the potential quantitative financial impacts are not disclosed. Furthermore, we do not publish our commodity  price forecasts as this would weaken our position in commercial negotiations and might give rise to concerns from regulators and  market participants. As good practice on scenario analysis and climate modelling evolves, we will continue to evaluate the robustness of our  assessments of climate-related risks and opportunities drawing on more recently published studies and analysis.

Our ambition is to grow total production by ~3%  per year on a copper equivalent basis from 2024 to 2033. l Climate policy-related costs are rising in all regions, but  considerably faster in OECD countries. These are likely to  rise quickly in Conviction, creating financial incentives to  undertake decarbonisation at many of our operations. In  Resilience, carbon prices in developing countries increase  more slowly. l By 2030, carbon penalties are projected to cost $0.3 billion  annually, rising to $0.6 billion by 2040 assuming there is no  reduction in our emissions.  l Recycling and end-use efficiency improvements put downward pressure  on demand, especially in Conviction, displacing some high-cost supply in  our key markets. This will not be enough to offset growth in demand for  primary supply. l In Conviction, decarbonisation will become increasingly important to gain a  social licence to develop new greenfield projects and for existing operations  to remain profitable. However, carbon costs will be offset by higher  commodity prices, and the potential for low-carbon operations to gain a  competitive advantage in some markets. In Aspirational Leadership, demand  for transition materials in the long-term offsets slightly lower demand for lower  grade iron ore.  Iron ore l Carbon costs are expected to rise at our Australian  operations, but they represent a small component of our  overall costs, and will therefore only have a limited impact on  our margins during this time period. l Steel producers are protected from rising carbon prices by  transitional assistance (eg Europe) or exemption  mechanisms (eg China), resulting in a slower rate of  transitioning to low-carbon steelmaking. This limits any  potential impact on consumer preferences for different  kinds of iron ore. l There is lower GDP growth and lower demand for iron ore in  Resilience compared with Conviction in the medium and  long-term. l Rising carbon prices, especially in Conviction, will become more material at  our Australian and Canadian operations, and at the Simandou project  approximately a decade later. In Resilience, Simandou is likely to remain  unaffected by carbon costs for several decades. l As carbon prices rise, and transitional assistance is phased out, carbon  costs on steel producers will increasingly favour low-carbon steelmaking  and higher-quality ores. This will increase demand for our high-grade iron  ore from the Simandou and Canadian operations which also has lower  energy requirements when used in a blast furnace. l The impact of low-carbon steelmaking on the relative economic value of  different iron ore products, particularly lower grades, depends on the  different technologies that reach a mature phase of development.  Although consumer preferences may change, we also have some flexibility  to alter our products’ technical specification. Aluminium l Carbon costs are expected to rise, particularly at our  refineries and smelters in Eastern Australia which currently  rely on emission-intensive electricity. This will result in  increased energy costs. l Policies to prevent carbon leakage are likely to emerge,  supporting the continued production of aluminium in OECD  countries, but the implementation is highly uncertain. l The contribution of aluminium to Group EBITDA averaged  11% over the period 2019-23 (using long-run consensus  pricing). Given our ambition to diversify our portfolio, we  expect its contribution to rise to around 15% by 2033 (on a  consistent basis). l In Conviction, carbon prices will push aluminium producers in OECD  countries to switch to renewable and zero-carbon power and look for  alternatives to current anode technology (eg ELYSIS™). Lower prices in  Resilience may delay hard-to-abate decarbonisation by a decade or more l Our hydro-based production in Canada and decarbonisation projects in  Australia will find markets in regions with a low-carbon premium such  as Europe. l Annual demand for low carbon aluminium in Conviction is projected to be  approximately 1.8 times greater by 2050, while demand in demand in  Aspirational Leadership is expected to be higher than this. Copper l Electrification is supportive of near-term demand for  copper, which is crucial to products such as renewable  energy infrastructure and electric vehicles. Electric vehicles  use 3-4 times more copper than conventional vehicles. l Carbon costs at our operations (in the US, Mongolia, and  Chile) are currently low and unlikely be to material until the  mid to late 2030s in all scenarios. l The contribution of copper to Group EBITDA averaged 9%  over the period 2019-23 (using long-run consensus pricing).  Given our ambition to increase copper production, we  expect its contribution to rise to around 20% by 2033 (on a  consistent basis). l Electrification continues to support copper demand in both scenarios,  supporting prices and incentivising growth projects. Electricity  consumption growth is almost twice as strong in Conviction due to a  higher GDP and a faster energy transition. l Annual copper demand in Conviction is projected to be approximately 1.8  times greater by 2050, while demand in demand in Aspirational  Leadership is expected to be higher than this. l Copper smelting is less energy-intensive relative to other metals, further  supporting demand. Minerals l Increasing use of EVs supports strong growth in the demand  for battery minerals such as lithium. l Carbon costs are expected to rise at our mineral operations  in South Africa. l Higher demand and prices for transition materials in  Conviction and Aspirational Leadership than in Resilience in  the medium to long term. l The net impact of climate policy on our diamond business is  likely to be minimal as carbon costs are unlikely to be a large  fraction of their market value. l Lithium is expected to significantly contribute to the Group’s  production growth, and we expect its contribution to rise to  over 10% of Group EBITDA by 2033 (using long-run  consensus pricing, including inorganic lithium growth).  l Even though battery technologies will develop over time, demand for  primary lithium supply will be robust, with EVs dominating the market in  Conviction over the next couple of decades, especially in China and  Europe.  l Long-duration energy storage may support demand for lithium and other  battery materials, but there are competing alternative technologies. l Carbon costs will increase at energy-intensive titanium dioxide mining and  processing operations in South Africa and Canada, making continued use  of fossil fuels economically unattractive. l Digital technologies and ride sharing may lower the demand for personal  vehicle ownership in some markets. l Lithium demand is expected to grow more than 6 times by 2050 in  Conviction. Short-medium term (0-10 years) Long-term (beyond 10 years) Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Climate Action Plan Annual Report 2024 45 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 48 ===== Strategic alignment with the low-carbon transition With higher GDP growth and a faster low-carbon transition, our economic performance is stronger in Conviction than in Resilience. Higher  carbon penalties and the potential impact on demand for mid and lower grade iron ore result in weaker economic performance in  Aspirational Leadership than in Conviction. Overall, our portfolio is resilient under scenarios aligned with 1.5°C, 2.1°C and 2.5°C outcomes.  The low-carbon transition is at the heart of our strategy. This mitigates risks associated with stricter carbon regulations and changing  consumer preferences and positions us to capitalise on the growing demand for transition materials.  Transition materials metrics Our products are classified as key transition materials (KTM) and other transition materials (OTM), aligning with the CA100+ Net Zero  Standard for Diversified Mining Companies. Iron ore and gold are classified as transition neutral materials (TNM). We divested the last of our  coal assets in 2018. Production of KTMs and OTMs increased by 11% and 2% respectively in 2024 on a copper equivalent basis.

Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Climate Action Plan Annual Report 2024 46 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 49 ===== Scope 1 and 2 emissions: Reduce emissions from our own operations We aim to reduce our net Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 (relative to 2018 levels),  and to reach net zero by 2050. We follow the principles of the mitigation  hierarchy, prioritising abatement of  emissions from electricity generation and  use, process emissions and direct fuel  consumption. In line with the IFRS standard  on climate-related disclosures (S2), we  report gross and net emissions separately.  Our target applies to our net operational  emissions on an equity share basis. Our  gross Scope 1 and 2 emissions reductions  are expected to be at least 40% by 2030,  and the use of carbon credits towards our  target will be limited to 10% of our 2018  baseline. In 2024, our net emissions include  the use of Australian Carbon Credit Units  (ACCUs) by our Australian assets to comply  with the Safeguard Mechanism in the  calendar year 20241. Our targets cover  more than 95% of our operational  emissions and are calculated using the  market-based Scope 2 method. To ensure a  focus on real reductions and comparability  over time, we adjust our 2018 baseline to  exclude emissions reductions achieved by  divesting assets and allow increases  associated with acquisitions. While there is no universal standard for  determining the alignment of targets with  the Paris Agreement goals, we concluded  that our Scope 1 and 2 target for 2030  was aligned with efforts to limit warming to  1.5°C when we set it in 2021. At that time,  KPMG provided limited assurance over the  alignment of this target with efforts to limit  warming to 1.5°C. Our targets were not  set using a sectoral decarbonisation  approach as there was no sector-specific  methodology then. This remains the  case today.  We use emissions metrics and other  measures to track our progress towards  our targets. We monitor and report this  progress to the Executive Committee  through an internal quarterly reporting  process, which includes operational  emissions and progress on abatement  projects across our decarbonisation  programs. KPMG provided limited  assurance over our 2024 progress  reporting against our Climate Action Plan  in addition to its reasonable assurance of  our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and limited  assurance of Scope 3 emissions. KPMG’s  statement is included at the end of  the report.   The 4 most significant sources of  operational emissions are: – electricity (purchased and  generated) - 37% – carbon anodes in aluminium and  reductants in titanium dioxide  furnaces - 25% – fossil fuels for heat at our processing  plants and alumina refineries - 23% – diesel consumption by our mining  equipment and rail fleet - 13%. While our asset portfolio has evolved since  2018, as we orient our growth to transition  materials, the share of emissions from our  different commodities has remained stable.  Today, approximately two-thirds of our  emissions are generated from our  Aluminium business.   Our Group-wide consumption of electricity  is approximately 4 times that of other global  diversified mining majors, due to the high  energy intensity of the Aluminium business.  However, 78% of the electricity we use is  from renewable sources and we are making  investment and supply decisions to  increase this to around 90% by 2030. 2024 gross Scope 1 and 2 emissions (adjusted equity basis) 30.7Mt CO2e 2023: 33.9Mt CO2e (adjusted for acquisitions) l Electricity l Diesel l Processing l Other Note: Emissions are presented on an adjusted equity basis. 1. The compliance period for the Safeguard Mechanism is from 1 July to 30 June and does not align with our calendar year reporting. So the carbon credits used towards our 2024 net  emissions calculation include Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) that were retired for compliance for the period 1 January to 30 June 2024 plus a projection of the number of  ACCUs we expect to retire for the period 1 July to 31 December 2024. See Nature-based solutions section on pages 56-57 for further detail. Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Climate Action Plan Annual Report 2024 47 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 50 ===== Progress, lessons learned and our approach today Our approach to decarbonising our operations has evolved since 2021 when we first set our targets and CAP. This is partly due to the  challenge of developing new technologies and implementing large-scale physical infrastructure projects. We have also found opportunities  to contract renewable electricity and use renewable diesel. Highlights from our  2021 CAP Progress, lessons learned and our approach today Aim to install 1GW of  wind and solar  capacity in the Pilbara  (using our capital) The emissions reductions we have achieved since 2018 are mostly the result of decarbonising power, but developing large-scale  renewables projects in the Pilbara has taken longer. We need time to engage with Traditional Owners and to find appropriate sites. In  addition, as we do not expect to deploy battery-electric haul trucks in the Pilbara before 2030, we now estimate we require  approximately 600-700MW of renewable power capacity to displace 80% of our gas consumption for power generation. We are  making progress and have now completed construction of a 34MW solar power plant at Gudai-Darri along with battery storage at  Tom Price. Together with the Ngarluma Aboriginal Corporation, we are progressing the development of an 80MW solar PV facility  near Karratha. We are also exploring a renewable energy project with the Yindjibarndi Energy Corporation (YEC) consisting of 75MW  of solar on a greenfield site near Millstream Chichester National Park.  Beyond the Pilbara, we have made substantial progress on renewables deployment around the world with our own capital investments  and through commercial agreements. This includes projects at Kennecott and Diavik, PPAs at Gove, Amrun, QIT Madagascar Minerals,  Richards Bay Minerals, Escondida and in the US. In addition, we have procured and retired bundled and unbundled energy attribute  certificates (EACs, including Renewable Energy Certificates and Guarantees of Origin) for select locations around the world, though  these represent less than 5% of our total electricity use.  Develop green  repowering solutions  for the Boyne Island  and Tomago smelters For our Gladstone assets, we have signed PPAs for a combined 2.2GW of renewable energy, catalysing the development of new large- scale renewable energy in Queensland. Government support for repowering is needed to maintain competitiveness of the highly energy- intensive, low-margin smelters. We secured a standalone support agreement with the Queensland Government in August 2024, and in  early 2025, the Australian Government announced an aluminium production credit to help sustain and grow aluminium smelting in  Australia. Together these initiatives provide critical support for our Gladstone aluminium operations’ transition to renewable energy. Early  in 2024, Tomago launched a Request for Proposal process seeking proposals from market participants for renewable energy and  storage solutions. The process highlighted significant cost and schedule complexities in the New South Wales energy market, introducing  risks to finding a competitive repowering solution for the Tomago smelter. We continue to partner with industry, energy market  participants and governments to identify repowering pathways for a competitive, low-carbon future for aluminium in New South Wales. Advance the  deployment of zero  emissions trucks We continue to work with BHP, Caterpillar and Komatsu to accelerate the development of battery-electric haul trucks. In addition we  have invested in the deployment of 8 smaller-sized battery-swap electric trucks at Oyu Tolgoi. However, we do not expect wide-scale  deployment if large-scale electric trucks before 2030 due to technology maturity globally.  Given this slower pace of technology development, we are developing alternative solutions in the interim. We have invested in renewable  diesel with Kennecott switching to this in 2024, following the successful transition at our Boron mine in California the year before. We have  also started to develop our own biofuel supply with an investment in 3,000 hectares in Queensland, Australia to plant Pongamia saplings. Advance the use of  hydrogen in our  alumina refineries Research, development, scale-up and deployment of new low-carbon technology can take decades and can also take longer than  expected, particularly for industrial heat and process emissions that are hard to abate. Even if successful developments are unlikely to  contribute substantial emissions abatement before 2030 target but will need to be commercially viable for widespread deployment to  reach net zero by 2050.   We are working with Sumitomo and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) to build a 2.5MW electrolyser at our Yarwun  refinery to supply more than 125 tonnes of hydrogen per year and test its use in alumina calcination. In addition, we are progressing  double digestion technology at Queensland Alumina Limited. This will involve process changes that can lower the temperature of the  process and reduce energy consumption and carbon intensity.  Beyond alumina refining, we are also trialling BlueSmelting™ at our RTIT Quebec Operations - a pre-reduction process for ilmenite. Our  new joint venture with Aymium, Évolys Québec Inc. will manufacture a biocarbon product sourced from biomass residues, as an alternative  for anthracite currently used in ilmenite smelting processes at Rio Tinto’s Critical Minerals and Metallurgical Complex in Sorel-Tracy. Bring ELYSIS™ to  commercial scale by  2024 at our Alma  smelter ELYSISTM is a breakthrough technology that removes the carbon anodes in aluminium smelting - a process that has been used globally  for over 100 years. It continues to experience the scaling challenges and learning rates typical of major technology changes. We continue  to make progress in developing ELYSIS™ technology with our partners and in 2023 commissioned prototype (100kA) cells at Alma. We  continue work to commission commercial scale 450kA cells - this is now expected in 2025, having originally aimed for commissioning in  2023. In addition, we are also investing in the deployment of 10 smaller-scale 100kA cells at Arvida. Build capability to  invest in and develop  nature-based  solutions projects Our abatement projects continue to be complemented by investment in nature-based solutions and the purchase of high-quality carbon  credits. We are also applying our integrity screening criteria to the ACCUs we procure to meet our Safeguard Mechanism obligations  in Australia.  The IFRS S2 reporting standard now requires that companies with net emissions targets should be explicit about the gross  reductions they are targeting and provide the reader with detail on the quality of the carbon credits that are used towards the net  emissions targets. The use of carbon credits towards our 2030 target is limited to up to 10% of our 2018 emissions baseline. For  more information about our use of offsets, see pages 56-57. We estimated capital  investment in  decarbonisation of  $7.5bn by 2030 Our target to reduce emissions by 50% by 2030, relative to 2018 levels, remains unchanged. However, we believe achieving this will require  less capital investment, which is now estimated at the lower end of $5-6bn over the period 2022-2030, and more operating expenditure. We  need to be disciplined about our capital investment and make a commercial case for each mitigation project. Our experience shows that we  cannot solve this simply by allocating capital. To accelerate our emissions we will take advantage of commercial solutions that can be ready in  the market this decade which includes the use of renewable diesel in our mining fleets, or PPAs for renewable electricity alternatives. Since  2021, our energy contracts have underpinned new investment in wind, solar and energy systems with an aggregate value of over $8bn. Incorporate climate  into the Chief  Executive’s short-term  incentive plan (STIP)  up to 5% of the total Decarbonisation makes up 10% of our STIP today and now applies to 27,000 of our people, including our CEO. It has also been  incorporated into senior leadership Performance Share Awards in the long-term incentive plan (LTIP). Report emissions  using a hybrid of  location- and market- based approaches In 2023, we updated our reporting methodology and now use market-based Scope 2 emissions in our primary metric and target.  Consequently, the Bell Bay Aluminium and ISAL smelters, which are physically co-located and contracted with hydropower facilities,  now report emissions under this new methodology. Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Climate Action Plan Annual Report 2024 48 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 51 ===== We face two underlying challenges in delivering  net reductions in absolute emissions. First,  production growth increases emissions and we  need additional abatement to address this.  This growth may be brownfield (such as in the  Pilbara) or greenfield (such as Simandou).  And secondly, in our existing mining  operations, increasing work indexes, with  longer haul distances and declining ore grades,  typical for the mining sector, mean that more  energy is required to achieve the same level of  production output.  Our adjusted gross Scope 1 and 2 emissions  were 30.7Mt CO2e in 2024.  In 2024 we made  significant progress and reduced our  emissions by 3.2Mt CO2e. This has primarily  been achieved by new renewable energy  contracts, including the limited use of  unbundled renewable energy certificates in  locations where new generating assets are  under development or where power  purchase agreements have been agreed.  In addition we have made commitments to  projects that are expected to deliver  abatement of around 3.6Mt CO2e per year in  future periods mostly through renewable  electricity and biofuels. In addition, imminent  investment decisions could deliver further  abatement by 2030 and include new energy  solutions at BSL and fuel-switching and  electrification in the Queensland Alumina  Limited (QAL) and Yarwun alumina refineries.  Our 2025 target is to reduce net emissions  by 15% below 2018 levels. In 2023, we  reported that while we expected to have  committed to abatement projects  representing more than 15% of group  emissions, that delivered abatement would  lag this target. Since then, we have  executed a number of commercial  partnerships and transactions that have  allowed us to decarbonise faster. We have  now reduced gross operational emissions,  by 14% below our 2018 levels. After applying  high integrity offsets our net Scope 1 and 2  emissions are 17% below our 2018 baseline.  Progress on abatement will not be linear.  Delays are the result of a range of factors,  including engineering and construction  challenges, pace of development of new  technology and energy systems in the  locations in which we operate, and the need  to carefully balance our ambitions with the  needs of our local communities and  stakeholder groups. In response to this,  we continue to work with our partners,  governments and others to progress  abatement opportunities, and, in parallel, we  are adopting commercial solutions, such as  PPAs and biofuels, that can deliver emissions  reductions faster. We anticipate abatement  from these to rise between 2025 and 2030. Our roadmap to 2030  Between now and 2030, the most significant  opportunities to reduce our Scope 1 and 2  emissions are to switch the electricity we  generate or purchase to renewables, and to  address process heat emissions from our  alumina refineries. We have a pipeline of  projects and committed investments that  support our 2030 target of a 50% reduction in  emissions. To reach our 2030 target, our single  largest lever – accounting for around one- quarter of our emissions – is at the Boyne and  Tomago aluminium smelters in our Pacific  Aluminium Operations.  We must also make progress with other key  projects in our pipeline related to renewable  electricity contracts (for example Richards  Bay Minerals PPAs) and alumina processing  heat reductions (for example QAL double  digestion), to meet our 2030 target.  Production growth and growth from new  projects also need to be accommodated  within our absolute emissions reduction  target. Collectively, this represents around  4.6Mt CO2e to our baseline to 2030. In addition, we now expect to use high-quality  carbon credits from nature-based solutions  towards our Scope 1 and 2 net emissions  target to 2030. These will be limited to up to  10% of our 2018 baseline emissions and are  expected to be predominantly carbon credits  (ACCUs) used by our Australian operations  for compliance with the Safeguard  Mechanism. Our emissions reporting will  continue to transparently distinguish between  our gross operational emissions and net  emissions for the Group, as well as meeting  transparency standards regarding the volume  and type of carbon credits retired.

This is  challenging given approximately half of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions will require technology breakthroughs, but we are determined to be a  catalyst for their development.

Totals shown represent 2018 baseline emissions, reflecting increased equity at BSL, NZAS. 2. Baseline emissions extended post-2040 using assumed asset life extensions. 3. Represents net emissions reduction vs 2018 baseline. By 2030, we expect to have made significant  reductions in our electricity-related emissions  (both Scope 1 and Scope 2). Beyond 2030,  the outlook for emissions abatement is more  uncertain. However, we have achieved  breakthroughs in low-carbon technology that  provide us with at least one visible pathway  to net zero for all our major sources of  emissions. This is a significant achievement.  However, technology development is  complex and these breakthroughs may not  all turn out to be scalable and competitively  deployable. As such, we continue to pilot and  demonstrate these technologies with our  partners, while maintaining research and  development initiatives across industry to  find alternatives that may prove more  promising. Given the uncertain timing of  suitable, proven and commercial-scale  technology, our roadmap to 2050 allows  for future opportunities to be defined  post-2040.  Carbon removals By 2050, small sources of hard-to-abate  emissions may remain and will therefore  require carbon removals to achieve net  zero. This may be through natural or  technological removals and storage. In the short to medium term, we are  investing in high-integrity nature-based  solutions in the regions where we operate,  and will voluntarily retire carbon credits to  complement other decarbonisation  investments (see pages 56-57 for  further detail). In the medium to long term, technological  removals may offer a more permanent  solution to any remaining emissions from  fossil fuel consumption. We are also  exploring the potential of carbon capture  and mineralisation technologies. In 2024, we  focused on finding the best technologies to  capture the low concentration carbon  dioxide (CO2) from our aluminium smelters’  flue gas. This requires either the adaptation  of direct air capture technologies to higher  concentration CO2 or the adaptation of point  source technologies to lower concentrations.  In both cases, the technology readiness level  is often low.   In early 2025, we signed a partnership  agreement with Hydro to identify and  evaluate carbon capture technologies for  future implementation in the aluminium  smelting process. Separately, in partnership  with Carbfix, the characterisation of the  ISAL site for mineralisation is progressing,  aiming for first injection in 2028.  The assessment of the CO2 mineralisation  potential of our co-owned Tamarack project  in Minnesota has progressed with the  completion of a 1,137 meter exploratory well.  More work is planned in 2025 to investigate  the carbonation behaviour of the rock.

Securing long-term renewable power  solutions for the smelters supports the  energy transition required for the Gladstone  region to maintain jobs and increase  opportunities for industrial growth.  Emissions reduction across  the aluminium value chain in Australia  is complex. It relies heavily on the  availability of large-scale, competitive,  firmed renewable power, alongside  significant investment, collaboration and  partnership with governments, technology  developers and industry peers to support  innovation breakthrough. We cannot do  this alone.  Contracts for the current supply of  electricity to our Boyne smelter expire in  2029, and for Tomago by end of 2028, and  the smelters must develop low-cost  renewable energy solutions to maintain  their long-term viability. Decarbonising  these assets requires solutions supported  by state and federal governments.  Our Boyne smelter requires up to  975MW of power, equivalent to 3-4GW  of high-quality wind and solar capacity  paired with appropriate and competitive  firming assets and contracts.   In 2024, we announced PPAs for a  combined 2.2GW of renewable energy to  repower BSL, catalysing the development  of new large-scale renewable energy in  Queensland. These comprise 1.1GW of solar  electricity from European Energy’s Upper  Calliope solar farm to be built near  Gladstone and 1.1GW from Windlab’s  Bungaban wind project. Once the projects  are developed, they could generate energy  equivalent to 10% of Queensland’s current  power demand. In August, we made arrangements with the  Queensland Government on a support  package for Boyne Smelter to assist with  the transition to a competitive and  repowered future. These arrangements  would come into effect in 2029. They are  supported by the Australian Government’s  aluminium production credit as announced  in early 2025, and contingent on our  investment in further renewable energy and  the approval of our joint venture partners. Other renewable electricity developments  We rely on renewable and non-renewable  electricity to power our mines, processing  plants and supporting infrastructure. We  are working to displace gas and coal-fired  power with solar PV, wind and other  renewable technologies. We are focusing on the transition to  renewable energy sources in 5 main  regions: the Pilbara in Western Australia,  RBM in South Africa, bauxite operations in  Weipa, Australia, Kennecott in the US, and  Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia. Total electricity- related emissions from these assets were  0.9Mt CO2e in 2024. In 2024, RBM signed two renewable energy  agreements: a 20-year 140MW wind PPA at  Khangela and a 20-year 230MW wind PPA  at Overberg. We also purchased EACs to  cover the period until these assets are  commissioned. At Kennecott, a 78.5MW  wind VPPA and a 25MW solar PV facility  were approved. Additionally, commissioning  of a 5MW solar PV plant was completed in  2024, after undergoing rectification works  and commissioning throughout the year.  Construction on a second 25MW plant  started in late 2024. At Amrun, a 12MW  solar farm is under construction, and at  Gove, 10MW of solar is being built. Decarbonising the electricity at each of  these locations has varying degrees of  complexity, including whether the power is  externally or internally generated, land  access requirements (including permitting  and Traditional Owner engagement)  and availability of commercial solutions.  A 100MW solar PV facility can require a  land area of approximately 200 hectares,  equivalent to the operating footprint of one  of our mines in the Pilbara. Although  renewables benefit from established  construction methods, are lower technical  risk and relatively low impact on the ground,  the sheer scale of the renewables footprint  means that we must take the time required  to find suitable sites and engage with  Traditional Owners. We invest our own capital in renewable  energy projects while also using other  renewable energy procurement methods  (such as PPAs and EACs) that align with  global standards and practices. Under the  GHG Protocol, renewable electricity must  either have an EAC or be derived from  renewable generation that is not  contractually committed to another  party. In alignment with the GHG Protocol  we report eligible energy supplies as  renewable and include them in our  Scope 2 emissions reporting.

The Diesel Transition program also addresses  marine fuel and some other smaller emissions sources. $64m decarbonisation spend  on diesel transition  programs in 2024 5% percentage of global diesel  supply transitioned to  renewable diesel 1.6 billion litres diesel consumed at our major  managed operations in 2024 Diesel use from our mobile equipment and  rail fleet represents around 13% of our total  Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Although electrification is the preferred long- term solution for reducing diesel emissions, it  is not technically or financially feasible at all  mining operations today, or for all types of  equipment. Electrification is well suited to our  greenfield applications where we have large  fleets, but less so to brownfield operations  with smaller fleets, shorter mine life or other  operational complexities. Complementary  pathways are therefore in development and  include the use of renewable diesel to more  immediately reduce diesel-sourced emissions. Electrification The electric vehicles required to support  meaningful emissions reductions for the mining  industry are unique from those deployed in the  transportation or logistics sectors, or consumer  vehicles with fixed routes and operating  conditions. Mining solutions must be adaptable  to changing mine plans, supported by flexible  charging locations and powerful enough to  support intense work cycles with high operating  hours and loads. Most importantly, they need to  be safe, reliable and have sufficient battery  capacity and run-time between charging cycles. Charging infrastructure must also be dynamic  and support evolving mine plans and equipment  routes which may mean that charging stations  cannot remain permanently in one location or  must be complemented by mobile solutions.  The charging network requires access to  sufficient and reliable renewable energy. In 2024, we progressed the following  electrification activities:  1) Battery-electric haul truck Pilbara  collaboration: We progressed our  partnership with BHP to test battery- electric haul trucks in the Pilbara region.  In 2025 and 2026 we will collect data on  battery performance, charging systems,  and overall productivity in Pilbara  conditions, and share the information so  we learn faster.  2) China’s State Power Investment  Corporation (SPIC) partnership: Battery  swapping technology allows a battery- electric vehicle to quickly exchange a  discharged battery pack for a fully  charged one, instead of recharging the  vehicle at a static charging station. The  technology is already applied on haul  trucks in mining operations across China.  The 2-year project will demonstrate 8  mining haul trucks (91 tonne payload), 13  batteries (800kWh), and a robotic battery  swap and charging station in non- production activities at the Oyu Tolgoi  open pit copper mine in Mongolia. Renewable diesel Renewable diesel is a drop-in replacement  fuel that can be used in existing equipment to  significantly reduce emissions. While  renewable diesel presents a compelling  option, widespread adoption depends on  development of a liquid market of sustainable  feedstock. To support this, we are developing  a sourcing strategy for commercially  available renewable diesel from third-party  suppliers while also developing organic  supply options by identifying and cultivating  sustainable feedstocks focusing on  Australian-based options such as Pongamia. In 2024, we progressed the following  renewable diesel activities: 1) Transitioned Kennecott operations to  renewable diesel, achieving 95% diesel  displacement including all heavy mining  equipment across the mine, concentrator,  smelter, refinery and tailings.  2) Continued renewable diesel use at Boron  following successful trials initiated in 2022.  3) Purchased land for Pongamia seed oil  feedstock generation pilot. We acquired  approximately 3,000 hectares of land in  north Queensland to assess Pongamia  viability and yield. We are partnering with  Midway to oversee the planting and  management of the Pongamia seed farms. Given the potential timeframes and  challenges associated with large-scale  development and deployment of battery  vehicles in some industries, policies must  support market development and  competitiveness of alternative fuels.  The lack of a liquid market is a key  constraint to widespread and accelerated  use of alternatives to diesel fuels, both  physically and economically. Support is  needed to incentivise the production and  use of biofuels at volume and grow this  industry. Incentives could include support  for research and development, pilot  programs and direct support to landowners  to develop advanced biofuel feedstock  crops in suitable areas.

Aluminium anodes We are working to develop a breakthrough  aluminium smelting technology with no  direct greenhouse gas emissions. The ELYSIS™ partnership was established  in 2018 with Alcoa, with support from Apple  and the governments of Canada and  Quebec, to develop the world’s first direct  emissions-free aluminium smelting process  using inert anodes to replace carbon ones. Work at Alma is now focused on scaling up  the ELYSIS™ technology towards the  demonstration of commercial-size cells.  The smelting cells will operate on an electrical  current of 450kA, which is the commercial  scale for many large, modern aluminium  smelters. As noted above, research and  development is complex and sometimes takes  longer than planned. Commissioning these  cells was originally anticipated in 2023 but is  now expected to be in 2025 due to delays in  installing and commissioning some  equipment. A plan is now in place to complete  these crucial steps, and the fundamentals of  the technology remain sound.   We also aim to grow capacity for our  ELYSIS™ low-carbon smelting technology.  Before 2030 our use of ELYSIS™ carbon free  smelting technology will support new  production and will not address emissions  from existing carbon anodes. For all of our  smelters, the deployment of ELYSIS™  technology is inextricably tied to the  long-term plans for the underlying assets.  For this reason, associated abatement is not  currently reflected in the forecast 2030 plan,  but we expect to phase out the use of carbon  anodes at our smelters beyond 2030. In June 2024, we announced an investment  of $285 million to build a demonstration plant  using the first ELYSIS™ technology licence, in  partnership with the Government of Quebec.  This plant will be built at the Arvida smelter in  Quebec equipped with 10 carbon-free  aluminium smelting cells operating at 100kA.  The investment will support the ongoing  development of the breakthrough ELYSIS™  technology and allow us to build expertise in  its installation and operation.  Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Climate Action Plan Annual Report 2024 54 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 57 ===== Alumina processing The alumina refineries in Gladstone; Yarwun  and QAL are the largest source of process  heat emissions in the Group. The refineries  are currently reliant on coal and gas to  generate heat for digestion (75% of refinery  emissions) and use in the calcination phase  (25% of refinery emissions) of the process. The successful reduction of emissions in our  Australian alumina refineries relies heavily on  technology development, capital investment  and the availability of large-scale renewable  energy. Our preferred decarbonisation  strategy, based on technical merit and  commercial viability, is a combination of energy  management, fuel switching and electrification.  We are focused on reducing the emissions of  the digestion phase through 3 main projects: 1) Reducing baseload energy  requirements through double  digestion. In 2024, we completed a  double digestion pre-feasibility study at  QAL. The feasibility study was approved  in Q4 2024 and therefore  commencement of the study work will  now occur in 2025.    2) Upgrading energy with heat pumps and  mechanical vapour recompression  (MVR). At QAL, the order of magnitude  study for waste heat recovery using MVR  will commence in Q1 2025 and is  planned to complete in Q2 2025. The  project is expected to commence pre- feasibility in Q3 2025. 3) Fuel switching through electric steam  generation (including electric boilers  and thermal energy storage): – Final approval of the electric boiler  project in Vaudreuil is now expected  in 2025. – At Yarwun, the thermal energy  storage (TES) industrial  demonstration project has seen  continued discussion with the  technology supplier Rondo and  Australian Renewable Energy Agency  (ARENA). This project is expected to  move to a feasibility study in 2025,  pending additional support  from ARENA.  – At Yarwun, we executed a bio-pellet trial.  A feedstock growing trial continues in  North Queensland. We are progressing  several partnership opportunities for  bio-based energy supply to Gladstone. To reduce emissions in the calcination  phase, we are focused on 2 main projects: 1) Substituting natural gas with green  hydrogen. At Yarwun, the design and  engineering for the hydrogen calcination  project have been completed and  construction is in progress. Trials to burn  hydrogen in the calcination process are  planned to commence in the second half  of 2025. 2) Electric calcination. At Vaudreuil, an  electric calcination pilot is planned to  commence in 2025. For our climate briefing paper on   decarbonising our Australian alumina  refineries, see riotinto.com/climatechange Minerals processing A large source of our process emissions  arises from processing titanium dioxide  feedstocks (TiO2) in Canada and  South Africa.  Finding new and innovative technologies to  support the decarbonisation of these  facilities represents both a challenge and an  opportunity. Carbon abatement can be  partially realised by transitioning from fossil  fuels to renewable energy sources for  heating and operating these facilities. We are partnering with the governments  of Canada and Quebec to support  technological innovations to decarbonise  our operations by up to 70% and  strengthen the critical minerals and  metals value chains through the production  of titanium metal and scandium. The  BlueSmeltingTM demonstration plant,  which started in April 2023, employs  world-first technology developed by  Rio Tinto, to reduce emissions from  RTIT Quebec Operations. If successful, the technology could be  applied to our RBM operations in South  Africa, which use the same smelting  process. There are other potential  applications for BlueSmeltingTM technology  in decarbonising steelmaking.  In 2024, the BlueSmeltingTM technology was  fully validated for QMM ilmenite ore at our  RTIT Quebec Operations, and reduction  gas was safely transitioned from smelter  gas to hydrogen. Several ilmenite ores  were tested with hydrogen and the first  tests with iron ore from IOC have been  successfully completed.  Scaling up low carbon technology for  minerals and metals processing is expected  to require significantly more renewable  energy. Access to hydroelectric power in  Quebec requires support from the  government-owned provider. In a tight  market, access to this supply could be limited  and the negotiation period can be time- consuming. Support to streamline  discussions and consideration of the supply  of additional renewable energy to hard-to- abate Canadian industries, where it can have  the greatest impact, could underpin further  investment in breakthrough technologies.  In 2024, we announced a new joint venture  with Aymium named Évolys. We will  manufacture a metallurgical biocarbon  product to reduce carbon emissions in  large-scale industrial processes. The  biocarbon product will be used at RTIT  Quebec Operations as an alternative  to anthracite.  Biocarbon trials were successfully carried out  at RBM and RTIT Quebec Operations sites  this year, thus completing industrial  qualification. And, at IOC, we completed a  plant trial of substituting coke with biocarbon.  In 2025, we aim to develop bioenergy  supply sources (biofuel and biocarbon) to  support the industrial ramp-up of the new  joint venture ÉvolysTM. We also plan to  complete phase 2 of the BlueSmelting™  technology validation and the installation  and commissioning of an electric boiler at  IOC.

Over the last 2 years, we developed  our high-integrity criteria - based on our own  standards as well as international best  practice, guidance and principles. We have  identified new projects to develop and  existing ones to scale up, and partnered with  NGOs and other experts to deliver our  program. Today, we are on track to enable  500,000 hectares of high-integrity nature- based solutions across Argentina, Australia,  Guinea, Madagascar and South Africa by the  end of 2025. These projects are enablers for activities  that support sustainable livelihoods for the  communities where we operate, while  protecting and restoring nature, and  delivering high-quality carbon credits. Our  projects complement structural abatement. How we use carbon credits We anticipate that we will retire approximately  1.1 million Australian Carbon Credit Units  (ACCUs) for compliance with the Safeguard  Mechanism for the calendar year 2024.  In alignment with our updated CAP, we will  limit the use of voluntary and compliance  carbon credits towards our 2030 climate  target to up to 10% of our 2018 baseline  emissions (~3.6 million). Carbon credits  retired as offsets towards our climate targets  must pass our due diligence assessment,  including meeting our high-integrity criteria. See our 2024 Scope 1, 2 and 3 Emissions  Calculation and Climate Methodology report  and our 2024 Sustainability Fact Book for  further detail on our carbon credits  retirement methodology. How we source carbon credits We source carbon credits in 3 ways2:  – We develop new projects – we work with  local partners and communities to  develop and implement new nature-based  solutions projects that address nature  loss, while generating carbon credits and  delivering benefits for local communities.  – We invest in and scale up existing projects  – through commercial investments with  project partners, we provide capital and  support the development and scale-up of  nature-based solutions projects in our  operating regions.  – We source high-integrity carbon credits  through spot carbon credit purchases  and long-term offtake agreements from  nature-based solutions projects that  meet our high-integrity criteria. We aim  to source the highest quality credits  available in the market.  All our investments and purchases are  subject to our high-integrity criteria, which  forms the basis of our due diligence  process3. To assess projects, we analyse  publicly available data, geospatial data, and  data and models from project developers.  We also hold question and answer sessions  with developers, combined with site  inspections. This information is assessed  against our requirements, and if at any  stage the project fails to meet our criteria,  we do not proceed with the investment.  Our criteria include an assessment of the  potential impact of our projects, seeking to  ensure that they do not result in negative  unintended consequences for people,  communities, their heritage or natural  ecosystems. The risks and opportunities  identified in the assessment must be  addressed, managed, tracked and assessed  periodically during the project. In 2024, approximately 15% of all projects  assessed met our criteria, highlighting our  commitment to building a high-integrity and  diverse project pipeline for Rio Tinto,  including a variety of methodologies across  a wide range of ecosystems and land uses. Our high-integrity criteria In 2024, we updated and expanded our  high-integrity criteria4, using our own  learnings and the latest international best  practice, guidance and principles, including  the Core Carbon Principles by The Integrity  Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market  and the International Union for  Conservation of Nature Global Standard.  1) Additionality: The project and its outcomes  are made possible by climate finance and  would not have happened otherwise. 2) Quantification: The project can generate  real carbon reductions, removals, or both,  supported by robust accounting practices. 3) Permanence: The project can deliver  permanent carbon reductions, removals,  or both, and reversal risks are realistic  and well-managed. 4) Governance, Social and Ecological  Safeguards: The project takes an  integrated approach to protecting or  restoring nature, or both, while  supporting community livelihoods and  respecting human rights. 5) Sustainable Development and Nature  Positive Outcomes: The project supports  multi-decade sustainability outcomes and a  diverse project pipeline for Rio Tinto. 1. Spend on carbon credits is initially treated as capital and  expensed when these are retired. See pages 157-160 where  we describe our accounting policies and the classification of  climate-related items. 2. In 2024, we updated the way we outline our sourcing  strategy, relative to 2023, in which we referred to the  following 3 pathways to securing carbon credits: investment  in Australian Carbon Credit Units; the development of our  own voluntary projects; and commercial agreements with  voluntary carbon credit developers.  3. Compliance market projects delivering credits for  retirement against our net emissions target are tested  to the extent possible with information available. If  available project information is not sufficient to make  an informed assessment, the project will not be  considered further or will be excluded from  consideration until such time as sufficient information  becomes available. We also published more detail about our  due diligence process, including the  questions we ask project developers to  evaluate their projects.    This information, including specific steps  we take when assessing ACCU projects, is  available at riotinto.com/naturesolutions Our voluntary projects Our development and scale-up projects  include landscape-level protection and  conservation, restoration and land-use  management activities, covering clean  cooking initiatives, reforestation and  afforestation, forest and grassland  management, sustainable forestry and  agro-forestry. These projects follow  the latest available voluntary carbon  market methodologies. In 2024, in partnership with The Government  of Madagascar, BirdLife International,  Asity Madagascar and other partners,  we continued to support the development of  the Tsitongambarika Forest REDD+5 project  in Southeastern Madagascar through a  $2.1 million investment. And we committed  $16 million to the Makira Natural Park REDD+  Project in the north, through a new  partnership with the Wildlife Conservation  Society and Everland.  In South Africa, we partnered with Peace  Parks Foundation, Sayari Earth and  WILDTRUST to carry out a feasibility  study for a large-scale, landscape level  nature-based solutions project in  KwaZulu-Natal Province. The feasibility  report will be delivered by mid-2025,  when we will decide on the investment. In Guinea, we completed feasibility work for  a clean cooking, fuel-switching program,  now preparing to move into pilot phase.  We also identified a high-quality  reforestation project, and we are working  with local partners to investigate REDD+  and mangrove restoration projects.  Through a $2.1 million investment over  2 years, we are also working with BirdLife  International and Aves Argentinas to scale up  a large native grasslands management  carbon project in Argentina. In Mongolia, we partnered with EarthShot,  URECA and the Wildlife Conservation  Society to investigate opportunities for  sustainable forest management projects.  4. In addition to Additionality, Quantification, Permanence,  and Social and Ecological Safeguards, we now consider  Governance (within the latter) and added Sustainable  Development and Nature Positive Outcomes. 5. United Nations Climate Change: ‘REDD’ stands for ‘Reducing  emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in  developing countries. The ‘+’ stands for additional forest- related activities that protect the climate, namely sustainable  management of forests and the conservation and  enhancement of forest carbon stocks. Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Climate Action Plan Annual Report 2024 56 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 59 ===== Meeting our regulatory obligations We operate in many jurisdictions that have  implemented carbon pricing regulations  that cover our Scope 1 emissions. These  include Australia, Canada, California, the  EU and New Zealand where approximately  83% of our Scope 1 emissions or 64%  of our total emissions are covered by  these regulations. Australia - Safeguard Mechanism We have significant emissions in Australia,  and are required to comply with the  Safeguard Mechanism. We source high  quality ACCUs from savanna fire  management, human-induced regeneration  (HIR) and environmental planting (EP)  projects, while seeking to: – Partner for the long term with  Indigenous project developers. These  projects can bring multiple benefits in  addition to fire management and nature  repair, with carbon finance reinvested  into the communities to support training,  employment and enhanced connection  to Country. For example, near our  operations in the Northern Territory we  are supporting Arnhem Land Fire  Abatement, an Aboriginal-created,  owned and operated not-for-profit  carbon business. Closer to our  operations in Far North Queensland, we  are supporting several projects,  including the Aurukun Savanna Burning  Project and the Oriners & Sefton  Savanna Burning Project. – Continuously strengthen our due  diligence process. We use a range of  geospatial tools and approaches to  assess the design and performance of  HIR and EP projects, including satellite  imagery analysis and land cover  classification. This enables us to assess  the integrity of projects by monitoring,  verifying and quantifying vegetation  growth and land cover changes over time.  Our site visits and engagement with  developers give us additional information  to support these assessments. – Invest in project development to  reduce our overall reliance on spot  transactions, move ACCU costs closer  to the cost of development and have  greater oversight of the integrity of  projects. This includes investing in  carbon developers, such as Australian  Integrated Carbon (in which we have a  14.15% interest) and the Silva Carbon  Origination Fund, one of the first in  Australia to provide investors with  access to large-scale, high-quality  carbon credits from land reforestation  projects integrated with sustainable  agriculture. Other countries Canadian Provinces have implemented  different carbon pricing regulations, including  the British Columbia Output-Based Pricing  System and the Quebec Cap-and-Trade  System which is linked with California’s. In the  California-Quebec system, offsets may be  used for compliance purposes (limited to a  fixed percentage of the allowances allocated  to each installation). Our aluminium smelters in Iceland and  New Zealand are covered by Emissions  Trading Systems. Offsets are not eligible  for compliance use under these carbon  pricing regulations.

Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Climate Action Plan Annual Report 2024 57 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 60 ===== Scope 3 emissions: Partner to decarbonise our value chains In 2024, our Scope 3 emissions were 574.6Mt  CO2e (equity basis), approximately 19 times  higher than our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.  This is compared to a restated 2023 number  of 572.5 Mt CO2e (equity basis). The majority of these emissions (94%) stem  from customers processing our products,  particularly iron ore (69%) and bauxite and  alumina (23%). Specifically, emissions related to iron ore  processing were 395.9Mt CO2e in 2024,  compared to 399.9Mt CO2e in 2023.  Emissions related to bauxite and alumina  processing increased from 127.1Mt CO2e  (restated) in 2023 to 134.0Mt CO2e in 2024,  mostly as a result of increased bauxite sales. Many of our customers have set public  targets for their Scope 1 and 2 emissions  (our Scope 3). About 55%1 of our  steel-producing customers by direct iron  ore sales volume have set public targets to  reach net zero or carbon neutrality by  2050. Meanwhile, nearly 33%1 of our bauxite  sales are to customers with net zero  emissions targets, though only 11% of  customers are aiming for net zero by 2050.  As things stand today, our analysis of our  customers’ targets and their governments’  commitments to reduce their emissions  shows a trajectory for those processing  emissions that approaches net zero by  around 2060. This is driven in large part by  China (80% of Scope 3 emissions), which  has pledged to be carbon neutral by 2060.  Approximately 20% of our emissions come  from countries such as South Korea and  Japan, which have pledged to be net zero  by 2050.  We are committed to partnering with  customers and suppliers to help them  achieve their targets earlier, reaching net  zero by 2050. We have not set an overall  Scope 3 emissions target due to the limited  direct influence we have on the  decarbonisation activities of our customers,  required maturation of technology adoption  and grid decarbonisation in customers’ host  countries. Instead, we are holding ourselves  accountable on real and measurable  commitments in the near term, which will  ensure technologies are available to  accelerate the longer-term transition. Therefore, we have set near-term, action- oriented, and measurable targets in the  areas where we believe we have agency and  can support meaningful change. We take  accountability and track our progress on  individual projects and partnerships, and  stay deeply connected across the value  chain, ensuring we are up to date on  developments and maintaining ambitious  decarbonisation goals.  Our Scope 3 targets have not been derived  using a sectoral decarbonisation approach.  Instead, we have set these targets based on  what we can achieve practically and  effectively under each category. We engage  KPMG to provide limited assurance on our  Scope 3 emissions calculations and  progress made in relation to the 4 most  significant categories of our Scope 3  footprint: steel and aluminium value chains,  shipping and procurement. The assurance  statement is available on page 321. 1.

Steel is one of the most cost-efficient  construction materials and is essential in  low-carbon infrastructure, transportation  and buildings. With approximately 2 billion  tonnes of crude steel produced globally  in 2024, the industry overall emits over  3.5 billion tonnes of CO2e annually,  equivalent to around 8% of global  carbon emissions. As one of the world’s largest iron ore  producers, we have a key role to play  in decarbonising the steel value chain.  We aim to accelerate the development  and adoption of low-carbon emissions  technologies that both reduce our Scope 3  emissions and future-proof our iron ore  business. Our approach is built on a  platform of collaboration across the value  chain. We are partnering with over 40  partners in about 10 countries to build a  portfolio of options, from iron ore  processing to iron and steelmaking.  We prioritise our project portfolio based on  parameters such as ore suitability, technical  and commercial feasibility, and emissions  abatement potential, to ensure a disciplined  approach to investing capital and effort.  Our strategy is framed under 3 pathways  across different time horizons: 1. Existing pathways We are actively working with our customers  to help reduce their carbon emissions from  the current blast furnace (BF) process.  Our initiatives include optimising BF burden,  improving energy efficiency, BF slag  optimisation, and carbon capture, utilisation  and storage (CCUS).  2. Emerging pathways We are supporting early development and  proliferation of emerging low-carbon DRI  projects that use high-grade iron ores, such  as those we produce at IOC, and, in the  future, Simandou. We are committed to  supporting these low-carbon projects that  may otherwise face significant headwinds.  Our approach includes bringing together  the right group of partners, supplying  high-grade ore, bringing our technical and  sales and marketing expertise, and investing  in early-stage projects. In November 2024, we entered agreements  with GravitHy – an industrial start up  establishing 2 Mtpa production of ultra- low-carbon DRI in Fos-sur-Mer, France.  GravitHy’s hydrogen-based DRI plant is  expected to start production in 2028.  The facility will feature ultra-low-carbon  hydrogen production infrastructure,  enabled by access to grid-connected  nuclear power. By processing our iron ore  with GravitHy, emissions are reduced by up  to 90% compared to a typical BF-BOF  pathway.  3. Future pathways While low-carbon DRI technology is  established for high-grade ores, there is  currently no economic low-carbon iron and  steelmaking technology for low- and  medium-grade ores, such as those produced  in the Pilbara. Low- and medium-grade iron  ore accounts for more than 80% of global  iron ore supply. Full decarbonisation of the  steel industry therefore depends on the  development and commercial proliferation of  low-carbon ironmaking technologies that use  low- and medium-grade ores. We are supporting the development of  these technologies with a focus on: – Beneficiating our ores to remove  impurities before ironmaking. – Pelletising our ores to improve their  suitability to proven shaft furnace  technology – Evaluating emerging fluidised bed  technology. This technology may be a  suitable process for our iron ore fines  products, removing the need to pelletise  prior to ironmaking. – Developing a proprietary ironmaking  process called BioIron™ which uses raw  biomass3, along with microwave energy, to  convert Pilbara ores into metallic iron. This  has potential to reduce carbon emissions  by up to 95% compared to the BF-BOF if  combined with renewable energy and  fast-growing biomass. – Jointly developing ESF technology,  which is required for all of the above  ironmaking pathways. The ESF removes  impurities inherent in low- and medium- grade ores, as a second stage of  ironmaking. We are progressing our  partnership with BlueScope and BHP to  build an ESF pilot facility in Australia.  This will initially use natural gas to  reduce iron ore to DRI, but once  operational, the project aims to use  lower-carbon emissions hydrogen to  reduce iron ore. Reductions of up to  80% in carbon emissions are potentially  achievable, compared to a typical  BF-BOF. We are also working with  Baowu to build an ESF pilot facility  in China. In 2024, we spent $65 million on steel  decarbonisation initiatives. Over the next  3 years, 2025-2027, we plan to spend  $200-350 million across our steel  decarbonisation portfolio. Decarbonisation of the steel sector will not  happen in isolation; all stakeholders along  the steel value chain will need to work  together. Ultimately, Scope 3 emissions  reductions are dependent on the  deployment of these lower-carbon  steelmaking technologies by our customers.  A range of different policies is needed to  support research and development,  first-of-a-kind projects and commercial  deployment of low-carbon steelmaking.     For more information see our climate  briefing paper on decarbonising our iron  ore value chain at riotinto.com/ climatechange 1. The support will be in the form of direct technical  support and co-developing technology solutions. 2. Subject to funding approval and technical feasibility. 3. Rio Tinto is aware of the complexities around the use of  biomass supply and is working to ensure only  sustainable sources of biomass are used. Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Climate Action Plan Annual Report 2024 59 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 62 ===== Steel decarbonisation projects tracker Aluminium value chain Alumina decarbonisation  targets – In 2025, partner with at least 2  bauxite customers with the goal of  improving energy efficiency and  reducing emissions, focusing on  digestion improvement technology;  controlling or removing organic  compounds from the refining  process; and technical options  to reduce moisture content in  our bauxite. We regularly engage with our customers to  understand their ESG priorities and  requirements, and identify and agree on  collaboration opportunities aligned with our  capabilities. Energy efficiency is a key  priority for our customers due to its direct  impact on emissions.  In the alumina refinery process, steam is  used to heat the bauxite slurry in the  digestion unit to high temperatures,  dissolving the alumina in the bauxite. This  digestion process is a crucial aspect of the  overall energy efficiency of the refinery. In  addition, effective organic control is  essential for achieving production rates and  producing quality alumina, especially when  processing Australian bauxites. More than 85% of our 134.0Mt CO2e Scope  3 emissions in the aluminium value chain  come from the electricity- and emissions- intensive aluminium smelting process.  However, the majority of our product is  processed in China using coal-fired refining  and smelting processes, where we have  little influence over the power source for  these electricity grids. Our short- to medium-term focus is to help  our customers improve the alumina refining  process to increase energy efficiency and  optimise use of our bauxite1.  Strong demand for bauxite has resulted in  almost double the number of refineries  processing Rio Tinto bauxite over the past 3  years. As some of our bauxite sales are  made through intermediaries, we have  limited direct interaction with the end  customer. Consequently, we have less  influence and ability to engage on  matters relating to decarbonisation with  these refineries.  In 2024, digestion improvement technology  was successfully implemented at one of our  bauxite customers’ operations. We also  completed an overview and opportunity  assessment of organics technologies, and  conducted customer visits to present the  portfolio of control options. Another key ESG priority for our bauxite  customers is the significant challenge of  managing bauxite residue. We are supporting  our customers in the development of  processing and reuses for this residue to  reduce the environmental and safety impact  of residue storage. In 2024, we pursued a  testing program with one of our customers  on converting bauxite residue into soil  products for agriculture. 1. This is mostly via sweetening and improved digestion.  In the longer term, this will be mostly through using  renewable energy for the heat source, via hydrogen  calcination and electric boilers. Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Climate Action Plan Annual Report 2024 60 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 63 ===== Shipping Shipping decarbonisation targets – Reach net zero shipping by 2050  across our shipping footprint. – Fulfil First Movers Coalition (FMC)  pledge of 10% of time-chartered fleet  to be running on low-carbon fuels1 by  2030 and progressing to 100% of  time-chartered fleet by 20402.  – Reduce emissions intensity by 40%  by 2025 (5 years ahead of the target  set by the International Maritime  Organization [IMO]), and deliver 50%  intensity reduction by 20303. – Enhance accuracy of emissions  reporting by using actual voyage  data for more than 95% of our cargo  shipments by 2024. Our Scope 3 emissions from shipping and  logistics are 8.9Mt CO2e. Of this, 5.2Mt  CO2e (59%) is generated by our chartered  fleet, and around 1.9Mt CO2e (21%) comes  from shipping our products, where freight  has been arranged by the purchaser. The  remaining 1.8Mt CO2e (20%) comprises  other logistics elements such as truck, rail,  container movement and other logistics- related emissions. An additional 0.4Mt CO2e  of Scope 1 shipping-related emissions is  attributed to the vessels we own.  As a major charterer transporting over  300Mt of bulk products annually with a fleet  of 230 chartered vessels and 17 owned  ships, we recognise our vital role in  decarbonising shipping and partnering with  industry stakeholders to accelerate  this journey. To reduce emissions from shipping, we  focus on: Energy efficiency: While in mid-2024 we  achieved a 40% reduction in emissions  intensity against the IMO’s intensity target  baseline year 2008, we ended 2024 with a  39% reduction (up from 37% at end 2023),  primarily by: – Incorporating larger vessels such as  Newcastlemax (210k deadweight  tonnage (DWT), which have ~10% lower  emissions intensity than standard  Capesize (170-180k DWT). – Technical modifications to the hull,  propeller, and engine. As we improve the  energy efficiency of our own vessels, we  are also prioritising chartering vessels with  design improvements, including those  with energy-saving devices installed. – Speed and route optimisation: We  deploy sophisticated weather routing  software and seek to continually  optimise scheduling and reduce  unneeded time waiting in port.  We have completed a recent dry dock  program and energy-saving device  installations on all 17 owned vessels.  In 2025, we plan to trial further energy  efficiency technologies such as shaft  generators and air lubrication systems,  while exploring opportunities to apply these  to our chartered fleet.  Transitional fuels: We continue to explore  opportunities for biofuels and liquefied  natural gas (LNG). In 2024, we introduced 4  additional LNG Newcastlemax dual-fuelled  vessels to our fleet (current total of 9 in the  fleet), capable of delivering up to 15% to  20% CO2e emissions reductions compared  to traditional fuel oil. We continue to work with our partners to  progress commercially viable biofuel bunkering  solutions as well as recycled fuel deployment. End-state fuels: To achieve our aim of net zero  shipping by 2050, our Marine team is focusing  on end-state fuels. Although there is no clear,  single end-state fuel solution for the shipping  industry, low-carbon methanol and low-carbon  ammonia are considered the more promising  options4.  We progress the availability and  business case for end-state fuels (including  value-chain split of opportunity/risk) through  industry collaboration such as our leadership  in the West Australia – East Asia Iron Ore  Green Corridor. Additionally, regulation is essential to  facilitate the drive towards net zero shipping.  In 2023, the IMO announced a heightened  ambition, including guidance for net zero  shipping “by or around 2050”, with interim  non-binding emissions reduction targets set  for 2030 and 2040. To deliver on the  reduction targets, the IMO is currently  working on the development of a basket of  candidate mid-term GHG reduction  measures (eg fuel standard with GHG pricing  mechanism), with a view to finalising these in  2025, with entry into force in 2027.   Through a range of industry partnerships and  via direct government engagement we seek  to positively shape regulatory measures that  are sufficiently robust to catalyse and  accelerate shipping’s energy transition.  In 2024, we met our target to use actual  voyage data (eg actual fuel consumption)  rather than industry estimates for more  than 95% of our cargo shipments5. 1. Although the FMC currently employs the terminology  “zero-emission” rather than “low-carbon”, with a  guiding principle of delivering a well-to-wake GHG  emission reduction of 80% or more compared to fuel  oil, we have updated our terminology to reflect that  these fuels are unlikely to be fully net zero emissions on  a lifecycle basis over the coming years. While we  endeavour to achieve the guiding principle proposed  by the FMC, we may initially consider fuel pathways  with a lesser emission reduction with consideration to  factors such as supply, availability of technology and  regulatory developments from the IMO.  2. Subject to the availability of technology, supply, safety  standards and a reasonable price premium. 3. Relative to IMO’s 2008 baseline. 4. A range of fuels and technologies are likely to comprise  shipping’s “end state”, which may also include drop-in  biofuels, bio/e-LNG and even fossil fuels which may be  complemented by carbon capture technology. 5. Where Rio Tinto manages the freight (excluding free on  board shipments). Procurement Upstream Scope 3 emissions from  procurement were 22.2Mt CO2e (excluding  business travel) in 2024, split between  purchased fuels, goods and services.  The goods and services are further divided  between emissions related to operational Procurement decarbonisation  targets – Engage with 50 of our highest-emitting  suppliers on emissions reduction,  focused on driving supplier  accountability for setting and delivering  against their decarbonisation targets.  – Implement decarbonisation   evaluation criteria for new sourcing in  high-emitting categories1.  expenditure purchases (such as caustic,  explosives, coke, pitch) of 14.8Mt CO2e,  and capital expenditure purchases (such  as machinery, electrical equipment) of  3.0Mt CO2e. Due to the nature of our  businesses, many of our purchased inputs  are from hard-to-abate sectors, such as  caustic, coke, pitch and steel. In accordance with Rio Tinto’s stated  position to put the energy transition at the  heart of our strategy, in 2024 we launched  our Sustainable Procurement Principles  and revised Supplier Code of Conduct,  outlining the expectations we have for  ourselves and our suppliers to strive to  ensure that the procurement of our goods  and services aligns with our commitment to  strive for impeccable ESG credentials and  responsible business practices. We expect  our suppliers to share this commitment to  environmental responsibility.  We work with more than 20,000 suppliers  across complex multi-layered supply chains.  To address upstream emissions, we are  taking a systematic approach, prioritising  engagement with 50 of our highest-emitting  suppliers (representing over 40% of our  procurement-related emissions), and  referencing decarbonisation as evaluation  criteria for new sourcing in high-emitting  categories. The prioritisation of suppliers  and categories followed the assessment of  the sources of emissions across the Global  Procurement portfolio (and available  abatement pathways) and deliberately  focuses our efforts on the largest sources.  Ongoing refinement of the measurement  and reporting methodology will inform our  priorities in future.  In 2024, we issued a baseline questionnaire  to inform our engagement with 50 high- emitting suppliers, and returned a 100%  response rate. We validated and discussed  responses in follow-up supplier  engagements with a focus on  understanding maturity, opportunities for  partnership and improvement opportunities.  We have now developed and implemented  decarbonisation criteria to evaluate new  sourcing in high emissions categories. In 2025, we will sustain and deepen  engagements with the 50 high-emitting  suppliers, building on 2024 engagements  and continue to reference decarbonisation  criteria to evaluate new sourcing in high  emissions categories.  1.

Expenditure must be incurred for decarbonisation purposes and can be either capital or operating in nature, based on financial accounting principles.  1. Total decarbonisation spend includes costs related to the purchase of offsets, renewable energy certificates, decarbonisation team costs and external decarbonisation  investments.  Decarbonisation investment is derived from  the Group’s capital allocation framework  and aligned to our 2025 and 2030 Scope 1  and 2 emissions targets. We make decisions  under a dedicated evaluation framework  which considers the following: – impact of the investment on shareholder  value and asset cost base – level of emissions abatement – maturity of the technology and  delivery risk – competitiveness of the investment as  per the marginal abatement cost curve  (MACC) and external benchmark  – policy context – alternative options on the pathway to  net zero.  We also assess projects against our  approach to a just transition, with  consideration to the impact on employees,  local communities and industry. In line with  our other investment decisions, governance  of decarbonisation investments depends on  the nature and size of the project.   Using this framework, we maintain our  capital expenditure guidance of $5-6 billion  between 2022 and 2030 and $0.5-1 billion  in the period 2024-2026. This includes  voluntary carbon credits and investment in  nature-based solutions projects but  excludes the cost of carbon credits bought  for compliance purposes. We are also  transitioning many of our significant fossil  fuel contracts into various commercial  contracts for renewable PPAs and biofuels. Rio Tinto applies an internal cost of carbon  when making our investment decisions. This  includes current legislated carbon penalties,  which apply to approximately half of our  emissions, principally in Australia and  Canada, plus future policies that could be  introduced in the regions where we operate.  See page 44 for more detail on our carbon  prices used in our climate change scenarios  and page 73 for our Scope 1 emissions  covered by emissions-limiting regulations. Our decarbonisation project portfolio is  constantly evolving as new projects are  added following further technical and  commercial assessment. We are targeting  a value accretive pathway to 2030 across  the portfolio.  The large scale investment in  zero emissions technologies that is needed  to progress towards our net zero target  will require global carbon pricing or  green premiums. 2030 decarbonisation spend Our target to reduce emissions by 50% by  2030 relative to 2018 levels remains  unchanged. We see decarbonisation as a  key business imperative to manage our  exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices and to  mitigate the impact of inflationary carbon  penalty costs. Meeting our 2030 targets will  diversify our energy portfolio away from  volatile, globally traded fossil fuels and  towards structurally secure, long-term, cost  efficient, low-carbon alternatives. As per our 2023 climate change-related  reporting, we believe achieving this will  require less capital investment and an  increasing number of commercial  partnerships than expected when we set  our targets in 2021. To further accelerate our emissions  abatement, we will take advantage of  non-capital-intensive solutions that can be  ready in the market this decade and avoid  lengthy project development schedules.  We anticipate that approximately 90% of  our abatement by 2030 will be delivered by  non-capital intensive solutions, including  several renewable PPA contracts executed  over the past 12 months.  For projects delivering on our 2030  abatement target, we anticipate incremental  operating expenditure at a portfolio level to  be breakeven, before application of carbon  costs and savings. A significant amount of  abatement will be delivered through  entering into PPAs that can be cost-neutral  or offer a cost saving relative to the fossil  fuel alternative. This is offset by other  contracts such as biofuels where we  anticipate a cost premium will prevail  this decade.  We also continue to make ongoing  investments in studies, pilots and  demonstration plants targeting long-dated  and uncertain carbon reduction outcomes.  Operational expenditure varies year on  year, but across the decade we anticipate  on average annual spend to be in the order  of $0.2-$0.3 billion. Pre-2030 abatement projects are  predominantly expected to be delivered  through non-capital-intensive solutions  and proven technologies, while  post-2030 abatement projects are  generally characterised as high-cost,  capital-intensive projects that require  industry breakthroughs. Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Climate Action Plan Annual Report 2024 63 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 66 ===== Just transition We acknowledge that the low-carbon  transition requires substantial investment  and significant changes to our current  energy systems and supply chains. These  transition activities introduce new social  risks and opportunities to host  communities, employees, contractors and  customers, and have the potential to  disproportionately affect those that are  most vulnerable to change.  Through our Human Rights Policy we have  committed to “support a low-carbon  transition that is rights-respecting, socially  inclusive and just”. We will embed just  transition principles into our  decarbonisation strategy, working to  minimise impacts and optimise  socioeconomic opportunities.   Our progress on our 2024 commitments  was largely through establishing strong  partnerships and working transparently with  local communities. Partnering to facilitate a  just transition  The quantum of minerals needed to realise  the global energy transition will require new  mines, many of which will be located on the  lands of Indigenous or land-connected  peoples, or in vulnerable socioeconomic  regions. Large areas of land will also be  required for developing renewable energy  projects. Respectful and ongoing  engagement will be at the centre of these  new developments. In Australia, our agreements with the  Yindjibarndi Energy Corporation and  the Ngarluma Aboriginal Corporation  are the first Indigenous partnerships in  our renewable energy portfolio, and  are important pathways into future  energy projects. We also have a growing portfolio of  nature-based solutions projects, where  we work with local partners to deliver high  integrity projects which foster positive  outcomes for people, nature, and climate.  These partnerships are co-designed with  communities to secure resilient and  improved livelihoods through the  protection, sustainable management,  and restoration of nature. Managing impacts and  opportunities  When we make decisions on  decarbonisation projects across our work  streams (eg renewables, diesel transition,  nature-based solutions) we aim to optimise  environmental and social outcomes, while  effectively managing expected and  unintended impacts. For communities more broadly, our Group  social investment framework has an  “economic opportunity and just transition”  investment pillar supported by the regional  economic development framework. There  are multiple projects underway worldwide to  strengthen regional economic  diversification and equip communities to  tackle the challenges of climate change.  Through the social investment reporting  system, data is already collected around  how we contribute to “stable, beneficial  work and economic opportunities” and  delivering “diverse, inclusive and  secure economies”. We also apply local and Indigenous  participation requirements throughout our  energy and other procurement processes.  This ensures that local and Indigenous  employment and procurement are  optimised, thereby building capability within  these groups to take advantage of  transition-related opportunities. For our workforce, this means we need to  support affected employees to transition  to other opportunities either within our  business, with other resource companies  in different locations, or to new  industries altogether.   As an example, the introduction of the  ELYSIS™ technology in Canada or battery- electric haul trucks at our mines will create  an ecosystem of new opportunities and  jobs. We will work closely with our  employees and host communities to  plan for these changes. Engagement and  transparency We are currently rolling out an annual  sentiment survey through our Local Voices  program which was initiated in 2023. This  survey includes questions around climate  change and communities’ understanding of  the potential impacts and opportunities  associated with decarbonisation. We also facilitate civil society organisation  roundtable events in 3 locations each year.  These events provide a space for  engagement around our work towards a  just transition.  Action in 2025 Our future actions will focus on the  following objectives: – further embedding just transition  principles and commitments into our  project decision-making processes – better understanding the social impacts  of our decarbonisation strategy – providing greater transparency for  workers and communities affected by  our transition activities. Climate policy  and advocacy We support the goals of the Paris  Agreement to pursue efforts to limit the  global average temperature increase to  1.5 degrees, and do not advocate for  policies that undermine this or discount  Nationally Determined Contributions.  Our high-level policy positions are:  – Business has a role to play in climate  policy development; this should be  effective, fair, pragmatic, market- based and support free trade. – Carbon pricing is the most effective  incentive for business to reduce  emissions, but may not be sufficient  for hard-to-abate parts of our  carbon footprint (for example carbon  anodes, minerals processing). – Climate policy should not  undermine competitiveness and  result in carbon leakage - carbon  border adjustment mechanisms or  alternative policies are necessary. – Other policy tools are necessary to  decarbonise minerals and metals:  grant funding and tax incentives for  research and development; product  standards and procurement  obligations to drive the deployment  of pre-commercial technology. While business has a vital role in managing  the risks and uncertainties of climate  change, governments can support the  challenge by providing enabling  frameworks, including policies and  programs, which increase momentum to  shared net zero goals.   Rio Tinto’s direct engagement on climate  policy is underpinned by the climate  commitments and principles which  represent a guide to the positions taken in  both direct and indirect advocacy. Overall  advocacy positions will balance the  commitment to these principles and the  climate targets set with the need for an  efficient permitting process that is essential  for project development. This includes  projects that decarbonise our operations or  those that produce transition materials and  support local communities and jobs in the  regions where we operate. We actively engage on climate and energy  policy with governments, industry and civil  society in the countries where we operate in  different ways to help shape policy,  regulation and frameworks. We post all  standalone submissions to government  consultation processes on our website.  For more information on our climate  position and advocacy, see riotinto.com/ climateposition Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Climate Action Plan Annual Report 2024 64 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 67 ===== We encourage industry associations to  align all climate related advocacy with the  goals of the Paris Agreement. We publish  our review of the climate advocacy of  industry associations annually. Our approach to policy advocacy has been  informed by our regular engagement with  investors and stakeholders. Our climate related advocacy is focussed  on policy and other measures which enable  decarbonisation of operational emissions,  production of metals and minerals required  for the energy transition and support for  the goals of the Paris Agreement. Below are examples of the focus areas and  objectives for engagement on key climate  policy areas. Industry associations and  civil society  Industry associations and civil society  organisations play an important role in  policy development and reform.    Industry associations’ views will not always  be the same as ours, so we periodically  review our memberships in individual  associations. This assessment may include: – the purpose of the association and the  value the membership may provide to  our business and our investors – appropriate governance structures  within the industry association policy  positions and advocacy of the  industry association. Where our membership is significant, we will  work in partnership with industry associations  with the aim of aligning these policy positions  with our climate and energy policy. Where  significant differences in policy positions  arise we may: – provide greater clarity on our own policy  positions, through standalone direct  company submissions on policy issues  or direct engagement with policy makers – work as part of that industry association  to understand alternative points of view  and to seek common ground or seek a  broader balanced response to areas of  difference – seek a leadership position in the  governance body of that industry  association to further influence the  policies and perspectives of that  association, or – suspend our membership, if it seems  formal dialogue processes undertaken  for more than 12 months will not resolve  our differences in positions. In making  this decision we would also consider  other benefits (unrelated to climate  change) membership of such  associations brings to our business, our  investors and other stakeholders. For more information for more  information on our work with industry  associations, including our review of their  climate change advocacy activities, see  riotinto.com/industryassociations Climate policy and  advocacy governance Our Climate Policy and Advocacy team  engages with industry associations, civil  society organisations, investors,  government bodies, and other stakeholders  on climate-related policies, regulations,  and reporting. Submissions to direct government  consultations on climate related policy are  typically developed by this team in  conjunction with subject matter experts or  decarbonisation project leads, reviewed by  our government relations and legal teams,  and then approved by the relevant country  Director or senior executive. The Board approves our positions on  climate change policy, our approach to  engaging with industry associations and our  annual review of indirect advocacy.  Management is responsible for comparing  our positions with those of individual  industry associations on a “comply or  explain” basis. 2024 Activities Decarbonising energy systems Government’s sectoral decarbonisation plans and policies  should support investment certainty and drive an orderly  transition of energy systems while supporting operational  decarbonisation through the delivery of sufficient supply of  competitively priced, reliable, low-carbon energy. – In Australia, we participated directly and indirectly through industry associations in the  development of the Electricity and Energy Sector Plan and conducted extensive  engagement with a range of government bodies on the critical role of renewables in our  operational decarbonisation pathways.  – In Canada, we had industry-level discussion with Federal and Territory authorities on the  importance of clean energy for the development of critical mineral mining projects. We  have also proposed the expansion of inter- and intra-provincial power lines to provide  renewable electricity for projects needed for the low-carbon industrial transition, as well as  for the clean electricity tax credit to include intra-provincial power lines. Development of carbon pricing schemes to support  the transition In the absence of global carbon prices, country level carbon  pricing or emissions reductions schemes must balance shared  net zero emissions with competitiveness of our operations and  risks of carbon leakage. – We supported the transition of British Columbia’s carbon tax scheme to an output-based  pricing scheme while ensuring the competitiveness of our recently modernised aluminium  smelter in Kitimat. Through industry associations, we also supported the use of high-quality  regulated credits as an additional tool to meet compliance obligations and to support  emissions reduction outside the scope of the Quebec Cap-and-Trade System.  Development of a sustainable low-carbon liquid fuels  industry   Displacing diesel use requires a range of options, including fleet  electrification and the use of renewable diesel alternatives.  Government policies are required to support the development  of a competitive and sustainable low-carbon liquid fuels market. – We published a briefing paper on Transitioning our Diesel Fleet, including outlining policy  support required. – In Australia, we advocated for supply side mechanisms to support the development of a  competitive renewable diesel market in our submission to the Future Made in Australia: Low  Carbon Liquid Fuels consultation process, and the development of sectoral  decarbonisation plans, and provided technical input into the development of an Australian  renewable diesel standard.  – We submitted support for the development of a new Australian Carbon Credit Unit  methodology to incentivise sustainable biogenic feedstock projects in Australia. – We advocated for reporting frameworks that enable recognition of emissions reduction  from biofuels use and certification of full value chain carbon intensity. Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Climate Action Plan Annual Report 2024 65 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 68 ===== 2024 Activities Progressing decarbonisation plans for the aluminium industry Decarbonisation of hard to abate energy intensive processing  activities requires significant investment in technology  development and deployment, and support which ensures  global competitiveness of these sectors through the transition  in the absence of a global carbon price. – In Australia, we undertook extensive engagement with state and federal government  departments to increase awareness of the aluminium value chain, decarbonisation  pathways and economic considerations. We advocated for support for the transition and  decarbonisaton of these industries in our submissions to the Future Made in Australia:  Unlocking Green Metals Opportunities consultation and the development of the Industrial  Sector Plan (ongoing). Climate-related financial reporting  We support the development of frameworks that encourage  transparency and provide the key disclosures required for investors  and other external stakeholders to compare progress against  climate ambitions, enhance competitiveness in global markets,  attract investment and accelerate the transition of economies. – We provided feedback by our Australian industry associations on Treasury’s Exposure Draft  Legislation and the AASB S2 Exposure Draft supporting alignment with international  standards to balance increased transparency with efficiency of reporting and comparability  of data. Providing the materials and minerals essential to the  energy transition – In Australia, we advocated for the inclusion of copper, aluminium, alumina and bauxite into  Australia’s revised Critical Minerals List as they are central to the clean energy transition  (high-purity alumina was already on the list). Subsequently, aluminium and copper were  included in a newly formed Strategic Materials List. – In Canada, we advocated for the inclusion of high purity iron ore on Canada’s Critical  Minerals List as a key input into low-carbon steel manufacturing. Additional areas of focus for 2025 Growing demand for low carbon products – We will engage with the Australian government’s development of the Renewable Energy  and Product Guarantee of Origin certifications, to promote transparent and consistent  disclosure of carbon intensity. – We will engage with the government of Quebec through public consultation on the future  of the Cap-and-Trade scheme in Quebec, and support the inclusion of indirect emissions  in the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism to support the production of low carbon  aluminium. Physical climate risk and resilience  We will continue to enhance our resilience  to a changing climate, aiming to ensure the  long-term viability of our assets, our people,   communities and broader value chains.  We will: – Monitor risks across our operations and  adapt our processes to make sure our  sites are managed responsibly and  safely for our people, surrounding  communities, and the environments we  work in, now and in the future. – Undertake physical climate risk financial  modelling and enhance the accuracy  and completeness of the data used for  the analysis where possible. – Refine our physical resilience program  based on the outcomes of the physical  risk analysis. Physical climate risk refers to the negative  effects of extreme weather and changing  climate conditions, classified as 2  main types: – Acute climate risks: Sudden, severe events  like tropical cyclones, wildfires, heatwaves,  extreme rainfall, flooding, and hail. These  can disrupt operations, damage  infrastructure, impact communities, and  increase operational costs. – Chronic climate risks: Gradual changes  such as rising sea levels, increasing  temperatures, and altered precipitation  patterns. These can reduce resource  availability, increase costs, affect  productivity and workforce health, and  impact supply chain resilience. Building resilience involves anticipating,  adapting to, and recovering from these  impacts to ensure the long-term viability of  assets, people, communities and value chains. Our strategy and approach Our approach to physical climate risk and  resilience is centred around 4 pillars that  guide our risk management and our work  on adaptation: 1. Weather/climate analytics  and insights    Across the Group, we use advanced  weather and climate data products. These  include short-term weather forecasts and  severe weather forecasts that aid in  operational planning and emergency  responses. Climate outlooks support mine  planning and resilience by providing  insights into rainfall and cyclone patterns.  Catastrophe modelling estimates financial  impacts from extreme events. Long-term  climate change projections assess future  extreme events and inform risk and  resilience assessments, operational  strategies and financial planning. Climate change projections are available for  every site in our portfolio (including non- managed assets). Down-scaled climate  change projections are available for over  60 climate change variables and future  emission scenarios from the IPCC Coupled  Model Intercomparison Project 5 and 6  (CMIP5 and CMIP6). We have completed  flood risk modelling for 100% of our  managed and non-managed assets. These  span present-day, medium and long-term  time horizons.   2. Physical risk identification  and assessment  Our approach to quantifying and assessing  physical risk covers individual assets  (bottom-up) and Group level (top-down).  We first identify climate risks and  opportunities across varying time horizons  and emission scenarios. Next, we evaluate  their potential financial and non-financial  consequences and likelihood, then we  prioritise these risks by materiality for  effective risk management and appropriate  resource allocation. This process is  integrated within the Rio Tinto Risk  Management Information System. The  scope of our assessments includes our  operations and the environments in which  we operate, our people, the communities  who host us and our supply chain.   3. Resilience planning and adaptation  Our resilience planning identifies the most  appropriate resilience measures to manage  climate risks and adapt to them. We  comprehensively evaluate an investment  decision before funding is approved. This  includes prioritising projects and engaging  key stakeholders to seek alignment on the  investment and its implementation.   4. Monitoring and evaluation   We actively and regularly monitor risks, with  clearly defined roles and responsibilities. We  continually evaluate the latest generation of  climate change data and emerging  technologies to assess the risk profile of  our assets and infrastructure over time.  Where we have identified a material change  to the economic, social, environmental or  physical context of the risk, we revisit the  assessment process.   Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Climate Action Plan Annual Report 2024 66 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 69 ===== Risks and impacts  We have identified 8 Group-level material physical climate risks.  The table below takes into account both the short-term risk that could emerge during current operations and the  long-term risk associated with climate change. Key l Short term (0-2 years) l Medium term (2-10 years) l Long term (10+ years) Tailings storage facility (TSF)  containment breach/failure due to  geotechnical instability or  significant erosion event ll Extreme rainfall,  flooding Our facilities comply with local laws and regulations and have risk management  protocols in place, including a Group safety standard for tailings and water storage  facilities. We regularly update this standard and undergo internal and external  assurance checks. Our operational TSFs have, or are developing, tailings response  plans and follow strict business resilience and communications protocols. Water shortages, supply and  availability impacting operations  and production, water treatment  and environmental compliance,  dust control and community  relations ll Rainfall,  temperature We use a water risk framework to identify, assess and manage water risks across our  portfolio of managed operations (see page 36). The framework requires us to consider  whether sufficient water is available to supply both our operational demands and the  demands of other stakeholders within the broader catchment. We apply rigorous  standards and processes to ensure effective controls are in place at all sites. This  includes our Group water quality protection and water management standard, and a  standardised Group water management control library which describes all controls  identified to manage our water risks. Asset-specific climate change risk and resilience  assessments further enable continued improvement of water risk management over time. Damage to critical coastal  infrastructure (shipping berths, ship  loaders, stackers/reclaimers,  conveyors) resulting in operational  and supply chain disruption lll Tropical  cyclone/storm,  wind,  storm surge  Our coastal infrastructure is designed to withstand the wind loading and other  impacts associated with extreme events, including severe tropical cyclones.  Established business resilience management plans offer frameworks for response,  continuity, and recovery in the event of a natural catastrophe scenario, aiming to  minimise damage and resume operations swiftly. Our engineering risk assessment  program, including asset-level critical risk assessments, considers natural  catastrophe modelling and associated risks, if appropriate. Damage and outages of critical  electrical (motors, generators,  cooling systems) and power  (substations, transformers,  transmission lines) infrastructure  leading to operational downtime  and damage to equipment lll Tropical  cyclone/storm,  extreme rainfall,  flooding,  extreme  temperatures,  lightning  Electrical and power infrastructure is designed in accordance with local engineering  and design standards and internal electrical safety standards and is considered in  our asset-specific climate change risk and resilience assessments. Flood risk  modelling (surface water, riverine and coastal inundation) incorporating future  climate change projections has been completed across our portfolio of managed  and non-managed operations. Damage to critical mining and  production infrastructure (eg  fixed plant, conveyors) resulting in  operational disruption lll Tropical  cyclone/storm,  extreme rainfall  and/or flooding  Critical mining and production infrastructure is designed in accordance with local  engineering and design standards and considered in our asset-specific climate  change risk and resilience assessments. Assets located in tropical cyclone-affected  regions have appropriate controls to minimise damage and operational downtime.  Flood risk modelling incorporating future climate change projections has been  completed across our portfolio of managed and non-managed operations. Health and safety and productivity  of workforce resulting in reduced  productivity, dehydration and  impaired ability to work safely and  efficiently ll Extreme heat Controls are in place to manage the risk of extreme heat for our workforce, including  adequate acclimatisation prior to starting work. Those undertaking high-risk heat  tasks are monitored daily for signs or symptoms of heat illness and stress. Operator  checklists ensure adequate hydration and work area management. Provision is  made for cool rest areas with access to cool drinking water. Our workforce is able to  self-pace their workload ensuring regular breaks. Disruption to transport routes  (maritime, rail, air and road access)  and supply chain (supplies and  critical spares and access to direct  customers) lll Tropical  cyclone/storm,  extreme heat,  extreme rainfall,  flooding We are working to better understand the interdependencies across our entire  operation. We operationalised analytics that provide real-time natural hazard impacts  for over 50% of our tier 1-3 goods suppliers. Being alerted to potential supply  disruption in real-time allows our teams to make informed decisions to reduce supply  chain disruption. This work aims to identify critical components of our product group  supply chains and manage the potential adverse impacts from physical climate risk. Acute and chronic climate  change impacting closure  objectives ll Tropical  cyclones/storm,  temperature,  rainfall, flooding,  sea level rise We consider these impacts when planning and executing closure. We use latest- generation climate change projections specific to the site to inform appropriate  landform design, water management and vegetation selection. This is to support  modelling per local regulatory requirements and internal closure standards. Ongoing  and regular monitoring and maintenance of the site is essential to ensure the  effectiveness of closure measures, including monitoring water quality, soil erosion,  vegetation growth and any potential contamination or instability issues. Risk, impact and time horizon Environmental  triggers  Risk management Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Climate Action Plan Annual Report 2024 67 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 70 ===== Modelling financial exposure to  physical climate risk   In 2022, we launched the Physical Resilience  Program, starting with resilience assessments  in the Pilbara and Saguenay–Lac-St-Jean. In  2023, we expanded to a Group-wide  assessment to understand climate risks and  financial impacts. We continue to improve  financial risk modelling and enhance asset- level climate resilience assessments. We update our scenario analysis for  physical risk assessments in line with our  strategic planning cycles or when there are  significant changes to our assets or sites.  This year, there have been no material  changes to our business or operations, so  our current assessment remains relevant.  However, we have revised our assessment  to confirm our business remains resilient to  the identified physical risks. Our climate physical risk modelling analysis,  performed in collaboration with Marsh,  estimated the expected financial losses  from damage to individual assets, across  various time horizons and emission  scenarios caused by physical climate  hazards. This analysis used modelling from  XDI (Cross Dependency Initiative). Losses  associated with business interruption or  productivity loss were excluded due to the  complexity of our value chain and the  increased subjectivity of loss attribution.   This modelling process and methodology  considers the following:   1) Asset portfolio: Includes a significant  breadth of assets, including mining  assets and critical infrastructure  components integral to our operations.  Only active industrial and mining  facilities were modelled, including non- managed operations. Corporate offices  and remote operation centres have  been modelled but are not presented in  this analysis. Assets in our closure  portfolio have not been modelled, but  are considered in bottom-up physical  risk and resilience assessments. 2) Climate scenarios, time horizons  and hazards: Emission scenario Description and outcome Intermediate  emissions  scenario  IPCC  Representative  Concentration  Pathway 4.5  (RCP4.5)  Emissions peak around  2040, then decline.  Relative to the  1986-2005 period,  global mean surface  temperature changes  are likely to be  1.1°C-2.6°C by 2100.   High emissions  scenario IPCC  Representative  Concentration  Pathway 8.5  (RCP8.5)  Emissions continue to  rise throughout the 21st  century and is  considered a worst- case climate change  scenario. Relative to the  1986-2005 period,  global mean surface  temperature changes  are likely to be  2.6°C-4.8°C by 2100.   Multiple future time horizons are  modelled, including 2030 (medium  term), 2040 and 2050 (long term).  Eight climate hazards are modelled in  this analysis, including flooding (riverine  and surface water), coastal inundation,  including sea level rise, extreme heat,  cyclonic wind, extreme wind, forest fire  and freeze-thaw.   3) Annualised damage (AD): The output of  the modelling is calculated for each  asset under various climate scenarios,  time horizons and hazards. AD,  expressed as a percentage, represents  the expected average annual damage to  an asset attributable to climate-related  hazards relative to a fixed value  (eg $1 million). As such, an AD of 0.5%  would mean that for every $1 million of  exposure, $5,000 could be damaged, on  average, in any given year.   Asset-specific outputs have been  aggregated to the site, region and  Group level. Risk categorisation is based  on the AD values, with thresholds set at  <0.2% for low AD risk, 0.2-1% for medium  AD risk, and >1% for high AD risk.  Estimates consider a stationary “do  nothing” approach for our operating  assets and do not consider present or  future controls, or adaptation or  resilience projects that will likely  materially impact our AD cost.  Annualised damage risk scores At the Group level, present day AD losses  fall within the initial range of the medium AD  risk category (0.2-1%). Considering  projected future emission scenarios by  2050, we expect increases in AD. This  places the Group’s AD in the intermediate  range of the medium AD risk category,  potentially exceeding a two-fold rise from  present values.   Currently, across 9 core climate  geographies where we operate, the risk of  AD is low in 3 regions, medium in 5 and high  in 2. Notably, sites in Asia, the Middle East  and Guinea are the primary contributors to  the highest risk classification. In both the  intermediate and high emissions scenarios,  by 2050, eastern Australia and New  Zealand are also expected to be classified  as high risk with up to a four-fold increase  in AD. This is principally due to the potential  effects of coastal inundation, surface water  flooding and cyclonic winds. Other notable  increases in risk are in Europe and the  Middle East (an approximate 60% increase).  The risk trend in Asia is steady through time. In assessing the risk of various hazards  under different emissions scenarios  projected for 2050, there is a notable shift  in the risk profile for various perils across  our operating sites. The number of sites at  risk from coastal inundation, riverine flood  and surface water flood increase under  both future emission scenarios. Of all  hazards, riverine flood sees the largest  increase by 2050 under a high emissions  scenario. The number of operating sites at  risk from cyclonic wind, extreme wind, forest  fire, freeze-thaw and soil subsidence is not  expected to materially change with future  emissions scenarios. Considerations and limitations  Our climate physical risk modelling  acknowledges limitations and uncertainties  due to the dynamic nature of the Earth’s  climate and unpredictable future GHG  emissions. These models represent  plausible futures, not predictions, and are  useful for assessing risks and informing  strategic decisions. The accuracy of our analysis depends on  the quality of asset data and assumes no  changes in operations or design standards.  Each asset is assigned an archetype, which  may not fully capture its unique  characteristics, affecting the risk profile. This analysis is iterative, evolving with new  insights and projections. We plan to update it  regularly to reflect changes in our asset base,  guiding our physical resilience program.

See page 158 for more on our  resilience to physical risk impacts. 2024 progress  Throughout 2024, we made progress on  managing and adapting to our physical  climate risks.   – Global Industry Standard on Tailings  Management (GISTM): In accordance  with GISTM guidelines, we continue to  make progress on the climate resilience  assessment process for our tailings  storage facilities (TSFs). This approach  tests the design basis of each TSF  component, considering future  climate change. We have completed  assessments for high priority TSFs  and are continuing to progress with  assessments for all remaining facilities,  which are expected to be completed by  August 2025. – Supply chain: This year, we  operationalised analytics that provide  real-time natural hazard monitoring for  50% of our supply chain (tier 1-3 goods  suppliers). Being alerted to potential  supply disruption in real time provides  our teams with the opportunity to make  informed decisions to reduce supply  chain disruption.  – Water supply: In 2024, we continued to  enhance our water risk management by  evaluating our ability to maintain a  reliable power supply from external  hydropower providers. This includes  assessing power generation and  electricity transmission. To support this,  we conducted a climate risk assessment  at our ISAL smelter. Action in 2025 In 2025, we will progress our bottom-up  physical risk and resilience assessments  across our operating sites and TSFs, in  accordance with the GISTM. We will  continue to refine and enhance the data  inputs and estimates used in our modelling  to generate more accurate and meaningful  results that will help focus our activities in  2025 and beyond.  – Extension of Value at Risk (VaR)  analysis/financial risk: We advanced the  Global VaR top-down risk assessment  with more detailed financial risk  modelling at a product group level. We  have completed the assessment of our  Iron Ore product group and have  started work on the Aluminium product  group and expect to complete this in  2025. In addition to asset damage, the  product group level assessment also  evaluates the impacts of business  interruption on Group revenue. – Bottom-up risk assessments: Asset- level climate resilience assessments are  advancing across all product groups as  part of a broader multi-year program. In  2025, we plan to perform a  comprehensive review of the  methodologies and governance  processes supporting climate risk  management and resilience measures.  This will focus on strengthening the  integration of climate resilience analysis  and planning into asset-level risk  assessment frameworks and processes. – Water supply: In 2025, we will conduct 2  climate risk assessments on non- managed hydropower supply for the  NZAS and Bell Bay aluminium smelters.  We will also assess our water supply at  our operations in Gladstone.    For more information on physical risk and  resilience, see riotinto.com/climaterisk Climate-related  governance The Board  The Board has ultimate responsibility for our  overall approach to climate change. This  includes the oversight of climate-related  risks, opportunities, strategy, projects,  partnerships, physical resilience, engagement,  reporting, and advocacy as per the Schedule  of Matters. Climate change and the low- carbon transition present material risks and  opportunities for our business, forming a key  part of our strategy and ESG objectives. The  Board approves our overall strategy, policy  positions, and climate disclosures within this  report, delegating specific responsibilities to  committees and the Chief Executive. These  factors are considered in strategy  discussions, risk management, financial  reporting, investment decisions, and  executive remuneration.  The Board regularly receives updates on  climate-related matters at board meetings.  The CFO presents a performance report,  including a dashboard of KPIs and a detailed  decarbonisation scorecard covering, but not  limited to, operational emissions, offsets,  abatement projects and Scope 3 emissions. In the past 12 months, the board agendas  have included climate-related items, such as  discussions on the Boyne Smelter  repowering solutions and NZAS electricity  arrangements. The Board balances  environmental goals with financial and social  implications. For example, we secured 2.2 GW  of renewable energy for the Boyne Island  smelter through PPAs. Although the Pacific  Aluminium Operations average is in the 4th  quartile of the aluminium cost curve,  repowering the smelter should help it move  lower down the cost curve. This decision  highlights the trade-offs between advancing  decarbonisation goals and supporting local  employment in the Gladstone region.  Climate-related matters are also a key part of  the biannual strategy sessions. Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Climate Action Plan Annual Report 2024 69 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 72 ===== In 2022, our shareholders supported the  CAP put forward to them by the Board, in a  non-binding advisory vote on our ambitions,  emissions targets and actions to achieve  them. The Board further committed to  repeating this vote every 3 years, at a  minimum, unless there were significant  changes in the interim, in which case the CAP  would be returned to the next immediate  AGM. The principles which formed the basis  for the development of the 2025 CAP were  presented to the Board in October and  approved as part of the Annual Report  preparation and review process. Progress against commitments in the  CAP is reported once a year to our  stakeholders via the climate disclosures in  the Annual Report. These disclosures are  supplemented with briefing papers, our  Quarterly Operations Review, press  releases and other reports on our  progress. In addition, we consulted our  shareholders and CSOs during the work to  update this 2025 Climate Action Plan. Given the importance of climate-related  matters, we have specifically considered  candidates with experience in climate and  renewable energy when hiring directors.  When considering the composition of the  Board, we used an external consultant to  identify where we need particular strengths  and skills on the Board in relation to climate  and the Group’s forward strategy. We also  request updates from our Directors biannually  regarding any training they have undertaken,  maintaining a register of this information. We  expect our Directors to remain informed and  up to date on relevant matters. To further support the Board’s strategic  oversight of climate risk, we also conduct  teach-in sessions for new projects and key  updates on decarbonisation initiatives. These  sessions are focused on strategic priorities  and are also held when critical decisions  need to be made. For example, during the  Pacific Aluminium Operations repowering  project, the Chief Decarbonisation Officer  briefed the Board on our objectives. While  these teach-ins contribute to capacity  building, there is a need for more formal  training. We will define measures taken to  further enhance Board competencies with  respect to managing climate-related matters. For additional information see our Strategic  context and strategy sections on pages 6-7.   Summary of 2024 activities: – Updated the Group’s operational  decarbonisation pathway and  associated expenditure. – Engaged with investors and civil  society organisations following the  publication of our 2023 Climate  Change Report.  – Approved the 2023 Climate Change  Report and climate-related  disclosures in the 2023 Annual Report  notes to the financial statements. – Approved the principles for inclusion  in our 2025 CAP. – Approved various projects that  support the growth in production of  transition materials and our internal  decarbonisation objectives. – Approved the Group’s strategy and  scenarios, including the use of  climate scenarios and the impact and  opportunities arising from the  energy transition. – Incorporated new long-term  decarbonisation metrics in the 2024  Performance Share Awards (PSAs)  to incorporate 20% of the award  being based on decarbonisation  (People & Remuneration Committee). – Approved Group physical resilience  program (Sustainability Committee). For more information on the Board, their  activities and composition see pages  100-118. Sustainability Committee The Sustainability Committee is responsible  for the oversight of key sustainability issues  including social and environmental matters  that are impacted by climate change,  particularly those relating to water and  biodiversity. An updated Terms of  Reference has been drafted to reflect these  responsibilities including oversight of  physical resilience to climate change. For more information see pages 117-118. Audit & Risk Committee The Audit & Risk Committee is responsible  for risk management systems and internal  controls, financial reporting processes and  the relationship with the external auditors  as noted in its committee charter. This  involves the oversight of significant issues  of judgement relating to the financial  statements including those relating to  climate, consideration of climate policies,  and stress testing our strategy against  selected scenarios. It also includes  appointing and maintaining our relationship  with the external auditors who assure GHG  emissions and ensure the effectiveness  of the risk management framework. People & Remuneration Committee The role of the People & Remuneration  Committee includes the oversight of the  Group’s remuneration structure, including  the use of short- and long-term incentive  plans for the Executive Directors, as  reflected in its charter. This will include  performance against strategic measures  linked to decarbonisation. In 2024, 10% of  the short-term incentive plan (STIP) and  20% of the long-term incentive plan (LTIP)  were weighted towards decarbonisation,  including the progress of our carbon  abatement projects. See pages 119-145 for  four 2024 remuneration outcomes and the  incorporation of climate-related measures in  the STIP and LTIP. Management role Investment Committee The Investment Committee reviews and  approves the Group’s capital expenditure in  relation to abatement projects and climate  change research and development.  Decarbonisation investment decisions are  made under a dedicated evaluation  framework that considers the value of the  investment and impact on cost base, the  level of abatement, the maturity of the  technology, the competitiveness of the  asset and its policy context, and alternative  options on the pathway to net zero.  Projects are also assessed against our  approach to a just transition, with  consideration of the impact on employees,  local communities and industry. For more information see our Capital  allocation and investment framework on  page 63 for more detail. Chief Executive and Executive Committee The Chief Executive is responsible for  delivering the CAP, as approved by the  Board, with the Executive Committee  supporting this role. Risk management,  portfolio reviews, capital investments,  annual financial planning and our approach  to government engagement are integrated  into our approach to climate change and  emissions targets. The annual financial  planning process focuses on the short term  (up to 2 years). The new growth and  decarbonisation strategy is part of the  medium-term planning process.  Remuneration: Our Chief Executive’s  performance objectives in the STIP include  delivery of the Group’s strategy on climate  change. These are cascaded down into the  annual objectives of relevant members of the  Executive Committee, including the Chief  Technical Officer, and other members of  senior management. Decarbonisation is also  included as a performance measure in the  STIP and LTIP as described above. See pages  119-145 for our 2024 remuneration outcomes  and the incorporation of climate-related  measures in the STIP and LTIP.  Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Climate Action Plan Annual Report 2024 70 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 73 ===== As part of our updated evaluation approach  approved by ExCo and the Board in April  2024, we will hold a decarbonisation review  session once or twice a year as part of the  regular ExCo schedule to discuss the overall  decarbonisation roadmap and abatement  portfolio. This will also cover projects and  investment proposals related to mitigating  Scope 3 emissions. The review session will  consider any future changes to our targets or  commitments should they be necessary.  The Chief Decarbonisation Officer and Rio  Tinto Energy and Climate team will organise  and facilitate the forums, with inputs from our  Commercial team on Scope 3 projects. Energy and Climate team In 2022, we established a central team,  Rio Tinto Energy and Climate (RTEC), to  deliver progress on our CAP. This is led by  the Chief Decarbonisation Officer, who  reports to the Chief Technical Officer and is  accountable for all aspects of the CAP. The  RTEC team is structured according to the  main areas of our abatement work that drive  decarbonisation across our operations,  including a Nature-based Solutions team.  Two additional teams complete the RTEC  organisation: a Decarbonisation Office that  monitors and forecasts GHG emissions, tracks  investment decisions and coordinates our  approach to physical climate risks; and a  Climate Policy and Advocacy team that is  responsible for engaging with industry  associations, civil society organisations,  investors, government and other stakeholders  on climate related policies, regulation and  reporting. Rio Tinto Commercial drives the  approach to Scope 3 emissions, given its  responsibility for procurement, shipping and  sales to our customers. The Decarbonisation  Office prepares a quarterly progress report  for the Executive Committee, which includes  operational emissions and progress on  abatement projects and other areas of  our CAP.   Management of climate-related  risks and opportunities  The Board approves our risk appetite and  oversees our principal risks, and is supported  in monitoring material risks by the Audit &  Risk and Sustainability committees.  Climate-related risks and opportunities are  integrated in our enterprise-wide risk  management framework. These are identified  by the product group or supporting functions,  then included in the appropriate risk register.  These will be assigned a Risk owner and  evaluated on the maximum reasonable  consequence and likelihood of the risk.  Consequences may include the impact on  Group free cash flow or business value, or  reputation and licence to operate. These risks  are escalated to the appropriate level of  management for oversight and action. See  pages 88-91 for more detail on our risk  management process, emerging risks,  materiality matrix and assessment of  principal risks.  We actively monitor and assess the potential  impact of climate risks and opportunities on  our operations and business through  scenario planning. See pages 43 and 66 for  more detail on how we use scenarios to  identify climate-related transition and  physical risks and portfolio opportunities.  Climate change and the low-carbon  transition remain critical emerging risks, with  potential to have a significant impact on our  business and the communities where we  operate. Emerging risks that could  materially impact strategic objectives are  incorporated within our principal risks and,  where possible, we develop responses to  mitigate threats and create opportunities  for the Group. Climate-related risks and  opportunities linked to several of these  principal risks are listed below:  – 2. Preparing our Iron Ore business to  meet the demand for low-carbon steel.  – 4. Minimising our impact on the  environments we work in and building  resilience to changes in those  environments, including climate change  and natural hazards. – 7. Delivering on our growth projects. – 8. Achieving our decarbonisation  targets competitively. – 10. Conduct our business with integrity,  complying with all laws, regulations  and obligations. See pages 91-98 where we have described  the risk or opportunity, the key regions  impacted, our risk management responses,  and the relevant groups with oversight of  each process. These risks or opportunities, if material, are  linked to one of the above Group principal  risks and reviewed on a quarterly basis by  the Risk Area of Expertise and the Risk  Management Committee (RMC). All  employees are empowered to own and  manage the risks that arise within their area  of responsibility. Our Centres of Excellence,  comprising our 2nd line of defence, provide  deep subject matter expertise, for example  steel decarbonisation. Our Internal Audit  function provides independent assurance.  Where required by law, or where deemed  appropriate, we also engage third parties to  provide independent assurance. Where  risks are material to the Group, they are  escalated to the RMC and, as appropriate,  to the Board or its committees.  For more information see pages 88-98 on  our approach to risk. Climate-related metrics  and data We have established key metrics to help us  track our progress against our decarbonisation  targets, ensuring we are advancing towards a  sustainable and low-carbon future. Our metrics help us manage and monitor our  climate risks and opportunities including  metrics for transition-related opportunities (the  increased demand for transition materials)  provided on page 46 (transition materials  metrics), and physical risks metrics including  the financial exposure metric and annualised  damage metric detailed on pages 68-69.  We have also disclosed other ESG-related  KPIs, metrics and targets that integrate  with our objective of striving for impeccable  ESG credentials within the respective  Environment, Social, and Governance  sections of this Annual Report. A summary  of these metrics is found on page 34 with  other Group KPIs on pages 12-14. Scope 1 and 2 emissions: Our operational emissions targets are  ambitious - to reduce emissions by 50% by  2030 relative to 2018 levels, reaching net  zero by 2050. Our targets cover more than  95% of our reported Scope 1 and 2  emissions and are aligned with 1.5°C  pathways. We adjust our baseline to  exclude reductions achieved by divesting  assets and to account for acquisitions.  Our definition of net zero applies to our  operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions on  an equity basis. See pages 49-57 for detail  on how we are reducing emissions in our  own operations. Scope 1 emissions are direct GHG emissions  from facilities fully or partially owned or  controlled by Rio Tinto. They include fuel use,  on-site electricity generation, anode and  reductant use, process emissions, land  management and livestock. Scope 2  emissions are GHG emissions from the  electricity, heat or steam brought in from  third parties (indirect emissions). This is  consistent with the World Resources Institute  (WRI) and World Business Council for  Sustainable Development (WBCSD)’s  Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol: A  Corporate Accounting and Reporting  Standard (Revised Edition) (2015).

Acquisition of Mitsubishi's interest in Boyne Smelters (11.65%), Sumitomo  Chemical's interest in New Zealand Aluminium Smelter (20.64%) and Boyne Smelters (2.46%), taking NZAS equity to 100% and BSL to 73.5%. Equity increase for the Ranger mine to  98.43%. Divestment of Lake MacLeod Dampier salt operations (removal from the baseline). 1. Rio Tinto share (equity basis) as a Baseline represents emissions from our benefit or economic interest in the activities resulting in the emissions. Emissions accounted for represent  current equity and ownership for the full year. 2. The baseline value is based on the current equity in each asset, including zero equity in divested assets. Scope 2 emissions in the baseline are calculated using the market-based method. 3. Carbon credits used towards our 2024 net emissions calculation include Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) that were retired for compliance for the period 1 January to 30 June  2024 plus a projection of the number of ACCUs we expect to retire for the period 1 July to 31 December 2024. This projection is based on our Scope 1 emissions for the period 1 July -  31 December 2024. Rio Tinto retires ACCUs for liability under the Australian Safeguard Mechanism. Baselines for sites are calculated using known production intensity factors combined  with actual reported production. Liability is determined when actual emissions exceed these baselines. Due to the misalignment of timing (Safeguard being July-June), carbon credits  reported against the net emissions number include actual ACCUs retired for liability in the Jan-Jun 2024 part of the reported NGER FY24, and calculated liability using actual  production and emissions for Jul-Dec 24.

However, as a result of the Australian Government’s sanction measures,  QAL is currently prevented from tolling for Rusal and Rio Tinto is currently utilising 100% of the tolling capacity at QAL. Our 2024 equity emissions and our 2018 baseline include QAL  emissions on the basis of Rio Tinto’s 80% ownership. In 2024, the additional emissions associated with Rio Tinto’s additional tolling capacity were 0.8Mt. 1. Scope 1: Emission factors are consistent with the most applicable national or regional reporting guidance or schemes. For emissions not covered by government reporting, factors from the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories are used. A full list of references is included in the 2024 Scope 1, 2 and 3 Emissions  Calculation and Climate Methodology report. In 2024 as part of the implementation of a new GHG reporting tool, the Scope 1 factors for all sites were re-visited. Some adjustments were made  to provide greater alignment with government reporting and regional factors.  2. Scope 2: Market-based method counts commercial decisions to purchase the unique rights to renewable energy as zero emissions and applies a residual mix factor (or similar) to the  remaining MWh purchased. The residual mix factor is typically equivalent to the grid intensity with renewable attributes that have been sold removed from the factor. Scope 2 emission factors  are consistent with the Australian National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Measurement Determination 2008 for Australian operations location-based reporting. For non-Australian  operations, where possible, factors are sourced from public grid level data or electricity retailers. For market-based reporting, Scope 2 includes the use of renewable electricity certificates  (RECs) and all contracts where we have the exclusive rights to the renewable energy attributes.  Market-based emissions reported as zero include Oyu Tolgoi, ISAL aluminium, Resolution Copper, Weipa, Richards Bay Minerals and Kennecott Copper with surrendered RECs. Escondida  and QMM have renewable energy PPA contracts with energy attributes.  3. Carbon credits used towards our 2024 net emissions calculation include Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) that were retired for compliance for the period 1 January to 30 June  2024 (retired) plus a projection of the number of ACCUs we expect to retire for the period 1 July to 31 December 2024 (planned). This projection is based on our Scope 1 emissions for  the period 1 July - 31 December 2024. For details, refer to the table ''Carbon credits retired towards net emissions (equity basis)'' in our 2024 Sustainability Fact Book. 4.

Scope 3 emissions  are prepared on an equity basis, taking into account our economic interest in all managed and non-managed operations. Scope 3 emissions  are indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated as a result of activities undertaken across the value chain. Scope 3 emissions are  divided into 15 categories, covering activities both upstream and downstream of our operations. Of these categories, Category 10 –  Processing of sold products – accounts for about 94% of the identified emissions across our value chains. For further details, refer to our  2024 Scope 1, 2 and 3 Emissions Calculation and Climate Methodology report. We engaged KPMG to provide limited assurance on Scope 3 emissions estimates in 2024. The assurance statement can be found on  page 321. 1. To identify and calculate Scope 3 emission sources across our operations, we have used the WRI and WBCSD, Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and  Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) (2015), GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (2013) and the Technical Guidance for Calculating  Scope 3 Emissions (version 1.0).  We estimate the emissions from our customers' processing of iron ore, bauxite, alumina, titanium dioxide, salt and copper concentrate using a combination of internal emissions  modelling, regional and industry level emissions factors and production and sales data. Third party shipping and transportation of our products to our customers, intercompany  transport of products and transport of fuel and other supplies are also calculated and reported. Emissions associated with the manufacture and supply of purchased and capital goods  are included in the Scope 3 inventory. Scope 3 emissions deemed to be material at Group level are reported on an equity basis as part of our disclosures in the Annual Report and our submission to the Carbon Disclosure  Project. Where there are significant changes to the calculation methodology of Scope 3 categories to improve the maturity and accuracy of reported emissions, an approximate  equivalent to the historical reported numbers using the new methodology will be provided.

The following categories are excluded for the reasons provided:  Category 8: Upstream leased assets. Rio Tinto does not lease significant upstream assets.  Category 11: Use of sold products. This category is not applicable since Rio Tinto does not produce any fossil fuels or manufacture products applicable to this category.    Category 12: End-of-life treatment of sold products. Rio Tinto’s products include metals and minerals with minimal emissions at end of life. This category is not applicable since Rio Tinto  does not produce any fossil fuels or manufacture products applicable to this category. Final products related to Rio Tinto’s material value chains (steel, aluminium and copper) produce  materials with established recycling industries.   Category 13: Downstream leased assets. This category is not applicable since Rio Tinto does not lease significant downstream assets.  Category 14: Franchises. This category is not applicable since Rio Tinto does not have franchised operations.  Category 15: Investments. This category is for reporting emissions from company investments not already reported in Scope 1 and 2. Rio Tinto reports using the equity share approach, so all  Scope 1 and 2 emissions from managed and non-managed investments are included in Scope 1 and 2 reporting and Scope 3 emissions within other applicable categories of Scope 3 reporting. In 2024, emissions have been restated to ensure comparability with the material change in the spend-based emissions methodology. Amendments have been made in Category 10 bauxite  and alumina processing due to identified double counting of emissions for non-equitable bauxite and alumina. For further details on Scope 3 reporting refer to the 2024 Scope 1, 2, and 3  Emissions Calculation and Climate Methodology. Calculation methodology – Scope 3 emissions categories The calculation methodology for Scope 3 emissions categories associated with a target or goal is provided below. See our 2024 Scope 1, 2  and 3 Emissions Calculation and Climate Methodology report for detail on all Scope 3 emissions categories.  Category  Calculation boundary  Calculation methodology and notes 1. Purchased goods  and services, and  2. Capital goods – Includes emissions associated with relevant purchased  goods and services.  – Excludes emissions associated with other Scope 3  categories ( fuel, energy and transport). – Includes emissions associated with the upstream  goods purchased or acquired by the business for  capital projects.   – Spend data method using operating business costs for managed sites  on equity basis using EXIObase, US Environment Protection Agency,  UK Government spend-based  factors.  – Scope 3 emissions are calculated for major consumables and raw materials  using quantity based reporting. – Where unavailable, non-managed site costs are estimated using costs from  similar production facilities. 3. Fuel and  energy-related  activities – Includes emissions from the production and  transportation of purchased fuels, including natural  gas, diesel, coal and energy sources not included in  Category 1. This includes transmission losses from  purchased electricity. – Fuel and energy consumption data from Rio Tinto business systems.  Factors are sourced from the Australian National Greenhouse Accounts  Factors (Australian NGA), UK Government, International Energy Agency  (IEA) and National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).  4. Upstream  transportation  and distribution – Total Scope 3 GHG emissions from upstream  transportation and distribution of Rio Tinto products.  – Includes all inbound transport, all inter-company  transport paid for by Rio Tinto and all outbound  product transport paid for by Rio Tinto (e.g. under cost,  insurance and freight (CIF, CRF) or similar terms).  – Includes emissions from bulk marine shipping,  containerised shipping, road and rail transport of  sold products and inbound transport emissions of  major consumables. – Excludes emissions from Rio Tinto owned vessels (this  is included in Scope 1 emissions).  – For our managed fleet (period-chartered and spot), actual emissions are  derived from consumed fuel reported from each individual voyage.  Estimated emissions from non-managed voyages (FOB and similar terms)  are calculated using the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI)  guidelines including vessel type-size, cargo volumes and distances. Generic  EEOIs are sourced from the 4th International Maritime Organization (IMO)  GHG Study. – For containership, road, rail and air, UK Government conversion factors  have been utilised. Transport emissions estimated by spend data and  EXIObase emission factors are also included in this section. 10. Processing of  sold products – Includes emissions related to the processing of iron  ore, bauxite, alumina, TiO2 feedstocks, copper  concentrate and salt. “Other” includes an estimate for  processing emissions related to Rio Tinto’s other  products, including molybdenum and minor minerals.  – Emissions calculated as described in this report.  – High purity products like gold, silver and diamonds, which are low  volume and have minimal amounts of further processing, are considered  not material.

Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Climate Action Plan Annual Report 2024 75 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 78 ===== Social  Our values of care, courage and curiosity define who we are. They shape how we behave,  how we operate and how we solve problems. By putting these values into action, we will  continue to build trust, from the inside out.  The health, safety and wellbeing of our  employees, contractors and communities is  core to our values, and to what we stand for  as a company. Nothing matters more. We are on a multi-year journey to create a  workplace where everyone feels safe,  respected and empowered to have a good  day, every day. Long-term, transformational  cultural change is a complex process, and  the Everyday Respect Progress Review,  which we conducted in 2024, confirms  there remain serious challenges we must  continue to address. But our people believe  we are heading in the right direction, and  we are determined to stay the course  in strengthening our work culture.  Everyone deserves to feel physically  and psychologically safe at work,  without exception.  Wherever we operate, we work with  communities to understand the social,  cultural, environmental and human rights  impacts of our activities. We work hard to  avoid, mitigate and manage adverse  impacts, and to respect human rights  throughout our value chain. And we  engage respectfully to listen and  respond to concerns and contribute to  positive outcomes for host communities  and society. Living and working with care, courage and  curiosity will help us deliver the future we  want for our people and to be the best  operator and partner we can be.  Safety It is with deep sadness that we reflect on  the tragic fatal events at our managed  operations in 2024.  On 23 January, a plane crashed shortly  after takeoff near Fort Smith, Northwest  Territories, Canada, resulting in the loss of  6 of the 7 people on board, including 4  Diavik team members and 2 airline crew  members. We remember our colleagues  who lost their lives - Diane Balsillie,  Howard (Howie) Benwell, Joel Tetso,  and Shawn Krawec. Another member of our  Diavik team survived, was treated in hospital  and subsequently released.  The Transport Safety Board of Canada  continues to investigate this tragic event,  with the investigation expected to be  completed in 2025.  Following this event, we critically evaluated  our aviation management approach across  the Group to identify and implement  opportunities for improvement. On 26 October, Morlaye Camara, an  employee of one of our contractors, was  injured at the SimFer Port Project in  Morebaya, part of the Simandou project,  and subsequently passed away from his  injuries. Following a thorough review to  understand the circumstances that led to  the event, we have shared the lessons  learned with our leaders and partners,  encouraging them to reflect on how these  relate to their teams and workplaces, and  act upon what we have learned.  We are also saddened by serious safety  events reported across our industry more  broadly, including 2 fatal events at our  non-managed operations. Additionally, we remain concerned for  Gel Aguaviva, a crew member aboard our  bulk carrier RTM Zheng He, managed by  Anglo Eastern, who was reported missing on  26 December. A search and rescue operation  led by the Philippine Coast Guard is ongoing.  We care deeply about the health, safety and  wellbeing of everyone involved in our  business, and these tragedies highlight the  ongoing need to prioritise these aspects  every shift, every day.  Guided by our firm belief that all fatalities  are preventable, we are committed to  applying the lessons learned across our  business to continuously improve our  practices and prevent similar future events.  This includes focusing on identifying,  managing and, where possible, eliminating  risks so everyone goes home safely. We also recognise cultural and operational  contexts vary across the regions where we  operate, and fostering a strong safety  culture is a commitment we share with our  partners. In 2024, we internally shared   lessons from past fatal event investigations  conducted by our non-managed operation  partners, as we believe two-way sharing and  learning is key to supporting our collective  safety maturity journey. We also continue to  work together to prioritise health and safety  in ways that resonate locally and uphold our  standards globally. Image: Gers in grasslands, Mongolia. Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  Annual Report 2024 76 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 79 ===== Across our managed operations, we  continue to see serious events where  people are exposed to potential fatal  incidents (PFIs). The main safety risks at our  managed operations relate to falling  objects, falling from heights and  vehicle-related incidents, which account for  62% of total PFIs and remain at the  forefront of our safety maturity efforts. Our all-injury frequency rate (AIFR)  remained at 0.37 in 2024, consistent with  2023. We continue to see a disparity in  safety performance for employees  compared to contractors, and remain  focused on supporting contractor safety by  further integrating teams into our safety  culture, and learning from them.  In 2024, we experienced 5 significant  potential process safety events: 3 at  Richards Bay Minerals in South Africa, one  at Bell Bay Aluminium in Australia, and one  at New Zealand’s Aluminium Smelter in New  Zealand. We continue working to mature our  management system and culture, through  our process safety improvement plan.   Critical risk management (CRM) CRM remains our primary fatality  elimination tool, making sure critical  controls are in place and working where  there is a fatal risk. In 2024, our teams  continued to reconnect with why we have  CRM and enhance the quality of  verifications by checking the right critical  controls are in place for each task.  In 2024, we began work to strengthen our  safety control framework to align with our  evolving risk profile, which will extend into  2025. This will enable us to improve safety  and enhance assurance. By offering visibility  into the performance of the framework, we  can proactively identify improvement areas  and adapt before something goes wrong. Safety maturity model Leadership and strong processes are  critical in driving a sustained improvement  of our safety performance and safety  culture. This is evident in the  implementation of our safety maturity  model (SMM), introduced in 2019. SMM is  our blueprint for safety, integrating best  practices in leadership, engagement,  learning, risk management and work  planning, as well as operational ownership  of health and environmental risks.  In 2024, we continued to work closely with  our assets to evaluate and evolve their  safety maturity and foster both physical and  psychological safety. Through this, we have  refined our assessor training program,  placing more emphasis on elements such as  mindsets, behaviours and felt experiences.  This supports our belief that all employees  and contractors should feel empowered to  work safely, speak up and make decisions  that prioritise their wellbeing.  While we acknowledge cultural  transformation is a long-term journey, we  are encouraged by our SMM assessments  outcomes in 2024. These have significantly  deepened our understanding of each site’s  safety culture and support actionable  insights to guide us towards creating an  even safer work environment.  In 2025, we are looking to further evolve  SMM to improve safety across our value  chain and support our Best Operator focus.

Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Social  Annual Report 2024 77 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 80 ===== Health and wellbeing Occupational health  We aim to ensure everyone goes home  safe and healthy every day. In 2024, we  recorded 147 new occupational health  illnesses (2023: 103), reflecting our  increased focus on identifying, investigating  and preventing health conditions arising  directly from work. Many occupational  illnesses develop over a long and  continuous period, requiring sustained  efforts to reduce exposure reduction  over time.  In 2024 we:  – Completed occupational and industrial  hygiene monitoring at our operational  and managed assets, assessing noise,  airborne particulates, gas and other  contaminants. These insights provide  valuable insights into our exposure  profile and help us to prioritise actions  to ensure effective controls are in place.  – Redesigned fit-for-purpose medical  assessments at our Australia-based  operations, with a plan to expand to our  assets across the rest of the world  in 2025. – Continued to standardise how  occupational health and hygiene data is  digitally collected and accessed,  transitioning from manual to more  secure and streamlined digital collection  processes that deliver improved risks  and trends insights to support our  health management initiatives. – Implemented 7 projects at 6 assets  to successfully reduce exposures to  known health risks for our employees  and contractors. For more information see riotinto.com/health Mental health and wellbeing Mental health is a core part of our health  and safety culture, with a responsibility to  support all aspects of our people’s  wellbeing. We pay particular attention to  creating a psychologically healthy and safe  work environment, while providing support  to our people for their mental health needs,  wherever they may arise. In 2024 we: – Conducted an increasing number of  psychosocial risk assessments and  provided leader training to better  address psychosocial hazards in the  workplace and improve the experience  of work for our people. – Supported the principles of good work  for worker wellbeing through our People  Experience programs, such as improving  inclusion and diversity, providing fair pay  and flexible work, consulting and  communicating with our people, and  supporting career progression and job  adjustments over the employee lifecycle. – Used insights from our twice-yearly  People Survey to inform our approach  to mental health. – Furthered our efforts to develop a  psychologically healthy and safe  workplace by designing our facilities,  teams and culture to eliminate  psychosocial risk, and raising awareness  and delivering training to our leaders to  help them recognise and support people  experiencing mental ill-health. – Provided employees with tools and skills  to support their mental health, such as  our global Employee Assistance  Program (EAP) and our global Peer  Support Program, where 100% of our  1,650 peer supporters are trained in  mental health support. We also  continued to offer domestic violence  support programs to all employees. – Raised awareness of mental health in the  workplace through global campaigns  such as World Mental Health Day and  our company-wide Mental Health Week,  which included a program of activities,  wellbeing resources and an external  video series. – Continued several partnerships with  mental health organisations, including   Lifeline Australia, a new 5-year  partnership with Western Australia- based Telethon, and our continuing  support for the Fondation Jeunes en  Tête in Quebec over the last 29 years. – Maintained our Tier 2 rating in the  2024 CCLA Corporate Mental Health  Benchmark Global 100+, ranking as the  4th top improver in the last 3 years  (out of 100). – Contributed to industry-wide  improvements of psychosocial risk  management as an active member of the  Minerals Council of Australia (MCA)  Psychosocial Risk Management Working  Group, and through our participation in  the ICMM Psychosocial Risk and Worker  Wellbeing Management Working Group,  which is helping to build a standard for  our industry and shape a new definition  of psychological health. For more information on how we’re  creating an environment where everyone  feels safe, respected and empowered, see  pages 78-80 and 86-87. Talent, diversity and inclusion We are committed to building a culture  where everyone, everywhere feels safe,  respected and empowered to have a good  day, every day. Insights from 2024 Listening to our people  In 2024, we held 2 People Surveys to gain  insights from the voices of our employees  across the company to better understand the  steps we can all take to make Rio Tinto a better  place to work.   We heard from more than 41,000 employees  in our fourth quarter People Survey, who  shared over 100,000 comments. Our  employee satisfaction score (eSAT) was 74  and our Recommend Rio score 72, both  consistent with the 2023 score. The second  highest score (77) was in response to “I am  treated with respect at work”, and “I feel safe  at work” had the highest score (78). From the  feedback, we recognise we can improve the  way we take meaningful action as a result of  the survey (58) and how people collaborate  to get things done (62). We have an expectation that every leader will  review the results and discuss them with their  teams, and generate an action plan to create  improvements. This year we introduced a new  culture metric as part of our Group  performance scorecard. Using our People  Survey results, we are tracking an average over  time of all questions to target and improve the  overall experience for everyone working  at Rio Tinto. In April, 2 years after publishing the Everyday  Respect Report, we launched a Progress  Review, conducted again independently by  Elizabeth Broderick & Co. (EB&Co.). More  than 10,050 individuals completed the survey,  1,318 participated in virtual and in-person  listening sessions and 342 submitted  confidential written contributions. On 20 November, we published the findings  of the Progress Review. Change is  happening and we are making progress.  However, people are still experiencing  behaviours and attitudes in our company  that are unacceptable and harmful. We are  greatly troubled by this and sincerely  apologise to anyone affected. Safety, both  physical and psychological, remains our  number one priority and supporting our  people when harm happens always comes  first. And there is still more to do. We must  continue to focus on ensuring that the  workplace experience reflects our  values consistently. The survey data in the Progress Review was  an important temperature check for us.  Nearly half of survey respondents reported  an improvement in relation to bullying, sexual  harassment and racism, with a majority of  employees expressing confidence that  Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Social  Annual Report 2024 78 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 81 ===== Rio Tinto will make a meaningful difference in  these areas in coming years.  Achieving the sustained change we  want to see in our workplace will require  ongoing focus and effort from everyone at  Rio Tinto. We remain committed to cultural  transformation and will accelerate our efforts.  To be successful, we must take the time to  listen to everyone in Rio Tinto and  understand all perspectives. Our efforts will  be focused on increasing our opportunities  to listen to understand and ensure our  workplaces support everyone.  For more information about Everyday  Respect, and to read the Progress Review,  see riotinto.com/everydayrespect Building respect More than 99% of our leaders have  completed the “Building Everyday Respect”  training, along with 97.4% of employees  globally, strengthening everyone’s  understanding of what good looks like and  how to be an upstander.  For more information about our work to  support employees’ psychological health  and safety see the health and wellbeing  section on pages 78. Creating an inclusive workplace  We are committed to ensuring our  workforce reflects the communities where  we operate and offering a workplace that is  inclusive of everyone, everywhere.  In 2024, we set a target on our Group  scorecard to continue to build women’s  representation. Our target was 25.8% of our  workforce, and we achieved 25.2%. We were  pleased to see senior leaders increase from  30.1% to 32.0% and operations and general  support from 17.7% to 18.9%. We are not  satisfied with this result and remain  committed to increase the representation  of women in our workplace.   We are making progress on our ambition to  increase representation of ethnic minorities  in our global senior leadership population  (Executive Committee direct reports) to  18% by 2027. We currently have 14.3%,  which represents a small increase from our  baseline. Aligned to the requirement of the  Parker Review1 we have also set a target of  17% representation of ethnic minorities in  our UK-based senior management  population by end 2027.  We monitor the  diversity of succession plans for all senior  roles and ask that our executive search  partners provide diverse candidate slates.  The introduction of Workday this year will  help us gain a more complete global data  set, enabling us to more accurately monitor  progress on increasing representation.    Inclusive Voices, our Global Employee  Resource Groups (ERGs) communities, was  launched to elevate the voices of  underrepresented groups and allies, and  address barriers to diversity. These ERGs  are employee-led and ExCo-sponsored,  kicking off with LGBTQ+ Voices, Gender  Equal Voices and Neurodiverse Voices,  joining the Elevating Voices Network in  Australia, established in late 2023. We  recently announced champions for 4 new  Inclusive Voices ERGs that will launch in  quarter one 2025 to improve the  experiences of our people with disabilities  and amplify our cultural diversity.   Developing our talent This year we launched a new talent  framework, Career Conversations, to give  our people greater agency in their future  careers and development. It centres around  our people, their values-based  performance, motivations and experiences,  supporting them to plan their career and  development in collaboration with their  leader. Launched to senior leaders in 2024,  Career Conversations will be rolled out  more broadly across the organisation in  2025 and 2026.    We continued our commitment to support  individuals at the start of their career with 235  graduates and 280 interns joining the  organisation in 2024. Our graduate program  provides stretching development  opportunities, including our Innovation  Challenge, and enables interns to build  business skills and experience while studying.  This year we launched a new development  curriculum, recognising the different learning  preferences for these graduates. Grad Tok  uses technology, video and digital resources to  provide development resources in short, easily  digestible formats that can be accessed as  needed as part of a curated learning journey. In 2024, 6,084 new hires joined the  business, of which 1,821 were contractors  becoming permanent employees (2023:  9,166 new hires of which 2,718 were  contractors).   Investing in leadership development To best equip our most senior cohort to  lead culture change, we have now had over  three-quarters of the senior leadership  group (77%) complete the Voyager  program. This program encourages leaders  to reflect deeply, role model psychological  safety, understand empathy and build  connection to lead in a complex  environment. We have maintained a sustained focus on  the importance of coaching, with a further  523 leaders completing our Leader as  Coach program which supports our Safe  Production System roll out. To support our frontline leaders, this year  we launched Leadership Fundamentals,  designed to build core leadership skills, with  individual modules focused on key areas such  as how to build a team and how to create a  safe environment. More than 695 frontline  leaders have participated in the program.  There have been 31 Safe Production  System deployments at operational sites  this year, bringing a focus to mindsets,  behaviours and skill development for  our leaders. For more information about how we are  increasing Indigenous leadership in our  business see the CSP commitments  section on page 83. Equality through pay equity Ensuring that employees with similar skills,  knowledge, qualifications, experience and  performance are paid equally for the same  or comparable work is intrinsically linked to  our commitment to inclusion and diversity.  We remain committed to eliminating  any residual pay inequities based on  gender or other non-legitimate dimensions  of difference.  Our equal pay gap, the primary lens we use  when assessing gender pay, measures the  extent to which women and men employed  by our company in the same location, and  performing work of equal value, receive the  same pay. Our 2024 equal pay gap was less  than 1.5% in favour of men.  Our gender pay gap is a measure of the  difference between the average earnings of  women and men across the Group  (excluding incentive pay), regardless of role,  expressed as a percentage of men’s  earnings. Our 2024 gender pay gap was  less than 1% in favour of women.  For more information about our  commitment to pay equity see  riotinto.com/payequity 1.

Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Social  Annual Report 2024 80 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 83 ===== Community engagement and social investment The strength of our relationships with the  communities who host us, and broader  society, is central to our business.  Our Communities and Social Performance  (CSP) teams work across our entire  business. They provide technical expertise  to continually evolve and improve our  approach to engaging with communities  where we operate. These teams include  experts ranging from archaeologists,  anthropologists, social scientists and  economic development experts to human  rights specialists and operational leaders.  Our teams and assets operate in line with  our global Communities and Social  Performance Standard, which we revised  and strengthened in 2022. Our standard  provides clear direction on the minimum  requirements expected and how we can  deliver better social outcomes and  strengthen our social licence.  We aim to build enduring relationships with  Indigenous Peoples and communities that  host our operations. We respect the deep  physical, spiritual and cultural connection  that Indigenous Peoples have to the land,  waterways, culture and nature. Investing in  genuine partnerships is critical to unlocking  the socio-economic opportunities created  by our decarbonisation strategy. By  listening to understand, being transparent  and willing to learn from our mistakes, we  will help build lasting outcomes for host  communities and society.  2024 progress We continue to strengthen our social  performance capacity and capability to  become a better operator and partner.  In 2024, our CSP practitioners continued to  increase their knowledge through online and  face to face learning and knowledge sharing. It is essential that we listen to, and act on,  the views of communities that host our  operations. In 2024, together with Voconiq,  a third-party engagement science research  company, we launched our global  Community Perception Monitoring program,  Local Voices. The program will help us to  engage more effectively and better  understand communities’ perceptions,  leading to improved data-driven decisions. CSP targets In 2024, we progressed initiatives towards our  2026 CSP targets. We also extended those  targets for one year, to conclude in 2027, to  accommodate Group-wide productivity and  culture initiatives. We launched our Human  Rights in Action learning program for  employees in higher-risk human rights roles,  with an 85% completion rate. We continued to  implement management frameworks for  cultural heritage management and strategic  social investment partnerships, and to increase  Indigenous leadership in Australia. For more information about our CSP targets  see page 34 or visit riotinto.com/communities Social investment  We partner with host communities to deliver  positive and lasting outcomes. Engaging  local services, employing local people,  buying local products and investing  in thriving regional economies creates  real value for host communities and  our business. In 2024, our total voluntary global  social investment was $95.9 million,  covering a wide range of social and  economic programs.  Our goal for social investment is to  contribute to strong and resilient  communities in thriving regional economies.  We are doing this by applying a more  strategic approach to how we partner  with communities so we can deliver the  outcomes that are important to them.  For more information about our social  investment, see riotinto.com/ socialperformance and the 2024  Sustainability Fact Book. Country updates QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM),  Madagascar In 2023, QMM increased its community  commitment to $4 million per year over  25 years, with half to be spent locally and  half in the region. This was part of the fiscal  agreement between the Government of  Madagascar and Rio Tinto announced  in August 2023. In September 2024,  following several community engagements,  the list of projects was submitted to the  representatives of the Government of  Madagascar and approved by the Council  of Ministers.  In 2024, QMM completed the regional  rollout of backpacks for children in the  District of Fort-Dauphin. A total of 38  primary schools, with more than 11,000  children, benefited from these critical  school supplies. QMM also supported the  community health mission of the NGO  Médecins de l'Océan Indien (MOI), an  initiative that aims to facilitate free access  to essential medical care for more than  19,000 patients in Fort-Dauphin and the  surrounding area. In April 2024, Rio Tinto plc received a  “letter of claim” from UK law firm Leigh Day  representing 64 individuals living in the  Mandena region of Madagascar where  QMM operates. We are taking the letter  seriously. Although we cannot comment on  the letter itself given the initiation of a legal  process, QMM’s published independent  studies on water quality and radiation within  the community, taken over the last 3 years  (available on Rio Tinto’s website), do not  support the allegations raised in the letter.  Resolution Copper project, Arizona, US At our Resolution Copper project, we  remain committed to preserving Native  American and local cultural heritage while  delivering long-term benefits to the region.  In 2024, we continued building relationships  with Native American Tribes and local  communities, strengthening partnerships  focused on cultural preservation, youth  recreation, and economic development.  We also advanced and signed the Good  Neighbor Agreement with the Town of  Superior, local communities and  stakeholders from the Pinal and Gila  counties to support a lasting,  collaborative relationship. For more information visit riotinto.com/ projects  Simandou project, Guinea We are committed to delivering significant  and tangible economic and social benefits  to the local communities surrounding the  Simandou iron ore project in Guinea. We  continue to work closely with community  representatives to understand their  priorities and concerns, and to design and  deliver social investment programs that  contribute to improving living conditions. Earlier this year, we reached an important  milestone with the approval of SimFer’s Land  Acquisition and Resettlement Framework and  the associated site-specific Resettlement and  Compensation Action Plans. This framework  covers our operations on the mine, the rail  spur and port, and has been developed  following extensive consultation with  impacted communities and the Government  of Guinea. We have ensured that our plans  benefit from their knowledge and experience  and that all possible steps are being taken to  minimise disruption, provide appropriate  compensation, and restore the livelihoods of  the people and communities affected. We  recognise our ability to positively contribute  to Guinea's long-term social and economic  development beyond the immediate impact  of our operations. Our dedicated social and  regional economic development programs  focus on partnering to build essential  capacity, including in health and education,  and to foster strong economic linkages and a  more resilient, diversified economy. We are  also contributing to important infrastructure  such as the development of the Conakry  Urban Park. Together with all our partners, we are  committed to developing the Simandou  project in line both with national regulations  and internationally recognised environmental,  social and governance standards. Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Social  Annual Report 2024 81 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 84 ===== Oyu Tolgoi, Mongolia At Oyu Tolgoi, we are working in  partnership with communities and  government, contributing to sustainable  social and economic change through long- term strategic partnerships. Since 2015, we  have invested $52 million to the Gobi Oyu  Development Support Fund (DSF) for long- term sustainable development in Umnugovi  aimag and partner soums.  In 2024, the fund provided $6.4 million  towards a waste recycling facility; a heating  sub-station; the extension of sewage  pipelines; improved medical and  educational services and a cultural heritage  preservation initiative. In 2023, Oyu Tolgoi  committed $50 million over 5 years to  support the Khanbogd soum town  development by 2040. In 2024, the  renovation of the Galba park was  completed as well as a 7.16km road  construction project in the town centre.  Other projects began, including a  recreational sports complex, and education,  health and business development initiatives.  Oyu Tolgoi works in partnership with the  Khanbogd soum administration and the  herder community as part of The Tripartite  Council. In 2024, there was significant  progress in delivering community projects  relating to sustainable herder livelihoods,  student scholarships, and pastureland  water access. In late 2023, Rio Tinto and UNESCO established a long-term  partnership to foster sustainable  development initiatives in Mongolia.  In 2024, the first joint initiative started which  focuses on preserving Mongolia’s unique  cultural heritage and paleontological sites,  empowering local communities and creating  responsible tourism practices.    Panguna mine, Bougainville,  Papua New Guinea The Panguna Mine Legacy Impact  Assessment (PMLIA) was published in  December 2024.   The independent report assesses the  environmental impacts and directly  connected social and human rights impacts  caused by the Panguna mine since  Bougainville Copper Limited (BCL) ceased  operations in 1989.  Conducted by independent consultants  Tetra Tech Coffey over the past 2 years, the  entire PMLIA process was overseen by the  Oversight Committee which is made up of  representatives from the Government of  Papua New Guinea, the Autonomous  Bougainville Government (ABG), landowner  and community representatives, BCL,  Rio Tinto and the Human Rights Law Centre  (HRLC). The report is available on the  Panguna Mine Legacy Impact Assessment  Oversight Committee’s website. We welcomed the release of the PMLIA  as a critical step forward in building  understanding of the long-term legacy  impacts of BCL’s former mine in Bougainville. In November 2024, Rio Tinto, BCL and ABG  signed a Memorandum of Understanding  (MoU) to discuss ways forward. The MoU  parties plan to address the PMLIA findings  and develop a remedy mechanism  consistent with the UN Guiding Principles  on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).   Rio Tinto has acknowledged a class action  lawsuit filed in July 2024 in Papua New  Guinea's National Court of Justice, naming  both Rio Tinto and its former subsidiary  Bougainville Copper Limited (BCL) as  defendants. On 20 September 2024, Rio  Tinto submitted its defence against the  legal claim. The company will strongly  defend its position in this case. For more information on our ongoing  commitments, see riotinto.com/panguna Rincon Lithium Project, Argentina In 2024, the Rincon project remained  committed to responsible mining and  community engagement.  We are working together with the local  communities, listening to their needs and  aspirations and ensuring their voices are  heard in decisions that affect them. Our support for community development  initiatives includes: – supporting higher education  scholarships through a partnership with  Fundación Anpuy and UCASAL  University and other institutions – initiating an urban forestry project,  donating 60 trees and protective  planters crafted by local people using  repurposed pallet wood from the  project’s waste – supporting employability through  training 67 individuals for operator and  laboratory positions. These programs help ensure we are  contributing to a sustainable and long-term  positive impact for the region. China partnerships We extended our partnership with the  China Development Research Foundation  for the next 3 years, supporting rural  revitalisation in Bijie, Guizhou Province,  through early childhood development,  renewable energy utilisation and cultural  heritage preservation. We continued  supporting Daying Qijiang Foreign  Language School in Sichuan Province, a  partnership since 2008, and strengthened  our partnerships with a number of leading  Chinese universities to explore innovative  solutions to climate change and  environmental challenges. Update on our CSP  commitments We continue to find better ways to improve  our cultural competency, processes and  engagement after the tragic destruction of  the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in May  2020. This includes reviewing our mine  plans, improving agreements, strengthening  our social performance governance,  capacity, and capability, and building strong  relationships with Indigenous Peoples  and communities. In this section, we provide an update on our  progress on some of the commitments we  made as part of the Rio Tinto Board Review  in 2020 on cultural heritage management.  This progress is summarised under 3 areas:  relationships, governance and process, and  leadership and inclusion. For more information see our 2021 and  2022 Communities and Social  Performance Commitments Disclosures  at riotinto.com/cspreport Relationships We have been changing the way we work  and engage with communities and  Indigenous Peoples in every part of our  business. Our approach aims to enhance  our understanding and appreciation of  Indigenous cultural heritage and ensure  that Indigenous voices inform our planning  and decision making. While we have made progress, some  relationships with Indigenous communities  remain challenged. We are committed to  working together to achieve positive,  long-term outcomes for the communities  where we operate. Protecting and preserving Yinhawangka  culture, Pilbara, Australia  We have partnered with the Yinhawangka  Aboriginal Corporation to design a program  aimed at protecting and preserving  Yinhawangka culture.   The “Living Cultures Program” will deliver  projects to record, preserve and transfer  cultural knowledge. This includes language,  living history and heritage, women’s  business, arts and culture, songlines  and traditional stories. The partnership  also aims to increase local economic  development opportunities, improve social  and emotional wellbeing for community,  enhance cultural land management by  Yinhawangka and develop and deliver  cultural awareness training.  Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Social  Annual Report 2024 82 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 85 ===== Exploration agreements  In 2024, we implemented agreements with  local communities at some of our advanced  exploration projects in Chile and Angola.  At the Nuevo Cobre copper exploration  project in northern Chile, a joint venture  with state-owned Codelco, we reached  framework agreements with 5 Indigenous  communities of the Colla People.  In Angola, we signed an agreement with  5 villages around the Chiri site, which is an  advanced diamond exploration project and  joint venture with the state-owned Endiama.  The agreement focuses on promoting  community development in agriculture,  adult literacy and local employment. Shared vision with Indigenous partners at  our Diavik diamond mine In October 2024, we hosted a closure  workshop for Tłı̨cho Government  participants to discuss the mine’s closure  plans and integration of Traditional  Knowledge. The workshop allowed  Traditional Knowledge holders and Tłı̨cho  Government’s technical staff to engage with  Diavik employees and view the site.  The meeting focused on water quality,  vegetation and land considerations. Progressing renewable energy with   Ngarluma, Pilbara, Australia  In July 2024, together with the Ngarluma  Aboriginal Corporation, we announced  plans to progress the development of an  80MW solar farm on Ngarluma Country,  near Karratha, Western Australia to supply  renewable energy to our Pilbara operations. When complete, this project has the  potential to reduce the amount of natural  gas currently used for generation across  our Pilbara operations by up to 11% and  could reduce Rio Tinto’s emissions by up to  120kt CO2e.  This project demonstrates our commitment to  working together with Indigenous communities  towards a more sustainable future. For more information read the story at  riotinto.com/pilbararenewables Governance and process We continue to implement our Communities  and Social Performance Standard, and  revise systems and processes to help us  meet external expectations and deliver  better social and human rights outcomes.  In 2024, we continued to strengthen our  risk management processes, using a  structured approach to risk identification  and management. This included the  development of Group level “bow  ties” (analysis tools for risk management)  and updating our critical controls to better  prevent and mitigate cultural heritage and  social impact risks across our operations. Australian Advisory Group We established the Australian Advisory  Group (AAG) in 2022 to provide  independent expert advice to our  executives on matters impacting our  relationship with Indigenous Peoples and  communities in Australia.  In 2024, discussions focused on care for  Country and culture, complex social  transitions, and implementing the  UN Declaration on the Rights of  Indigenous Peoples.   As part of the AAG’s staggered terms of  engagement, inaugural members Michelle  Deshong and Shona Reid stepped down,  and we welcomed June Oscar AO and  Dr Teagan Shields. June is a proud Bunuba  woman from Western Australia and a strong  advocate for social justice and women’s  issues. Teagan is a proud Arabana woman  who is passionate about Indigenous-led use  of traditional knowledge in biodiversity  conservation. The AAG is made up of 5 other leaders  including Professor Peter Yu AM (AAG  Chairman), Djawa Yunupingu, Nyadol Nyuon  OAM, Cris Parker and Dr Yarlalu Thomas. The Oxford Leading Sustainable  Corporations Programme In 2024, 223 senior leaders successfully  completed the Leading Sustainable  Corporations Programme. This is the third  year we have partnered with the Oxford  Saïd Business School. The 12-week course helps our leaders build  their understanding of current and  emerging environmental, social and  governance issues and how best to embed  sustainable thinking into broader business  activities and planning. It is essential that we  understand our impacts better, in order to  achieve our objectives and future growth  aspirations, and be a more sustainable and  responsible business. Cultural heritage management  In 2024, our assets that took part in the  Independent Cultural Heritage Management  audit in 2021 and 2022 completed a self- assessment against our maturity framework,  to identify gaps for improvement. We also  launched a template to help standardise  our assets’ Cultural Heritage Management  Plans. This will ensure a consistent  approach to protecting and managing  cultural heritage across our business.  These actions are part of our target to  co-manage cultural heritage with  communities and knowledge holders  by 2027.   Find out more about our approach to  cultural heritage at riotinto/ culturalheritage Leadership and inclusion We want Indigenous Peoples to have a  stronger voice in our company and in the  decisions that affect their rights and  interests. This will help us shape, influence  and challenge our decisions for the better.  Indigenous leadership Our Indigenous Leadership Program in  Australia focuses on advancing and  empowering Indigenous leaders. To help  grow Indigenous leadership, we are  improving pathways to employment,  increasing the number of employment  opportunities and providing positive  experiences for current and future  employees so they can actively grow  their career.  We now have 61 Indigenous leaders in our  business in Australia, in areas such as  Finance, Information Technology, Human  Resources, Projects, Legal, Commercial,  Government Relations, Risk and Audit. And  these Indigenous leaders sit at the  decision-making tables, contributing to the  future direction of our company.  RioInspire In 2022, we partnered with the Australian  Graduate School of Management at the  University of New South Wales to deliver the  RioInspire Indigenous Leadership program.  RioInspire is a ground-breaking, globally  recognised program that focuses on  developing executive-ready Indigenous future  leaders. In 2023 and 2024,  37 Indigenous  leaders graduated from the program, with  7 of them continuing to complete graduate  certificates and MBAs. In 2024, we introduced  the program globally, with 4 Indigenous  leaders from Canada and the US taking part. Cultural Connection To create an inclusive, culturally safe and  respectful environment for Indigenous  People we need to ensure our employees  have a good understanding of the culture,  heritage and history of Indigenous Peoples  in Australia.  Our Cultural Connection program  ensures our leaders have an informed  understanding of Indigenous culture,  and know how to build strong, trusted  relationships with the Indigenous  community and Indigenous employees.   In Australia, around 90% of our senior  leaders have completed the program and  we are now delivering it to our next cohort  of leaders.  In 2024, we recruited a Global Chief Advisor  Indigenous Relations and plan to expand  our Indigenous leadership program to  North America in 2025. Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Social  Annual Report 2024 83 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 86 ===== Cultural safety We are committed to creating culturally  safe environments where people of diverse  cultural and ethnic backgrounds can feel  respected and safe – spiritually, socially,  emotionally and physically.  In 2024, we introduced new resources  to support our leaders in talking about  the importance of cultural safety and  strengthening it within their teams. We also  continued to expand our Elevating Voices  Network which is led by a small group of  Indigenous and non-Indigenous employees  who activate events, activities and  conversations for its members. Living Languages Living Cultures Our Living Languages Living Cultures  program promotes and invests in  preserving, reviving, and celebrating  Indigenous cultures and languages  in Australia. In 2024, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal  and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS)  unveiled the AIATSIS Centre for Australian  Languages and the Our Languages Keep Us  Strong program. With our support, this  initiative is dedicated to protecting  Indigenous Australian cultures and  knowledge, and increasing understanding  about the value of Australia’s first languages. Supporting Indigenous businesses We support local businesses, employ local  people and buy local products, especially  from Indigenous, small and regional  businesses. In 2024, we spent more than  A$926 million with Indigenous businesses  across Australia – an increase of 27.7% on  the year before. We are also increasing our  spend with local and Indigenous businesses  in North America. In 2024, we spent $216  million with Indigenous suppliers in this  region.  We have many success stories of  the positive impact we are having on local  Indigenous communities. One example is in  Canada, where our Aluminium Quebec  Operations partnered with an Indigenous  sawmill company, Sciages GP, from the  Pekuakamiulnuatsh community, to supply  essential wood parts for shipping our  aluminium globally. This contract has  created a significant number of jobs in  Mashteuiatsh and supports the local  economy. Truth and reconciliation We continue to commemorate and celebrate  Indigenous events and observance days  across our business. In 2024, we ran a global  communications and engagement campaign  around International Day of the World’s  Indigenous Peoples. Raising awareness  through stories, messaging and materials  helps our people better understand and  respect Indigenous history, culture and  People, which contributes to a safer and  more inclusive workplace.

Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Social  Annual Report 2024 84 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 87 ===== Human rights Respecting human rights is core to our values  and to delivering our business strategy.  Commitment We are committed to treating everyone with  dignity and respect – from our employees,  contractors and workers in our value chain, to  the communities we partner with, and others  affected by our activities and business  relationships. We know that our activities, and  those of our partners, can have both a positive  and a negative impact on human rights. By  embedding rights-respecting and ethical  behaviour throughout our business, we will be  better able to prevent human rights harm. To  do this, we rely on: – empowering people through an inclusive  and supportive business culture that  aligns with our values – embedding human rights due diligence  into business processes and systems – engaging with stakeholders to identify  and address root causes of human  rights harm. Regardless of the operating context, our  approach to human rights remains consistent  and aligned with the UN Guiding Principles on  Business and Human Rights, and other  international standards and frameworks.  For more information see our Human  Rights Policy at riotinto.com/humanrights 2024 progress Governance We continue to evolve our human rights  performance to help prevent our involvement  in adverse human rights impacts. We regularly  review and update internal standards, systems  and processes to integrate human rights due  diligence and promote more responsible and  ethical ways of working. In 2024, we provided  the Sustainability Committee with an update  on our human rights performance. Salient human rights issues We identify the priority human rights issues  that could severely impact people through our  activities or business relationships. These  issues consider our operational footprint, value  chain and external contexts and include: – land access and use – Indigenous Peoples’ rights – security – inclusion and diversity – community health, safety and wellbeing – workplace health and safety – labour rights (including modern slavery) – climate change and just transition We continue to identify issues related to  water and environment, and nature as  emerging salient issues. In 2025, we will  review our Group-wide salient issues.  Assets conduct self-assessments to enable  a more complete understanding of their risk  context. There has been a significant  increase in the quantity and quality of  human rights risk self-assessments at  assets (59 completed in 2024 compared to  24 in 2023). These self-assessments -  whether standalone or integrated into  broader enterprise risk assessments - help  assets prioritise and take action to prevent  human rights harm that is, or may be,  connected to our activities. Examples of  assessments included at our Pacific  Aluminium assets as part of the Aluminium  Stewardship Initiative certification; at 26  closure assets; and an independent human  rights impact assessment at Simandou.  Security and human rights assessments are  ongoing at assets in more complex security  contexts that involve both private and  public security arrangements. For more information see our 2024  Sustainability Fact Book at riotinto.com/ sustainabilityreporting Our business relationships We partner with communities, business  partners and other stakeholders to advance  respect for human rights in line with  international standards and our values.  Our joint venture partners  We continue to work with joint venture  partners to provide human rights technical  support and monitor human rights  performance, including through Board and  Committee roles for non-managed operations.  Suppliers Using a risk-based approach through our  third party due diligence process, we pre- screen our potential business partners and  complete desktop human rights reviews. In  2024, 6,359 third party due diligence  reviews were completed, and 174 were  escalated for human rights review. For  higher-risk suppliers, we have developed  action plans to support ongoing monitoring  and evaluation of identified risks.  We expect our suppliers (including  subcontractors) to adhere to our Supplier  Code of Conduct (SCOC), which includes  respecting human rights. We updated our  SCOC in 2024, alongside a new set of  Sustainability Procurement Principles.  The updated SCOC better reflects our  commitments to sustainability, ethics and  social responsibility with updated  requirements on labour and human rights. In 2024, we focused due diligence efforts  on higher-risk supplier categories, including  logistics and renewables, due to operating  contexts, and potentially higher-risk  workforces. Our approach focuses on  influencing broader industry change  through trusted partnerships, rather than  avoidance and termination of relationships.   We also appointed a panel of independent  human rights auditors to assess the labour  rights performance of suppliers in high-risk  categories and completed 3 pilot audits  across key operating regions.  For more information see our annual  Modern Slavery Statement at  riotinto.com/modernslavery Grievance and remedy  Effective grievance management can  enable more trusted relationships and help  prevent human rights harm from occurring  in the first place. Every asset is required to  have a grievance mechanism.  We are committed to providing for, or  cooperating in, remediation when we identify  we have caused or contributed to human  rights harm. We may also play a role in  remediation where we are directly linked to  harm through our products, services or  operations. Receiving feedback, complaints or  grievances from stakeholders is an important  part of ongoing human rights due diligence. In  2024, the human rights team provided support  on a range of internal investigations and  assessments with a focus on grievance and  remedy processes, including at Oyu Tolgoi,  Kennecott and in Laos. Capacity building on human rights Since everyone has a role in respecting  human rights, our people are our first line of  defence. In 2024, we developed a 3-year  learning strategy which focuses on respect  for human rights.    We also launched a global learning program  called Human Rights In Action to support our  target to train everyone identified in higher- risk human rights roles by the end of the year.   Higher-risk roles identified included a large  proportion of our senior leaders across a  range of functions and assets.   The program included virtual events, a  mandatory self-directed e-module and a  toolkit to cascade learnings throughout the  business. We will consider how this program  continues to evolve in 2025. Our broader  human rights training records are available  in the 2024 Sustainability Fact Book.  Collaboration It is crucial that we collaborate with peers,  civil society organisations and others, given  the systemic nature of human rights issues.  We identify and embrace initiatives that  work to mitigate the root causes of human  rights harm. We advocate on public policy  efforts that help businesses further respect  human rights. We continue to engage with  peers, investors, civil society organisations,  workers’ organisations and business  partners on issues relating to human rights.  In 2024, we continued to support ICMM’s  Human Rights working group, the Human  Rights Resources and Energy Collaborative,  and the Mining Association of Canada’s  International Social Responsibility Committee.  We actively participate in the Voluntary  Principles Initiative and UN Global Compact  networks and attend regional business and  human rights forums in Africa, Asia and Europe. For more information about how we engaged  with key stakeholders, including civil society  organisations, see pages 9 and 106-108. Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Social  Annual Report 2024 85 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 88 ===== Governance Our reputation as a business that operates with high levels of integrity depends on the  actions we take and decisions we make each day. We expect our people and partners to  uphold the highest standard of integrity, act ethically and do the right thing.  Transparent, values-based, ethical business We empower our people to seek guidance  when faced with ethical or business  dilemmas – both to prevent incidents from  occurring, and to protect them and others  from harm. The way we treat our people, our  partners, the environment and the  communities where we work, and how we  conduct business, are what makes us a  responsible partner of choice. 2024 progress Compliance program developments   Business integrity is core to how we build  trust with our stakeholders. It forms the  foundation of our ability to run our  operations and maintain an ethical culture.  We have continued to evolve our compliance  program to align with leading industry  practice, changes to the regulatory  landscape and business integrity risks we  face across the countries where we operate.  During the year, we undertook a maturity  assessment of our program, which concluded  our program has a higher level of maturity  than benchmarked peers.  In 2024, we delivered several compliance  program improvements: – We refined our online disclosures system  for gifts and entertainment from, and to,  third parties, conflicts of interest and  sponsorship and donations. This  increases transparency, promotes  simplification, and allows us to automate  approvals and workflow.  – We launched a new Compliance  Champions program, developing and  leveraging a site-level network of  employees to promote ethical behaviours.  – We uplifted the maturity of our Data  Privacy Compliance Program. This  included implementing a refined Privacy  Impact Assessment process and a new  Privacy Statement, and reinvigorating  the Data Privacy Lead network across  the Group, while continuing to ensure  compliance with new and changing  privacy legislation across the  jurisdictions where we operate.  – We continued to enhance our Third- Party Risk Management (TPRM)  framework. We piloted a new TPRM  system to increase automation and  improve risk management exposure from  third parties. We expect the new system  to launch across the Group in 2025.   – We continued to invest in our Sanctions  Compliance Program through enhanced  sanctions screening processes of third  parties, deep dive reviews for parts of the  business with higher sanctions exposure,  and increased training of employees.  Code of Conduct and annual training To  help equip our workforce to navigate  uncertain areas and spot ethical and  compliance-related risks, in 2024, we  launched a new annual Code of Conduct  training. This training sets the foundation for  the way we work, guiding ethical decision  making and reflecting the safe and respectful  environment we want to achieve for our  people. Based on our Code of Conduct, it is  designed to help all employees and  contractors live our values of care, courage  and curiosity.  For information on our Code of Conduct,  see riotinto.com/ethics The new Code of Conduct training  incorporates topics across all areas of our  Code, providing examples of the values,  commitments and behaviours we expect of  our people. The online training has been  completed by 27,050 of our people, and  21,406 have completed the offline version.  Our Executive Committee attended an  immersive face-to-face session.  In addition to online Code of Conduct  training, the Ethics and Compliance team  delivered tailored risk-based face-to-face  training on anti-bribery and corruption, data  privacy, anti-trust and trade sanctions. A total  of 7,624 employees received this training in  2024.  We also provided business integrity  training to our third parties on a risk basis.  myVoice, our confidential  reporting program  A respectful and inclusive workplace, with a  strong ethical culture that reflects our values,  must include a safe space where individuals  can speak up  with confidence and without  fear of retaliation. A strong culture of speaking  up enables us to identify and address potential  issues swiftly, respond appropriately, minimise  risk, and ensure care for our people and the  communities where we  operate.      The myVoice program enables confidential  and anonymous reporting, including  protected whistleblower disclosures.  myVoice is operated by the Business  Conduct Office (BCO), which reports to our  Chief Legal, Governance and Corporate  Affairs Officer. The BCO provides regular  program insights to the Board and the  Group Ethics and Compliance Committee.  For information on how we manage cyber  security, see riotinto.com/cybersecurity Image: Our Integrated Operations Centre,  Brisbane. Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG Annual Report 2024 86 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 89 ===== Care Hub  In 2023, BCO launched Care Hub, a  confidential service designed to provide  more channels for our people to raise  concerns, and greater access to a range of  support as well as non-investigative  resolution options. It is available to anyone  directly or indirectly impacted by disrespect  and harmful behaviours at work, such as  bullying, harassment, sexual harm, racism and  discrimination. Care Hub has been widely  accessed across Rio Tinto, supporting over  675 individuals during 2024 (and around 250  in 2023), as well as facilitating resolution  options other than investigations. Continuous improvement The number of concerns raised through  myVoice continues to increase yearly, with  1,920 reports in 2024 (2023: 1,614). Our new  mobile intake route was introduced in June  to supplement existing web based, phone  and proxy reporting. The web-based route  remains the most used (61% of reports). The reporting rate per 100 headcount rose  to 3.4 in 2024 from 2.9 in 2023, with over  half of reporters (54%) happy to reveal their  identity, despite the small increase seen in  anonymity rates in 2024 (46%, up from 40%  in 2023). BCO substantiated more reports in 2024  (283) than in 2023 (267). However, the  substantiation rate has declined: 44% of 642  reports investigated and closed in 2024,  down from 53% of 500 reports in 2023.  The median average case closure time for all  cases closed in 2024 was 30 days, consistent  with 30 days in 2023. The mean average case  closure time in 2024 was 91 days from 65  days in 2023, the increase being influenced  by a drive to close aged cases. In 2024, we delivered several  enhancements to the BCO program.  The BCO is looking to improve access to  information and is exploring options to  better share data on our website. As an organisation we recognise there is  more work to do to improve our culture.  Each person's experience of misconduct is  unique. We are committed to holding  ourselves accountable and having controls  in place to identify where our business  processes may have created an opportunity  for misconduct to arise. This is critical to  ensuring our people feel safe and  respected in the workplace.  Transparency  We believe greater transparency and  accountability are key to earning and  building trust, encouraging sustainable  business practices, and translating taxes  and royalties into beneficial outcomes for  communities who host our operations.  Being transparent about our tax payments,  mineral development contracts, beneficial  ownership, and our stance on a range of  other sustainability issues – like climate  change – allows us to enter into open, fact- based conversations with our stakeholders.  This leads to a better understanding of  everyone’s roles and responsibilities. We are a founding member of the Extractive  Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), and  a signatory to The B Team Responsible Tax  Principles. We report in full the  requirements of the “Tax” standard (GRI  207) of the Global Sustainability Standards  Board of the Global Reporting Initiative,  including full country-by-country reporting. Political integrity We do not favour any political party, group or  individual, or involve ourselves in party  political matters. We prohibit the use of  company funds to support political  candidates or parties. Our business integrity  procedure includes strict guidelines for  dealing with current and former government  officials and politicians. They cannot be  appointed to senior employee positions or  engaged as consultants, without the approval  of executive management and our Chief  Ethics and Compliance Officer. We regularly  engage with governments and share  information and our experiences on issues  that affect our operations and our industry. We join industry associations where  membership provides value to our business,  investors and other stakeholders. We outline  the principles that guide our participation  and the way we engage, and a list of the top  5 associations by membership fees paid at  riotinto.com/industryassociations. We also  track and disclose how we engage on climate  policy issues, disclosing when the policies  and advocacy positions adopted by industry  associations differ materially from ours. We  continue to strengthen our approach and  disclosures on industry associations. Voluntary commitments,  accreditations and memberships   We take part in global, national and regional  organisations and initiatives that inform our  sustainability approach and standards,  helping us better manage our risks. These  independent organisations and initiatives  assess and recognise our performance, and  we participate in industry accreditation  programs for some of our products.

Strategic report  |  Our approach to ESG  |  Governance  Annual Report 2024 87 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 90 ===== Our approach to risk management Taking risks responsibly is key to delivering our strategy in a way that creates value for our  customers, shareholders, employees and partners. To deliver our strategy, in a way that  creates value for our customers,  shareholders, employees and partners,  it is essential that we take risks responsibly. Our risk culture fosters awareness,  transparency, and informed decision- making. It reflects our values, is consistent  with our Code of Conduct, The Way We  Work, and is implemented through our risk  management framework.  Our risk management framework includes  our risk appetite, which outlines the level of  uncertainty we are willing to accept to  achieve our strategic objectives. It is  developed with input from our leadership,  approved by the Board, and is used  throughout our Risk Management Process.  This integration ensures we are effectively  managing threats and opportunities to our  business and host communities, as well as  protecting nature.  Our risk management process Set strategy,  objectives and  risk appetite Perform risk  assessment Identify and evaluate  risks to strategy and  objectives. Perform risk  management Implement controls  and actions to  manage risks within  risk appetite. Perform risk  assurance Check and verify  that controls and  actions are effective  in managing risks.  Identify, prioritise  and implement  improvements. Communicate risk  insights Communicate  current and  emerging risk  exposure to inform  decisions. Improve and  embed risk  management Build risk capability  and culture so active  management is  embedded in how  we run our business. Plan Do Check Act Our risk management process follows  international standards and operates as a  Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle. This provides a  systematic yet flexible approach to respond  to the dynamic business environment we  operate in.  When identifying and assessing risk, we take  into account both financial and non- financial impacts on our business, the  environment and communities where we  operate. We assess the materiality of each  risk, enabling us to escalate when necessary  and prioritise resources where they are  most needed.  We actively monitor how well we manage  risks that are material to our objectives by  verifying that the design of our response  (actions and controls) remains resilient to  changing conditions, and by checking the  implementation of the response against our  actual performance. We enhance the  check-and-verify step by applying the 3  lines of defence approach, which remains a  core part of our risk management  framework. We look to continually improve  and strengthen our risk culture and  framework through enhancing processes,  tools and training. We use an enterprise-wide risk  management information system (RMIS)  with integrated tools and applications to  capture, manage and communicate material  business risks. These tools support decision  making and prioritisation through  transparent, up-to-date data.

The Board is  supported in monitoring a range of material  financial and non-financial current and  emerging risks by the Audit & Risk and  Sustainability committees. The Audit & Risk  Committee also monitors the overall  effectiveness of our risk management and  internal control frameworks and principal  risks. Pages 113 to 118 detail the committee’s  activities in 2024. The Board’s extensive  range of skills, experience, and knowledge  contributes to a well-rounded perspective  on risk management.  The Board has delegated responsibility for  day-to-day management of the business to  the Chief Executive, and through him, to  other members of the Executive Committee  under a Group delegation of authority  framework. Our product groups and Group  functions, along with several risk-oversight- focused executive and operational  committees, support the Chief Executive in  the effective management of our material  risks. Our Risk AoE is responsible for the  design and implementation of our risk  management framework globally,  supporting risk assessments and delivering  timely insights to executives and the Board.  Under our 3 lines of defence model, all  employees are empowered to own and  manage the risks that arise within their area  of responsibility. Our CoEs, comprising our  2nd line of defence, provide deep subject  matter expertise and objective challenge.  Our Internal Audit function provides  independent assurance. Where required by  law, or where deemed appropriate, we also  engage third parties to provide  independent assurance. Where risks are  material to the Group, they are escalated to  the Risk Management Committee and, as  appropriate, to the Board or its committees. Emerging risks  Emerging risks are new or evolving risks that  are highly uncertain by nature and have the  potential to significantly impact the Group.  Emerging risks are typically less predictable  and lack precedents, making them challenging  to assess or mitigate. Given our diverse  portfolio and geographical footprint, we are  exposed to many highly uncertain, complex  and often interrelated risks. We remain vigilant  to the leading indicators of emerging risks,  potential impact and responses. Our analysis is  anchored on our global scenarios as outlined  in the Strategic context section on page 6. Emerging risks that could materially impact  strategic objectives are incorporated within  our principal risks and, where possible, we  develop responses to mitigate threats and  create opportunities for the Group. We  monitor these risks closely for changes in the  external factors and reassess them as they  evolve and new information is discovered.  The Board reviews these risks periodically. Geopolitical risks continue to shape the  global economy. They create uncertainty  through changing trade policies, tensions  between major economies, regional  conflicts, and sanctions which could disrupt  supply chains and market access. We  monitor global developments closely and  stress-test the resilience of our business  model, including our supply chains, through  scenario planning to identify potential  management responses. These include, but  are not limited to, developing our capability  to settle and receive renminbi (RMB). Please  refer to principal risk 11 and 14 on pages 97  and 98 for further details of our key  management responses. Strategic report  |  Our approach to risk management Annual Report 2024 89 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 92 ===== Climate change and the low-carbon  transition remain critical emerging risks, with  potential to have a significant impact on our  business and the communities where we  operate. Physical risks such as extreme  weather events, water scarcity, and shifting  temperature patterns have the potential to  disrupt production, damage infrastructure  or increase costs. Transitional risks continue  to be a global agenda, with governments  and regulatory bodies increasingly  implementing stricter emissions regulations  and targets. We actively monitor and assess  the potential impact of these on our  operations and business through scenario  planning. Where appropriate, we take a  proactive approach to responding to the  uncertainty. This includes committing to  decarbonisation targets and associated  capital expenditure, optimising our portfolio  for future demand, and developing deeper  understanding of exposure across the  business using the latest generation climate  analytics. Please refer to principal risks 2, 4  and 8 on pages 92, 93 and 95 and the  Climate Action Plan on pages 41-75 for  further details.  Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and  advancing technologies have the potential to  unlock transformative opportunities for  businesses through enhancing efficiency,  and data-driven insights to support decision  making, driving pace and breadth of  innovation. It is also in its infancy, which carries  significant unknown risks. Our focus is on  robust monitoring and internal upskilling to  understand this evolution, supported by strong  governance processes to support its use. Longer-term viability statement  Context  Our business model underpins our ability to  deliver on our strategy. This is outlined on  page 8. Our business planning processes  include modelling a series of macroeconomic  scenarios and using various assumptions that  consider internal and external factors. As part  of our risk management framework, we  closely track, monitor and mitigate principal  risks to our business plan and model.  Viability assessment process and  key assumptions The assumptions underlying our business  plan and macroeconomic forecast have the  greatest level of certainty for the first 3 years.  Our longer-term viability assessment  examines the first 5 years (2025-29) of the  business plan. This allows for a detailed  analysis of the potential impacts of risks  materialising in the first 3 years, and enables  us to further stress test the business plan for  risks materialising towards the end of the  time period, although with less certainty.  The principal risks and uncertainties section  outlines risks that could materially affect our  performance, prospects or reputation. For  the viability assessment, we have considered  principal risks that could severely impact the  Group’s liquidity and solvency in addition to  non-financial impacts.  Assessment of viability The risks and key assumptions  considered in our longer-term viability  assessment are as follows:   Risk A: Remaining competitive  through economic cycles or shocks Scenario assumptions: An economic  shock arising in 2025, caused by  escalating geopolitical tensions, a trade  war or military actions, leading to a  sustained loss of confidence in financial  markets and supply chain disruptions. It  assumes commodity prices experience  large negative pricing shocks in 2025  through 2029 and a short-term supply  disruption for key commodities. The  scenario relates to principal risk 11  (Remaining competitive through  economic cycles or shocks by maintaining  strong financial and operating  performance underpinned by a healthy  inventory of high-quality reserves). Risk B: Group material major hazard  or cyber risk  Scenario assumptions: A catastrophic  event occurs, resulting from a major  operational failure such as a tailings or  water storage facility failure, extreme  weather event, underground or  geotechnical event or a cyber event  that impacts operational systems. It  assumes multiple fatalities, cessation of  operations and significant financial  impacts. We have assumed 3 such  events occur within the assessment  period, each with significant but varied  impacts. The scenario relates to  principal risks 1 (Preventing loss of  operational control that may lead to  potential fatalities, permanent  disablements, or material production  disruption) and 12 (Preventing material  business disruption and data breaches  due to cyber events).   Risk C: Delivery of our growth  projects  Scenario assumptions: A risk driven by  evolving societal expectations and  changing laws affecting the timelines for  delivering sustaining or growth projects.  We have assumed an impact on our  near-term key projects and considered  available alternatives. The financial  impact assumed here is in addition to  any non-financial impact, such as  reputational harm. The scenario relates  principal risks 3 (Building trusted  relationships with communities), 6  (Building trusted relationships with  Indigenous Peoples) and 7 (Delivering on  our growth projects). Results of assessment We quantify the expected financial impact  of each risk based on internal  macroeconomic and business analysis, as  well as internal and external benchmarking  on similar risks. We apply a probabilistic  approach to quantify risks and impacts  where relevant.    The first 5 years of the Group’s business plan  has been stress-tested for each risk to assess  the impact on the Group’s longer-term viability,  including whether additional financing facilities  would be required. In addition to liquidity and  solvency, the assessment considered other  financial performance metrics and dividend  payments. These metrics are subject to robust  stress tests. The most “severe” scenario, albeit unlikely,  considers the financial impact of all 3 risks  materialising in the 5-year period. Without  management action, this scenario would  create both an immediate and a prolonged  severe impact. However, we have a suite of management  actions available to preserve resilience  through the period of assessment, including  accessing lines of credit, reducing organic  and inorganic growth capital expenditure,  and raising capital. Our financial flexibility  could be limited during the peak of the  crisis. The viability of the Group under all  the scenarios tested remained sound.   The resilience of the Group’s business  model is largely underpinned by 4 factors:     – the competitive position and diversification  of our commodities portfolio   – our disciplined capital allocation framework  and commitment to prudent financial policy   – the pay-out shareholder return policy  being based on earnings   – the focus on striving for impeccable ESG  credentials and therefore strengthening  our social licence, which allows for  growth and maintaining access to debt  capital and bank loan markets.    Therefore, considering the Group’s current  position and the robust assessment of our  emerging and principal risks, the Directors  have assessed the prospects of the Group  over the next 5 years (until 31 December 2029)  and have a reasonable expectation that we will  be able to continue to operate and meet our  liabilities as they fall due over that period.   In the long term, there are 4 principal risks  with long-dated consequences that could  have a material impact on our viability:   – preparing our iron ore business to  meet demand for low-carbon steel  (principal risk 2) – minimising our impact on the  environments we work in and building  physical resilience to changes in those  environments, including climate change  and natural hazards (principal risk 4) – being responsible operators throughout  the entire life of our assets – from  discovery to closure (principal risk 5) – delivering our growth projects  (principal risk 7). The principal risks and uncertainties section  provides further details, including current  management responses. Strategic report  |  Our approach to risk management Annual Report 2024 90 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 93 ===== Principal risks and uncertainties The principal risks and uncertainties outlined in this section could materially affect our ability to  meet our strategic objectives. They could materialise from a combination of external or internal  factors and manifest or escalate from any part of the business as an opportunity or threat.  To ensure we can prioritise our efforts  and resources, we regularly assess the  materiality of our principal risks in terms  of potential consequence and likelihood.  This allows us to implement responses  that reduce negative impacts and  realise the benefits of opportunities.  These assessments, and the effectiveness  of our associated responses, reflect  management’s current expectations,  forecasts and assumptions. They involve  judgement and can be affected by  unexpected changes in our external  environment. While we endeavour  to reduce negative impacts to our  business, some inherent risks remain.  However, we closely monitor these  threats and have developed business  resilience plans.  The principal risks and uncertainties mapped  below are based on our managed operations.  We are also exposed to risks associated with  our non-managed joint ventures which, if  they arise, may have consequences on our  reputation or finances. We seek to bring an  equal level of rigour and discipline to our  managed and non-managed joint ventures as  we do to our wholly-owned assets, through  engagement with partners, embedded  representatives and influence, in line with  applicable laws. The timeframe of our principal risks and  uncertainties is within 5 years, unless  explicitly stated otherwise. We frame our  principal risks and uncertainties in the  context of our overarching strategic  objectives: to become Best Operator; to  strive for impeccable ESG credentials; to  excel in development; and to protect our  social licence. These are summarised in the  table below in order of maximum  reasonable consequence and likelihood. The principal risks and uncertainties have not  been assessed for the impact of the recently  announced proposed acquisition of Arcadium  Lithium plc (Arcadium). We will assess this once  the acquisition closes and Arcadium is fully  integrated within the Group.

Strategic report  |  Our approach to risk management Annual Report 2024 91 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 94 ===== 1. Preventing loss of operational control that may lead to  potential fatalities, permanent disablements, or material  production disruption  Nothing is more important than the safety and wellbeing of our  employees, contractors and communities where we operate. The mining  industry is inherently hazardous, with the potential to cause fatalities,  illness or injury, damage to the environment, disruption to communities  or major loss of production or revenues. Our objective is to have zero  fatalities or permanent disablements. We believe all fatalities are  preventable, so our focus is on identifying, managing and, where  possible, eliminating hazards. Safe and stable operations are critical to  delivery of our objective to be Best Operator, and maintaining close  control of our operating assets ensures reliable productive outputs.  l Best Operator Change vs 2023: Increasing l Impeccable ESG Opportunities  Demonstrating our ability to meet or exceed our commitments in  safety and hazard management supports incident prevention, and our  ability to achieve predictable operating results and maintain our social  licence to operate. This allows us to deliver on our objective of being   Best Operator and striving for impeccable ESG credentials.  Threats  Our operational environment is exposed to major hazards, including  processing, underground mining, slope geotechnical, functional safety  (eg sinking shafts and autonomous operations) and tailings  management. Inability to manage these hazards could result in a  catastrophic event or other long-term damage to the Group or the  environment and communities where we operate. Loss of technical  capability at complex operations poses increased risk. In addition to  major hazards, our operations are exposed to safety risks which could  result in single or multiple fatalities. These include risks from vehicles  and driving, aviation, falling objects, electricity and explosives. Key exposures Underground risks at Oyu Tolgoi, Kennecott, Diavik and Resolution.  Slope geotechnical risk at Kennecott and QIT Madagascar Minerals  (QMM). Tailings and water storage facilities at our Aluminium, Iron Ore  and Closure assets. Process safety at Copper and Aluminium smelters  and refineries. Functional safety at Oyu Tolgoi and across our Iron Ore  assets. Mass passenger transport at Oyu Tolgoi, Simandou and Rincon.  Risk oversight: Major Hazards Steering Committee, Safety and Operations  Committee, Risk Management Committee, Sustainability Committee Key management response includes: – Strengthening the First line of defence through enhanced Group  controls that standardise and systematise how we identify,  manage and verify control performance for major hazard and  safety risks across the Group. – Technical capability within the Development & Technology  Centres of Excellence for major hazards and asset management,  including assurance against Group standards and procedures  and learning from industry incidents. – Comprehensive control frameworks (risk bowties, standards,  procedures, guidelines, tools and templates, control library) for  our major hazards.   – For our tailings facilities with “Very High” and “Extreme” consequence  classifications, we have published a Tailings Facility Disclosure under  Principle 15 of the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management  (GISTM). This provides information on implementation status and  summaries of our tailings management processes.  – We continue to implement the Process Safety improvement plan  across the Group.  – Future Technical Asset Management program aimed at  improving asset management performance across the business,  which is a key driver of major hazard events.  – Continued focus on fatality elimination through our Critical Risk  Management program.   – Established Mass Transport and Aviation Communities of Practice  to build capability, and understanding and management of risks. 2. Preparing our iron ore business to meet demand for low- carbon steel Decarbonisation of iron and steelmaking may affect the future  relative values of our iron ore products. We have the opportunity to  unlock business value through optimising our iron ore product  strategy, partnering with technology providers and universities, and  innovating with our customers to position ourselves favourably for  the future demand for low-carbon steel. l Best Operator Change vs 2023: Stable Opportunities By proactively engaging with customers, technology providers and  research institutes, we can develop low-carbon steelmaking  pathways suited to our low-medium grade ores, protecting the  future value of our Pilbara ores. Threats Uncertainty remains around the pace of transition across the steel  value chain, and the implications for the quality of iron ore products  required to support future low-carbon technologies. While the  market is expected to continue to require Pilbara iron ores,  decarbonisation of the steel value chain will require the  development and proliferation of economic low-carbon  technologies suited to low-medium grade ores.  Key exposures Pilbara low-medium grade ores. Risk oversight: Steel Decarbonisation Steering Committee,  Risk Management Committee, Board Key management response includes: – Optimising our iron ore portfolio to bring additional high-grade  ore to the market (eg Simandou). – Establishing the Rio Tinto Steel Decarbonisation team to identify  and develop technical and commercial options through deep  partnerships across the steel value chain, with a specific focus  on economic low-carbon solutions for our Pilbara ores.  – Exploring beneficiation and modular concentrators with  technology partners to upgrade Pilbara ores, to reduce  impurities and increase amenability to future low-carbon  steelmaking technology. – Developing long-term strategic research and development  partnerships with key iron ore customers, including Baowu,  Nippon Steel, BlueScope, POSCO, Zenith and Shougang to  explore a range of economic new low-carbon technologies  suited to low-medium grade iron ores. Key areas of focus include  the development of electric smelting furnace technology,  fluidised bed technology, carbon capture, as well as optimisation  of existing blast furnaces.  – Developing BioIron™ in partnership with the University of  Nottingham and Metso. The BioIron™ process uses sustainable  biomass and microwave energy to convert Pilbara ores into  metallic low-carbon iron. Strategic report  |  Our approach to risk management Annual Report 2024 92 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 95 ===== 3. Building trusted relationships with communities We strive to be a trusted partner to communities, stakeholders and  broader society, leading to improved performance, future prospects  and reputation. l Social Licence Change vs 2023: Stable Opportunities Strong relationships with the communities where we operate  provide stable operating environments and a foundation for growth.  Positive and trusted relationships with communities, governments  and other stakeholders can support preferential access to new  resources, create predictable investment, promote human rights,  and help shape mutually and equitably beneficial economic, social  and environmental outcomes. Threats Access to land and resources may be impacted if we are not  considered a trusted partner that respects host communities and  human rights, mitigates adverse social and environmental impacts  and sustainably improves social and economic outcomes in  communities that host our operations. Other potential impacts can  include operational disruption, security incidents, expropriation,  export or foreign investment restrictions, increased government  regulation and delays in approvals, which may threaten the  investment proposition, title, or carrying value of assets.  Key exposures Communities surrounding the Simandou project, Pilbara operations,  Richards Bay Minerals, Resolution, QIT Madagascar Minerals, Jadar  and Oyu Tolgoi. Risk oversight: Risk Management Committee, Sustainability Committee Key management response includes: – Applying minimum operating standards through the Code of  Conduct, Communities and Social Performance (CSP) Standard  and Human Rights Policy (publicly available), applicable  throughout the asset lifecycle. – Developing and implementing CSP plans to drive consistent  performance and monitor outcomes. Strengthening community  engagement through appropriately resourced and skilled asset  CSP teams and leaders. Measuring and reporting on our  performance through the Group-wide Local Voices community  perception monitoring program and clear accountability for  relationships with host communities residing with the asset leader. – Delivering sustainable, long-term social outcomes through  strategic social investment, regional economic development and  mutually beneficial partnerships.  – Implementing local procurement policies and targets, including  local content commitments for major capital projects.  – Improving the quality of our complaints and grievance processes  through training and guidance materials. – Investigating and sharing learnings from CSP incidents, including  community wellbeing and safety. For more information on how we are developing and investing in  nature-based solutions near our operations, see our 2025 Climate  Action Plan on page 41. 4. Minimising our impact on the environments we work in  and building physical resilience to changes in those  environments, including climate change and natural hazard   Producing the materials the world needs means we have an impact  on the environment. Our operations and projects require proactive  management to minimise potential impact to water resources or  biodiversity in new asset developments, existing operations and  closures. Our assets, infrastructure, communities and broader value  chains are exposed to the impacts of extreme weather events, and  climate change is expected to impact the frequency, intensity and  likelihood of extreme events across different regions globally.  l Impeccable ESG  Change vs 2023: Stable Opportunities  By understanding specific exposures across our portfolio, our capital  programs can incorporate measures to minimise environmental impact  and improve resilience in the event of an extreme climatic event.   Development of high-integrity nature-based solutions, in  collaboration with local partners and communities, generates  high-quality carbon credits while restoring ecosystems, protecting  existing pristine areas and supporting the development of  associated socioeconomic opportunities independent of mining  (thus helping to address dependencies).  Threats A number of our operations and future development opportunities exist  within, or close to, sensitive biodiverse regions. Our licence to operate  and develop requires us to demonstrate our capability to protect  ecosystems through improved practices and technological solutions.   Natural hazards or extreme weather events can endanger our employees  and communities, damage our assets or cause significant operational  interruption. A direct impact of a Category 5 cyclone could lead to a  significant disruption to Pilbara port operations. Longer-dated exposure  to chronic changes in climate is less well understood given the inherent  uncertainty in future climate projections.  Key exposures  Our operations in the Pilbara and Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean  regions, QIT Madagascar Minerals and the Simandou project. Risk oversight: Risk Management Committee, Sustainability Committee   Key management response includes: – Annual Environmental Certification across all assets endorsed by  product group Chief Executives.  – Business endorsement for the development of a nature strategy,  incorporating a target program.  – Understanding our exposure at each asset through programs such as  our critical risk assessment (CRA) program and asset integrity  assurance, and climate change resilience assessments (CCRAs) to  identify vulnerabilities across our portfolio. Reporting against the Task  Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) requirements.  – Actively supporting, and reporting our practices against, the  commitments outlined in ICMM’s position statement on  water stewardship. – Continuing to disclose our operations’ surface water allocation,  latest annual water usage and average catchment rainfall runoff  and a 5-year view on historical annual water usage.   – Utilising the latest generation climate analytics (weather  forecasts, climate outlooks, catastrophe modelling and  projections) to gain quantitative insights into short-, medium-,  and long-term physical climate risks.  – Developing technical guidance to inform physical climate risk  identification, management and adaptation.  – Business Resilience Plans and Emergency response plans,  training and annual exercises to prepare for a natural disaster  event, including established communication plans and  coordination with local, regional and state agencies.  Strategic report  |  Our approach to risk management Annual Report 2024 93 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 96 ===== 5. Being responsible operators throughout the entire life of our assets – from discovery to closure We are committed to being responsible operators throughout the  entire life of our assets, from discovery to closure. We do this in  partnership with our internal and external stakeholders, such as host  communities, Indigenous Peoples, regulators and joint venture  partners, embedding closure considerations throughout the entire  lifespan of our assets – in the way we design, build, run, close and  transition them.   l Social Licence Change vs 2023: Stable Opportunities Finding innovative ways of managing through the operation phase  over the long term can improve the cost profile or capital intensity  of closure. Investing in research and development over the life of  the asset to find innovative ways of managing long-term closure  risks can also improve closure outcomes. We actively assess opportunities to repurpose and reuse sites for  future economic or social resilience and work collaboratively with  our stakeholders throughout the life of the asset. We seek mutually  beneficial solutions through relinquishment or divestment of closed  or legacy assets. Threats Closure obligations may increase over time due to changes in the  Group’s portfolio, stakeholders’ and community expectations,  regulations, standards, technical understanding and techniques. The manifestation of exposures at a closed or legacy asset, due to a lack of  historic information, could impact our licence to operate, the cost of  closure and negatively impact on the human rights of communities where  it is located. Key exposures Pilbara near-term closures (including Channar and Eastern Range),  Gove, Argyle, Energy Resources of Australia (ERA), Mange-Garri,  Diavik and legacy sites. Risk oversight: Closure Steering Committee, Risk Management  Committee, Sustainability Committee Key management response includes: – Development and maintenance of the end-to-end closure global  process, closure group controls and ongoing support to  implement the Closure Standard. – An Asset Closure Strategy (ACS), closure plan and cost estimate  that have been developed at 61% of our assets and are to be  updated every 5 years – Closure studies completed for sites that plan to close in the next  10 years. Notable studies include Pre-feasibility study (PFS)  Closure Study in 2024 for Channar and Eastern Range (closing  in 2027), PFS for Gove Mine (closing in 2029), PFS for Partial  Closure Hope Downs 1 (closing in 2033), and Order of  Magnitude Closure Study for Weipa Northern Operations  (closing in 2029). – Incentivising progressive closure activities by removing  approved spend from product group free cash flow performance  metrics. This contributes to increased annual progressive  rehabilitation and helps deliver our closure commitments to  regulators, Indigenous Peoples and other stakeholders. – Actively exploring cost-effective solutions to common challenges  through targeted research and development projects, and  improvements in closure planning, studies, execution,  socioeconomic transition and legacy management.  – Developing and implementing management plans for tailings  facilities as legacy assets are prioritised by Global Industry  Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) consequence  classifications. 6. Building trusted relationships with Indigenous Peoples Our relationships with Indigenous Peoples play a material role in  delivering our operational and strategic goals and in our ability to  operate. A breakdown in these critical relationships may have a  significant impact on our business. We aim to build respectful and  enduring relationships with Indigenous partners and communities,  enabling them to realise their goals and aspirations and to create  long-term shared benefits. l Social Licence Change vs 2023: Stable Opportunities We have the opportunity to work closely with Indigenous Peoples to  realise long-term socioeconomic, cultural and environmental  benefits. Our capacity to deliver value to host communities and  Indigenous Peoples supports our current and future growth plans,  including in the Pilbara, Weipa, Saguenay, Arizona and Argentina  and existing partnerships at Iron Ore Company of Canada and in  British Columbia. Threats Mining activities may strain relationships with Indigenous Peoples,  particularly where actual or perceived damage of significant cultural  values (cumulative or acute) occurs without appropriate  consultation and consent. This may result in loss of trust with  Indigenous Peoples, impacting our social licence to operate. Key exposures Indigenous Peoples near Resolution, in the Pilbara, Cape York  (Weipa), Canada (Quebec, Labrador, British Columbia),  and Argentina. Risk oversight: Risk Management Committee, Sustainability Committee Key management response includes: In addition to those captured under principal risk 3, Building trusted  relationships with communities, are the following key responses: – Developing a global approach to Indigenous Relations. – Building cultural responsiveness and competencies (including for  cultural heritage) across our leadership teams and workforce. – Strengthening consultation, meaningful engagement and free,  prior and informed consent (FPIC) processes.  – Progressing Indigenous leadership, employment and economic  development efforts. – Strengthening integrated cultural heritage management systems  and embedding social considerations in approvals and decision- making processes at all levels of the organisation. – Strengthening cultural heritage critical controls and verification  requirements in our First line of defence. – Reviewing risks to Indigenous Peoples across the project  lifecycle, mergers, acquisitions and development projects. – Investing in strategic partnerships that address the needs and  aspirations of Indigenous organisations and those impacted by  the investment activity. – Elevating the voices of our Indigenous employees and engaging  with, and learning from, the Australian Advisory Group. Strategic report  |  Our approach to risk management Annual Report 2024 94 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 97 ===== 7. Delivering on our growth projects Delivering our growth strategy relies on our ability to develop  resources faster and more competitively than others, while striving for  impeccable ESG credentials, and on the success of our exploration  (greenfield and brownfield) and acquisition activities to secure those  resources. Developing projects requires complex multi-year study and  execution plans and carries significant delivery risk.   l Excel in Development Change vs 2023: Stable Opportunities Active and focused exploration and business development efforts  have the potential to increase or diversify our commodity resource  base. Through operational efficiencies, deployment of new  technologies or improved understanding of our orebodies, we may  convert a greater proportion of resources to reserves more  competitively. Through strengthening partnerships with emerging  regions, we may improve both speed of project delivery and capital.  Threats New high-quality deposits are increasingly scarce, and those that  are known require advances in processing technology, significant  capital investment, or may negatively impact our ESG credentials.  Additionally, as studies and projects progress, they are susceptible  to changes in approvals, societal expectations, or changes in  underlying commercial or economic assumptions which could  impact economic viability. Key exposures Simandou, increasing approval timeframes in the Pilbara, Oyu Tolgoi  underground expansion, Rincon, Resolution and Jadar. Risk oversight: Investment Committee, Ore Reserves Steering  Committee, Risk Management Committee, Board Key management response includes: – Having deep in-house capabilities (eg in exploration, technical  research and development centres, business development,  global and specialised projects, and our studies division) and  strengthening partnerships with emerging regions for  project delivery. – Having a comprehensive talent strategy to ensure we have the  right organisational strength and capacity to deliver the  growth portfolio. – Focusing growth capital expenditure on energy transition  commodities, such as copper, battery materials, high-grade iron  ore, and critical minerals (rhenium, tellurium, scandium, selenium,  and gallium). – Joint venture partnerships to enhance development capabilities  and reduce funding requirements.  – Broadening our scope to include jurisdictions and targets that  can grow and create optionality or are a strategic fit to  the Group. – Stage-gate approval process including in-flight monitoring of  project progress, with enhanced projects governance using  industry best practices. – New country entry reviews to ensure robust understanding of  risks, including ESG and human rights due diligence during  exploration, studies or mergers and acquisitions. 8. Achieving our decarbonisation targets competitively  Ensuring our ability to deliver longer-term strategic objectives  encompasses our ability to achieve our Scope 1 and 2 targets  between now and 2050, and deliver on our focus area of striving for  impeccable ESG credentials, while balancing the need to invest for  growth, deliver superior shareholder returns and remain competitive.    l Impeccable ESG  Change vs 2023: Stable Opportunities  Decarbonising our assets has the potential to enhance our  competitive advantage (tariffs and access to markets). It also  provides opportunity to decouple our operating cost basis from  emerging carbon taxes and fossil fuel markets. Creative deployment  of new assets and value chains can benefit our host communities,  with Traditional Owner owned renewables and emerging new value  chains such as biofuels and biocarbon providing early successful  examples. Renewable energy projects will likely provide energy in  excess of our needs at certain times, improving the availability of  renewable energy in the communities where we operate.  We are well placed to be a leading supplier of materials to support  the energy transition, for example aluminium for solar panels and  copper for electric vehicles.  Threats  Delays in priority initiatives will threaten our Scope 1 and 2 target  delivery and ability to respond proactively and competitively. A key  uncertainty is our ability to successfully engage, and partner where  appropriate, with governments and other external parties to  progress grid decarbonisation in a timely manner, with large scale  grid solutions in Australia planned for final delivery very late this  decade already. Furthermore, our 2030 targets remain achievable  through a mix of renewable penetration, biodiesel, small process  heat modifications and use of offsets. Successful research and  development investment in areas such as electric fleets, hydrogen  calcination, ELYSISTM, and BlueSmeltingTM is required to support the  decarbonisation pipeline post 2030.    Adhering to our social and human rights standards during implementation  of decarbonisation projects will be critical to avoid adversely impacting  people and stakeholder relationships. However, this may limit our available  sourcing options and lead to delays in meeting our targets.  Key exposures Our Aluminium group’s Pacific Operations smelter repowering and  alumina processing.  Risk oversight: Decarbonisation Investment Forum,  Risk Management Committee, Board  Key management response includes: – We maintain our capital expenditure guidance of $5-6 billion  between 2022 and 2030 and $0.5-1 billion in the period 2024 to  2026, relating to the delivery of our targets through 6 large  abatement programs focused on renewables (such as in the  Pilbara, and at Richards Bay Minerals and Aluminium’s Pacific  Operations), ELYSIS™, alumina processing (Yarwun and  Queensland Aluminium Limited), minerals processing and diesel  transition; supplemented by nature-based solutions and offsets.  – Announcing 2 renewable power purchase agreements for 2.2GW  to supply our Boyne aluminium smelter in Gladstone, Australia,  and securing in-principle Queensland government support.  – Establishing the Rio Tinto Energy & Climate team accountable  for decarbonisation decision making, funding and resource  prioritisation, data collection and analysis.  – Having our Office of the Chief Scientist support decarbonisation  research and development to identify pathways for hard-to- abate areas, required to meet our targets.   – Developing partnerships with external parties to leverage  broader capabilities and accelerate decarbonisation.

Transforming our culture, enabling us to live our values  Living our values goes to the heart of our Group’s performance,  prospects and reputation. Sharing and demonstrating our values unlocks  opportunities in all that we do, every day. We are focused on building a  culture where all our people are trusted and empowered to be their best  selves and help drive change. This begins with a workplace where  everyone feels safe, respected and empowered every day.  l Best Operator Change vs 2023: Stable Opportunities  Our reputation, and our ability to build respectful and trusting  partnerships, depends on our business conduct being consistent with  our corporate values. Our corporate values inspire our people to  contribute in ways that align with our purpose and strategic direction.  Threats  Not living our values has the potential for decisions to prioritise   production over safety. As societal expectations are changing, and  higher standards are being placed on organisations, the role we play  in society requires us to ensure we are consistently displaying and  living our values. The 2022 final reports of the Western Australia  Parliamentary Inquiry into the mining industry and the Everyday  Respect Report into the workplace culture at Rio Tinto highlighted the  scale of change required internally and across the resources sector.  Risk oversight: Risk Management Committee, Board  Key management response includes:  We embarked on a cultural change program led by the refresh of  our corporate values in 2021 and have accelerated this through the  Everyday Respect task force. In 2023, we refreshed and updated  our Code of Conduct, The Way We Work, to be more  comprehensive and act as the blueprint of key principles, driving  policy position, setting out our commitments to stakeholders,  helping our people live our values, and clarifying what is expected of  all employees. During 2024, we have been evaluating our progress  and gaining insight to inform the next stage of our journey through  the Everyday Respect Progress Review, which we published in  November (see page 78). We have introduced the following changes  to support our leaders and teams in living our values: – We refreshed our purpose and values and have been following a  program of activity to support how these are embedded. – The Everyday Respect Progress Review, published in November  2024, will inform our future plan of activity alongside the results  of our biannual people survey and annual values scorecard  which is also reviewed by our Executive Committee and  our Board.   – Our internal whistleblowing program (myVoice) is open to  employees and external stakeholders, to report on conduct  inconsistent with our values and Code of Conduct.    – Care Hub comprises a team of Support Partners who facilitate  trauma informed, people-focused support, care and non- investigative resolution options to individuals affected by harmful  behaviours at work.  – We have people management processes that support alignment  with our strategy and values, to increase respect and  transparency. These include values-based performance  management processes and a career management framework  (Career Conversations).  – We implemented new Code of Conduct mandatory training in  July 2024, which all employees are required to complete on an  annual basis.  10. Conducting our business with integrity, complying with  all laws, regulations and obligations  Our determination to become Best Operator and have impeccable  ESG credentials is underpinned by our commitment to ensure  compliance with our operational procedures, laws and our  obligations. These expectations are outlined in our Group policies,  standards and procedures, published on our website.  l Impeccable ESG Change vs 2023: Stable Opportunities  Good corporate citizens that operate to high ethical standards are  known to have a healthy culture, outperform peers and retain and  attract better talent. This leads to greater success in securing  access to resources and investment opportunities.  Threats  A serious breach in our operations or in our value chain of anti- corruption legislation or sanctions, data privacy, human rights, anti-trust  rules, or inappropriate business conduct, could result in serious harm to  people and significant reputational, legal and financial damage.  Key exposures Exposures exist in Argentina (Rincon), Guinea (Simandou) and  Mongolia (Oyu Tolgoi).

Remaining competitive through economic cycles or  shocks by maintaining strong financial and operating  performance, underpinned by a healthy inventory of  high-quality reserves Our business model depends on our ability to convert existing  Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves available for mining when  required. The viability of our orebodies, and business, is most  sensitive to the complexity of our orebodies and associated  orebody knowledge base, combined with commodity economics  which are greatly influenced by macroeconomic and geopolitical  developments. We aim to remain competitive, preserve resilience  and maintain access to funding by having cost-competitive assets,  a diversified commodities portfolio, a strong balance sheet, prudent  financial policies and strong ESG credentials.  l Best Operator Change vs 2023: Stable Opportunities  Favourable market conditions and strong internal capital discipline  allow us to maintain our balance sheet strength. This enables us to  invest in growth opportunities, pay down debt and enhance returns  to shareholders.   Through operational efficiencies, deployment of new technologies  or improved understanding of our orebodies, we may convert a  greater proportion of our Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves.  We can reduce unscheduled loss and improve mining and  processing equipment availability through implementing a targeted  asset management uplift program that embeds good work  management practices, increasing planned and scheduled work,  and reducing reactive maintenance.  Threats  A deteriorating economic or political environment could lead to  falling commodity prices (reduced cash flow, limiting profitability),  trade actions (increased tariffs, retaliations, and sanctions), and  governments’ efforts to exert more control over their natural  resources or to protect their domestic economies by changing  contractual, regulatory or tax measures. This can potentially impact  our key markets, operations, investments, tax obligations, financial  results and access to funding.  Input cost inflation and escalation could increase pressure on  operating costs and margins. Orebody health remains challenged with Ore Reserve depletion  driven by expanded production and ongoing resource development  challenges. Failure to secure access and approvals could limit  collection of required orebody knowledge that may reduce the  volume of existing Ore Reserves and the future conversion of  Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves in the required timeframe.  Risk oversight: Financial Risk Management Committee, Ore  Reserves Steering Committee, Risk Management Committee, Audit  & Risk Committee  Key management response includes: – Implementing the Safe Production System which aims to  transform how we operate our assets, manage performance, and  develop and empower our people. This enables us to  consistently deliver outstanding safety, engagement and  production results, and improve our asset and equipment  reliability and maintenance.   – The Orebody Knowledge Centre of Excellence (OBK CoE) within  Group Technical maintains and assures compliance with the Group’s  Resources and Reserves Standard and monitors performance to track  variation from expected asset production plans.   – Annual review of the Group’s Ore Reserves and Mineral  Resources, and orebody health used to drive long-term planning  assumptions and activities. The Group maintains capital  discipline and a strong balance sheet through robust investment  governance processes, prudent financial policies and a pay-out- based shareholder returns policy. A strong investment grade  credit rating ensures access to diverse funding sources.    12. Preventing material business disruption and data  breaches due to cyber events  Managing cyber security events allows us to avoid disruption to our  operations, comply with data privacy requirements and keep sensitive  information related to customers, contractors or suppliers safe  l Best Operator Change vs 2023: Stable Opportunities  The value of a robust cyber security capability extends beyond the  protection of our information, assets, and people. Requests for  information to substantiate Rio Tinto’s cyber security capabilities  are becoming more frequent and detailed as our customers look to  validate their supply chain risk.   In parallel, the expectations from regulators and ratings agencies  are increasing, and new obligations for public disclosure of  cybersecurity incidents are emerging. This generates opportunity to  enhance our ESG credentials and customer value proposition.  Threats  Cyber incidents can occur due to malicious external or internal  attacks, but also inadvertently through human error.   Although the extent and frequency of cyber security threats remain  in line with growth expectations, the external threat landscape  continues to evolve at a rapid pace.  The rise of digitisation has driven greater convergence and  connectivity between our information technology (IT), and industrial  and operational environments. The increased use of emerging or  disruptive technologies to inform and automate decisions also  amplifies the threat of loss of control systems or autonomous  functions.   Key exposures Our greatest exposures continue to be through our global  ecosystem of third-party suppliers, and the rapid development of  new projects, with an increasing reliance on technology. Risk oversight: Cyber Security Steering Committee,  Risk Management Committee, Audit & Risk Committee   Key management response includes: – Operating a perpetual cyber security function and program of  work ensures our controls remain relevant to the threat  environment which is constantly evolving and adapting. This  informs the Group business resilience and recovery plans for  cyber breaches across critical sites and assets.  – Engaging external expertise to assess and benchmark our  environment against the National Institute of Standards and  Technology’s Cybersecurity Management Framework. This  recurring assessment is used to inform and monitor the uplift of  our maturity in cyber security risk management.  – Continuing investments into strengthening endpoint detection,  network segregation and access management within operational  technology environments.  – Programs to further the awareness and skills of IT professionals  who play a part in maintaining the integrity and resilience of our  IT environments. – Providing training to our people to enhance awareness of cyber  threats and their role in keeping our environment safe. – Operating a Cyber Security Steering Committee to monitor  performance and drive investments in mitigation of key cyber  security risk exposures. Strategic report  |  Our approach to risk management Annual Report 2024 97 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 100 ===== 13. Attracting, developing and retaining people with the  requisite skills  Our ability to achieve our business strategy depends on attracting,  developing and retaining a wide range of internal and external  skilled and experienced people.  l Best Operator  Change vs 2023: Stable Opportunities  Investing in critical skills required now and for the future – and  “building” through a focus on early careers and reskilling our people,  rather than “buying in” talent – can enhance productivity, innovation  and business resilience. Increasing local employment and career  pathways supports our social licence to operate. And creating  partnerships, including joint ventures, presents opportunity to  acquire talent.  Threats  Business interruption or underperformance may arise from a lack of  access to capability. Tight labour markets, and entry into new  countries where mining capabilities are in limited supply or the  Rio Tinto brand is less established, can lead to heightened  competition for diverse talent and critical skills. This may include  skills in climate, energy, decarbonisation, technical mining and  processing, licence to operate, and new commodities and projects.  Changing societal expectations are placing pressure on our  corporate and employer brand in terms of who we are and what we  stand for. Since the pandemic, talent is less inclined to relocate,  forcing the reliance on local or national recruitment, which  significantly reduces the market size for sourcing talent.  Key exposures:  Turnover rate in process safety management and technology roles.  Risk oversight: Risk Management Committee, People &  Remuneration Committee  Key management response includes: – Creating the Rio Tinto Leadership team and implementing a  robust schedule of talent practices. This aims to ensure we are  effectively developing and deploying our best talent into our  most critical roles, and building strong and diverse pipelines for  our general manager and managing director level roles. – Capability in strategic workforce planning, with a focus on critical  roles and critical future capabilities, including decarbonisation. – Planned development offerings to build the capability of leaders  at all levels, and increase our ability to retain key skills and talent.  – Launching a refreshed approach to talent management (Career  Conversations) and development plans in July 2024, which will  be expanded across the organisation in the first quarter of 2025.   – Talent planning globally for critical technical capabilities.  – Ongoing monitoring of the global talent market, developments  and trends, including Rio Tinto brand awareness, reputation and  talent mobility.  – Ongoing monitoring of turnover data, to identify patterns, trends  and priority areas for focus.  – Biannual people survey, engagement strategy and retention modelling.   – Group-wide employee value proposition, tailored by labour  market and talent segment.  – A talent acquisition strategy that targets multiple labour markets  and a diverse range of skills.  – A global graduate program and strategic partnerships for  mutually beneficial relationships with universities.  – Local trainee (apprenticeship) programs and other future skill  development partnerships.  – Implementing the Workday platform to increase access to, and  consistency of, people data, and support us in effectively  monitoring employee movement and retention, and understanding  the experience of our workforce and their capabilities.  For more information, see pages 78-80. 14. Withstanding impacts of geopolitics on our trade  or investments Geopolitics has the potential to increase trade tensions,  undermining rule-based trading systems. Possible trade actions can  impact our key markets, operations or investments, and may limit  the benefits of being a multinational company with a global  footprint. We continue to build resilience through diversification,  and identify opportunities for engagement with governments, civil  society, industry associations and international bodies. l Best Operator  Change vs 2023: Stable Opportunities Working closely with governments on balanced domestic policy  proposals has potential to bring long-term economic and social  benefits for the country, while supporting growth and investments  for us.  Global geopolitical realignments include the creation of new  strategic alliances between countries that could create partnership  and growth opportunities (eg in the security of critical minerals  supply).   Threats A deteriorating economic and political environment could lead to  falling commodity prices (reduced cash flow, limiting profitability,  reducing reserve inventory), trade actions (increased tariffs,  retaliations, and sanctions), and governments’ efforts to exert more  control over their natural resources or to protect their domestic  economies by changing contractual, regulatory or tax measures.  This can potentially impact our key markets, operations,  investments, tax obligations, financial results and access to funding. Key exposures A highly uncertain and unstable global macro environment,  including China-US tensions and the indirect impacts of the war in  Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East. Risk oversight: Financial Risk Management Committee,  Risk Management Committee, Board Key management response includes: – Continuing to further diversify our portfolio of commodities  (focused on materials that enable the low-carbon transition),  markets and jurisdictions to reduce exposure to specific  geopolitical events, such as with the Rincon lithium project in  Argentina, Simandou high-grade iron ore project in Guinea, and  the proposed acquisition of Arcadium. – A fully resourced external affairs function to closely monitor the  political and geopolitical environment, coordinate our  engagement with stakeholders and to identify possible  opportunities for the Group through engagement with  governments, civil society, industry associations and  international bodies. – Maintaining strong relationships with stakeholders across the  countries and sectors we operate in. – The New Country Entry Procedure, which focuses on cross- functional, real-time engagement. – Regularly assessing and quantifying changes in political and  country risk to inform strategic, operational and investment  decisions. – The Sanctions Standard and Export Control Procedure, to  mitigate against potential breach of economic sanctions and  trade controls. Ongoing monitoring of the political environments  where we operate and engagement with government in those  areas. – Capability to settle and receive renminbi (RMB), including  management of central bank digital currency (CBDC)  transactions in line with industry standards, to mitigate potential  trade tensions impact on key Chinese customers’ access to  credit and USD. .

In an increasingly volatile world, having a  well-defined strategy, strict capital allocation and good governance is essential for success. In this report, we describe some of the well- established governance processes that  support effective decision-making at the  Board. Like everyone at Rio Tinto however,  it is important that we continuously review  and improve our structure and processes to  make sure we are efficient and effective.  The report explains how we assessed our  effectiveness and the results of the  2024 review. Our Board members have diverse  backgrounds, and each brings their unique  and valuable experience to our work.  Directors are encouraged to challenge each  other’s assumptions and push to  understand different perspectives to reach  an objective view. This has been especially  important in a year in which we made  several significant decisions related to the  execution of Rio Tinto’s strategy, for  example, the decision to proceed with the  proposed acquisition of Arcadium Lithium. The Board has also reviewed and approved  the proposed Climate Action Plan, which  will be put to shareholders for approval at  our 2025 AGMs. We are retaining our  commitments to decarbonise our assets  and work with customers and suppliers to  reduce our value chain emissions. We are  doing this in a way that creates value for  shareholders and the Board recommends  it for approval.  The Board also studied the Everyday  Respect Progress Review in 2024, which  was another significant step in Rio Tinto’s  culture journey. As the Board oversees  and monitors our organisational culture,  it was valuable to understand where the  challenges remain in aligning our culture  with our purpose, values and strategy. The  findings of the Progress Review and People  Surveys have informed our view that Rio  Tinto is heading in the right direction, but  still has significant work to do to improve  its culture. Half of the Non-Executive Directors have  been appointed within the last 2 years.  In recognition of this, the Board held 2  dedicated sessions where we got to know  each other more deeply to accelerate our  team forming and dynamic, alongside our  regular meetings.  In addition, Board members made a  series of individual and group site visits  to help deepen our understanding of the  business and progress on our culture and  operating performance.  These visits are always invaluable  opportunities for the Board to engage  directly with the teams on site and take  these learnings back into our boardroom  discussions. I am grateful to my colleagues  for their continued energy and enthusiasm  to learn, and to everyone who has taken the  time to share their insights with us. Finally, there will be a number of Board  changes in 2025, with Kaisa Hietala, Simon  Henry and Sam Laidlaw all stepping down.  Simon will hand over his chairship of the  Audit & Risk Committee to Sharon Thorne,  and the People & Remuneration Committee  will pass from Sam to Ben Wyatt. A huge  thank you to Kaisa, Simon and Sam for  the dedication they have shown Rio Tinto.  I believe they leave our business in a strong  position, with a good mix of seasoned  Directors on the Board.

Directors’ report   Annual Report 2024 109 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 112 ===== Evaluating our performance This year, the Board’s annual performance evaluation was led internally. This aligns with the  corporate governance principles for both the UK and Australia.  Every 3 years, we engage a professional  external adviser to undertake an  independent evaluation of the Board’s  effectiveness, and, in 2023, Jan Hall, of  business advisory company No.4, carried  this out. This external evaluation took an in- depth look at Board dynamics and how the  Board operated. The Board agreed actions  for improvement from this evaluation, which  were detailed in our 2023 Annual Report  and we have worked to implement these  during 2024.  The objectives of the 2024 internal  evaluation were then to: 1) Assess progress against the actions  from the 2023 external evaluation, and  determine if more work is needed to  close these out. 2) Understand where the Board is doing  well and where improvements could be  made, taking into account 2023’s  detailed review.  3) Set a benchmark against which  effectiveness can be assessed in  future years. How the 2024 evaluation worked  All Board members completed an  anonymous questionnaire that looked at: – progress against the specific actions  from the 2023 evaluation  – the performance of the Board during  the year – the performance of its committees – feedback on the performance of the  Chair and individual Directors.  In addition to the questionnaire, each  Director had an externally facilitated  interview to capture deeper and more  nuanced feedback on board effectiveness. What the evaluation found The evaluation concluded that the Board  and its Committees were working well, and  that the performance of the Chair and  individual Directors was effective. The consensus from the questionnaire and  the interviews was very positive. Feedback  noted the improvement over the year in  terms of structuring the Board’s agendas  and papers to allow more time to be  focused on discussion and on material  strategic topics. The external evaluation in  2023 had identified this as an improvement  area. There was agreement however that  further improvement is required, and work  will be undertaken on the format of the  Board’s materials to ensure they allow the  Board to consider matters in a focused and  concise way. With a number of newly appointed  Directors, the Board spent 2 dedicated  sessions in 2024 on team dynamics and  accelerating the process of getting to know  one another more deeply. The evaluation  results reflected that these sessions were  considered very valuable and will be  repeated. The Non-Executive Directors, led by the  Senior Independent Director, are responsible  for the performance evaluation of the Chair  and met separately in 2024 to discuss this.  The externally facilitated interview process  also captured feedback on the Chair and  Directors, all of whom were considered to be  performing efficiently.

Board committee membership key Committee Chair People & Remuneration Committee Audit & Risk Committee Sustainability Committee Nominations Committee Directors’ report   Annual Report 2024 110 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 113 ===== Nominations Committee report The Nominations Committee ensures appointments to the Board are subject to a formal,  rigorous and transparent procedure, and oversees succession planning for the Board and  senior management. As we reported last year, the size of the  Board peaked at 14 Directors as we  retained the expertise and experience of  our longer-serving Directors during a  transitional period as newer Directors  familiarised themselves with the Group. This  transitional phase is now largely concluded  so we will make the following changes to  the Board during 2025. With effect from the conclusion of the Rio  Tinto Limited annual general meeting in May  2025, Sam Laidlaw will step down as a  Director of the Company. Sam was  appointed to the Board in February 2017  and has served as Chair of our People &  Remuneration Committee and as the Senior  Independent Director. I would like to  express my sincere thanks to Sam, on  behalf of the Board, for his outstanding  contribution to Rio Tinto. Ben Wyatt will  succeed Sam as Chair of the People &  Remuneration Committee. Sharon Thorne  will become our Senior Independent  Director.  In the second half of 2025, Simon Henry will  step down as a Director. Simon was  appointed to the Board in April 2017 and  has served as Chair of the Audit & Risk  Committee since May 2019. We are grateful  to Simon for his invaluable contribution to  the Group. Sharon Thorne will succeed  Simon as Chair of the Audit & Risk  Committee. Kaisa Hietala will also step down as a  Director with effect from the conclusion of  the Rio Tinto Limited annual general  meeting in May 2025. The recent growth in  our lithium business has increasingly  created potential conflicts of interest with  Kaisa’s non-executive directorship with  Exxon Mobil. Out of an abundance of  caution, Kaisa has offered to resolve this  potential conflict by stepping down from  the Rio Tinto Board.  Kaisa has been a very  welcome and valuable addition to the Board  since her appointment in March 2023, and  her guidance on energy transition and  business transformation in particular have  contributed significantly and insightfully to  our discussions.  While she will be greatly missed, we have  accepted the decision to step down and  wish Kaisa well for the future. Dominic Barton Nominations Committee Chair 19 February 2025 Board induction Following a significant refresh of our Board  through 2023 and 2024, we reviewed our  induction process and made improvements  to make it more efficient and tailored to the  interests and requirements of each new  director so that they can quickly build an  understanding of Rio Tinto, our markets  and stakeholders. The induction aims to add greater depth  to Directors’ existing knowledge of the  company, enabling them to become more  effective members of the Board as quickly  as possible. Initially this can be achieved  through access to written information,  which is provided on appointment.  The Company Secretary then works  with the Director to build a focused  set of engagements with leadership and  management to allow for discussion on key  topics and further information to be  provided. Specific briefings are often  included as part of the regular teach-in  sessions that are provided for the Board. The induction typically takes several months  and the Company Secretary works closely  with the Director to ensure it is relevant.  Site visits are important to our induction  process and this year Dean Dalla Valle,  Susan Lloyd-Hurwitz and Joc O’Rourke  visited Kennecott, Martin Merz and Joc  O’Rourke travelled to Yarwun and QAL, and  Sharon Thorne visited our aluminium  operations in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean.  Our new Directors also visited Matalco and  Rio Tinto Iron & Titanium Quebec Operations’  Sorel-Tracy plant.     For more information about our new  Non-Executive Directors, see the Board  biographies on pages 102-103.

Simon McKeon was a member of the Committee until  his retirement from the Board on 2 May 2024.  2. Kaisa Hietala, Susan Lloyd-Hurwitz, Martina Merz,  Jennifer Nason, Joc O’Rourke and Ben Wyatt stepped  down from the Nominations Committee on  31 May 2024. Length of tenure of  Non-Executive Directors   l  0-3 years: 7 l  +3-6 years: 3 l  +6-9 years: 2 Directors’ report   Annual Report 2024 111 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 114 ===== Our key responsibilities The purpose of the Nominations Committee  is to review the composition of the Board.  The Committee leads the process for  appointments, making recommendations to  the Board as part of succession planning  for Non-Executive Directors. It also  approves proposals for appointments to  the Executive Committee.  Membership of the Committee The members of the Committee are all  independent Non-Executive Directors, and  their biographies can be found on  pages 102-103.  The Chief Executive and the Chief People  Officer are invited to attend all or part of  meetings, as appropriate. The Committee is  chaired by the Chair of the Board, unless  the matter under consideration relates to  the role of the Chair.  The Committee had 2 formal meetings in  2024.  Attendance at the formal meetings is  included in the table on page 110. Appointments to the Board – our policy We base our appointments to the Board on  merit, and on objective selection criteria,  with the aim of bringing a range of skills,  knowledge and experience to Rio Tinto.  This involves a formal and rigorous process  to source strong candidates from diverse  backgrounds, and conducting appropriate  background and reference checks on the  shortlisted candidates. We aim to appoint  people who will help us address the  operational and strategic challenges and  opportunities facing the company and  ensure that our Board is diverse in terms of  experience, gender, nationality, social  background and cognitive style. As such, we  engage only recruitment agencies that are  signed up to the Voluntary Code of  Conduct on diversity best practice.  We believe that an effective Board  combines a range of perspectives with  strong oversight, combining the experience  of Directors who have developed a deep  understanding of our business over several  years with the fresh insights of newer  appointees. We aim for the Board’s  composition to reflect the global nature of  our business - we currently have 8 different  nationalities (including dual nationalities) on  a Board of 14.  The Committee engaged Spencer Stuart to  support the search for our new Non-Executive  Directors, Martina Merz and Sharon Thorne.  The Committee is satisfied that Spencer Stuart  does not have any connections with the  company or individual Directors that may  impair their independence. When recruiting government or former  government officials to join the Rio Tinto  Board, we comply with any restrictions and  obligations existing pursuant to relevant laws  and regulations, including with respect to  confidentiality, lobbying and conflicts  of interest.  The key skills and experience of our Board are  set out on this page of the report.  Diversity The Board recognises that it has a critical  role to play in creating an environment in  which all contributions are valued, different  perspectives are embraced, and biases are  acknowledged and overcome. The Board  shares ownership with the Executive  Committee of the Group’s Respect,  Inclusion & Diversity Policy, which can be  found at riotinto.com/policies.  The proportion of women on the Board is  currently 43% (6 women and 8 men). As at  the date of this report, we do not currently  meet the UK Listings Rules target to have a  female Chair, Chief Executive, Chief  Financial Officer or Senior Independent  Director, however effective 1 May 2025 we  will meet this target when Sharon Thorne  becomes Senior Independent Director.  The Group has continued to set measurable  gender diversity objectives for the  composition of senior leadership and  graduate intake and achievement of these  targets contributes to the variable  remuneration of senior executives. Progress  on diversity is shown in the Our approach  to ESG section on page 34, where we show  a breakdown by seniority.  The number of Directors who identify  themselves as being from an ethnic  background is one (Ben Wyatt), aligned to  the objectives of The Parker Review in  the UK.  For further information on the gender and  ethnic diversity of the Board and Executive  Committee please see page 148 of the  Additional statutory disclosure section.  Progress on diversity is shown in the  Talent, diversity and inclusion section  on pages 78-80.

The Committee undertakes a regular  schedule of work each year. It discusses  and oversees the significant issues of  judgement relating to the financial  statements. We reviewed the new standards  and amendments applicable for the year to  understand how these would be  implemented by the Group. We also  undertook a forward-looking analysis of  amendments to standards that have been  issued, but are not yet effective. The  Committee works with management and the  external auditors to understand and agree  how these will be applied.  The Committee considered the Group’s  internal controls of financial reporting for  the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). It also  looked at the internal process in place that  will allow the Board to meet the requirement  of the new UK Corporate Governance  Code, with regard to the effectiveness of  internal controls. This year the Committee considered the  steps that are being taken to implement a  “Material Control and Assurance Plan” to  address the requirements of the new UK  Corporate Code Provision 29, effective  1 January 2026. This is a top-down, risk-led  methodology to support the new  disclosures required with effect from the  2026 financial year. We aim to achieve a  proportionate and practical response to the  new declaration, and key to this is the  identification of “material controls”. The  foundation of the work we undertook was  looking at the definition of material control,  and we have worked with peers,  accountancy firms and our auditors to  understand emerging best practice in this  area of corporate governance. We have an  existing SOX program and have therefore  considered the interaction between the two,  ensuring that the frameworks are  complementary. Throughout 2025, the team  will review the mapping of controls to  principal risks and the Committee have  oversight of this process. In 2024, the Committee, together with the  Sustainability Committee, have continued to  follow the landscape of environmental,  social and governance (ESG) reporting  requirements. This year we are adopting   new climate disclosures in our reporting,  and we are aiming to align with IFRS S2 on  climate-related disclosures. We think this  will place us in a good position for future  years when reporting becomes mandatory.  I have appreciated the support I have  received from my fellow Committee  members this year. In particular I would like  to thank Simon McKeon for the insight and  challenge that he brought as a member of  the Audit & Risk Committee. The  membership of the Committee was  reviewed following Simon’s departure and  as part of the planned refreshment of  the Board.  I am pleased that Kaisa Hietala,  Joc O’Rourke and Sharon Thorne joined  the Committee in 2024. Jennifer Nason  also joined the Committee with effect from  17 February 2025. This has brought depth  to the Committee both in number of  members and the range of experience  each Director brings.  I trust you find this report a useful account  of the work of the Committee during  the year.

Jennifer Nason joined the Committee on 17 February 2025.  Membership The members of the Committee are all  independent Non-Executive Directors, and  their biographies can be found on  pages 102-103. The Chair of the Board is  not a member of the Committee.  As Rio Tinto’s securities are listed in  Australia, the UK and the US, we follow the  regulatory requirements and best practice  governance recommendations for audit  committees in each of these markets.  Australian listing requirements In Australia, the members, and the  Committee as a whole, meet the  independence requirements of the  Australian Securities Exchange (ASX)  Principles. Specifically, the Committee  members between them have the  accounting and financial expertise, and a  sufficient understanding of the industry in  which the company operates, to be able to  discharge the Committee’s mandate  effectively.  UK listing requirements In the UK, the members meet the  requirements of the Financial Conduct  Authority’s (FCA) Disclosure Guidance and  Transparency Rules, and the provisions of  the UK Corporate Governance Code  relating to audit committee composition.  Simon Henry, the Chair of the Committee,  and Sharon Thorne are considered by the  Board to have recent and relevant financial  experience.  Simon Henry, Kaisa Hietala and  Joc O’Rourke have extensive experience in  the natural resources sector. Ben Wyatt and  Jennifer Nason have gained experience in  the mining sector by serving on the Board  and through regular site visits, reports and  presentations. Sharon Thorne has  undertaken site visits and teach-ins as part  of her induction programme. The  Committee as a whole has competence  relevant to the sector in which the company  operates.  The Committee complies with the Audit  Committees and the External Audit:  Minimum Standard.  US listing requirements In the US, the requirements for the  Committee’s composition and role are set  out in the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC) and New York Stock  Exchange (NYSE) rules. The members of the  Committee meet the independence  requirements set out under Rule 10A-3 of  the US Exchange Act and under Section  303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual.  The Board has designated Simon Henry as  an “audit committee financial expert”. The  Board also believes that the other members  of the Committee are financially literate by  virtue of their wide business experience.  Directors’ report  Annual Report 2024 113 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 116 ===== Committee remit The Committee’s objectives and responsibilities  are set out in our Terms of Reference  (see riotinto.com/corporategovernance).  These follow the relevant best practice  recommendations in Australia, the UK  and the US. Our main duties Financial reporting – we review the key  judgements needed to apply accounting  standards and to prepare the Group’s  financial statements. We also review the  narrative reporting that goes with them, with  the aim of maintaining integrity in the  Group’s financial reporting. And we monitor  exclusions made in deriving alternative  (non-GAAP) (Generally Accepted  Accounting Principles) performance  measures such as underlying earnings.  – External audit: We oversee the  relationship with the external auditors  and review all the non-audit services  they provide and their fees, to safeguard  the auditors’ independence and  objectivity. We also assess the  effectiveness of the external audit and,  when necessary, carry out a formal  tender process to select new auditors.  – Framework for internal control and risk  management: We monitor the  effectiveness of the Group’s internal  controls, including those over financial  reporting. We also oversee the Group’s  risk management framework.  – Group Internal Audit (GIA): We oversee  the work of GIA and its head, who reports  functionally to the Committee Chair. – Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves:  We oversee the reporting and assurance  of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves,  and consider the impact on financial  reporting.  – Distributable reserves: We provide  assurance to the Board that  distributable reserves are sufficient, and  in the correct corporate entities, to  support any dividend proposals.  These duties feed into an annual work plan  that ensures we consider issues on a timely  basis. The Committee has authority to  investigate any matters within its remit. We  have the power to use any Group resources  we may reasonably require, and we have  direct access to the external auditors. We  can also obtain independent professional  advice at the Group’s expense, where we  deem necessary. No such advice was  required during 2024.  The Committee Chair reports to the Board  after each meeting on the main items  discussed, and the minutes of Committee  meetings are circulated to the Board.  We had 6 Committee meetings in 2024.  Attendance at these meetings is included in  the table on page 110. The Committee has  met twice to date in 2025.  The Chair of the Board, the Chief Financial  Officer, the Group Financial Controller and  the heads of GIA and Risk regularly attend  Committee meetings, as does the Chief  Legal Officer, Governance & Corporate  Affairs. Other senior executives and  subject-matter experts are invited  as needed.  The external auditors were present at all of  the Committee meetings during the year.  The auditors review all materials on  accounting or tax matters in advance of  each meeting, and their comments are  included in the papers circulated to  Committee members. The audit partners  also meet with the Committee Chair ahead  of each meeting to discuss key issues and  raise any concerns.  The Committee meets regularly in private  sessions. We also hold regular private  discussions with the external auditors.  Management does not attend these  sessions. The Committee Chair also has  regular contact and discussions with these  stakeholders outside the formal meetings. Use of Committee meeting time  in 2024   l Financial reporting:  40% l Internal control and  risk management:  25% l External audit: 15% l Internal audit: 15% l Governance: 5% Other focus areas in 2024 In addition to the scheduled workload, the  Committee also: – Received an update on internal projects  to simplify how we work. This included  the transition to the HR IT platform  Workday and the Future Finance  project, which is standardising,  simplifying and automating our financial  processes and controls. – Received an update on the development  of the framework that will be used to  determine Material Controls, the testing  approach and the 2025 milestones. – After a robust process, in early 2025,  recommended to the Board that the  draft 2024 Annual Report should be  taken as whole, fair, balanced and  understandable. – Reviewed the quality and effectiveness of  the Group’s internal control and risk  management systems. This review  included the effectiveness of the Group’s  internal controls over financial reporting,  and the Group’s disclosure controls and  procedures in accordance with sections  404 and 302 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley  Act 2002. The Committee also  considered reports from GIA and KPMG  on their work in reviewing and auditing the  control environment. – The Committee considered cyber risk at  the December meeting. This included the  external threat landscape and the  defences, processes and response  capabilities in place to manage risk. Significant issues relating to financial statements There were 4 significant issues considered by the Committee in relation to the financial statements. Matters considered Conclusion Review of carrying value  of cash-generating units  and impairment charges/ reversals The Committee assessed management’s determination of cash-generating units, review of impairment triggers, and consideration  of potential impairment charges and reversals over the course of the year. The key assets discussed included Rio Tinto Kennecott,  where the revised mine plan was identified as an impairment trigger and, following the impairment test, management concluded that  the carrying value remained supportable, and in Pacific Aluminium where decarbonisation activities resulted in an impairment  charge for Queensland alumina refinery. Application of the policy  for items excluded from  underlying earnings and  underlying EBITDA The Committee reviewed the Group’s policy for exclusion of certain items from underlying earnings and confirmed the consistent  application of this policy year on year. The pre-tax items excluded from underlying earnings comprised charges of $0.8 billion and  income of $1.5 billion. A reconciliation of net earnings to underlying earnings is presented in the Alternative Performance Measures  section. Estimate for provision for  closure, restoration and  environmental  obligations The Committee reviewed the significant changes in the estimated provision for closure, restoration and environmental obligations  by product group and Rio Tinto Closure. The Committee received updates on the closure studies completed in the period and  reviewed economic assumptions assessed by management, including changes to the discount rate. Climate change The Committee received an overview of the work that management is undertaking in relation to climate change and the potential  financial reporting implications thereof. The Committee reviewed the accounting for long-term renewable power purchase  agreements entered into during the period and the climate change disclosure in the Annual Report, with particular emphasis on the  impact to impairment charges and the related disclosure of sensitivities. Directors’ report  |  Audit & Risk Committee report  Annual Report 2024 114 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 117 ===== Climate change-related  financial reporting The Directors have considered the  relevance of the risks of climate change and  transition risks associated with achieving  the goals of the Paris Agreement when  preparing and signing off the Company’s  accounts. The narrative reporting on  climate-related matters is consistent with  the accounting assumptions and  judgements made in this report. The Audit &  Risk Committee reviews and approves all  material accounting estimates and  judgements relating to financial reporting,  including those where climate issues are  relevant. The Group’s approach to climate  change is supported by strong governance,  processes and capabilities. This year, we updated the scenario  framework used to assess the resilience of  our business under different transition- related scenarios. Conviction scenario is  now our central case. It underlies strategic  planning across the Group, is used in  commodity price forecasts, valuation  models, reserves and resources  determination, and in determining estimates  for assets and liabilities in our financial  statements, including impairment testing,  estimating remaining economic life, and  discounting closure and rehabilitation  provisions. Resilience scenario is our  sensitivity analysis designed to test our  annual plan and investment proposals.  Neither of the Conviction or Resilience  scenarios above are consistent with the  expectation of climate policies required to  accelerate the global transition to meet the  stretch goal of the Paris Agreement. Despite  global agreements on climate change reached  in Glasgow and Dubai, emissions today  continue to rise, making the 1.5°C goal of the  Paris Agreement unlikely to be achieved. As  our operational emissions targets are in line  with 1.5°C, so too are our decarbonisation  investment decisions. In 2022, we developed a  Paris-aligned scenario, referred to as the  Aspirational Leadership scenario, which  helps us better understand the pathways to  meet the Paris Agreement goal, and what  this could mean for our business. Overall, based on our internally developed  pricing outlooks, we do not envisage a  material adverse impact of the 1.5°C Paris  Agreement-aligned sensitivity on asset  carrying values, remaining useful life, closure  and rehabilitation provisions for our Group. During the year, the assessment performed  under the Physical Resilience Programme,  together with our ongoing review processes,  including impairment assessments, did not  identify any material accounting impacts as a  consequence of the physical risks associated  with climate change. For more information on climate change  impact on our Group, see our 2025 Climate  Action Plan on pages 41 to 75 in this report. Contact with financial regulators  during 2024 During the year, the Company did not  receive any formal correspondence from  financial regulators. External auditors Engagement of the external auditors  For the 2024 financial year, KPMG served  as our auditors. Their appointment was  approved by shareholders at our AGMs in  2024. The UK entity of KPMG audits  Rio Tinto plc, and the Australian entity  audits Rio Tinto Limited. The UK audit  engagement partner, Jonathan Downer, was  appointed in March 2021 and the Australian  partner, Trevor Hart, was appointed in  2020. Graham Hogg will replace Trevor Hart  for the 2025 audit. This is a planned partner  rotation, in line with the requirements of the  Australian Accounting Professional & Ethics  Standards Board and SEC requirements. We agreed on the scope of the auditors’  review of the half-year accounts, and of  their audit of the full-year accounts, taking  into consideration the key risks and areas  of material judgement for the Group. We  also approved the fees for this work and the  engagement letters for the auditors.  The Group has fully complied with the  Statutory Audit Services Order. Safeguarding independence and  objectivity, and maintaining effectiveness  In our relationship with the external  auditors, we need to ensure that they retain  their independence and objectivity, and are  effective in performing the external audit.  Use of the external auditors for non-audit services  The external auditors have significant  knowledge of our business and of how we  apply our accounting policies. That means it  is sometimes cost-efficient for them to  provide non-audit services. There may also  be confidentiality reasons that make the  external auditors the preferred choice for a  particular task.  However, safeguarding the external  auditors’ objectivity and independence is an  overriding priority. For this reason, and in  line with the Financial Reporting Council’s  (FRC) Ethical Standard and the SEC  independence rules, the Committee ensures  that the external auditors do not perform  any functions of management, undertake  any work that they may later need to audit  or rely upon in the audit, or serve in an  advocacy role for the Group. We have a policy governing the use of  the auditors to provide non-audit services.  The cap on the total fees that may be paid  to the external auditors for non-audit  services in any given year is 70% of the  average of the audit fees for the preceding  3 years. This is in line with the FRC’s Ethical  Standard. Non-audit assignments fall into 2  broad categories:  – Audit, audit-related or other  “pre-approved” services where we  believe there is no threat to auditors’  independence and objectivity, other  than through the fees payable.  – Other services approved under  delegated authority.  We apply different approval regimes to  these areas of work. Approval of “pre- approved” services is as follows:  – Up to $50,000: subject to prior  notification to management, this work  can be awarded.  – From $50,001 to $100,000: requires the  Chief Financial Officer’s approval.  – Over $100,000 and with a tender  process: if the external auditors are  successful in the tender, the  appointment requires the Chief Financial  Officer’s approval.  – From $100,001 to $250,000 without a  tender process: requires the Chief  Financial Officer’s approval.  – Over $250,000 without a tender  process: requires the Committee’s or  Committee Chair’s approval.  In each case, the nature of the assignment  and the fees payable are reported to  the Committee.  The Chief Financial Officer can approve  other services up to the value of $50,000  and an aggregate value of no more than  $100,000. Fees exceeding $100,000 in  aggregate require approval from the  Committee or the Committee Chair. At the half-year and year-ends, the Chief  Financial Officer and the external auditors  report to the Committee on non-audit  services performed and the fees payable.  Individual services are also reported to the  Committee at each meeting that have either  been approved since the previous meeting,  or that require approval for commencement  following the meeting.  Non-audit services provided by KPMG in  2024 were either within the predetermined  approval levels or approved by the  Committee and were compatible with the  general standard of independence for  auditors and the other requirements of the  relevant regulations in Australia, the UK and  the US regulations. Fees for audit and non-audit services The amounts payable to the external  auditors, in each of the past 2  years, were:  2024 $m 2023 $m Audit fees  28.1 26.6 Non-audit service fees:  Assurance services  5.2 4.1 All other fees  0.2 0.1 Total non-audit service fees  5.4 4.2 Non-audit: audit fees (in-year)   19 %  16 % For further analysis of these fees, please  see note 38 on page 228. None of the individual non-audit  assignments was significant, in terms of  either the work done or the fees payable.  Directors’ report  |  Audit & Risk Committee report  Annual Report 2024 115 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 118 ===== We have reviewed the non-audit work  in aggregate. We are satisfied that neither  the work done, nor the fees payable,  compromised the independence or  objectivity of KPMG as our external auditors. Independence of the external auditors  KPMG are required to provide a declaration  to the Directors in relation to their  compliance with the independence  requirements of the Australian  Corporations Act 2001 and the  professional code of conduct for external  auditors. A copy of this is on page 265. No person who served as an officer of  Rio Tinto during 2024 was a Director or  partner of KPMG at a time when they  conducted an audit of the Group.  Effectiveness of the external auditors  We review the effectiveness of the external  auditors annually. We consider the results  of a survey containing questions on the  auditors’ objectivity, quality and efficiency.  The survey, conducted in June 2024, was  completed by a range of operational and  corporate executives across the business,  and by Committee members. We are satisfied with the quality and  objectivity of KPMG’s 2023 audit. Audit Quality Review As part of the annual inspection of audit  firms, the Audit Quality Review (‘AQR’) team  of the Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’)  reviewed KPMG’s audit of the Group  accounts for the year ended 31 December  2023. The AQR routinely monitors the  quality of audit work of certain UK audit  firms through inspections of sample audits  and related procedures, at individual audit  firms. The Committee and KPMG LLP have  discussed the report, which included a  number of good practice observations.  Overall, the result of the review raised no  issues which caused doubt on the quality of  our external audit and the Committee  remains satisfied with the efficiency and  effectiveness of the external audit.  Appointment of the auditors  The Committee has reviewed the  independence, objectivity and effectiveness  of KPMG as external auditors in 2024  and in the year to date. We have  recommended to the Board that KPMG  should be retained in this role for 2025,  which the Board supports.  KPMG have indicated that they are  willing to continue as auditors of Rio Tinto.  A resolution to reappoint them as auditors  of Rio Tinto plc will be proposed as a joint  resolution at the 2025 AGMs, together with  a separate resolution seeking authority for  the Committee to determine the external  auditors’ remuneration.  Subject to the approval of the above  resolution, KPMG will continue in office as  auditors of Rio Tinto Limited.  Risk management and internal controls  We review Rio Tinto’s internal control  systems and the risk management  framework. We also monitor risks falling  within our remit, including those relating to  the integrity of financial reporting. A  summary of the business’s internal control  and risk management systems, and of the  principal risks and uncertainties we face, is  available in the Strategic report on  pages 88-98. Importantly, responsibility for operating and  maintaining the internal control  environment and risk management systems  sits with leaders who are in the best  position to address them, while offering  support to them via Centres of Excellence  and Areas of Expertise. Leaders of our  businesses and functions are required to  maintain adequate internal controls, to  verify that these are operating effectively  and are designed to identify any failings and  weaknesses that may exist, and that any  required actions are taken promptly.  The Audit & Risk Committee also regularly  monitors our risk management and internal  control systems (including internal financial  controls). We aim to have appropriate  policies, standards and procedures in place,  and ensure that they operate effectively. As part of considering the risk management  framework, the Committee receives  regular reports from the Group Financial  Controller, the Chief Legal, Governance  & Corporate Affairs Officer, the Head of  Risk, the Head of Group Internal Audit (GIA)  and the Head of Tax on material  developments including with respect to the  legal, regulatory and fiscal landscape in  which the Group operates.  The Board, supported by the Audit & Risk  Committee, has completed its annual review  of the effectiveness of our risk management  and internal control systems. This review  included consideration of our material  financial, operational and compliance  controls. The Board concluded that the  Group has an effective system of risk  management and internal control. Internal control over financial reporting  The main features of our internal control  and risk management systems in relation to  financial reporting are explained on  page 151.  Internal audit program structure  GIA provides independent and objective  assurance of the adequacy and  effectiveness of risk management and  internal control systems. It may also  recommend improvements.  While the Head of GIA reports  administratively to the Chief Financial  Officer, appointment to, or removal from,  this role requires the consent of the Audit &  Risk Committee Chair. The Head of GIA is  accountable to the Chairs of the Audit &  Risk and the Sustainability Committees,  and communicates regularly with both.  Our GIA team therefore operates  independently of management. Its mandate is  set out in a written charter, approved by the  Audit & Risk Committee. GIA uses a formal  internal audit methodology that is consistent  with the Institute of Internal Auditors’ (IIA)  internationally recognised standards.  When needed, the team brings in external  partners to help achieve its goals. There is a  clear policy to address any conflicts of  interest, which complies with the IIA’s  standards on independence. This policy  identifies a list of services that need prior  approval from the Head of GIA.  Governance of the annual plan  Each year’s internal audit plan is approved  by the Audit & Risk Committee and the  Sustainability Committee. The plan is  focused on higher-risk areas and any  specific areas or processes chosen by the  committees. It is also aligned with any risks  identified by the external auditors. Both  committees are given regular updates on  progress, including any material findings,  and can refine the plans, as needed. Effectiveness of the internal audit program  The Audit & Risk Committee monitors  the effectiveness of the GIA function  throughout the year at its meetings. During  2024, the function continued its journey to  mature GIA to a “trusted adviser level” and  embedding the improvements initiated in  2023, demonstrating improvements in the  function’s effectiveness and delivery. We are satisfied that the quality, experience  and expertise of GIA are appropriate for the  business and that GIA was objective and  performed its role effectively. We are  satisfied that GIA is appropriately  resourced. We also monitored  management’s response to internal audits  during the year. We are satisfied that  improvements are being implemented  promptly in response to GIA findings, and  believe that management supports the  effective working of the GIA function.  Committee effectiveness  The Committee reviews its effectiveness  annually. In 2024, this was accomplished  through an internally-facilitated evaluation  of the Board and its committees.  The performance of the Committee was  highly rated, with no areas of concern  raised and no significant changes  recommended.  Directors’ report  |  Audit & Risk Committee report  Annual Report 2024 116 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 119 ===== Sustainability Committee report The Sustainability Committee monitors and supports Rio Tinto’s processes and practices to  ensure we supply the materials the world needs safely and sustainably. The prevention of fatalities, and the health,  safety and wellbeing of our employees,  contractors and communities, is the  Committee’s first priority. The Committee  also oversees other key sustainability risks,  including in particular our environmental  and social performance risks. We are deeply saddened by the tragic fatal  events at our managed operations in 2024. In  January, 4 colleagues from our operations at  Diavik and 2 airline crew members lost their  lives in a devastating plane crash near Fort  Smith, Northwest Territories, Canada. And in  October, an employee of a contracting  partner tragically lost his life after he was  injured at the SimFer Port Project, part of the  Simandou iron ore project. The Committee’s  sympathies go out to the families and team  members of each of these colleagues who  lost their lives.  Sadly, in 2024 we also saw fatalities more  broadly across our industry, including at the  operations of 2 of our non-managed joint  venture partners.  Our thoughts also remain with the family  and colleagues of a crew member aboard a  Rio Tinto bulk carrier who was reported  missing in December.    These events are a solemn reminder of the  safety risks in our business. We firmly  believe all fatalities are preventable, driving  us to learn from these tragedies and  ensuring we share insights widely to prevent  future events and inform ongoing  improvements to our safety practices.  Following the charter flight incident in  January, while awaiting the outcome of the  official investigation by the Transport Safety  Board of Canada, the Committee oversaw a  review of the Group’s aviation activities and  standards, and a benchmarking of the  Group’s aviation practices against industry  best practice.  In addition to reviewing the lessons learned  from these fatalities, the Committee continues  to review potential fatal incidents (PFIs) with  business leaders to share important lessons  from these events across the Group. In 2024,  the Committee undertook closer analysis of  PFIs involving an exchange of energy, with  major contributors to these incidents  including falling objects, vehicles and driving,  and contact with electricity. Critical risk management also continues to be  a key fatality elimination tool, helping to  ensure critical controls are in place and  operating effectively where there is a critical  risk of fatality. And the Committee continues  to review the progress through our safety  maturity model, which is a key tool for  supporting and enhancing our safety culture. In 2024, the Committee strengthened its  focus by dedicating a meeting to each of  the 3 key themes in its scope: health and  safety (including fatality prevention);  environment (including closure); and social  performance (including human rights and  Indigenous Peoples). A fourth meeting  received presentations from each of the  product group Chief Executives, our Chief  Commercial Officer, and our Chief  Technical Officer on the key sustainability  and operational risks, opportunities, trends  and controls for each product group, and  for Rio Tinto Marine, Exploration and  Projects, including the Simandou project.   We continued to oversee our progress  towards implementation of the Global  Industry Standard on Tailings Management  (GISTM), and to directly engage with  executives who have accountability for the  safety of tailings facilities across the Group.  We have received progress updates from  management on the pathway to full  conformance with GISTM.  The Committee reviewed the progress of  Rio Tinto’s program for managing its  physical resilience to climate change, and  for the Group’s compliance with the  disclosure requirements set out by the Task  Force on Climate-Related Financial  Disclosure (TCFD). At each meeting, the Group’s Internal Audit  (GIA) function reports to the Committee on  matters within the Committee’s scope. In  addition, in February 2024 the Group’s  auditors, KPMG, reported to the Committee  on their assurance procedures over our  2023 sustainable development reporting. Other key areas of focus for the Committee  in 2024 included: – Health and safety performance:  Receiving regular updates on health and  safety performance. – Environment and nature: Receiving a  report on the Group’s environmental  performance and endorsement of our  approach to our nature strategy, as well  as undertaking a deep dive on the  Group’s physical resilience to climate  change and natural disasters, and the  real-time modelling being done to  manage this risk. – Water: Receiving an update on the  Bungaroo aquifer in the Western Pilbara  and the decision to invest in the  construction of the Dampier desalination  plant, which will supply water to Rio Tinto’s coastal communities and  operations from 2026. – Social performance: Receiving an  overview of the emerging socio-political  landscape and an update on  Communities and Social Performance  2024 priorities and initiatives, including  our global program to collect and  respond to host community feedback,  social contributions, Indigenous  leadership and participation, cultural  heritage and agreements. – Human rights: Reviewing management  of human rights risks, tracking global  trends in human rights policy and  regulation, commercial and asset human  rights due diligence, and overseeing our  modern slavery reporting. – Security: Receiving updates on ongoing  security challenges across the Group. Site visits play an important role in  providing Committee members with a  deeper understanding of our sustainability  risks across our business. This year, there  were full Board site visits in Canada to our  Iron and Titanium Operations in Sorel- Tracy, Quebec and our Matalco joint  venture’s operations in Ontario. In addition,  our Committee members also made either  individual or group visits: – in Canada, to our Aluminium operations  in Saguenay–Lac-St-Jean in Quebec,  and our aluminium operations in Kitimat,  British Columbia – in Australia, to our Iron Ore operations in  the Pilbara, Western Australia, the Yarwun  and Queensland Aluminium Limited  alumina processing facilities in Gladstone,  and our Technical Development Centre in  Bundoora, Victoria – in Africa, to the Simandou iron ore  project in Guinea, and our mineral  sands joint venture at Richards Bay  in South Africa  – in the US, to our operations at  Resolution Copper in Arizona, and our  Kennecott copper operations in Salt  Lake City, Utah. I look forward to continuing the work of the  Sustainability Committee in 2025 to  contribute to the long-term sustainable  success of the Group.

Nothing is more important than the health,  safety and wellbeing of our people. We  tragically lost 5 colleagues in 2024. In  January, 4 colleagues and 2 employees of  the contractor’s airline crew died in a plane  crash en route to our Diavik mine. In October,  an employee of one of our contractors was  injured at the SimFer Port Project and  subsequently passed away.  We are also deeply concerned about a crew  member aboard a Rio Tinto bulk carrier who  was reported missing in December. These events have all had a devastating  impact and learnings from these tragic  events will be used to inform ongoing  improvements to safety practices to  prevent such incidents in the future. Operational performance and our balance  sheet remained robust in 2024, allowing  US$6.5 billion to be declared as dividends  to shareholders. This underpinned our  ability to reach an agreement in October for  the proposed acquisition of Arcadium  Lithium in an all-cash deal. Subject to  completion, this transaction will give us the  platform to create a world-class lithium  business. We expect the deal to close in  March 2025. Our operational performance in 2024 has  been facilitated by progress in deploying  our Safe Production System (SPS). SPS  deployment has commenced at 31 (81%) of  our sites and underlines our commitment to  become Best Operator with improved  safety and operational performance across  our global assets. During the year, we also  progressed against our other objectives -  striving for impeccable environment, social  and governance (ESG) credentials, excelling  in development and strengthening our  social licence. Our commitment to decarbonise our  business, and to develop products  and services to help our customers  decarbonise, continues at pace. 2024 was a  record year for investment approvals  towards our 2030 target, underwritten by  significant progress in repowering our  Gladstone assets. We signed 2 power  purchase agreements for a combined  2.2GW of renewable energy, catalysing the  development of new large-scale renewable  energy in Queensland. We also reached an  agreement with the Queensland  Government on a support package to assist  Boyne Smelters Limited (BSL) with the  transition to a competitive and repowered  future. In June, we announced the  installation of carbon-free aluminium  smelting cells in Quebec to support the  ongoing development of the ELYSIS™  technology, with the first production of  aluminium without direct greenhouse gas  emissions targeted by 2027. We entered  into a joint venture with Aymium to  manufacture renewable metallurgical  biocarbon product to help reduce carbon  emissions in large-scale industrial  processes. Across our existing portfolio, copper  production at Oyu Tolgoi continues to ramp  up, the first lithium production from Rincon  in Argentina was delivered in November  2024, and progress at the world-class  Simandou iron ore project in Guinea  continues at pace, with first high-grade iron  ore production scheduled during 2025.  Remuneration Policy Our 2024 Remuneration Policy (Policy)  received strong support with over 97% of  shareholders voting in favour. Throughout  this process, I was able to meet with many  of our shareholders and the key UK and  Australian advisory bodies to discuss and  shape our proposals. The open dialogue  with investors and advisory bodies was  welcomed and I would like to again thank  those who took part in this consultation. One of the asks from investors was to  provide transparency on our progress  against the new decarbonisation scorecard  for our long-term incentive plan (LTIP).  While we are only 12 months into the first  3-year performance period, we have  provided an update on our progress  against each measure. We do not expect  progress against the scorecard to be linear,  and some volatility for one or more  measures throughout the performance  period is likely, but we will provide annual  updates on progress, noting that specifics  may be subject to confidentiality. Overview of pay and  performance in 2024  The single total figure of remuneration for  the Chief Executive in 2024 is 57% lower  than the equivalent figure for 2023. This is  primarily driven by lower outcomes under  the LTIP. Short-term incentive plan For 2024, we made a change to the  financial measures, replacing underlying  earnings with underlying EBITDA but  retaining STIP free cash flow. These  measures, assessed on a flexed and  unflexed basis, account for half of the  outcome against the STIP scorecard.  Outcomes against the other half of the STIP  scorecard are linked to a range of strategic  measures covering performance around  safety, carbon reduction, diversity and  inclusion, and progress on our objectives to  excel in development and strengthen our  licence to operate. An individual multiplier is  in place to be used sparingly in cases of  exceptional performance. Directors’ report  Remuneration report Annual statement by the People & Remuneration Committee Chair The Committee’s overarching purpose is to ensure the people, culture and  remuneration policies, frameworks and practices are aligned with the  Group’s strategy, objectives and values. Annual Report 2024 119 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 122 ===== STIP fatality deduction During 2024 there were 2 tragic incidents in  which 5 colleagues lost their lives which  were the first work-related fatalities since  2018. Accordingly, it was determined that  the STIP fatality deduction should be  applied and this resulted in a reduction  equivalent to 10% of the final STIP  scorecard outcome for all STIP eligible  employees. The Committee assessed Group  performance against the STIP scorecard  and determined an overall scorecard  outcome of 49.5% of maximum, post fatality  deduction. STIP scorecard performance 2024 was a strong year for the Group in  terms of financial performance and  progress on implementation of the Group’s  strategy. For the financial component of the STIP  scorecard, we reported underlying EBITDA  of $23.3 billion and STIP free cash flow of  $11.6 billion. Despite challenges at a number  of our operations, these financial outcomes  were in line with plan, underpinned by  improved operational stability across most  of our operations. Overall, our reported 2024 result for the  financial component of the STIP scorecard  was 46% of maximum.  The strategic component of the STIP  scorecard comprises 4 separate measures -  Impeccable ESG, People & Culture, Excel in  Development and Social Licence. The  outcome against our Impeccable ESG  measure, which includes safety, was above  target for the year. Progress on  decarbonisation and the approval of  specific abatement projects has continued  over the year, as we continue to shape our  roadmap to our 2030 ambition and beyond.  Our People & Culture measures reflect  scores from the second of our bi-annual   employee engagement surveys, as well as  gender diversity aspirations. While both  dimensions showed improvement during  2024, the outcomes fell short of the targets  set by the Committee.  Overall performance against the Excel in  Development measure was above target for  the year, reflecting exciting progress in  exploration and studies, and continued  strong delivery across a number of projects  despite some challenging weather events  during the year.  The Social Licence measure assesses  changes in how we are perceived by the  general public using RepTrak, a third-party  survey provider, plus a qualitative review. In  2024 our global reputation score showed  improvement, resulting in an above  target outcome. Under the STIP, an individual multiplier can  be used for selected participants each year  to reflect exceptional performance. The  Committee considered the individual  performance of each Executive Director  during 2024 and did not apply an individual  multiplier to the STIP outcomes.  Further details on the individual  performance and STIP outcomes for the  Executive Directors can be found on  page 129-133. Long-term incentive plan The performance period for the 2020  Performance Share Award (PSA) concluded  in December 2024 and awards will vest on  20 February 2025. As well as reviewing the  formulaic outcome, the Committee also  considered the vesting outcome in the  context of underlying business performance  and the consequence management  framework and felt it reflected the  shareholder experience. Rio Tinto delivered a strong Total  Shareholder Return (TSR) of 80% over the  performance period. While this was  sufficient to trigger vesting under the  element measuring performance relative to  our mining peers, the result was marginally  behind the performance of the MSCI World  Index (TSR: 81%), and subsequently this  element lapsed in full. The overall formulaic  vesting outcome for the 2020 PSA was  12.75% of maximum. The Committee  recognises that Rio Tinto has delivered  strong returns for shareholders over the  past 5 years, and that the TSR performance  of a handful of very large technology  companies, especially in the last 12 months,  had a material impact on the performance  of the MSCI World Index. The Committee  however approved the formulaic outcome  and no discretion was exercised. 2025 remuneration decisions As we explained to investors as part of  establishing our Policy, the main policy  changes focused on the structure of pay,  resulting in an increase in our LTIP award  levels to be more aligned with peers in the  market. We undertook extensive  benchmarking during 2024 to assess  overall competitiveness and pay positioning  relative to our peers and those we compete  with for talent. This review confirmed prior  analysis that salaries and target  remuneration remained below median  market levels for certain critical positions.  Therefore, a targeted salary adjustment has  been approved for the Chief Executive, to  better reflect the talent market and most  importantly ensure pay levels remain more  aligned with the size of the role.  Since his appointment in January 2021, the  Chief Executive has demonstrated  exceptional leadership. He has led  significant improvements in restoring trust  with the local communities in which we  operate while delivering shareholder returns  of $38 billion through dividends and  buybacks. Under his leadership, Rio Tinto  has progressed several critical projects to  sustain, diversify and build on the returns  already delivered.  The Chief Executive’s current salary is  positioned at the lower end of FTSE 10 peer  companies. Considering his development as  an established FTSE 10 Chief Executive and  proven performance since his appointment,  we have reset his salary to £1,410,700. This  represents an increase which is at a  premium of 6.8% to the 3% general  increase applied to the UK workforce in  2025. The Committee are mindful of the  changes made to the Policy last year and  are keen to maintain a measured approach  to pay. It should be noted that even after  this adjustment, the Chief Executive’s salary  remains below median against FTSE 10  peers. Further details on the increase for  the Chief Executive are provided on  page 122. As part of making this change we engaged  extensively with a number of our major  shareholders regarding the proposed  adjustments to salary. I want to thank those  investors whom I met and consulted with  during the year.  Executive changes Alf Barrios, a member of the Executive  Committee since 2014, decided to retire  and stepped down from his role as Chief  Commercial Officer on 31 August 2024.  James Martin also decided to retire and  stepped down from his role as Chief People  Officer on 31 December 2024. On behalf of  the Board, I want to thank Alf and James for  their service to Rio Tinto and wish them  lengthy and enjoyable retirements. Bold Baatar, previously Chief Executive,  Copper, succeeded Alf as Chief Commercial  Officer, with effect from 1 September 2024.  We welcomed Katie Jackson to the role of  Chief Executive, Copper on 1 September  2024. Both Bold and Katie were appointed to  their roles on terms consistent with our  Policy. Details of their appointment terms are  included on page 138. Georgie Bezette was  also appointed to the role of Chief People  Officer and the Executive Committee on 1  January 2025. Directors’ report  |  Remuneration report  Annual Report 2024 120 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 123 ===== People During the year, we worked with the  Executive Committee to set the direction  for a workplace culture that aligns with our  purpose, reflects our values, and supports  the delivery of our strategy. To that end, we  continue to support a performance  management framework that places as  much emphasis on how results are  delivered as it does on what is achieved.  This further builds on our decision in 2023  to change the STIP scorecard to apply  consistently across 27,000 colleagues. The Committee monitored culture  progression through visits to our sites and  offices, operational deep-dives and  management presentations. It considered  trends and findings from our bi-annual  employee engagement survey, succession  and talent plans for our most senior roles,  as well as our ability to attract and retain a  diverse workforce. The overall  representation of women in our business  remains a key aspect of our broader  agenda on diversity and inclusion, and will  continue to be an area of focus in 2025. While the published findings of the  Everyday Respect Progress Review show  people are still experiencing behaviours and  attitudes in the company that are  unacceptable and harmful, the public  release of the 2022 Everyday Respect  Report was a critical catalyst for culture  change. We are more committed than ever  to continue to transform our culture on  what will be a multi-year journey. This  change started with the implementation of  recommendations outlined in the 2022  Everyday Respect Report, with longer-term  actions, such as continued investment in  facilities, ongoing. We firmly believe that our  response to the 2022 Everyday Respect  Report has established a solid foundation  for building a more diverse workforce and  inclusive culture. While there remains much  to be done, we are encouraged by the  progress and genuine effort across Rio  Tinto and recognise culture change takes  sustained effort.  Pay in the broader context Our focus on pay equity is evident in our  gender pay metrics. We continue to focus  on fair and equal pay with a view to  eradicating any pay gaps. Further details  on our equal pay gap and gender pay gap,  along with a wider discussion on diversity  and inclusion, are provided in the ESG  section of this report on pages 78-80. In 2024, we achieved accreditation from  the Fair Wage Network as a Living Wage  Employer, following a Group-wide  assessment of our employee remuneration.  The living wage review showed that Rio Tinto  employees, regardless of the work they  undertake or where in the world they  perform their work, are not paid less than  what is considered a living wage. This  reinforces our pay principles of fairness  and equity, as well as competitiveness.  As always, I welcome shareholder feedback  and comments on our 2024 Directors’  Remuneration report. Yours sincerely, Sam Laidlaw People & Remuneration Committee Chair 19 February 2025 Directors’ report  |  Remuneration report  Annual Report 2024 121 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 124 ===== People & Remuneration Committee Chair Q&A What is the rationale for increasing salaries this year? Last year we communicated to shareholders that a significant gap  remains between our executive pay and the companies against  which we compete for the best talent. This poses significant risks to  our ability to retain our executives. The Committee has a track record of taking a measured and  conservative approach to remuneration and being mindful of  shareholder expectations. Our conservatism usually means deferral  of any significant changes to make sure of our assessments, and to  allow us to engage with as many stakeholders as we can for  feedback prior to implementation. We have found this has  contributed to the high levels of trust we have built internally and  externally that we will do what is appropriate and make sure it is well  executed. Nevertheless, in recent years we have experienced  unwanted executive turnover.   The Policy changes made at the 2024 AGMs were supported by  more than 97% of shareholders. These were structural changes that  applied to the entire executive team and were a first step to  ensuring that our framework remained competitive and fit for  purpose while providing further alignment to our ambitious  decarbonisation goals. The targeted salary increase we are making  for the Chief Executive in 2025 addresses specific issues identified  and flagged to many stakeholders in prior consultations as also  needing attention, but was deferred until after the Policy review as  part of a measured approach to pay. The Chief Executive’s salary no longer reflects the size and  complexity of the company or the talent market in which we  operate. His base salary and, consequently, target pay have fallen  significantly behind the market with gaps now too large to ignore.  Nevertheless, and consistent with our conservative approach, we  have not sought to match the market at similar-sized and globally  complex FTSE 10 companies and our key mining peers, but rather to  reduce the pay gap to these market peers. For the avoidance of  doubt, we have not attempted to replicate materially higher US pay  levels, instead we have benchmarked to equivalent FTSE 10 and  non-US global resources companies. Therefore it is incumbent upon  the Committee to ensure the positioning of executive remuneration  is appropriate for both retention and attraction. Seeking to pay a  competitive market rate for all our employees, including executives,  without exception, is consistent with and maintains our pay  philosophy.  CEO total remuneration at target (US$, excluding benefits) $5m $6m $7m $8m $9m $10m $11m FTSE 10 (excl.  Financial services) -  range FTSE 30 (excl.  Financial services) -  interquartile range Have you reduced incentives to reflect the tragic fatalities  that occurred during the year? Safety remains the top priority for Rio Tinto and the Board.  The Committee was deeply saddened by the tragic deaths of our  colleagues in a plane crash while travelling to the Diavik mine at the  start of the year; and by the loss of a contractor at our Guinea  operations in October. These incidents were classified as work- related, representing the first work-related fatalities since 2018. In  accordance with our STIP rules, the Committee determined a  fatality deduction should apply to all STIP eligible employees and  applied a reduction equivalent to 10% of the STIP outcome. Given  the specific nature of the incidents, the Committee believes this is  an appropriate reduction to be applied across all STIP eligible  participants. How do the bonus outcomes reflect the Everyday Respect  Progress Review? The public release of the 2022 Everyday Respect Report was a  catalyst for cultural change at Rio Tinto and marked a significant  step towards greater transparency. We have an ongoing  commitment to transparency, and in November 2024 published the  Everyday Respect Progress Review. The Board and our employees  were disappointed and, naturally, saddened to see that some  colleagues are still experiencing behaviours and attitudes that are  unacceptable and harmful. Changing a company’s culture to be  ahead of the societies in which our employees live is a challenge  and change will need our continued commitment and attention  every day. The 2024 Everyday Respect Progress Review also  showed, while not as much as we hoped and worked very hard for,  that change is being achieved. Under the STIP framework, we have People & Culture metrics which  seek to measure the progress we are making. The way in which we  measure our progress will evolve. In 2023, the People & Culture  targets were linked to gender diversity and completion rate of an  employee training program following the publication of the 2022  Everyday Respect Report. For 2024, we applied ambitious gender  diversity targets, and measured this alongside targets for scores  under our employee engagement survey which seek to capture how  our culture is changing. While both metrics showed progress during  the year, overall performance fell short of our ambitions and  therefore outcomes under the People & Culture component of the  STIP scorecard were below target, with payouts of 12.5% of  maximum. While similar metrics will apply in respect of 2025, we  expect that the objectives will further evolve in future years. As part of the holistic assessment of our performance, the  Committee carefully considered the contents of the 2024 Everyday  Respect Progress Review and the actions that have been taken  during the year.  Ultimately, the Committee concluded that the  outcomes provided a fair assessment of performance. Rio Tinto  remains more committed than ever to transforming our culture, but  it is recognised that this will be a multi-year journey, and the Board  firmly believes that the response to the 2022 Everyday Respect  Report has established a solid foundation for building a more  diverse workforce and inclusive culture. This will continue to be an  area of focus. Directors’ report  |  Remuneration report  Annual Report 2024 122 riotinto.com Rio Tinto – current Rio Tinto – proposed  ===== PAGE 125 ===== Remuneration at a glance Our Remuneration Policy applies to our Executive and Non-Executive Directors and to the Chair. In accordance with Australian law, it also sets  out the Remuneration Policy principles that apply to key management personnel (KMP) who are not directors. Our Remuneration Policy, as  approved at our 2024 annual general meetings (AGMs), can be found at riotinto.com/annualreport. When developing the Remuneration Policy,  the Committee considered the pay arrangements from the perspective of clarity, simplicity, risk, predictability, proportionality and alignment to  culture. Further detail is set out on pages 119-126 of the 2023 Annual Report. The Remuneration Policy applicable to our executives and its  implementation in 2024 and 2025 is summarised below. Fixed pay Base salary – Base salaries are set to reflect broad alignment  with comparable roles in the global external  market and the executive’s qualifications,  responsibilities and experience. – Base salaries are reviewed annually by the  Committee. Any increase is normally aligned  with the wider workforce, with no cap on  individual salary increases to better align with  market practice and to provide sufficient  flexibility where appropriate.  – Above average increases may be made in  specific circumstances, such as promotion,  increased responsibilities or market  competitiveness. Pension or superannuation – Rio Tinto may choose to offer participation in a  pension plan, superannuation fund, or a cash  allowance in lieu. – The maximum annual benefit is set to reflect  the pension arrangements for the wider  employee population and is currently capped  at 14% of base salary.  Other benefits – Executives are eligible to receive benefits which  may include private healthcare cover, life and  accident insurances, professional advice, and  other minor benefits. – Secondment, relocation and localisation  benefits may also be made to and on behalf of  executives living outside their home country. STIP  – Measures and weightings for the scorecard are  selected by the Committee for each financial  year. At least 50% of the measures will relate to  financial performance, and a significant  component will relate to safety. Other strategic,  environmental, social and governance (ESG) and  individual business outcomes may be included. – EBITDA and free cash flow are used for the  financial measures, half of which are adjusted  for commodity prices. – For financial performance, threshold  performance results in a nil award (25% of  award pays out for threshold performance for  non-financial measures) and outstanding  performance results in maximum payout. The  payout for specific metrics may be varied to  reflect the stretch of the underlying target. – Maximum opportunity is capped at 200% of  base salary for each executive. – Normally, 50% of the STIP is delivered in cash and  the balance is delivered in shares that are deferred  for 3 years as a Bonus Deferral Award (BDA). – Dividends (or equivalents) may accrue in  respect of any BDA that vest. – The Committee retains the right to exercise  discretion to ensure that the level of award  payable is appropriate.  – Malus, clawback and suspension provisions  apply to the STIP and BDA. LTIP – 80% of the award is subject to performance  measured against Total Shareholder Return (TSR)  relative to the constituents of the S&P Global  Mining Index and the MSCI World Index, and 20%  is assessed against a decarbonisation scorecard  (for Performance Share Award (PSA) grants made  from 2024). – The Committee will set performance conditions  aligned with the Group’s long-term strategic  objectives for each PSA grant. Relative TSR has  been chosen as the predominant measure of  long-term performance. The Committee retains  the discretion to adjust the performance  measures and weightings as appropriate. – Awards have a maximum face value of 500% of  base salary (of which one-fifth of 2024 and 2025  awards is linked to a tangible decarbonisation  scorecard). Threshold vesting is 22.5% of face  value. Target is 50% of face value. – Dividends (or equivalents) may accrue in  respect of any PSA that vest. – The Committee retains the right to exercise  discretion and seeks to ensure that outcomes  are fair and reflective of the overall  performance of the company during the  performance period. – Performance period of 3 years, followed by a  holding period of 2 years (for PSA grants made  from 2024). – Malus, clawback and suspension provisions  apply to LTIP awards (noting clawback  provisions comply with SEC requirements). Shareholding requirements – Over a 5-year period, executives should reach a  share ownership in Rio Tinto shares (expressed  as a fixed number of shares and subject to  review every 2 years). The shareholding  requirement for 2024 and 2025 is: • Chief Executive: 120,000 Rio Tinto plc shares • Chief Financial Officer: 60,000 Rio Tinto plc  shares • Other executives (requirement varies by  individual): 46,000-54,000 Rio Tinto plc shares  or 40,000-46,000 Rio Tinto Limited shares – Longer periods may be accepted for  new appointments. – Executive Directors are required to retain a  holding for 2 years after leaving the Group, in  line with the shareholding requirements. Recruitment policy – No form of “golden hello” will be provided upon  recruitment. In the case of internal appointments,  existing commitments will be honoured. – Our approach concerning “buy-outs” is to  determine a reasonable level of award, on a  like-for-like basis, consisting primarily of share- based awards, but also potentially cash, taking  into consideration the quantum of forfeited  awards, their performance conditions and  vesting schedules. – Other elements of remuneration are to be  consistent with the Policy applicable to  other executives. Termination policy – An Executive Director’s notice period is  normally 12 months, during which they will  receive their base salary and other benefits. – Ineligible leavers forfeit their unvested LTIP and  STIP entitlements. – An eligible leaver may receive the following: • A discretionary STIP award on a pro-rata  basis, payable on the normal STIP payment  date in cash. • Any unvested BDA from prior year awards will  normally vest on the scheduled vesting date. • Unvested LTIPs will normally be retained and  vest on the scheduled vesting date, subject  to performance conditions where applicable. – PSA and Management Share Awards (MSA),  where applicable, will be reduced if the  executive leaves within 36 months of grant. – STIP and LTIP awards are subject to malus,  clawback and suspension following termination. Directors’ report  |  Remuneration report  Annual Report 2024 123 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 126 ===== Consequence management framework – Under both the malus and clawback provisions,  where the Committee determines that an  exceptional circumstance has occurred, it may,  at its discretion, reduce the number of shares  to be received on vesting of an award, or, for a  period of 2 years after the vesting, the end of  any holding period or payment of a share or  cash award, the Committee can claw back  value from a participant. – The Committee will apply the consequence  management framework, and the circumstances  under which the Committee exercises such  discretion may include, inter alia: • fraud, misconduct or an exceptional event  which has had, or may have, a material effect  on the value, or reputation, or social licence  of any member of the Group • an error in the Group’s financial  statements which requires a material  downward restatement • personal performance and leadership  behaviour of a participant, of their product  group, or of the Group, which does not  justify vesting; or where the participant’s  conduct or performance has been in breach  of their employment contract, any laws, rules  or codes of conduct applicable to them; or  the standards or demeanour reasonably  expected of a person in their position • misstatement or misrepresentation  of performance • where any team, business area, member of  the Group or profit centre in which the  participant works (or worked) has been:  found guilty in connection with any  regulatory investigation; or has been in  breach of any laws, rules or codes of  conduct applicable to it; or the standards,  leadership behaviour or demeanour  reasonably expected of it • where the Committee determines that there  has been material damage to the Group’s  social licence to operate • a catastrophic safety or environmental  event. – Under the suspension provisions, the Committee  may suspend the vesting of an award for up to 5  years until the outcome of any internal or  external investigation is concluded, and may then  reduce or lapse the participant’s award based on  the outcome of that investigation. Where  suspension applies, the 24-month clawback  period will not extend beyond the period  commencing from the original vesting date, or  the end of any holding period. – Remuneration delivered under the Policy is  subject to SEC-compliant clawback policies for  up to 3 financial years requiring the clawback  of erroneously awarded incentives as a result  of material misstatements.  Discretion – The Committee reserves the right to review  all remuneration outcomes arising from  mechanistic application of performance  conditions, and to exercise discretion to  make adjustments where such outcomes  do not properly reflect underlying performance  or the experience of shareholders or  other stakeholders. – The Committee may at its discretion adjust, or  change performance measures, or both, if  events occur which cause the Committee to  determine that the measures are no longer  appropriate or in the best interests of  shareholders or other stakeholders, and that  amendment is required so that the measures,  as far as possible, achieve their original  purpose. Such discretion will be exercised  judiciously and clearly disclosed and explained  in the Implementation report.

Approximately 27,000 employees who  participate in the STIP have one Group  scorecard. The metrics in the STIP design  were chosen to drive the implementation of  our strategy and are based around our  areas of focus: our 4 objectives together  with the delivery of strong financial  performance and accelerating our  culture change. The PSA is targeted at our most senior  leaders, with consistent metrics applied for  all participants. The award is intended to  capture how we create sustainable value  for our shareholders over the longer term.  LTIP awards are based on relative TSR  performance both against sector peers  and the wider market, plus a scorecard  linked to the Group’s long-term  decarbonisation ambitions. Incentive Reflection in scorecard Strategic priorities People & Culture l STIP Focuses on how we do things as well as what we achieve, as a critical  lever of accelerating our culture change and building an inclusive  workplace environment.

The remuneration framework that applies to the wider employee population is inspired by, and consistent with, the Remuneration Policy that applies to executives. This allows the reward offering to employees to be  competitive and strongly linked to performance, while staying aligned with the company culture. Competitive reward Reward performance Recognise potential Fairness Focus on wellbeing Retain talent Consistency – We take a consistent approach in how we implement our Policy to enable transparency and fairness. – Our STIP design uses one scorecard for around 27,000 employees, including executives. This consistent  approach supports the delivery of our strategy, and a mindset shift in how we win collectively. Fairness – We are committed to providing equitable pay for equivalent roles and contribution. We review and monitor pay  equity through different lenses: • In-depth pay equity analysis as part of the remuneration review process. Through this, we manage pay equity  from multiple perspectives, including gender. • We annually review employee remuneration against living wage benchmarks, and achieved accreditation as a  Living Wage Employer from the Fair Wage Network in 2024. • Minimum global standards, which we implement across all countries to ensure the foundations of our reward  offerings, meet levels determined by the Group irrespective of local market practices. Examples include  global standards for parental leave and life assurance. Ownership – We promote material participation in our all-employee share plan (myShare) to create stewardship and provide  employees with access to building longer-term financial security. – As at 31 December 2024, approximately 36,000 (2023: 34,000) of our employees across more than  30 countries are shareholders in the company. – Employees invest approximately $26 million (2023: $24 million) in Rio Tinto shares every quarter through the  myShare plan. – Employees eligible for LTIP awards receive these as either MSA, vesting over 3 years and not subject to  performance conditions, or PSA which are performance-tested over 3 years. Recognition – Launched in February 2024, RockStars is our global recognition and service milestones program, reaching over  58,000 colleagues. – The program is supported by an easy-to-use platform, accessible across countries, offering a simple and  standardised framework for recognition at all levels. – Recognition moments are aligned with our company values, promoting the behaviours we want to see at  Rio Tinto.  – The program is complemented by our annual RockStars of the Year Awards, where noteworthy employee efforts  are celebrated. Wellbeing – We provide industry- and market-leading benefits programs that focus on holistic and integrated support for  physical, mental and financial wellbeing. – The benefits we offer can be tailored to suit different needs and life stages, including: employee assistance;  minimum standards for life, accident and disability insurances; medical plans and virtual care, health screening  and prevention; and subsidised health and wellbeing services.

About our reporting As our shares are listed on both the  Australian Securities Exchange and London  Stock Exchange, the information provided  within our Remuneration report must  comply with the reporting requirements  of both countries. Our regulatory responsibilities impact the  volume of information we provide, as well  as the complexity. In Australia, we need to  report on a wider group of executives,  as described in the following paragraph.  In addition, as set out in the summary table  below, the 2 reporting regimes follow  different methodologies for  calculating remuneration. In the UK, disclosure is required for the  Board, including the Executive Directors.  The Australian legislation requires disclosures  in respect of KMP, being those persons  having authority and responsibility for  planning, directing and controlling the  activities of the Group. In 2024, our KMP  comprise the Board, all product group Chief  Executives and the Chief Commercial Officer. Executive KMP are listed on pages 136 and  137, with details of the positions held during  the year and dates of appointment to  those roles. The single total figure of remuneration table  on page 129 shows remuneration for our  Executive Directors, gross of tax and in the  relevant currency of award or payment. In table 1a on page 141, we report  information regarding executives in  accordance with Australian statutory  disclosure requirements. The information is  shown gross of tax and in US dollars.  The remuneration details in table 1a include  accounting values relating to various parts  of the remuneration package, most notably  LTIP awards, and require a different  methodology for calculating the pension  value. The figures in the single total figure  of remuneration table are therefore not  directly comparable with those in table 1a.  Where applicable, amounts have been  converted using the relevant average  exchange rates included in the notes to  table 1a. In table 1b on page 142, we report the  remuneration of the Chair and the  Non-Executive Directors.  Certain information contained within the  Remuneration report is audited, as outlined  on page 145. Shareholder voting As required under UK legislation, the  new Policy was subject to a binding vote  and approved at our 2024 AGMs. The  Implementation report, together with  the annual statement by the People &  Remuneration Committee Chair, is subject  to an advisory vote each year as required  by UK legislation. Under Australian  legislation, the Remuneration report as a  whole is subject to an advisory vote. All  remuneration-related resolutions will be  voted on at the AGMs as Joint Decision  Matters by Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto  Limited shareholders.  The differing approaches  explained As well as the difference in methodology  for measuring remuneration, there are key  differences in how remuneration is reported  in the UK and Australia. UK – For reporting purposes, remuneration is  divided into fixed and variable elements. – We report remuneration in the currency it  is paid. For example, where a UK executive  is paid in pounds sterling, remuneration is  reported in pounds sterling. Australia – For reporting purposes, remuneration is  divided into short- and long-term  elements. – All remuneration is reported in US  dollars, so using the previous example,  the UK executives’ remuneration would  be converted to US dollars using the  average exchange rate for the financial  year (except STIP, which is converted at  the year-end exchange rate). The table below summarises the elements  of each component of remuneration, as well  as the significant differences in the  approaches to measurement.

Taking these into account when setting  the Policy for Executive Director  remuneration – engaging independent external  remuneration advisers. We consider the level of pay and conditions  for all employees across the Group when  determining executive remuneration. Committee membership The members of the Committee during the  year and to the date of this report were: Sam Laidlaw  (Committee Chair) Dominic Barton Dean Dalla Valle Simon McKeon  (to 2 May 2024) Susan Lloyd-Hurwitz Jennifer Nason Ngaire Woods  (to 31 May 2024) Ben Wyatt (from 1 June 2024) How we work The Group Company Secretary (or their  delegate) attends meetings as secretary to  the Committee. The Chief Executive, Chief  People Officer, Head of Reward and Head  of Talent attend appropriate parts of the  meetings at the invitation of the Committee  Chair. No individual is in attendance during  discussions about their own remuneration.  Independent advisers The Committee has a protocol for engaging  and working with remuneration consultants  to ensure that “remuneration  recommendations” (being advice relating to  the elements of remuneration for KMP, as  defined under the Australian Corporations  Act 2001) are made free from undue  influence by KMP to whom they may relate.  We monitored compliance with these  requirements throughout 2024. Deloitte, the  appointed advisers to the Committee, gave  declarations to the effect that any  remuneration recommendations were made  free from undue influence by KMP to whom  they related. The Board has received  assurance from the Committee and is  satisfied that this was the case. Deloitte are members of the Remuneration  Consultants’ Group, and voluntarily operate  under its Code of Conduct (the Code) in  relation to executive remuneration  consulting in the UK. The Code is based  upon principles of transparency, integrity,  objectivity, competence, due care and  confidentiality. Deloitte has confirmed that  they adhered to the Code throughout 2024  for all remuneration services provided to  Rio Tinto. The Code is available online at  remunerationconsultantsgroup.com. The Committee is satisfied that the Deloitte  team is independent. During 2024, Deloitte’s  services also included attending Committee  meetings, providing support on the 2024  Remuneration Policy and giving advice in  relation to management proposals and  shareholder consultations.  Deloitte was paid $490,922 (2023:  $504,507) for these services. Fees were  charged on the basis of time and expenses  incurred. We received other services and  publications relating to remuneration data  from a range of sources. During the year,  Deloitte also provided internal audit, tax  compliance and other non-audit advisory  services. These services were provided  under separate engagement terms and the  Committee is satisfied that there were no  conflicts of interest. How the Committee spent its time  in 2024 During 2024, the Committee met 5 times.  We fulfilled our responsibilities as set out in  our terms of reference, including the  expanded scope on the broader  People agenda. Our work in 2024 included: – reviewing culture maturity metrics – reviewing people development and  talent management – determining any base salary adjustments  and LTIP grants for executives – reviewing performance against the 2023  STIP and 2019 PSA targets, including  assessing applicable adjustments – determining the targets for the 2024 STIP – reviewing performance of the  accountable executives for Global  Industry Standard on Tailings  Management (GISTM) implementation – consulting with shareholders and proxy  advisers on our new Policy proposals  and a base salary review for the  Executive Committee – finalising terms for the retirement of Alf  Barrios, Chief Commercial Officer and  James Martin, Chief People Officer – setting terms of appointment of Katie  Jackson, Chief Executive, Copper, Bold  Baatar, Chief Commercial Officer and  Georgie Bezette, Chief People Officer – reviewing executives’ progress towards  the Group’s share ownership  requirements – reviewing the strategy and annual reports  on the Group’s global benefit plans. Performance review process  for executives We conduct annual performance reviews  for all executives. Our key objectives for the  performance review process are to: – improve organisational effectiveness by  creating alignment between the  executive’s objectives, Rio Tinto’s  strategy, the individual’s leadership  behaviours and the company’s values – provide a consistent, transparent and  balanced approach to measure, recognise  and reward executive performance. The Chief Executive conducts the review for  members of the Executive Committee and  recommends the performance outcomes to  the Committee. The Chief Executive’s  performance is assessed by the Chair of the  Board and is discussed and considered with  the Committee and the Board.

Dividend equivalent shares are applied on the vesting of the LTIP awards and, for the purposes of this table, are valued at the grant price for the LTIP awards and included in the face- value figure. The impact of share price change for LTIP awards vesting is included under the heading “share price appreciation”. The value of the LTIP awards reported in 2023 has  been restated to reflect the actual vested value.  The LTIP face value for 2024 is based on the number of PSA shares due to vest for the performance period ending 31 December 2024  (including dividend equivalents accrued throughout the vesting period), valued at the share price on the grant date. Any impact of share  price movement over the vesting period is shown under the share price appreciation column. The decrease in values for LTIP award vesting  for the Executive Directors reflects the lower vesting outcomes for the 2020 PSA relative to the 2019 PSA.  The 2024 face value and the share price appreciation figures shown above are estimates of both the number of shares that will ultimately vest and  the share price on vesting. Once actual values are known these estimates will be restated in the following year. Refer to page 134 for further detail. Fixed remuneration Base salary  In 2024, a comprehensive review of base salaries was undertaken for the Executive Committee to ensure they remain competitive in the  market. The Chief Executive’s March 2025 salary increase is at a premium of 6.8% to the 3% general increase awarded to UK employees.  Further detail is set out in the Annual statement by the People & Remuneration Committee Chair. The Chief Financial Officer’s base salary  increase is in line with that awarded to the wider UK employee population in 2025 of 3%. Base salaries are reviewed with a 1 March effective  date.

Maximum STIP award is capped at 200% of base salary. Target performance represents 50% of maximum and outstanding performance  represents 100% of maximum. Half of the STIP award will be paid in cash in March 2025, and the remainder will be delivered in deferred shares as a BDA, vesting in December 2027.  On cessation of employment, any unvested deferred shares will lapse unless the Committee decides the executive is an eligible leaver.  Directors’ report  |  Remuneration report  Annual Report 2024 129 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 132 ===== 2024 short-term incentive plan measures STIP Component Commentary Financial (Weighting: 50%) For 2024, the financial measures were underlying EBITDA and STIP free cash flow. The first, underlying EBITDA, gives insight to cost  management, production and performance efficiency. This is further described on page 168. A reconciliation of Profit after Tax for the year  to underlying EBITDA is provided on page 168. STIP free cash flow demonstrates how we convert underlying earnings to cash and provides further insight into how we are managing  costs, efficiency and productivity. STIP free cash flow comprises free cash flow (as reported on page 272), adjusted to exclude dividends  paid to holders of non-controlling interests in subsidiaries (of $0.5 billion) and development capital expenditure (of $5.3 billion, including  development capital expenditure associated with decarbonisation). This adjusted metric excludes the impact of those components of free  cash flow that are not directly related to performance in the year and therefore better represents underlying business performance.  Strategic (Weighting: 50%) Impeccable ESG (20%) aims to promote safety in all its aspects and progress decarbonisation efforts as we work towards achieving our  ambition to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030. Safety measures a combination of our safety maturity model (SMM) and all-injury frequency rate (AIFR). The safety outcome is  underpinned by an assessment of conformance with the GISTM for “high” and “very high” classification tailings facilities. Decarbonisation measures progress of carbon abatement projects against incremental stages of development. Excel in Development (10%) aims to incentivise a growth mindset by focusing on exploring new opportunities, prospecting new sites,  technology, and innovation. It measures performance in exploration, studies and project execution. Exploration progress focuses on the opportunities coming out of the exploration pipeline and moving into formal studies.  Studies progression assesses the number of studies approved to progress to project execution phase.  Project execution measures our execution progress in creating growth opportunities and closure projects across the Rio Tinto portfolio. People & Culture (10%) aims to improve diversity, create an inclusive work environment in which people can thrive, accelerate our culture  change and reinforce our values. It encompasses gender diversity and culture progress metrics. Gender diversity measures the year-on- year increase in representation of women in our organisation. Culture progress reflects the change in organisational culture as indicated  by our employee engagement survey. Social Licence (10%) is included as an indicator of our ability to build trust and acceptance with our external community of stakeholders.  The general public perception in key countries is reflected by a reputation score measured via a third-party survey provider, RepTrak. Calculation of 2024 short-term incentive plan award The following table summarises the calculation of the 2024 STIP award against the Group scorecard for the Executive Directors.

No payout below threshold. Threshold payout is nil for financial measures and Social Licence and 25% of maximum for the other strategic measures. Payout for achieving target  corresponds to 50% of maximum, going up in a straight line to outstanding, which represents 100% of maximum. 2. AIFR assesses the number of injuries per 200,000 hours worked by employees and contractors at managed operations. It includes medical treatment cases, restricted workday and  lost-day injuries.  3. The Group STIP SMM result is the average of the SMM scores achieved by the individual assets included in the safety maturity program.  4. For Decarbonisation, the progress of carbon abatement projects against incremental stages of development is calculated as the expected 2030 carbon reduction, measured in tonnes  of CO2e, contributed by each abatement project that passes a stage-gate during the calendar year. The scope is restricted to direct abatement initiatives under the global “6+1”  decarbonisation program, including approved renewable energy, abatement and energy efficiency projects. Nature-based solution (NbS) offset projects are not in scope. The outcome  for 2024 partially includes abatement projects relating to deprioritised assets and projects where the abatement timeframe may extend into 2031, therefore the Committee has capped  the resulting outcome at 75% of maximum.  5. Three Conceptual Study (CS) projects were completed in 2024 and each is assigned a value of 1 point. One project advanced to CS and is assigned a value of 0.5 points. Also, one  project progressed from Target Testing to Project of Merit and is assigned a value of 0.25 points, resulting in a weighted outcome of 3.75. 6. Qualitative review comprising of community insights from Local Voices and Social Licence self-assessments both showing strong results in 2024 (see commentary on page 131). Directors’ report  |  Remuneration report  Annual Report 2024 130 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 133 ===== STIP Group scorecard commentary Commentary on financial measures Unflexed performance for our financial performance measure  of 51.6% was slightly above target. Whilst this included an uplift  from higher copper and aluminium prices, the benefit of higher  prices compared to plan was modest compared to previous  years, and the financial outcome was underpinned by improved  operational stability across most of our operations. Flexed performance to remove the impact of commodity prices  and foreign exchange rates gives us an indication of underlying  business performance. Our flexed performance reflects the  shortfall in planned production volumes and resulting shipments  at a number of our sites. This included lower mined copper  volumes from Kennecott due to geotechnical instabilities in the  pit wall, higher than average rainfall in the Pilbara, and  operational challenges encountered at IOC.  However, underlying performance across the majority of the Group  was solid and increasingly predictable as the benefits of the Safe  Production System continued to unlock value in our assets.  Production was notably strong in Aluminium, with annual record  production at Amrun and Gove, resulting in bauxite production 8%  higher than plan. Based on these factors, the flexed component is modestly below  target for EBITDA (at 42.6%) and STIP free cash flow (at 39.2%). In line with our standard STIP principles, STIP free cash flow was  adjusted by $259 million to effectively remove the unplanned cash  flow impact of a one-off investment that reduces our exposure to  closure obligations over the longer term.  Outcome:  Below target  (at 46.3% of  maximum)     Commentary on strategic measures  Impeccable ESG Safety is our number one priority, and we are saddened to have  tragically lost 5 colleagues in 2024. In 2024, we maintained our  AIFR performance of 0.37, exceeding the annual target of 0.38. As part of our continual improvement, we have also seen an  uplift of 0.4 in our SMM assessments score, against a target  improvement of 0.5, resulting in a SMM global score of 5.4.  We have also exceeded the target for our GISTM  implementation plans for all classifications of tailings facilities in  2024. We have had no incidents with off-lease tailings releases  at any of our facilities.  Decarbonisation measures the progress of carbon abatement  projects against incremental stages of development. Climate change  and the low-carbon transition is at the heart of our strategy. We have  set ambitious commitments to reduce carbon emissions (CO2e) from  our business by 50% relative to 2018 levels by 2030, and achieve net  zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050.  2024 was Rio Tinto’s best year for decarbonisation with absolute  Scope 1 and 2 emissions reducing by 3.2 Mt CO2e during the year.  We remain on track to achieve our 2030 and 2050 ambitions.  A total of 28 projects progressed through a development stage  during the year. Outcome: Above  target (at 62% of  maximum) Excel in Development  Excel in Development encompasses goals focusing on exploration  progression, studies progression and project execution.   Exploration progression develops a dynamic portfolio of projects  that are rigorously prioritised and rapidly tested. Exploration  progression focuses on the opportunities coming out of the  exploration pipeline and moving into formal studies, including  Conceptual Studies completed with a decision to hold, divest or  advance to Order of Magnitude (OoM), studies advancing from  Projects of Merit (PoM) to Conceptual Study (CS) phase, and  studies advancing from Target Testing (TT) to PoM.  Three CS projects were completed this year, one project advanced to  CS and another project progressed from TT to PoM, resulting in an  outstanding weighted score of 3.75. Studies progression of 5 studies in 2024, with 4 studies obtaining Notice  to Proceed in the year. This included Cape Lambert High Density Ore and  Brockman Syncline 1 programs. Full project sanction was achieved for the  Simandou and Hope Downs 1 Sustaining Studies in 2024. This  outstanding result provides diversified growth opportunities across  commodities of Copper, Aluminium and Iron Ore.   Projects execution refers to the percentage of in-flight and  completed projects on track against the Investment Committee plan.  Throughout 2024, we made strong progress on a range of projects.  Nine out of 12 projects remained on track with the approved  Investment Committee plans.  A significant milestone was also achieved with the Autonomous  Haulage System in Western Range going live in 2024. Project Shafts 3 and 4 for Oyu Tolgoi underground mine were also  commissioned in 2024, and are now fully operational. Outcome:  Outstanding (at 100% of  maximum) People & Culture Our People & Culture scorecard focuses on driving culture  change and improving gender diversity. Gender diversity in 2024 was focused on both increasing the  number of women and changing the culture to become more  inclusive. The representation of women across our business remains  a challenge. While we were able to increase the representation of  women in 2024 from 24.3% to 25.2%, this result was below the  threshold of 25.3%.  Culture change progress measures the change in our organisation’s  culture, as indicated by the results of the employee engagement  survey. The result from the employee engagement survey at the end  of 2024 was 70.19, rounded down to 70. This result was below the  target of 71 and represents threshold performance. Outcome:  Below target (at 12.5% of  maximum) Social Licence Reputation as the Social Licence metric focuses on building trust in and support of Rio Tinto within the communities where we work.  The general public perception in selected countries is reflected by a reputation score measured by RepTrak. The 2024 result was 60.9,  above the target range of 57.8 to 59.8 and a significant improvement on the score of 58.8 in the prior year. This score is a weighted,  global aggregate made up of results from Australia, Canada, Mongolia, New Zealand, South Africa, the UK and the US.  For 2024, the  Committee also took into account the roll-out of Local Voices (our community perception monitoring program) to 50% of our assets  and the emerging insights from the deployment, as well as the outcomes of our Social Licence self-assessments in 14 assets across all  product groups that demonstrated clear year-on-year improvement.  Considering both the reputation score and qualitative assessment  the Committee determined an outcome of 82.5% of maximum. Outcome:  Above target (at 82.5% of  maximum) Fatality deduction A deduction was applied to reflect the tragic work-related fatalities of 2024. Further detail is set out in the Annual statement by the People & Remuneration  Committee Chair.

Commentary Underlying EBITDA – unflexed 12.5% Underlying EBITDA is a segmental performance measure and represents profit before tax, net finance items, depreciation and amortisation. Underlying EBITDA is the prominent financial measure of  underlying business performance on an income statement  basis. The core objectives of robust operational  performance and disciplined cost management are well  reflected in underlying EBITDA. The underlying EBITDA  target for STIP purposes is based on the Group’s annual  plan, calibrated to reflect production guidance  communicated at the start of the year. Underlying EBITDA – flexed 12.5% Underlying EBITDA, adjusted for the impact of  commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Removing the impact of commodity prices and foreign  exchange rates gives us a stronger indication of the  underlying EBITDA outcome of our underlying business  performance, aligned to the core objective of Best Operator.  STIP free cash flow – unflexed 12.5% STIP free cash flow comprises free cash flow  adjusted to exclude dividends paid to holders of  non-controlling interests in subsidiaries and  development capital expenditure (including  development capital expenditure on  decarbonisation projects). STIP free cash flow demonstrates how we convert  underlying EBITDA to cash and provides further insight into  how we are managing efficiency and productivity, including  working capital and sustaining capital.

Directors’ report  |  Remuneration report  Annual Report 2024 133 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 136 ===== Long-term incentive plan PSA granted in 2020 were based on 2 performance conditions,  both measured over a 5-year performance period: – TSR relative to the EMIX Global Mining Index – 50% – TSR relative to the MSCI World Index – 50% The performance outcome against the EMIX Global Mining Index and  MSCI World Index was 25.5% and 0% respectively, resulting in an overall  vesting of 12.75%. The value of the shares vesting included in the single  total figure of remuneration table for 2024 is an estimate, as the actual  value can only be determined once the share price and final application  of dividend equivalents on vesting are known. The disclosed value is based on: – The approved TSR outcome relative to the EMIX Global Mining  Index (transitioned to the S&P Global Mining Index from 1 August  2023 following the decommissioning of the EMIX on 31 July  2023) and MSCI World Index, with associated dividend  equivalent shares. – The average share prices for Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited  over the last quarter of the 5-year performance period (Q4 2024). The actual value associated with the 2020 PSA vesting will be  disclosed in the 2025 Remuneration report. Calculation of 2020 PSA vesting The dual TSR measures recognise that the company competes in the global market for investors as well as within the mining sector, and  rewards executives for returns over the long term that outperform both the broader market and the mining sector.

The EMIX Global Mining Index was decommissioned on 31 July 2023 and therefore it was necessary to identify a replacement index for the remainder of the performance period. The  Committee considered a range of alternative indices and determined that S&P’s replacement index (the S&P Global Mining Index) was the most suitable, given the overlap in  constituents and close correlation in performance. TSR performance was calculated by our independent remuneration consultants tracking the EMIX Global Mining Index to 31 July  2023 and the S&P Global Mining Index thereafter. This methodology will apply to all relevant outstanding PSA.

Performance measures For PSAs granted in 2024 and 2025, 80% of the award is based on relative TSR measured on a weighted ranked basis against constituents  of a sector and a broader market index. Two-thirds of the TSR element will be measured relative to sector peers (constituents of the S&P  Global Mining Index) and the remaining one-third measured against a broader market reference point (constituents of the MSCI World  Index). The remaining 20% of the award will be based on strategic measures linked to decarbonisation.

The decarbonisation scorecard includes a combination  of metrics that address opportunities and risks from the energy transition to incentivise long-term competitive advantage. The balanced  scorecard includes the following 4 equally weighted elements assessed over the 3-year performance period: Objective Details Residual  emissions – This provides a measure of actual reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions with targets set taking into account the Group’s stated ambition  of a 50% reduction by 2030 (relative to our 2018 baseline). Achieving the maximum outcome would be consistent with the linear  trajectory required to achieve the 2030 ambition. – The Committee will take into account the relative contribution of nature-based offsets directly associated with Rio Tinto landholdings or  those of its joint ventures when assessing performance. The contribution will be capped at 10% of the reduction and for any outcome  above target the contribution from offsets will be ignored.  Project  delivery – The successful delivery of abatement projects will be fundamental to achieving our stretching decarbonisation objectives. – Working with the Decarbonisation Office, the Committee identifies a number of priority decarbonisation projects for which investment  approval has been granted, or is expected to be granted in the near future. Four projects for the 2024-2026 performance period were  approved by the Committee during 2024. For the 2025-2027 performance period, there are currently 4 projects identified for which  investment approval is expected prior to the end of the first half of 2025. – At the end of the 3-year performance period, there will be an assessment of project delivery measuring conformance to plan for both  spend and schedule. Using a predetermined framework, each project will be assigned a score out of 10 and vesting will be determined  based on the average score of the projects. Technology  development – Progressing towards net zero will require technology advancement and research and development breakthroughs that convert into  implemented projects. – This metric assesses Group spend committed to research and development and the successful implementation of projects that have a  meaningful impact on the abatement of emissions (including spend associated with reducing Scope 3 emissions). Transition  strategy – This measure aligns decarbonisation activity with our value creation strategy, specifically in building new capabilities or commitments  towards new growth assets. – For the 2024-2026 performance period, 3 transition strategy outcomes that are are significant to Group value were selected, namely:  Pacific Operations (PacOps) decarbonisation; aluminium and copper recycling and ELYSISTM implementation. For the 2025-2027  scorecard, PacOps decarbonisation and aluminium recycling will be retained, alongside a new initiative, lithium growth replacing  ELYSISTM implementation. For the PacOps and recycling initiatives being retained on the scorecard, they will be assessed only on  performance achieved during 2025-2027, noting they are also on the 2024-2026 scorecard. – At the end of the 3-year performance period, each transition strategy will be assigned a score out of 10 using a predetermined  framework and vesting will be determined based on the average score of the transition objectives. The targets under each element of the scorecard for the 2024 and 2025 awards, as well as an update on how performance is tracking over  the first year of the performance period for the 2024 award, are summarised below. Based on the performance to date, the best estimate of  the potential vesting outcome for the 2024 award is tracking between threshold and target.  Residual emissions Reduction in residual emissions  relative to 2018 baseline,  adjusted for changes in equity 5% 3.8Mt CO2e 5.3Mt CO2e 6.9Mt CO2e 2024 performance update: Tracking around threshold - reported emissions at the start of the award period were 33.9Mt CO2e adjusted for increased equity  at Boyne Smelters and New Zealand Aluminium Smelter, with a net reduction of 3.5Mt for the purposes of the scorecard delivered in the first year of the  award. Projected emissions reductions to 2030 are expected to be weighted to the end of the decade. Project delivery Conformance to plan for priority  decarbonisation projects 5% Average score of at least 6 out of 10  being a maximum deviation of 25%  from planned cost and schedule Average score of at least 8 out of 10  being a maximum deviation of 15%  from planned cost and schedule Average score of at least 9 out of 10  being less than 10% deviation from  planned cost and schedule 2024 performance update: Tracking to target – 4 projects have been included in the assessment of this metric, each of which is a committed project. The  projects are early in their development cycle and remain materially in conformance with cost and schedule. Technology development Technology advancements  and research and development  breakthroughs that convert  into implemented projects 5% 0.2% of Group revenue on  decarbonisation research and  development spend At least one project into  implementation totalling 250kt  annual abatement 0.4% of Group revenue on  decarbonisation research and  development spend At least one project into  implementation totalling 500kt  annual abatement 0.5% of Group revenue on  decarbonisation research and  development spend At least 2 projects into  implementation totalling 750kt  annual abatement 2024 performance update: Tracking to target - spend on research and development is tracking within target range, with several projects expected to  proceed into implementation later in the performance period.  Transition strategy Alignment of decarbonisation  activity with value creation 5% Average score of at least 6 out of 10  representing more limited progress Average score of at least 8 out of 10  representing good progress towards  strategic goals, some areas of  outperformance, substantially  achieved or on track to deliver major  objectives, or progress with no major  failures or impacts on broader  performance of the Group Average score of at least 9 out of 10  representing significant  outperformance of expectations,  implementation achieved or a major  new advancement with scope for  material benefits 2024 performance update: Tracking around threshold – significant progress including signing new repowering contracts for our Pacific Operations, including  at Boyne Smelters and New Zealand Aluminium Smelter to strengthen their future. For ELYSIS™ implementation, commitments have been made to install  carbon-free aluminium smelting cells at Arvida using the first technology licence issued by the ELYSISTM joint venture.

A minimum shareholding  requirement applies on appointment to be built up over  subsequent years. Executive departures Alf Barrios ceased to be a KMP on 31 August 2024 and retired from  the Group on 31 December 2024. Alf was treated as an eligible  leaver for the purposes of STIP and LTIP. Broader employee disclosures Chief Executive pay ratio The ratio of the single total figure of remuneration for the  Chief Executive to the lower quartile, median and upper quartile of  the Rio Tinto Australian employee population for 2024 is set out in  the table below. Lower quartile Median Upper quartile 2024 46 39 33 2023 1 114 95 79 1. The 2023 pay ratio data has been restated based on actual pay outcomes for the Chief  Executive in 2023. The median CEO pay ratio of 39:1 is lower than last year, primarily  due to materially lower outcomes on long-term incentives for the  performance period ending 31 December 2024. The Committee  continues to be mindful of the relationship between executive  remuneration and that of our broader workforce. The Committee’s  decision making will continue to be supported by regular and  detailed reporting on these matters.

No post-employment, termination or share-based  payments were made. Statutory minimum superannuation  contributions for Non-Executive Directors are deducted from the  Director’s overall fee entitlements when these are required by  Australian superannuation law. The total fee and allowance payments made to the Chair and  Non-Executive Directors in 2024 were within the maximum  aggregate annual amount of £4 million set out in the Group’s  constitutional documents, approved by shareholders at the  2024 AGMs. Share ownership policy for Non-Executive Directors Rio Tinto has a policy that encourages Non-Executive Directors to  build up a Rio Tinto shareholding. The shareholding target in 2024  is 1,800 Rio Tinto Limited shares, 2,200 Rio Tinto plc shares or 2,100  Rio Tinto ADRs (or a combination thereof) and will be reviewed  every 2 years. Details of Non-Executive Directors’ share interests in  the Group, including total holdings, are set out in table 2 on  page 142.

Other statutory disclosures Other share plans All-employee share plans The Committee believes that all employees should be given the  opportunity to become shareholders in our business, and that share  plans help engage, retain and motivate employees over the long  term. Rio Tinto’s share plans are therefore part of its standard  remuneration practice, to encourage employee share ownership  and create alignment with the shareholder experience. Executives  may participate in broad-based share plans that are available to  Group employees generally and to which performance conditions  do not apply. A global employee share purchase plan is normally offered to all  eligible employees unless there are local jurisdictional restrictions.  Under the plan, employees may acquire shares up to the value of  $5,250 (or equivalent in other currencies) per year or capped at  15% of their base salary if lower. Each share purchased will be  matched by the company, providing the participant holds the  shares, and is still employed, at the end of the 3-year vesting period. Approximately 36,000 of our employees (67% of those eligible) are  shareholders as a result of participating in these plans. In the UK,  these arrangements are partially delivered through the UK Share  Plan which is a UK tax-approved arrangement. Under this plan,  eligible participants may also receive an annual award of Free  Shares up to the limits prescribed under UK tax legislation. Management Share Awards The Management Share Awards (MSA) are designed to help the  Group attract the best staff in a competitive labour market, and to  retain key individuals as we deliver our long-term strategy. MSA are  conditional awards that are not subject to a performance condition.  They typically vest at the end of 3 years, subject to continued  employment. Shares to satisfy the awards are bought in the market  or reissued from Treasury. Executive Committee members are not  eligible to be granted MSA, except in connection with recruitment  purposes. Shareholder voting In the table below, we set out the results of the remuneration- related resolutions voted on at the Group’s 2024 AGMs.  Resolution Votes for Votes against Votes withheld1 Approval of the Directors’  Remuneration report:  Implementation report 97% 3% 7,949,109 Approval of the  Remuneration Policy  (2024) 97% 3% 3,469,190 Approval of the Directors’ Remuneration report 97% 3% 7,933,078 1.

For Bold Baatar this also includes the international transfer allowance  paid as per the company standard upon Bold’s relocation from the UK to Singapore.               4. “Non-monetary benefits” for executives typically include healthcare coverage, professional tax compliance services/advice, flexible perquisites and, where applicable, leave accruals and  mobility-related benefits. For Bold Baatar this also includes benefits related to his relocation from the UK to Singapore. 5. The figures for Alf Barrios reflect his remuneration up until he ceased to be a KMP on 31 August 2024. His total remuneration up until his employment termination date of 31 December  2024 was US$5,314,000. 6. The “Value of share-based awards” has been determined in accordance with the recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS2 ''Share-based Payment''. The fair value of awards  granted as MSA, BDA and PSA have been calculated at their dates of grant using valuation models provided by external consultants, Lane Clark and Peacock LLP, including an  independent Monte Carlo valuation model, which take into account the constraints on vesting attached to these awards. Further details of the valuation methods and assumptions used  for these awards are included in note 27 (Share-based Payments) in the financial statements. The fair value of other share-based awards is measured at the purchase cost of the shares  from the market. The share-based values disclosed in this table do not reflect amounts actually paid in 2024 or the value of shares that will ultimately vest. 7. “BDA” represents the portion of the 2021–2024 STIP awards deferred into Rio Tinto shares. 8. “Others” includes the Global Employee Share Plan (myShare) and the UK Share Plan. 9. Any costs related to defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical benefits are the service costs attributable to the individual, calculated in accordance with IAS 19. The  cost for defined contribution pension plans is the amount contributed in the year by the company. 10. “Total remuneration” represents the disclosure of total emoluments and compensation required under the Australian Corporations Act 2001 and applicable accounting standards. Further details in relation to aggregate remuneration for executives, including Directors, are included in note 29 (Directors’ and key  management remuneration).

The statutory minimum  superannuation contributions required by the Australian  superannuation law and paid for the Australia-based NEDs  are included in “Fees and allowances”.  3. “Non-monetary benefits” include, as in previous years,  amounts that are deemed by the UK tax authorities to be  benefits in kind relating largely to the costs of Directors’  expenses in attending Board meetings held at the  company’s UK-registered office (including associated  accommodation and subsistence expenses) and  professional tax compliance services/advice. Given these  expenses are incurred by Directors in the fulfilment of their  duties, the company pays the tax on them. 4.

Directors’ report  |  Additional statutory disclosure  Annual Report 2024 148 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 151 ===== AGM Disclosures  At Rio Tinto plc’s AGM on 4 April 2024,  Resolution 25 (“Authority to purchase  Rio Tinto plc shares”) was passed with less  than 80% of votes in favour, and Shining  Prospect (a subsidiary of the Aluminium  Corporation of China (Chinalco)) voted  against. Chinalco has not sold any Rio Tinto  plc shares and now has a holding of over  14%, given its non-participation in  Rio Tinto’s significant share buyback  programs. This places Chinalco close to the  14.99% holding threshold agreed with the  Australian Government at the time of  Chinalco’s original investment in 2008. Directors and executives The names of Directors and their periods of  appointment are listed on pages 102-103,  together with details of each Director’s  qualifications, experience and  responsibilities, and current directorships. There are no family relationships between any  of our Directors or executives. None of our  Directors or Executive Committee members  are elected or appointed under any  arrangement or understanding with any major  shareholder, customer, supplier or otherwise. A table of Directors’ attendance at Board  and committee meetings during 2024 is on  page 110. Directors’ experience and independence The Chair was considered independent  upon his appointment and, in the Board’s  view, he continues to satisfy the tests for  independence under the ASX Principles  and NYSE Standards. The Board is satisfied that all of its Non- Executive Directors are independent in  character and judgement, and are free from  any relationships (material or otherwise) or  circumstances that could create a conflict  of interest. On joining Rio Tinto, all Directors receive a  full, formal induction program. It is delivered  over a number of months, and tailored to  their specific requirements, taking into  account their respective committee  responsibilities.   All Directors are expected to commit to  continuing their development during their  tenure. This is supported through a  combination of site visits, teach-ins, deep  dives, and internal business and operational  briefings provided in or around scheduled  Board and committee meetings. The notice of AGM provides all material  information in Rio Tinto’s possession  relevant to decisions on election and re- election of Directors, including a statement  from the Board that it considers all  Directors continue to perform effectively  and demonstrate appropriate levels of  commitment. It also provides reasons why  each Director is recommended for re- election, highlighting their relevant skills and  experience.

Tim Paine is the Company  Secretary of Rio Tinto Limited. Andy’s and  Tim’s qualifications and experience are  described on page 103.  Indemnities and insurance The Articles of Association of Rio Tinto plc  and the Constitution of Rio Tinto Limited  provide for them to indemnify, to the extent  permitted by law, Directors and officers of  the companies, including officers of certain  subsidiaries, against liabilities arising from  the conduct of the Group’s business. The  Directors, Group Company Secretary and  Company Secretary of Rio Tinto Limited,  together with employees serving as  Directors of eligible subsidiaries at the  Group’s request, have also received similar  direct indemnities. Former Directors also  received indemnities for the period in which  they were Directors. These are qualifying  third-party indemnity provisions for the  purposes of the UK Companies Act 2006,  in force during the financial year ended 31  December 2024 and up to the date of this  report. During 2024, Rio Tinto paid legal  costs under the terms of those indemnities  for certain former Directors and officers  totalling $610,486. Qualifying pension scheme indemnity  provisions as defined by section 236 of the  UK Companies Act 2006 and other  applicable legal jurisdictions were in force  during the course of the financial year  ended 31 December 2024 and up to the  date of this Directors’ report, for the benefit  of trustees of the Rio Tinto Group pension  and superannuation funds across various  jurisdictions. No amount has been paid  under any of these indemnities during the  year. The Group has agreed to pay a premium for  Directors’ and officers’ insurance.  Disclosure of the nature of the liability  covered by the insurance and premium paid  is subject to confidentiality requirements  under the contract of insurance. Oversight of whistleblowing procedures Our whistleblowing process is overseen by  the Board. Every member of the workforce  has access to the whistleblowing program  (myVoice); details of the program are on  page 86. Labour and engagement policies  Labour relations  We also work together with our employees  and their unions, and we seek constructive  dialogue and fair solutions while maintaining  the competitiveness of our managed  operations. In 2024, we did not have  operations disruptions affecting production  due to industrial actions. Employment of people with a disability We acknowledge the systemic barriers  facing people with disabilities in attaining  meaningful employment. We further  acknowledge the efforts necessary to fully  support people with disabilities and we seek  to implement the accommodations they  need to fulfil their role, or an alternative role  if required.  Our Respect, Inclusion and Diversity Policy  sets out our expectations around the  behaviours needed for an inclusive and  diverse workplace, where we embrace  different perspectives, valuing diversity as a  strength.  Our Employment Policy outlines how we  are committed to preventing discrimination  and that we employ on the basis of job  requirements and do not discriminate on  grounds of disability or any other protected  characteristic. It also explains how we  ensure our people are trained to perform  their roles. More information can be found  at riotinto.com/policies. We remain a member of the IncludeAbility  Employer Network, which was set up by the  Australian Human Rights Commission and  aims to increase access to meaningful  employment opportunities for people  with a disability. We will continue to seek  ways to improve how we provide meaningful  opportunities for people with a disability  and are also working to reduce these  barriers as part of our response to the  recommendations in the Everyday  Respect Report. Engagement with UK employees Our statement on engagement with UK  employees is on page 106.

Political donations Rio Tinto prohibits the use of its funds to  support political candidates or parties. No  donations were made by the Group to parties  or political candidates during the year. At Rio  Tinto, we respect every country’s political  process and do not get involved in political  matters, nor do we make any type of  payments to political parties or political  candidates. In the US, in accordance with the  Federal Election Campaign Act, we provide  administrative support for the Rio Tinto  America Political Action Committee (PAC),  which was created in 1990 and encourages  voluntary employee participation in the  political process. All Rio Tinto America PAC  employee contributions are reviewed for  compliance with federal and state laws and  are publicly reported in accordance with US  election laws. The PAC is controlled by  neither Rio Tinto nor any of its subsidiaries,  but instead by a governing board of 5  employee members on a voluntary basis. In  2024, contributions to Rio Tinto America  PAC by 14 employees amounted to $14,815  and Rio Tinto America PAC donated $10,500  in political contributions in 2024.  Government regulations Our operations around the world are  subject to extensive laws and regulations  imposed by local, state, provincial and  federal governments. In addition to these  laws, several of our operations are  governed by specific agreements made with  governments, some of which are enshrined  in legislation. The geographic and product diversity of our  operations reduces the likelihood of any single  law or government regulation having a material  effect on the Group’s business as a whole.  Environmental regulations Rio Tinto is subject to various environmental  laws and regulations in the countries where  it has operations. We measure our  performance against environmental  regulation by tracking and rating incidents  according to their actual environmental and  compliance impacts using 5 severity  categories (very low, low, moderate, high or  very high). Incidents with a consequence  rating of high or very high are of a severity  that requires notification to the relevant  product group head and the Rio Tinto Chief  Executive immediately after the incident  occurring. In 2024, there were no  environmental incidents at managed  operations with a high impact.  During 2024, 7 managed operations  incurred fines amounting to $604,845  (2023: $986,968). Details of these fines are  reported in the Our approach to ESG  section on page 39.  Australian corporations that exceed specific  greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or energy  use thresholds have obligations under the  Australian The National Greenhouse and  Energy Reporting Act 2007 (NGER). All  Rio Tinto entities covered under this Act  have submitted their annual NGER reports  by the required 31 October 2024 deadline. Further information on the Group’s  environmental performance is included in the  Our approach to ESG section on pages 32-87,  and at riotinto.com/sustainabilityreporting.

This GHG data represents Scope 1  and market-based Scope 2 data on equity basis.  Our approach and methodology used for the  determination of these emissions are available at  riotinto.com/sustainability reporting.  7. Rio Tinto’s GHG emissions inventory is based on  definitions provided by The World Resource Institute/ World Business Council for Sustainable Development  Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Carbon Reporting and  Accounting Standard (Revised Edition) (2015). 8. Rio Tinto does not report on the proportion of CO2  emissions associated with the UK and offshore area  since it has no producing assets in the UK, only offices,  and consequently falls below Rio Tinto’s threshold level  of reporting. 9. Scope 1 GHG emissions are direct GHG emissions from  facilities fully or partially owned or controlled by  Rio Tinto (equity share basis). They include fuel use,  on-site electricity generation, anode and reductant use,  process emissions, land management and livestock. 10. Scope 2 emissions are presented on equity share basis,  for market based reporting Scope 2 includes the use of  Energy Attribution Certificates. Our approach and  methodology used for the determination of these emissions  are available at riotinto.com/sustainabilityreporting. 11. Carbon credits used towards our 2024 net emissions  calculations include Australian Carbon Credit Units  (ACCUs) that were retired for compliance for the  period 1 January to 30 June 2024 plus a projection of  the number of ACCUs we expect to retire for the period  1 July to 31 December 2024. This projection is based on  our Scope 1 emissions for the period 1 July - 31  December 2024. For details, refer to the table “Carbon  credits retired towards net emissions (equity basis)” in  the Rio Tinto Sustainability Factbook. 12. Total emissions are the sum of Scope 1 and scope 2  emissions. Total emissions include scope 1 emissions   resulting from production of electricity exported to  third parties. These emissions exclude indirect  emissions associated with transportation and use of  our products reported under Scope 3 emissions at  riotinto.com/sustainabilityreporting. 13. Historical information for copper equivalent intensity  has been restated inline with the 2023 review of  commodity pricing to allow comparability over time. Exploration, research and development The Group carries out exploration, research  and development as described in the  product group on pages 24-31. Exploration  and evaluation costs, net of any gains and  losses on disposal, generated a net loss  before tax of $936 million (2023: $1,230  million). Research and development costs  were $398 million (2023: $245 million). Dealing in Rio Tinto securities Rio Tinto securities dealing policy restricts  dealing in Rio Tinto securities by Directors  and employees who may be in possession  of inside information. These individuals must  seek clearance before any proposed  dealing takes place. Our policy also prohibits such persons from  engaging in hedging or other arrangements  that limit the economic risk in connection to  Rio Tinto securities issued, or otherwise  allocated, as remuneration that are either  unvested, or that have vested but remain  subject to a holding period. We also impose  restrictions on a broader group of  employees, requiring them to seek  clearance before engaging in similar  arrangements over any Rio Tinto securities. Financial reporting Financial statements The Directors are required to prepare  financial statements for each financial  period that give a true and fair view of the  state of the Group at the end of the  financial period, together with profit or loss  and cash flows for that period. This includes  preparing financial statements in  accordance with UK-adopted international  accounting standards, applicable UK law  (Companies Act 2006), Australian law  (Corporations Act 2001) as amended by  the ASIC class order and preparing a  Remuneration report that includes the  information required by Regulation 11,  Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized  Companies and Groups (Accounts and  Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended)  and the Australian Corporations Act 2001. In addition, the UK Corporate Governance  Code recommends that the Board provide  a fair, balanced and understandable  assessment of the company’s position and  prospects in its external reporting. Rio Tinto’s management conducts extensive  review and challenge in support of the  Board’s obligations, aiming to strike a  Directors’ report  |  Additional statutory disclosure  Annual Report 2024 150 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 153 ===== balance between positive and negative  statements and provide good linkages  throughout the Annual Report.  The Directors were responsible for the  preparation and approval of the Annual  Report for the year ended 31 December  2024. They consider the Annual Report,  taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced and  understandable, and that it provides the  information necessary for shareholders to  assess the Group’s position, performance,  business model and strategy. The Directors are responsible for maintaining  proper accounting records, in accordance with  UK and Australian legislation. They have a  general responsibility to safeguard the assets  of the Group, and to prevent and detect fraud  and other irregularities. The Directors are also  responsible for ensuring that appropriate  systems are in place to maintain and preserve  the integrity of the Group’s website.  Legislation in the UK governing the  preparation and dissemination of financial  statements may differ from current and future  legislation in other jurisdictions. The work  carried out by the Group’s external auditors  does not take into account such legislation  and, accordingly, the external auditors accept  no responsibility for any changes to the  financial statements after they are made  available on the Group’s website. The Directors, senior executives, senior  financial managers and other members of  staff who are required to exercise judgement  while preparing the Group’s financial  statements, are required to conduct  themselves with integrity and honesty, and in  accordance with the highest ethical  standards, as are all Group employees. The Directors consider that the 2024  Annual Report presents a true and fair view  and has been prepared in accordance with  applicable accounting standards, using the  most appropriate accounting policies for  Rio Tinto’s business, and supported by  reasonable judgements and estimates. The  accounting policies have been consistently  applied as described on pages 154-161, and  Directors have received a written statement  from the Chief Executive and the Chief  Financial Officer to this effect. In  accordance with the internal control  requirements of the Code and the ASX  Principles, this written statement confirms  that the declarations in the statement are  founded on a sound system of risk  management and internal controls, and that  the system is operating effectively in all  material respects in relation to financial  reporting risks. Further information on Directors’  responsibilities is included on page 245. Disclosure controls and procedures The Group maintains disclosure controls  and procedures, as defined in US Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) Rule  13a-15(e). Management, with the  participation of the Chief Executive and  Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the  effectiveness of the Group’s disclosure  controls and procedures in relation to US  Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), as of the end  of the period covered by this report, and  has concluded that the Group’s disclosure  controls and procedures were effective at a  reasonable assurance level. We have a thorough and rigorous review  process in place to ensure integrity of the  periodic reports we release to the market.  We communicate with the market through  accurate, clear, concise and effective  reporting, and contents of periodic reports  are verified by the subject matter experts  and reviewed by the relevant Group  functions. Such reports are then reviewed  and considered by the Group Disclosure  Committee for release to the market.   To ensure that trading in our securities  takes place in an informed and orderly  market, we have established a Disclosure  Committee to oversee compliance with our  continuous disclosure obligations. The  Group Disclosure and Communications  Policy, and the terms of reference of our  Disclosure Committee, together with our  adopted procedures in relation to  disclosure and management of relevant  information, support compliance with our  disclosure obligations. A copy of the Group  Disclosure and Communications Policy is  available on the website.  The members of the Committee are the  Chief Executive; the Chief Financial Officer;  the Group Company Secretary; the Chief  Legal Officer, Governance & Corporate  Affairs; the Head of Investor Relations; and  the Chief Executive, Australia.  Consistent with the Group’s disclosure  protocols, the Board is provided with copies  of all material market announcements  promptly after they are released to the  market. Management’s report on internal control  over financial reporting Management is responsible for establishing  and maintaining adequate internal controls  over financial reporting. These controls,  designed under the supervision of the Chief  Executive and Chief Financial Officer,  provide reasonable assurance regarding  the reliability of the Group’s financial  reporting and the preparation and  presentation of financial statements for  external reporting purposes, in accordance  with International Financial Reporting  Standards (IFRS) as defined on page 154. The Group’s internal controls over financial  reporting include policies and procedures  designed to ensure the maintenance of  records that: – accurately and fairly reflect transactions  and dispositions of assets, – provide reasonable assurances that  transactions are recorded as necessary,  enabling the preparation of financial  statements in accordance with IFRS, and  that receipts and expenditures are made  with the authorisation of management and  Directors of each of the companies, and – provide reasonable assurance regarding  the prevention or timely detection of  unauthorised acquisition, use or  disposition of the Group’s assets that  could have a material effect on its  financial statements. Due to inherent limitations, internal controls  over financial reporting cannot provide  absolute assurance. Similarly, these controls  may not prevent or detect all misstatements,  whether caused by error or fraud, within each  of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited. There were no changes to internal controls  over financial reporting during the relevant  period that have materially affected, or were  reasonably likely to materially affect, the  internal control over financial reporting of  Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited. Management’s evaluation of the  effectiveness of the company’s internal  controls over financial reporting was based  on criteria established in the Internal  Control-Integrated Framework (2013),  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Following this evaluation, management  concluded that our internal controls over  financial reporting were effective as at  31 December 2024. Application of and compliance with  governance codes and standards  Our shares are listed on both the Australian  Securities Exchange (ASX) and the London  Stock Exchange (LSE), We comply with the: London Stock Exchange – UK Corporate  Governance Code (2018 version) (the UK  Code) and the Australian Securities  Exchange – ASX Corporate Governance  Council’s Corporate Governance Principles  and Recommendations (4th edition) (the  ASX Principles). In addition, as a foreign private issuer (FPI)  with American depositary receipts (ADRs)  listed on the New York Stock Exchange  (NYSE), we report any significant corporate  governance differences from the NYSE  listing standards (NYSE Standards) followed  by US companies.  Statement of compliance with the UK  Code and ASX Principles Throughout 2024, and as at the date of this  report, the Group has complied with all the   Principles of the UK Code and the ASX  Principles, and all the relevant provisions.  For the purposes of ASX Listing Rule 4.10.3  and the ASX Principles, pages 100-118 and  146-152 of this report form our “Corporate  Governance Statement”. This statement is  current as at 19 February 2025, unless  otherwise indicated, and has been approved  by the Board. Further information on our  corporate governance framework and  practices is available at riotinto.com/ corporategovernance. Directors’ report  |  Additional statutory disclosure  Annual Report 2024 151 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 154 ===== Difference from NYSE Standards We consider that our practices are broadly  consistent with the NYSE Standards, There are  the following exceptions where the literal  requirements of the NYSE Standards are not  met due to differences in corporate  governance between the US, UK and Australia: – The NYSE Standards state that US  companies must have a nominating/ corporate governance committee which,  in addition to identifying individuals  qualified to become board members,  develops and recommends to the  Board a set of corporate governance  principles applicable to the company.  Our Nominations Committee does not  develop corporate governance  principles for the Board’s approval. The  Board itself develops such principles. – Under US securities law and the NYSE  Standards, the company is required  to have an audit committee that is  directly responsible for the appointment,  compensation, retention and oversight of  the work of external auditors. While our  Audit & Risk Committee makes  recommendations to the Board on these  matters, and is subject to legal and  regulatory requirements on oversight of  audit tenders, the ultimate responsibility  for the appointment and retention of the  external auditors of Rio Tinto rests with  the shareholders. – Under US securities law and the NYSE  Standards, an audit committee is  required to establish procedures for the  receipt, retention and treatment of  complaints regarding accounting,  internal accounting controls and audit  matters. The whistleblowing program  (myVoice) enables employees to raise  any concerns confidentially or  anonymously. The Board has  responsibility to ensure that the program  is in place and to review the reports  arising from its operations. Directors’ declaration The Directors’ statement of responsibilities  in relation to the Group’s financial  statements is set out on page 245. Non-audit services and auditor  independence Details of the non-audit services and a  statement of independence regarding the  provision of non-audit services undertaken  by our external auditor, including the  amounts paid for non-audit services, are set  out on page 115 of the Directors’ report. A copy of the Auditor’s Independence  Declaration as required under section 307C  of the Corporations Act 2001 is set out on  page .265. Going concern The Directors, having made appropriate  enquiries, have satisfied themselves that it is  appropriate to adopt the going concern  basis of accounting in preparing the  financial statements. Additionally, the  Directors have considered longer-term  viability, as described in their statement on  page 90. 2025 annual general meetings The 2025 AGMs will be held on 3 April 2025  in London, UK and 1 May 2025 in Perth,  Australia. Separate notices of the 2025  AGMs will be produced for the  shareholders of each company.

Annual Report 2024 153 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 156 ===== About Rio Tinto   In 1995, Rio Tinto plc, incorporated in the UK and listed on the  London and New York Stock Exchanges, and Rio Tinto Limited,  incorporated in Australia and listed on the Australian Securities  Exchange, formed a dual-listed companies structure (DLC). Under  the DLC, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited are viewed as a single  economic enterprise, with common boards of directors, and the  shareholders of both companies have a common economic interest  in the DLC. For further information on the DLC structure, see page  325. International Financial Reporting Standards-compliant  consolidated financial statements of the Rio Tinto Group are  prepared on this basis, with the interests of shareholders of both  companies presented as the equity interests of shareholders in the  Rio Tinto Group. This is in accordance with the principles and  requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards and in  accordance with an order, under section 340 of the Australian  Corporations Act 2001, issued by the Australian Securities and  Investments Commission (ASIC) on 11 July 2024 (ASIC class order).  For further details of the ASIC class order relief, see page 244. Rio Tinto’s business is finding, mining, and processing mineral  resources. Major products are iron ore, aluminium, copper, industrial  minerals (borates, titanium dioxide and salt) and diamonds. Activities  span the world and are strongly represented in Australia and North  America, with significant businesses in Asia, Europe, Africa and  South America. Rio Tinto plc’s registered office is at 6 St James’s Square, London  SW1Y 4AD, UK. Rio Tinto Limited’s registered office is at Level 43,  120 Collins Street, Melbourne VIC 3000, Australia. About the presentation of our consolidated financial  statements  All financial statement values are presented in US dollars (USD) and  rounded to the nearest million (US$m), unless otherwise stated.  Where applicable, comparatives have been adjusted to measure or  present them on the same basis as current-year figures. Our financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024  were authorised for issue in accordance with a Directors’ resolution  on 19 February 2025.  a.  The basis of preparation The financial information included in the financial statements for the  year ended 31 December 2024, and for the related comparative  periods, has been prepared: – under the historical cost convention, as modified by the  revaluation of certain financial instruments, the impact of fair  value hedge accounting on the hedged items and the  accounting for post-employment assets and obligations – on a going concern basis, management has prepared detailed  cash flow forecasts for at least 12 months and has updated life- of-mine plan models with longer-term cash flow projections,  which demonstrate that we will have sufficient cash, other liquid  resources and undrawn credit facilities to enable us to meet our  obligations as they fall due – to meet UK-adopted international accounting standards, applicable  UK law (Companies Act 2006) and Australian law (Australian  Corporations Act 2001) as amended by the ASIC class order – to meet international accounting standards as issued by the  International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and  interpretations issued from time to time by the IFRS Interpretations  Committee (IFRS IC), which are mandatory at 31 December 2024. The above accounting standards and interpretations are collectively  referred to as “IFRS” in this report and contain the principles we use  to create our accounting policies. Where necessary, adjustments  are made to the locally reported assets, liabilities, and results of  subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates to align their  accounting policies with ours for consistent reporting. b. The basis of consolidation The financial statements consolidate the accounts of Rio Tinto plc  and Rio Tinto Limited (together “the Companies”) and their  respective subsidiaries (together “the Rio Tinto Group”, “the Group”,  “we”, “our”) and include the Group’s share of joint arrangements and  associates. We consolidate subsidiaries where either of the companies controls  the entity. Control exists where either of the companies has: power  over the entities, that is, existing rights that give it the current ability  to direct the relevant activities of the entities (those that  significantly affect the companies’ returns); exposure, or rights, to  variable returns from its involvement with the entities; and the ability  to use its power to affect those returns. A list of principal  subsidiaries is shown in note 30.  A joint arrangement is an arrangement in which 2 or more parties have  joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of  control such that decisions about the relevant activities of the  arrangement (those that significantly affect the companies’ returns)  require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. We have  2 types of joint arrangements: joint operations (JOs) and joint ventures  (JVs). A JO is a joint arrangement in which the parties that share joint  control have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities  relating to the arrangement. This includes situations where the parties  benefit from the joint activity through a share of the output, rather  than by receiving a share of the results of trading. For our JOs, we  recognise: our share of assets and liabilities; revenue from the sale of  our share of the output and our share of any revenue generated from  the sale of the output by the JO; and its share of expenses. All such  amounts are measured in accordance with the terms of the  arrangement, which is usually in proportion to our interest in the JO.  These amounts are recorded in our financial statements on the  appropriate lines. Our principal JOs are shown in note 31. A JV is a  joint arrangement in which the parties that share joint control have  rights to the net assets of the arrangement. JVs are accounted for  using the equity accounting method. An associate is an entity over which we have significant influence.  Significant influence is presumed to exist where there is neither  control nor joint control and the Group has over 20% of the voting  rights, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that this is not the  case. Significant influence can arise where we hold less than 20% of  the voting rights if we have the power to participate in the financial  and operating policy decisions affecting the entity. It also includes  situations of collective control.  We use the term “equity accounted units” (EAUs) to refer to  associates and JVs collectively. Under the equity accounting  method, the investment is recorded initially at cost to the Group,  including any goodwill on acquisition. In subsequent periods, the  carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to reflect the Group’s  share of the EAUs’ retained post-acquisition profit or loss and other  comprehensive income. Our principal JVs and associates are shown  in note 32.  In some cases, we participate in unincorporated arrangements and  have rights to our share of the assets and obligations for our share  of the liabilities of the arrangement rather than a right to a net  return, but we do not share joint control. In such cases, we account  for these arrangements in the same way as our joint operations, with  all such amounts measured in accordance with the terms of the  arrangement, which is usually in proportion to our interest in the  arrangement.  All intragroup transactions and balances are eliminated  on consolidation. Financial statements  Annual Report 2024 154 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 157 ===== c. Materiality Our Directors consider information to be material if correcting a misstatement, omission or obscuring could, in the light of surrounding  circumstances, reasonably be expected to change the judgement of a reasonable person relying on the financial statements. The Group  considers both quantitative and qualitative factors in determining whether information is material; the concept of materiality is therefore not  driven purely by numerical values.  When considering the potential materiality of information, management makes an initial quantitative assessment using thresholds based on  estimates of profit before taxation; for the year ended 31 December 2024 the quantitative threshold was US$700 million. However, other  considerations can result in a determination that lower values are material or, occasionally, that higher values are immaterial. These  considerations include whether a misstatement, omission or obscuring: masks a change or trend in key performance indicators; causes  reported key metrics to change from a positive to a negative value or vice versa; affects compliance with regulatory requirements or other  contractual requirements; could result in an increase to management’s compensation; or might conceal an unlawful transaction.  In assessing materiality, management also applies judgement based on its understanding of the business and its internal and external  financial statement users. The assessment will consider user expectations of numerical and narrative reporting. Sources used in making this  assessment would include, for example: published analyst consensus measures, experience gained in formal and informal dialogue with users  (including regulatory correspondence), and peer group benchmarking. d. Summary of key judgements or other relevant judgements made in applying the accounting policies  The preparation of the financial statements requires management to use judgement in applying accounting policies and in making critical  accounting estimates.  These judgements and estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, having regard to  previous experience, but actual results may differ materially from the amounts included in the financial statements. Areas of judgement in the  application of accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements and key  sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and  liabilities within the next financial year are noted below. Further information is contained in the notes to the financial statements. Summarised below are the key judgements that we have taken in the application of the Group’s accounting policies for 2024 and how they  compare to the prior year. Taking a different judgement over these matters could lead to a material impact on the 2024 financial statements.  More detail on the judgement can be found in the respective notes.  Key judgements 2024 2023 Context Indicators of impairment and impairment  reversals (note 4) a a Various cash-generating units of the Group that have been impaired or  tested for impairment in previous years, are at higher risk of impairment  charge or reversal in the future due to carrying value and recoverable  amounts being similar.  Whilst we monitor all assets for impairment, these  assets are monitored more closely for indicators of further impairment or  impairment reversal as such adjustments would likely be material to our  results. Deferral of stripping costs (note 13) a a The deferral of stripping costs is a key judgement in open-pit mining  operations as it impacts the amortisation base for these costs, calculated on  a units of production basis; this involves determining whether multiple pits  are considered separate or integrated operations, which in turn influences  the classification of stripping activities as pre-production or production  phase. This judgement relies on various factors that are based on the unique  characteristics and circumstances of each mine. Estimation of asset lives (note 13) a a The useful lives of major assets are often linked to the life of the orebody  they relate to, which is in turn based on the life-of-mine plan. Where the  major assets are not dependent on the life of a related orebody,  management applies judgement in estimating the remaining service potential  of long-lived assets. The accuracy of estimating these useful lives is essential  for determining the appropriate allocation of costs over time, reflecting the  consumption of the asset’s economic benefits.  Close-down, restoration and  environmental obligations (note 14) a a Significant judgement is required to assess the possible extent of closure  rehabilitation work needed to fulfil the Group’s legal, statutory, and  constructive obligations, along with other commitments to stakeholders.  This involves leveraging our experience in evaluating available options and  techniques to meet these obligations, associated costs and their likely timing  and, crucially, determining when that estimate is sufficiently reliable to make  or adjust a closure provision. Financial statements  Annual Report 2024 155 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 158 ===== e. Key sources of estimation uncertainty We define key sources of estimation uncertainty as accounting estimates that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the  carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. We summarise below the most significant items and the rationale for  their identification. Relevant sensitivities are included within the indicated financial statement notes. Key accounting estimates 2024 2023 Context Estimation of the  close-down, restoration  and environmental cost  obligations (note 14) a a Close-down, restoration and environmental obligations are based on cash flow projections derived  from studies that incorporate planned rehabilitation activities, cost estimates and discounting for the  time value. Closure studies are performed to a rolling schedule with increased frequency and  engineering accuracy for sites approaching end of life. Information from these studies can result in a  material change to the associated provisions. During the year, the most significant closure provision  updates related to a number of sites across the Pilbara. The provisions are based on reforecast cash  flows, these are subject to further study which could result in material adjustment in the near term. Estimation of obligations  for post-employment costs  (note 28) a a The value of the Group’s obligations for post-employment benefits is dependent on the amount of  benefits that are expected to be paid out, discounted to the balance sheet date. There is significant  estimation uncertainty pertaining to the most significant assumptions used in accounting for pension  plans, namely the discount rate, the long-term inflation rate and mortality rates. Renewable power  purchase agreements  accounted for as  derivatives (note 24) a 0 A discounted cash flow methodology is used to determine the fair value of the derivative.  Key inputs into the valuation model include forward electricity price curves, which are used to  forecast future floating cash flows, estimated electricity generation and credit-adjusted  discount rates. Long-term forward electricity prices are a source of a significant estimation  uncertainty as they are not readily available and may be impacted by renewable market  developments, which are presently unknown. f. Currency Other relevant judgements - identification of functional currency We present our financial statements in USD, as that presentation currency most reliably reflects the global business performance of the  Group as a whole.   The functional currency for each subsidiary, unincorporated arrangement, joint operation and equity accounted unit is the currency of  the primary economic environment in which it operates. For businesses that reside in developed economies, the functional currency is  generally the currency of the country in which it operates because of the dominance of locally incurred costs. If the business resides in  an emerging economy, the USD is generally identified to be the functional currency as a higher proportion of costs, particularly imported  goods and services, are agreed and paid in USD, in common with other international investors. Determination of functional currency  involves judgement, and other companies may make different judgements based on similar facts.  The determination of functional currency affects the measurement of non-current assets included in the balance sheet and, as a consequence,  the depreciation and amortisation of those assets included in the income statement. It also impacts exchange gains and losses included in the  income statement and in equity. We also apply judgement in determining whether settlement of certain intragroup loans is neither planned nor  likely in the foreseeable future and, therefore, whether the associated exchange gains and losses can be taken to equity. During 2024, A$15,717  million (2023: A$15,102 million) of intragroup loans continued to meet these criteria; associated exchange gains and losses are taken to equity. On consolidation, income statement items for each entity are translated from the functional currency into USD at the full-year average rate  of exchange, except for material one-off transactions, which are translated at the rate prevailing on the transaction date. Balance sheet  items are translated into USD at period-end exchange rates. Exchange differences arising on the translation of the net assets of entities with functional currencies other than USD are recognised  directly in the currency translation reserve. These translation differences are shown in the statement of comprehensive income, with the  exception of the translation adjustment relating to Rio Tinto Limited’s share capital, which is shown in the statement of changes in equity.  Where an intragroup balance is, in substance, part of the Group’s net investment in an entity, exchange gains and losses on that balance are  taken to the currency translation reserve.   Except as noted above, or where exchange differences are deferred as part of a cash flow hedge, all other differences are charged or  credited to the income statement in the year in which they arise.  The principal exchange rates used in the preparation of the financial statements were:  Full-year average Year-end One unit of local currency buys the following number of USD 2024 2023 2022 2024 2023 2022 Pound sterling   1.28   1.24   1.24   1.25   1.28   1.21  Australian dollar   0.66   0.66   0.69   0.62   0.69   0.68  Canadian dollar   0.73   0.74   0.77   0.70   0.76   0.74  Euro   1.08   1.08   1.05   1.04   1.11   1.07  South African rand   0.055   0.054   0.061   0.053   0.054   0.059  Financial statements  Annual Report 2024 156 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 159 ===== g. Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources  A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid  material of economic interest in or on the Earth’s crust in such form,  grade (or quality), and quantity that there are reasonable prospects  for eventual economic extraction. An Ore Reserve is the  economically mineable part of a measured or indicated Mineral  Resource.  The estimation of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources requires  judgement to interpret available geological data and subsequently  to select an appropriate mining method and then to establish an  extraction schedule. At least annually, the Competent Persons of  the Group (according to the Australasian Code for Reporting of  Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (the  “JORC Code”)), estimate Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources using  assumptions such as: – available geological data – expected future commodity prices and demand – exchange rates – production costs – transport costs – close-down and restoration costs – recovery rates – discount rates – renewal of mining licences. With regard to our future commodity price assumptions, to  calculate our Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources for our filing on  the Australian Securities Exchange and London Stock Exchange, we  use prices generated by our Strategy and Economics team (refer to  the our 2025 Climate Action Plan section for further details about  our pricing methodology). For our Annual Report on Form 20-F,  filed with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), we use  consensus price or historical pricing and comply with subpart 1300  of Regulation S-K (SK-1300), instead of with the JORC Code. We use judgement as to when to include Mineral Resources in  accounting estimates, for example, the use of Mineral Resources in  our depreciation policy as described in note 13 and in the  determination of the date of closure as described in note 14.  There are many uncertainties in the estimation process and  assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may change  significantly when new information becomes available. New  geological or economic data or unforeseen operational issues may  change estimates of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources. This  could cause material adjustments in our financial statements to: – depreciation and amortisation rates – carrying values of intangible assets and property, plant and  equipment – deferred stripping costs – provisions for close-down and restoration costs – recovery of deferred tax assets.  The unaudited statement of Ore Reserves is included on pages 278  to 289 and of Mineral Resources on pages 290 to 300. h. Impact of climate change on the Group   The impacts of climate change and the execution of our climate  change strategy on our financial statements are discussed below.  Strategy and approach to climate change In 2021, we put the low-carbon transition at the heart of our  business strategy, setting a clear pathway to deliver long-term value  as well as ambitious targets to decarbonise our business.    Our target to reduce our net Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 15% by  2025, 50% by 2030 and to reach net zero emissions by 2050, all  relative to our 2018 equity baseline, remains unchanged.  We have  now reduced gross operational emissions by 14% below our 2018  levels; and have a pipeline of projects and committed investments  that support our 2030 target. Our gross emissions reductions are  expected to be at least 40% by 2030, and the use of carbon credits  towards our target will be limited to 10% of our 2018 baseline. While  there is no universal standard for determining the alignment of  targets with the Paris Agreement goals, we concluded that our  Scope 1 and 2 target for 2030 was aligned with efforts to limit  warming to 1.5°C when we set it in 2021. To reduce our  decarbonisation footprint we focus on renewable electricity,  transitioning from diesel and our processing emissions. Nature- based solutions (NbS) and carbon credits complement our  decarbonisation activities. To accelerate these activities, in 2023 we  established the Rio Tinto Energy and Climate Team led by our Chief  Decarbonisation Officer. To deliver our decarbonisation target, we  estimate that we will require around US$5 billion to US$6 billion in  capital investment between 2022 to 2030, unchanged from the  prior year. This includes voluntary carbon credits and investment in  NbS projects but excludes the cost of carbon credits bought for  compliance purposes. Our approach to addressing Scope 3 emissions is to engage with  our customers on climate change and work with them to develop  and scale up the technologies to decarbonise steel and aluminium  production. Our forecast growth capital expenditure captures new growth  opportunities with a focus on materials that are expected to see  strong demand growth from the low-carbon transition. This includes  our investments in Simandou, Matalco, Rincon, Oyu Tolgoi and the  recent agreement to acquire Arcadium Lithium plc. Our budget for  central greenfield exploration mainly focuses on copper with a  growing battery materials program. Decarbonisation investment is derived from the Group’s capital  allocation framework and aligned to our 2025 and 2030 Scope 1  and 2 emissions targets. Decarbonisation investment decisions are  made under a dedicated evaluation framework, which includes  consideration of the value of the investment and its impact on the  cost base, the level of abatement, the maturity of the technology,  the competitiveness of the asset and its policy context, and  alternative options on the pathway to net zero. Projects are also  assessed against our approach to a just transition, with  consideration of the impact on employees, local communities, and  industry.   Further details on our approach and progress are provided in the  front half of this Annual Report: our Climate Action Plan on pages 41  to 75.  Financial statements  Annual Report 2024 157 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 160 ===== Scenarios We use scenarios to identify and assess climate-related risks and  opportunities that may affect our business in the medium to long  term. We do not undertake climate modelling ourselves, rather we  determine the approximate temperature outcomes in 2100 by  comparing the emissions pathways to 2050 in each of our  scenarios with the Shared Socio-Economic Pathways set out in the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment  Report. We also consider the carbon budgets associated with  different temperature outcomes. Our scenario approach is reviewed  every year as part of our Group strategy engagement with the  Board. This year, we updated the scenario framework used to  assess the resilience of our business under different transition- related scenarios.  Our Conviction scenario is now our central case.  In the prior year,  our central case comprised the Competitive Leadership and  Fragmented Leadership scenarios. The Conviction scenario  underlies strategic planning and portfolio investment decisions  across the Group, is used in commodity price forecasts, valuation  models, reserves and resources determination, and in determining  estimates for assets and liabilities in our financial statements. In the  prior year, our central case comprised the Competitive Leadership  and Fragmented Leadership scenarios. In this scenario, countries  will decarbonise at a moderate pace, real gross domestic product  (GDP) grows at 2.5% between 2023-2050, but energy intensity of  GDP reduces approximately 2.7% per year due to sectoral shifts  and greater efficiency. In Conviction, climate policies become more  ambitious and effective over time resulting in a temperature rise of  2.1°C in 2100.   Resilience scenario, which limits temperature rises to around 2.5°C  by 2100, is a sensitivity analysis that is designed to test our annual  plan and investment proposals. Weaker governance, declining  global trade, and lower economic growth lead to less effective  climate action. Real GDP growth only averages 1.6% between 2023  and 2050.  Neither of the Conviction or Resilience scenarios above are  consistent with the expectation of climate policies required to  accelerate the global transition to meet the stretch goal of the Paris  Agreement. Despite global agreements on climate change reached in  Glasgow and Dubai, emissions today continue to rise, making the 1.5°C  goal of the Paris Agreement unlikely to be achieved. As our operational  emissions targets are in line with 1.5°C, so too are our decarbonisation  investment decisions. In 2022, we developed a Paris-aligned scenario,  referred to as the Aspirational Leadership scenario. The Aspirational  Leadership scenario reflects a world of high growth, significant  social change and accelerated climate action. The Aspirational  Leadership scenario is a commodity sales price and carbon cost  sensitivity, with all other inputs remaining equal to our central case.  It is built by design to reach net zero emissions globally by 2050  and helps us better understand the pathways to meet the Paris  Agreement goal, and what this could mean for our business. We do  not use the Aspirational Leadership scenario in our broader strategic  or investment decision-making.     Importantly, none of the above scenarios are considered a definitive  representation for our assessment of the future impact of climate  change on the Group. To assess transition risk, we use market  analysis for our short-term outlook, and our Conviction and  Resilience scenarios for our medium- to long-term assessment. For  physical risks, we use an intermediate and high emissions scenario.  Scenario modelling has inherent limitations and, by its nature, allows  a range of possible outcomes to be considered where it is  impossible to predict which outcome is likely. In addition, as our macroeconomic modelling involves a range of  variables, isolating and measuring the impact of specific climate  risks and opportunities is challenging. We do not publish the  commodity price forecasts associated with these scenarios, as to  do so would weaken our position in commercial negotiations and  might give rise to concerns from other market participants. Low-carbon transition risks and opportunities, financial resilience  of our portfolio  The low-carbon transition is at the heart of our strategy. This  mitigates risks associated with stricter carbon regulations and  changing consumer preferences and positions us to capitalise on  the growing demand for transition materials. With higher GDP  growth and a faster low-carbon transition, our economic  performance is stronger in Conviction than in Resilience. Higher  carbon penalties and the potential impact on demand for mid and  lower grade iron ore result in weaker economic performance in  Aspirational Leadership than in Conviction. Overall, the economic  performance of our portfolio would be stronger in scenarios with  higher GDP growth and proactive climate action, and is resilient  under scenarios aligned with 1.5°C, 2.1°C and 2.5°C outcomes.   We carefully monitor and manage transition risks linked to our  operational Scope 1 and 2 emissions and value-chain Scope 3  emissions. In particular, we expect the decarbonisation of our assets  to benefit from the implementation of new technologies. The pace  of technological development is uncertain, which could delay or  increase the cost of our decarbonisation efforts. Physical risk impacts In 2022, we launched the Physical Resilience Program across the  Group, starting with the asset-level resilience assessment in the  Pilbara and Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean. We continue to make progress  in a Group-wide, top-down assessment to further understand the  risks and opportunities associated with physical climate change and  to quantify any financial impacts, in addition to the site-specific,  bottom-up assessments, which will continue in the foreseeable  future.  Asset-level resilience assessments conducted to date as  part of a broader multi-year program, as well as our ongoing review  processes, including impairment assessments, have not identified  any material accounting impacts to date. For example, no write-offs  were necessary in the Pilbara, where certain infrastructure assets,  such as transmission lines, that have reached the end of their  natural lives are being replaced with climate-resilient infrastructure.   In 2024, we continued to make progress on the climate-resilience  assessment process for our tailings storage facilities, enhanced our  water risk management, and operationalised analytics that provide  real-time natural-hazard monitoring for 50% of our supply chain. In addition, we do not foresee the renewal of our contractual water  rights in Canada that have been classified as indefinite-lived  intangible assets to be at risk from climate change (note 12).  Further, closure planning considers future climate change  projections at each step of the process to support safe and  appropriate final landform design. Financial statements  Annual Report 2024 158 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 161 ===== NbS and carbon credits While prioritising emissions reductions at our operations, we are  also investing in high-integrity NbS in the regions where we operate  that can bring benefits to people, nature and climate. We will  voluntarily retire associated carbon credits to complement the  decarbonisation investment, but will limit the use of voluntary and  compliance offsets towards our 2030 climate target to up to 10% of  our 2018 baseline emissions. We source carbon credits in three  ways: we develop new projects, invest in and scale up existing  projects, and source high-quality carbon credits through spot  carbon credit purchases and long-term offtake agreements. This will  complement our abatement project portfolio and support our  compliance with carbon pricing regulation such as the Safeguard  Mechanism in Australia. In 2024, we finalised offtake agreements for  high-quality human-induced regeneration (HIR), as well as with  savanna fire management project developers, and progressed  feasibility studies on other projects.    In 2024, we purchased US$50 million (2023: US$61 million) of  carbon credits. They have been acquired for our own use and are  accounted for as intangible assets (note 12).  Accounting impacts from executing our strategy  Global decarbonisation and the world’s energy transition continue  to evolve, with the potential to materially impact our future financial  results as our significant accounting judgements and key estimates  are updated to reflect prevailing circumstances. In response,  carrying values of assets and liabilities could be materially affected  in future periods. Our current strategy and approach to  decarbonise our operations and achieve our Scope 1 and 2  emissions targets are considered in our significant judgements and  key estimates reflected in these financial results. Progressing our strategy to grow in materials needed for the low- carbon transition   As part of our strategy to grow in materials essential for the energy  transition, we approved “notice to proceed” for the Simandou high- grade iron ore project in Guinea and the Rincon lithium project in  Argentina (note 12). We have also continued to invest in our copper  portfolio. These projects follow our existing accounting policies on  undeveloped properties and cost capitalisation. In 2024 we also  announced a definitive agreement to acquire Arcadium Lithium plc  (note 5). In 2023, we entered into an agreement with Giampaolo Group to  form the Matalco joint venture, equity accounted, to meet a growing  demand for recycled aluminium  solutions, and invested in a copper  project known as Nuevo Cobre, accounted for as an investment in a  partially owned subsidiary (note 5).  Decarbonising our portfolio  As part of our decarbonisation programs, we invested  US$283 million (2023: US$191 million) comprising capital projects,  investments and carbon credits referred to above, capitalised on  balance sheet. Our operating expenditure on Scope 1, 2 and 3  energy efficient initiatives and research and development (R&D)  costs, inclusive of our equity share of R&D related to ELYSISTM, was  US$306 million (2023: US$234 million), recognised in the income  statement (note 7). Our capital commitments at the end of 2024  relating to decarbonisation totalled US$114 million (2023:  US$123 million) and included the Amrun renewable PPA classifed as  a lease not yet commenced (note 37). We invested US$89 million (2023: US$36 million) in entities  specialising in decarbonisation and related technology, accounted  for as financial assets, such as the Silva Carbon Origination Fund, a  developer of high integrity Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs)  and I-Pulse, a developer of decarbonisation applications. In 2023, this  included an investment in Australian Integrated Carbon (AIC), a  leading developer of high-quality carbon credits, which is an equity  accounted unit.  Given the significant investments we are making to abate our carbon  emissions, we have considered the potential for asset obsolescence,  with a particular focus on our Pilbara operations where we are building  our own renewable assets and are prioritising investment in  renewables to switch away from natural gas power generation. No  material changes to useful economic lives have been identified in the  current year as the assets are expected to be required for the  transition (note 13). As the renewable projects progress, it is possible  that such adjustments may be identified in the future.  Large-scale renewable power purchase agreements (PPAs) require  judgement to determine the appropriate accounting treatment and  may result in a lease, a derivative or an executory contract  depending on contractual terms (refer to note 21 for further  information on significant judgements in lease assessment). The  renewable solar and wind PPAs at Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) are  accounted for on an accrual basis as energy is produced, while the  renewable offtake arrangements at QIT Madagascar Minerals  (QMM) and Amrun are leases. As part of the program to develop renewable energy solutions for  our Queensland aluminium assets, we entered into 2 long-term  renewable 2.2GW PPAs: the Upper Calliope solar farm and the   Bungaban wind farm, at the end of 2023 and in 2024 respectively,  to buy renewable electricity and associated green products to be  generated in the future. In 2024, our New Zealand Aluminium  Smelters signed long-term PPAs with electricity generators for a  total of 572MW of hydro electricity. We also signed the Monte  Cristo Wind PPA in the US, which will account for about 20% of  Kennecott Scope 2 emissions abatement. These contracts are  recorded as level 3 financial derivatives, with net unrealised losses  of US$111 million recognised in the current year (2023: US$nil) (note  24 (iv)). These derivatives require complex measurement over the  contract’s term, with inputs such as unobservable long-term energy  prices being key sources of estimation of uncertainty (note e). No adjustments to useful lives of the existing fleet have been identified  to date as a result of planned mining fleet electrification in the Pilbara.  The solutions are still in development or pilot stages and the gradual  fleet replacement is intended to be part of the normal lifecycle renewal  of trucks. Depending on technological development, which is highly  uncertain, this could lead to accelerated depreciation in the future.  Similarly, our target to have net zero vessels in our portfolio by 2030  has not given rise to accounting adjustments to date, as the  replacement is planned as part of the lifecycle renewal. The  expenditure on our own carbon abatement projects and technology  advancements follows existing accounting policies on cost  capitalisation, research and development costs.  Financial statements  Annual Report 2024 159 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 162 ===== Impairment - sensitivities to climate change In our impairment review process we consider the risks associated  with climate change. The Gladstone alumina refineries are responsible for more than half  of our Scope 1 carbon dioxide emissions in Australia and therefore  have been a key focus as we evaluate options to decarbonise our  assets. In 2023, we recorded an impairment of Queensland Alumina  Limited (QAL) refinery with the recoverable amount largely  dependent upon the double digestion project, which was at the pre- feasibility study stage of project evaluation. This major capital  project improves the energy efficiency of the alumina production  process and significantly reduces carbon emissions. In 2024,  continued studies for this project have indicated an increased  capital cost compared with our previous assumption and therefore  we recognised further impairment and provided a sensitivity to the  cost of carbon credits (note 4). Following the impairment in 2022,  we continue to evaluate lower emission power solutions for the  Boyne smelter that could extend its life to at least 2040. In such  circumstances, the net present value of the forecast future cash  flows could support the reversal of past impairments. As noted above, we anticipate increased demand for copper in the  low-carbon transition. Whilst we have tested Rio Tinto Kennecott  cash-generating unit for impairment utilising our Conviction price  assumptions, that are not aligned with the goals of the Paris  Agreement, we have also provided a sensitivity using our Paris- aligned Aspirational Leadership scenario (note 4). Under the Aspirational Leadership scenario, which is not used in the  preparation of these financial statements, nor for budgeting  purposes, the economic performance of copper and aluminium is  expected to be stronger under supply and demand forward-pricing  curves, which we believe will be consistent with the Paris  Agreement. It is possible therefore, under certain conditions, that  historical impairments associated with these assets could reverse.     In the Aspirational Leadership scenario, the prices for lower-grade  iron ore are supported in the medium term by an assumed  underlying increase in GDP-driven demand. However, in the longer  term, we assume the pricing for lower-grade iron ore to be weaker  than in our Conviction scenario and will depend on the  development of low-carbon steel technology, the pace of which is  uncertain, but is expected to be offset by higher prices for higher- grade iron ore. As was the case in the prior year, this is very unlikely  to give rise to impairment triggers in the short- to medium-term,  due to the high returns on capital employed in the Pilbara and the  slow deployment of low-carbon steel technology. Use of Paris-aligned accounting Forecast commodity prices, including carbon prices, incorporated  into our Conviction scenario are used to inform critical accounting  estimates included as inputs to impairment testing, estimation of  remaining economic life for units of production depreciation and  discounting closure and rehabilitation provisions. These prices  represent our best estimate of actual market outcomes based on  the range of future economic conditions regarding matters largely  outside our control, as required by IFRS. As the Conviction scenario  does not represent the Group’s view of the goals of the Paris  Agreement, our commodity price assumptions used in accounting  estimates are not consistent with the expectation of climate policies  required to accelerate the global transition to meet the goals of the  Paris Agreement. As described above, we use our Aspirational  Leadership scenario to help us better understand the pathways to  meet the Paris Agreement goal, and what this could mean for our  business. Closure dates and cost of closure are also sensitive to climate  assumptions, including precipitation rates, but no material changes  have been identified in the year specific to climate change that  would require a material revision to the provisions in 2024. For  those commodities with higher forward price curves under the  Aspirational Leadership scenario, it may be economical to mine  lower mineral grades, which could result in the conversion of  additional Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves and therefore longer  dated closure. We completed the divestments of our coal businesses in 2018 and  no longer mine coal, but retained a contingent royalty income from  these divestments. Recent favourable coal prices exceeded  contractual benchmark levels and resulted in the cash royalty  receipt of US$45 million during 2024 (2023: US$38 million). We also  carry royalty receivables of US$252 million on our balance sheet at  31 December 2024 (2023: US$214 million), measured at fair value  (note 24). The fair value of this balance may be adversely impacted  in the future by a faster pace of transition to a low-carbon  economy, but this impact is not expected to be material. Overall, based on the Aspirational Leadership scenario pricing  outcomes, and with all other assumptions remaining consistent with  those applied to our 2024 financial statements, we do not currently  envisage a material adverse impact of the 1.5°C Paris-aligned  sensitivity on asset carrying values, remaining useful life, or closure  and rehabilitation provisions for the Group. It is possible that other  factors may arise in the future, which are not known today, that may  impact this assessment.

New standards issued and effective in the current year Our financial statements have been prepared on the basis of  accounting policies consistent with those applied in the financial  statements for the year ended 31 December 2023, except for the  accounting requirements set out below, effective as at 1 January 2024.  Classification of liabilities as current or non-current liabilities with  covenants (Amendments to IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial  Statements”) We adopted the Amendments to IAS 1 which specify the  requirements for classifying liabilities as either current or  non-current. The amendments clarify that a right to defer the  settlement must exist at the end of the reporting period and that  classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an entity will  exercise its deferral right. In addition, a requirement has been  introduced whereby an entity must disclose when a liability arising  from a loan agreement is classified as non-current and the entity’s  right to defer settlement is contingent on compliance with future  covenants within 12 months. The amendments do not have a  material impact on the Group.  Refer to note 20 for additional disclosures made in relation to  Amendments to IAS 1. Lease liability in a sale and leaseback (Amendments to IFRS 16  “Leases”) We adopted the Amendments to IFRS 16 which specify the  requirements that a seller-lessee uses in measuring the lease liability  arising in a sale and leaseback transaction. The amendments do not  have an impact on the Group. Supplier finance arrangements (Amendments to IAS 7 “Statement  of Cash Flows” and IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures”) We adopted the Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 which clarify the  characteristics of supplier finance arrangements and require  additional disclosure of such arrangements. The amendments  respond to the investors’ need for more information about supplier  finance arrangements to be able to assess how these arrangements  affect an entity’s liabilities, cash flows and liquidity risk. As a result of  the adoption of the amendments, we provided new disclosures for  liabilities under supplier finance arrangements as well as the  associated cash flows in note 18 and note 24 (i). These amendments  did not have a material impact on the amounts recognised in prior  and the current period.   The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s  (OECD) Pillar Two Rules For the year ended 31 December 2023, we adopted the  amendments to IAS 12, issued in May 2023, which provide a  temporary mandatory exception from the requirement to recognise  and disclose information on deferred tax assets and liabilities  related to enacted or substantively enacted law that implements  Pillar Two income taxes. Pillar Two was substantively enacted in the  United Kingdom on 20 June 2023, with application from 1 January  2024. Exposure to additional taxation under Pillar Two is immaterial  to the Group (note 10).  j. Reconciliation with Australian Accounting Standards  Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with  IFRS, as defined in the “Basis of preparation” section on page 154,  which differs in certain respects from the version of IFRS that is  applicable in Australia, referred to as Australian Accounting  Standards (AAS). We are required to disclose the effect of the  adjustments to our consolidated income statement, consolidated  total comprehensive income/(loss) and consolidated shareholders’  funds if our accounts were prepared under the version of IFRS that  is applicable in Australia. This is in order to satisfy the obligations of  Rio Tinto Limited to prepare consolidated accounts under  Australian company law, as amended by an order issued by the  Australian Securities and Investments Commission on 11 July 2024. Prior to 1 January 2004, our financial statements were prepared in  accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK  GAAP). Under IFRS, goodwill on acquisitions prior to 1998, which  was eliminated directly against equity in the Group’s UK GAAP  financial statements, has not been reinstated. This was permitted  under the rules governing the transition to IFRS set out in IFRS 1.  The equivalent Australian Standard, AASB 1, does not provide for  the netting of goodwill against equity. As a consequence,  shareholders’ funds under AAS include the residue of such goodwill,  which amounted to US$385 million at 31 December 2024  (2023: US$380 million).  Save for the exception described above, the Group’s financial  statements prepared in accordance with IFRS are consistent with  the requirements of AAS.

(c) In 2024, we received net proceeds of US$675 million (2023: US$1,157 million and 2022: US$352 million) from our sales and purchases of investments within a separately managed  portfolio of fixed income instruments. Refer to note 19 for details. Purchases and sales of these securities are reported on a net cash flow basis within “Sales of financial assets” or  “Purchases of financial assets” depending on the overall net position at each reporting date.  (d) In 2024, Other items includes the recognition of realised losses of US$88 million on currency forwards not designated as hedges (2023: realised losses US$57 million, 2022: realised losses  US$459 million). In 2022, other items also included the deduction of the US$432 million relating to the gain recognised on sale of the Cortez royalty shown in “Sale of financial assets”.

Financial statements  |  Consolidated primary statements  Consolidated statement of changes in equity Years ended 31 December Annual Report 2024 166 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 169 ===== Our financial performance We use a number of measures, including segmental revenue, underlying EBITDA, and capital expenditure to provide us with a greater  understanding of our operations’ underlying business performance, including revenue generation, productivity and cost management, on a  comparable basis between reporting years. 1   Financial performance by segment  Our management structure is based on product groups (PG) together with global support functions whose leaders make up the Executive  Committee. The Executive Committee members each report directly to our Chief Executive who is the chief operating decision maker  (CODM) and is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments. The CODM’s primary measure of  profit is underlying EBITDA (as defined on page 168). Our reportable segments are as follows. Reportable segment Principal activities Iron Ore Iron ore mining and salt and gypsum production in Western Australia. Aluminium Bauxite mining; alumina refining; aluminium smelting and recycling. Copper Mining and refining of copper, gold, silver, molybdenum, other by-products and exploration activities. Minerals Includes mining and processing of borates, titanium dioxide feedstock and iron concentrate and pellets from the Iron Ore  Company of Canada. Also includes diamond mining, sorting and marketing and development projects for battery materials,  such as lithium. Management responsibility during the build phase of the Simandou iron ore project falls under the Chief Technical Officer, Mark Davies.  Whilst this is classified as “Other operations”,and sits below reportable segments, we have shown this separately due to the significance of  funding and spend during the year following notice to proceed. Accountability for Rio Tinto Guinea, our in-country external affairs office  remains with Bold Baatar, and has therefore moved from the Copper product group to “Other operations” following his change in role to  Chief Commercial Officer. Accordingly, prior period amounts have been adjusted for comparability even though there is no material impact  as a result of the change.

The details provided include 100% of subsidiaries’ capital expenditure and Rio Tinto’s share of the capital expenditure of joint operations. (b) Consolidated sales revenue includes subsidiary sales of US$213 million (2023: US$20 million; 2022: US$50 million) to equity accounted units which are not included in segmental  revenue. Segmental revenue includes the Group’s proportionate share of product sales by equity accounted units (after adjusting for sales to subsidiaries) of US$4,261 million (2023:  US$3,036 million; 2022: US$2,900 million) which are not included in consolidated sales revenue. (c) Pre-tax and pre-divestment expenditure on exploration and evaluation charged to the profit and loss account in 2024 was US$935 million (note 8), compared with US$855 million in 2023  (excluding Simandou). Approximately 25% of the spend was by central exploration, 23% by Minerals (with the majority focusing on lithium), 36% by Copper, 14% by Iron Ore and 2% by  Aluminium. In 2024, all qualifying expenditure relating to Simandou is being capitalised. Qualifying expenditure on the Rincon lithium project has been capitalised since 1 July 2024. Financial statements   Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 167 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 170 ===== 1   Financial performance by segment continued Segmental revenue  Segmental revenue includes consolidated sales revenue plus the equivalent sales revenue of equity accounted units (EAUs) in proportion to  our equity interest (after adjusting for sales to/from subsidiaries). Segmental revenue measures revenue on a basis that is comparable to our underlying EBITDA metric. Other segmental reporting For further information relating to Revenue by destination and product and Non-operating assets by geography, refer to note 6 on page 178  and Our operating assets section on page 182, respectively. Underlying EBITDA Underlying EBITDA represents profit before taxation, net finance items, depreciation and amortisation adjusted to exclude the EBITDA  impact of items which do not reflect the underlying performance of our reportable segments. Other relevant judgements - Exclusions from underlying EBITDA Items excluded from profit after tax are those gains and losses that, individually or in aggregate with similar items, are of a nature and size  to require exclusion in order to provide additional insight into the underlying business performance. The following items are excluded  from profit after tax in arriving at underlying EBITDA in each year irrespective of materiality: – all depreciation and amortisation in subsidiaries and the corresponding share of profit in EAUs – all taxation and finance items in subsidiaries and the corresponding share of profit in EAUs – unrealised (gains)/losses on embedded derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting (including foreign exchange) – net (gains)/losses on consolidation or disposal of interests in businesses  – impairment charges net of reversals including corresponding amounts in share of profit in EAUs – the underlying EBITDA of discontinued operations – adjustments to closure provisions where the adjustment is associated with an impairment charge and for legacy sites where the  disturbance or environmental contamination relates to the pre-acquisition period. In addition, there is a final judgemental category which includes, where applicable, other credits and charges that, individually or in  aggregate if of a similar type, are of a nature or size to require exclusion in order to provide additional insight into underlying business  performance. In 2023, this included all re-estimates of the closure provisions for fully impaired sites identified in the second half of the  year due to the materiality of the adjustment in aggregate. In 2022, this category included the gain recognised by Kitimat relating to LNG  Canada's project and the gain recognised upon sale of the Cortez royalty. There were no similar items in 2024. 2024 US$m 2023  US$m 2022 US$m Profit after tax for the year   11,574   9,953   13,048  Taxation    4,041   3,832   5,614  Profit before taxation 15,615 13,785 18,662 Depreciation and amortisation in subsidiaries, excluding capitalised depreciation(a)   5,744   4,976   4,871  Depreciation and amortisation in equity accounted units   559   484   470  Finance items in subsidiaries   876   1,713   1,846  Taxation and finance items in equity accounted units   1,002   741   640  Unrealised losses/(gains) on embedded commodity and currency derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting  (including foreign exchange)   73   (15)   (6)  (Gains)/losses on consolidation and disposal of interests in businesses(b)   (1,214)   –   105  Impairment charges net of reversals (note 4)   573   936   52  Gain recognised by Kitimat relating to LNG Canada’s project(c)   –   –   (116)  Change in closure estimates (non-operating and fully impaired sites)(d)   86   1,272   180  Gain on sale of the Cortez royalty(e)   –   –   (432)  Underlying EBITDA   23,314   23,892   26,272  (a) Depreciation and amortisation in subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2024 is net of capitalised depreciation of US$174 million (2023: US$358 million; 2022: US$139 million). (b) Gains on consolidation of businesses include the revaluation of our previously held interest in the NZAS joint operation as we acquired the remaining shares during the year and this  became a subsidiary.  Disposals include the sale of Wyoming Uranium and Lake MacLeod, as described in note 5. (c) During 2022, LNG Canada elected to terminate their option to purchase additional land and facilities for expansion of their operations at Kitimat, Canada. The resulting gain was  excluded from underlying EBITDA consistent with prior years as it was part of a series of transactions that together were material.  (d) In 2024, the charge to the income statement relates to the change in estimates of underlying closure cash flows, net of impact of a change in discount rate, expressed in real-terms,  from 2.0% to 2.5% as applied to provisions for close-down, restoration and environmental liabilities at legacy sites where the environmental damage preceded ownership by Rio Tinto. In  2023, the charge includes US$873 million related to the closure provision update announced by ERA on 12 December 2023, together with the update included in their half year results  for the period ended 30 June 2023, published in August 2023. This update was considered material and therefore it was aggregated with other closure study updates (see note 14)  which were similar in nature and have been excluded from underlying EBITDA. The other closure study updates were at legacy sites managed by our central closure team as well as an  update at Yarwun alumina refinery which was expensed due to the impairment earlier in the year. In 2022, the charge related to re-estimates of underlying closure cash flows for legacy  sites where the environmental damage preceded ownership by Rio Tinto.  (e) On 2 August 2022, we completed the sale of a gross production royalty which was retained following the disposal of the Cortez Complex in 2008. The gain recognised on sale of the  royalty was excluded from underlying EBITDA on the grounds of individual magnitude.

Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 169 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 172 ===== 4  Impairment charges net of reversals  Recognition and measurement Impairment charges and reversals are assessed at the level of cash-generating units (CGUs) which, in accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment  of Assets”, are identified as the smallest identifiable asset or group of assets that generate cash inflows, which are largely independent of the  cash inflows from other assets. Separate CGUs are identified where an active market exists for intermediate products, even if the majority of  those products are further processed internally. In some cases, individual business units consist of several operations with independent  cash-generating streams which constitute separate CGUs.  Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to the CGU or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the related  business combination, and tested for impairment at the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management  purposes. All CGUs containing goodwill (note 11), indefinite-lived intangible assets and intangible assets that are not ready for use (note 12)  are tested annually for impairment as at 30 September, regardless of whether there has been an impairment trigger, or more frequently if  events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment charge. Other relevant judgements - determination of CGUs Judgement is applied to identify the Group’s CGUs, particularly when assets belong to integrated operations, and changes in CGUs  could impact impairment charges and reversals. The most relevant judgement for grouping continues to relate to the grouping of Rio  Tinto Iron and Titanium Quebec Operations and QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM) as a single CGU on the basis that they are vertically  integrated operations and there is no active market for QMM’s ilmenite. The most relevant judgement for disaggregation continues to relate to our bauxite and alumina refining operations in Australia whereby  we treat the Weipa bauxite mine as a separate CGU from the downstream assets at Gladstone. Currently, Weipa sells the majority of its  bauxite to third-party customers, whereas the alumina refineries are supplied with all of their bauxite internally.  Property, plant and equipment, including right-of-use assets and intangible assets with finite lives, are reviewed for impairment annually or  more frequently if there is an indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. This review starts with an appraisal of the  perimeter of cash-generating units to consider changes in the business or strategic direction. Following this, an assessment of internal and  external indicators is performed. Internal sources of information considered include assessment of the financial performance of the CGU  and changes in mine plans. External sources of information include changes in forecast commodity prices, costs and other market factors. Non-current assets (excluding goodwill) that have suffered impairment are reviewed using the same basis for valuation as explained below  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the impairment loss may no longer exist, or may have decreased. If appropriate,  an impairment reversal will be recognised. The carrying amount of the CGU after reversal must be the lower of (a) the recoverable amount,  as calculated above, and (b) the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment  loss been recognised for the CGU in prior periods. Key judgement - indicators of impairment and impairment reversals Our mining operations require large upfront investment with long periods of construction and management of geotechnical stability risks  from large-scale excavation of open pits or underground tunnelling. During operation and towards the end of mine life, the economic  performance of assets is subject to greater influence by short term market dynamics, which can impact the economic feasibility of  operations and life extension options. Together these represent our most significant sources of uncertainty relating to the identification  of indicators of impairment and impairment reversal. The underground expansion of our Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine in Mongolia is closely monitored for indicators of impairment and  impairment reversal, as it was previously impaired, meaning that carrying value and fair value were equal at that date. The ramp up of the  underground operations is progressing inline with our expectations, which means we have not identified an impairment trigger, however  there remain several years of construction, the complexity of which means we have not identified a trigger for impairment reversal. The  Rio Tinto Kennecott copper mine faced worsening geotechnical conditions in 2024, requiring a revised mine plan for 2025/26.  This  increased uncertainty was identified as an impairment indicator for Rio Tinto Kennecott and an impairment test was performed. The Gladstone alumina refineries are responsible for more than half of our Scope 1 carbon dioxide emissions in Australia and have  therefore been a key focus as we evaluate options to decarbonise our assets. In 2023, an impairment indicator at these assets resulted in  the full write-down of the carrying value of Yarwun and a partial write-down of our assets at Queensland Alumina Limited (QAL).  Continued studies during 2024 in relation to the double digestion project to improve the energy efficiency and reduce the carbon  emissions at QAL has indicated a greater overall cost compared with our prior year assumption and therefore we have identified this as  an impairment indicator and performed an impairment test. Where indication of impairment or impairment reversal exists, an impairment review is undertaken. The recoverable amount is assessed by  reference to the higher of value in use (being the net present value of expected future cash flows of the relevant CGU in its current  condition) and fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD). When the recoverable amount of the CGU is measured by reference to FVLCD, this  amount is further classified in accordance with the fair value hierarchy for observable market data that is consistent with the unit of account  for the CGU being tested. The Group considers that the best evidence of FVLCD is the value obtained from an active market or binding sale  agreement and, in this case, the recoverable amount is classified in the fair value hierarchy as level 1. When FVLCD is based on quoted prices  for equity instruments but adjusted to reflect factors such as a lack of liquidity in the market, the recoverable amount is classified as level 2  in the fair value hierarchy. No CGUs are currently assessed for impairment by reference to a recoverable amount based on FVLCD classified  as level 1 or level 2. Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 170 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 173 ===== 4  Impairment charges net of reversals continued Where unobservable inputs are material to the measurement of the recoverable amount, FVLCD is based on the best information available  to reflect the amount the Group could receive for the CGU in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  This is often estimated using discounted cash flow techniques and is classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.  Where the recoverable amount is assessed using FVLCD based on discounted cash flow techniques, the resulting estimates are based on  detailed life-of-mine and long-term production plans. These may include anticipated expansions which are at the evaluation stage of study.  The cash flow forecasts for FVLCD purposes are based on management’s best estimates of expected future revenues and costs, including  the future cash costs of production, capital expenditure, and closure, restoration and environmental costs. For the purposes of determining  FVLCD from a market participant’s perspective, the cash flows incorporate management’s price and cost assumptions in the short and  medium term. In the longer term, operating margins are assumed to remain constant where appropriate, as it is considered unlikely that a  market participant would prepare detailed forecasts over a longer term. The cash flow forecasts may include net cash flows expected to be  realised from the extraction, processing and sale of material that does not currently qualify for inclusion in Ore Reserves. Such non-reserve  material is only included when there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. This expectation is usually based on  preliminary drilling and sampling of areas of mineralisation that are contiguous with existing Ore Reserves. Typically, the additional evaluation  required to achieve reserves status for such material has not yet been done because this would involve incurring evaluation costs earlier  than is required for the efficient planning and operation of the mine.  As noted above, cost levels incorporated in the cash flow forecasts for FVLCD purposes are based on the current life-of-mine plan or long- term production plan for the CGU. This differs from value in use which requires future cash flows to be estimated for the asset in its current  condition and therefore does not include future cash flows associated with improving or enhancing an asset’s performance. Anticipated  enhancements to assets may be included in FVLCD calculations and, therefore, generally result in a higher value.  Where the recoverable amount of a CGU is dependent on the life of its associated orebody, expected future cash flows reflect the current  life-of-mine and long-term production plans; these are based on detailed research, analysis and iterative modelling to optimise the level of  return from investment, output and sequence of extraction. The mine plan takes account of all relevant characteristics of the orebody,  including waste-to-ore ratios, ore grades, haul distances, chemical and metallurgical properties of the ore impacting process recoveries, and  capacities of processing equipment that can be used. The life-of-mine plan and long-term production plans are, therefore, the basis for  forecasting production output and production costs in each future year.  Forecast cash flows for Ore Reserve estimation for JORC purposes are generally based on Rio Tinto’s commodity price forecasts, which  assume short-term market prices will revert to the Group’s assessment of the long-term price, generally over a period of 3 to 5 years. For  most commodities, these forecast commodity prices are derived from a combination of analyses of the marginal costs of the producers and  the incentive price of these commodities. These assessments often differ from current price levels and are updated periodically. The Group  does not believe that published medium- and long-term forward prices necessarily provide a good indication of future levels because they  tend to be strongly influenced by spot prices. The price forecasts used for Ore Reserve estimation are generally consistent with those used  for impairment testing unless management deems that in certain economic environments a market participant would not assume Rio Tinto’s  view on prices, in which case in preparing FVLCD impairment calculations management estimates the assumptions that a market participant  would be expected to use.  Forecast future cash flows of a CGU take into account the sales prices under existing sales contracts.  The discount rates applied to the future cash flow forecasts represent an estimate of the rate the market participant would apply having  regard to the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted. The  Group’s weighted average cost of capital is generally used as a starting point for determining the discount rates, with appropriate  adjustments for the risk profile of the countries in which the individual CGUs operate. For final feasibility studies and Ore Reserve estimation,  internal hurdle rates, which are generally higher than the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, are used. For developments funded with  project finance, the debt component of the weighted average cost of capital may be calculated by reference to the specific interest rate of  the project finance and anticipated leverage of the project.  For operations with a functional currency other than the US dollar, the impairment review is undertaken in the relevant functional currency.  In estimating FVLCD, internal forecasts of exchange rates take into account spot exchange rates, historical data and external forecasts, and  are kept constant in real terms after 5 years. The great majority of the Group’s sales are based on prices denominated in US dollars. To the  extent that the currencies of countries in which the Group produces commodities strengthen against the US dollar without an increase in  commodity prices, cash flows and, therefore, net present values, are reduced. Management considers that, over the long term, there is a  tendency for movements in commodity prices to compensate to some extent for movements in the value of the US dollar, particularly  against the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, and vice versa. However, such compensating changes are not synchronised and do not  fully offset each other. In estimating value in use, the present value of future cash flows in foreign currencies is translated at the spot  exchange rate on the testing date.  Generally, discounted cash flow models are used to determine the recoverable amount of CGUs. In this case, significant judgement is  required to determine the appropriate estimates and assumptions used, and there is significant estimation uncertainty. In particular, for fair  value less costs of disposal valuations, judgement is required to determine the estimates a market participant would use. The discounted  cash flow models are most sensitive to the following estimates: the timing of project expansions; the cost to complete assets under  construction; long-term commodity prices; production timing and recovery rates; exchange rates; operating costs; reserve and resource  estimates; closure costs; discount rates; allocation of long-term contract revenues between CGUs; and, in some instances, the renewal of  mining licences. Some of these variables are unique to an individual CGU. Future changes in these variables may differ from management’s  expectations and may materially alter the recoverable amounts of the CGUs.

Through the spring of 2024 as snow melted, accelerating movement in the  high wall was observed along 2 major fault lines. This movement has limited our ability to access the higher-grade primary ore on the south  wall. During the 3rd quarter of 2024, further studies on the geotechnical risks have been completed, indicating the need to change our mine  plan to stabilise pit wall movement and mitigate the risk of a significant geotechnical failure, this is expected to restrict ore deliveries from  the primary ore face in 2025 and 2026. This new information represents a material deviation from the current mine plan and has therefore  been identified as an impairment indicator. The recoverable amount for the CGU uses the fair value less cost of disposal methodology with real-terms post-tax cash flows discounted  over the expected life of mine at 6.3%. This includes preliminary estimates from a revised mine plan as future options for the open pit and  underground are reviewed, including growth options that remain subject to study and approval. The period of cash flows for end-of-mine  closure is significant relative to the period assumed for operations and therefore a post-tax real-terms discount rate of 2.5% has been used  in the recoverable amount determination for the cash outflows for the rehabilitation of the mine. No impairment charge has been recorded  as the overall net present value of cash flows based on our Conviction price series indicated that the recoverable amount exceeded the  US$2.2 billion carrying value of CGU by US$0.5 billion. This outcome is finely balanced as it represents less than 10% of the gross  asset carrying value. To illustrate the sensitivity of the recoverable amount to copper prices, with all other inputs unchanged, a reduction to  the copper price of 3% across all years would result in the recoverable amount of the CGU and the carrying value being equal.   Impact of climate change on our business - demand for copper As described in note 1, we anticipate increased demand for copper in the low carbon transition will result in higher copper prices. While  we have tested the Rio Tinto Kennecott CGU for impairment using our Conviction price assumptions, this is not aligned with the goals of  the Paris Agreement. Therefore we also provide a sensitivity using our Paris-aligned Aspirational Leadership scenario. We do not believe  this is representative of fair value less cost of disposal and it is provided for illustrative purposes only. The weighted average selling price for copper under our Aspirational leadership scenario over the life of mine for the Rio Tinto Kennecott  CGU is 10 per cent greater than our Conviction prices. Utilising the copper and carbon tax prices from our Aspirational Leadership  scenario with all other assumptions remaining unchanged indicates an additional US$1.0 billion of net present value from post-tax cash  flows. This assumes no changes to mined ore, or changes to risk weightings for future mine expansions, which in a stronger pricing  environment could improve the economic business case.

In 2023 we recorded an impairment of Queensland Alumina Limited  (QAL) refinery with the recoverable amount largely dependent upon the double digestion project, which was at the pre-feasibility study  stage of project evaluation. This major capital project improves the energy efficiency of the alumina production process and significantly  reduces carbon emissions. Continued studies for this project have indicated an increased capital cost compared with our previous  assumption and therefore we have performed a further test for impairment. Using a fair value less cost of disposal methodology and discounting real-terms post-tax cash flows at 6.6%, we recognised a pre-tax  impairment charge of US$461 million (post-tax US$503 million). This charge was all allocated against property, plant and equipment leaving  them with a residual carrying value of US$151 million. The post-tax impairment charge also includes a consequential adjustment to deferred  tax asset recognition within the same tax group. Impact of climate change on our business - Queensland alumina refinery We are committed to the decarbonisation of our assets to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 and to net zero emissions  by 2050 relative to our 2018 equity baseline. We anticipate that further carbon action may be necessary to align with the goals of the  Paris Agreement to limit temperature increases to 1.5oC. To illustrate the sensitivity of the impairment outcome to the cost of carbon  credits, we have modelled a 10% increase in carbon costs with no change to any other cash flows or assumptions. This sensitivity  indicated that a full impairment of QAL would occur under this scenario. Aluminium - Tiwai Point, New Zealand On 30 May 2024, we signed 20-year power arrangements with electricity generators Meridian Energy, Contact Energy and Mercury NZ to  set pricing for an aggregate of 572MW of electricity to meet the smelter's electricity needs. These new arrangements were identified as an  impairment reversal trigger as they give us confidence that the smelter would continue operations competitively beyond the existing supply  arrangement, which ran to December 2024. An impairment reversal is limited by the amount of depreciation that would have been charged had the previous impairments not occurred.  In this case, as the previous depreciation period was until December 2024, the impairment reversal was limited to US$41 million. Aluminium - Porto Trombetas (MRN), Brazil In preparing the local accounts for the year to 31 December 2023, after the publication of the Rio Tinto 2023 Annual Report, the directors of  Mineração Rio do Norte S.A. (MRN) recorded a local impairment charge triggered by cost increases, unfavourable exchange rates and  declining sales prices. The Rio Tinto share of that impairment is US$35 million pre-tax and US$23 million post-tax, and is included within the  current period share of profit after tax of equity accounted units. Rio Tinto’s share of bauxite produced by MRN is vertically integrated into our Quebec Smelter CGU included in North America Aluminium  operations. We reviewed the carrying value of the investment in equity accounted unit as part of this CGU and did not identify indicators of  impairment. Minerals - Diavik, Canada During the year an impairment trigger was identified at the Diavik diamond mine due to lower than forecasted diamond prices and  short remaining life of mine. Using a value in use methodology and discounting real-terms post-tax cash flows at 6.6%, we recognised a  pre-tax impairment charge of US$118 million (post-tax US$86 million). This represents a full impairment of property, plant and equipment in  the CGU. 2023 Aluminium - Alumina refineries, Australia In March 2023, the Australian Parliament legislated to introduce a requirement for large heavy industrial carbon emitters to purchase  carbon credits based on their Scope 1 emissions with a reducing baseline for these emissions. The challenging market conditions facing  these assets, together with our improved understanding of the capital requirements for decarbonisation and the legislated cost escalation  for carbon emissions, were identified as impairment triggers during the 6 months ended 30 June 2023. Using a fair value less cost of disposal methodology and discounting real-terms post-tax cash flows at 6.6%, we recognised a pre-tax  impairment charge of US$1,175 million (post-tax US$828 million). This represented a full impairment of the property, plant and equipment at  the Yarwun alumina refinery (US$948 million) and an impairment of US$227 million for the property, plant and equipment of QAL. These  impairments reflected market participant assumptions and the difficult trading conditions for these assets which were operating below our  planned output during the first half of 2023. Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 173 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 176 ===== 4  Impairment charges net of reversals continued Other operations - Simandou, Guinea The Simandou project in Guinea was fully impaired in 2015 as uncertainty over infrastructure ownership and funding had resulted in further  spend on exploration and evaluation being neither budgeted nor planned. In the second half of 2023, we concluded key agreements with  the Republic of Guinea and Winning Consortium Simandou (WCS) on the trans-Guinean infrastructure for the Simandou project and  progressed agreements with our joint venture partners that will enable the development of the Simandou iron ore mine. We therefore  concluded that although development agreements remain subject to regulatory approvals, the key uncertainties that gave rise to the 2015  impairment had reversed and consequently an impairment reversal trigger was identified at 1 October 2023. Revisions to the Investment Framework and changes to the proposed infrastructure arrangements since 2015 meant that historical costs  associated with these items were superseded and therefore the attributable asset cost and accumulated impairment associated with these  items was permanently derecognised. Previously capitalised exploration and evaluation costs associated with the mine and retained items of  property, plant and equipment that continue to be relevant to the Simandou project development were assessed for impairment reversal.  The recoverable amount of the CGU measured on a fair value less cost of disposal basis, was significantly greater than the historical cost of  the remaining impaired assets and therefore supported a full reversal of their previously recorded impairment charge. The pre-tax  impairment reversal of US$239 million was allocated as US$231 million to intangible assets (exploration and evaluation) and US$8 million to  property, plant and equipment. A deferred tax asset of US$152 million was recorded to account for the difference between the asset values  included in the Group accounts and the carrying value of in-country depreciable assets. Under our Aspirational Leadership pricing scenario,  increases in carbon pricing are expected to drive demand for the higher-grade iron ore at Simandou which would indicate a higher  recoverable value. As the previous impairment was fully reversed, this Paris-aligned sensitivity would not result in a different impairment  reversal. All spend on the Simandou project between the impairment in 2015 and 30 September 2023 was expensed as incurred. With effect from  1 October 2023, qualifying spend has been capitalised. 2022 Other operations - Roughrider, Canada  On 17 October 2022, we completed the sale of the Roughrider uranium undeveloped project located in the Athabasca Basin in  Saskatchewan, Canada for US$150 million (US$80 million in cash and US$70 million in shares of Uranium Energy Corp.). The project was  fully impaired during the year ended 31 December 2017 due to significant uncertainty over whether commercially viable quantities of Mineral  Resources could be identified at a future date. The sale therefore led to an impairment reversal during the year ended 31 December 2022. It  also led to a loss on disposal being recognised of US$105 million arising from the recycling of the currency translation reserve to the income  statement. Aluminium - Pacific Aluminium, Australia and New Zealand The operating and economic performance of the Boyne Smelter in Queensland, Australia was below our expectations in 2022. The plant  operated with reduced capacity and the economic performance suffered due to the high cost of energy from the coal-fired Gladstone  Power Station. These conditions were identified as an impairment trigger. We calculated a recoverable amount for the CGU based on post- tax cash flows, expressed in real terms and discounted using a post-tax rate of 6.6% over the period to 2029. This date was chosen as it  coincided with both the remaining term of the Boyne Smelter joint venture agreements and the Group’s Paris-aligned commitment to  reduce carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to the 2018 baseline. Despite the implementation of temporary energy price caps by the  Australian Government in 2022, this resulted in an impairment charge of US$202 million, representing a full impairment of the carrying value  of the Boyne Smelter investment in equity accounted unit. Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 174 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 177 ===== 5  Acquisitions and disposals Acquisitions  Recognition and measurement In determining whether a particular set of activities is a business, an  acquired arrangement has to have an input and substantive process,  which together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs.  Where an acquisition does not meet the definition of a business as  defined by IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”, each asset is recognised  on the balance sheet at fair value. In the consolidated cash flow  statement we assess, based on the substance of the transaction,  whether to allocate the cash consideration for these transactions  either to “Purchases of property, plant and equipment, and intangible  assets” or to “Acquisitions of subsidiaries, joint ventures and  associates” depending on the type of assets purchased. For undeveloped mining projects that have arisen through acquisition,  the allocation of the purchase price consideration may result in  undeveloped properties being recognised at an earlier stage of  project evaluation compared with projects arising from the Group’s  exploration and evaluation program. Subsequent expenditure on  acquired undeveloped projects is only capitalised if it meets the high  degree of confidence threshold discussed in note 12.  Where we increase our ownership interest in a subsidiary, the difference  between the purchase price and the carrying value of the share of net  assets acquired is recorded in equity. The cash cost of such purchases is  included within “financing activities” in the cash flow statement. 2024 Proposed acquisition of Arcadium Lithium On 9 October 2024, Rio Tinto and Arcadium Lithium plc (Arcadium  Lithium) announced a definitive agreement under which Rio Tinto  will acquire Arcadium Lithium in an all-cash transaction for $5.85  per share. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the  Board of Directors of both Rio Tinto and Arcadium Lithium. On  23 December 2024, Arcadium Lithium announced that it had  obtained the requisite approvals of their shareholders. The  transaction is also subject to the approval of the Royal Court of  Jersey and receipt of customary regulatory approvals and other  closing conditions, which is expected to close in March 2025. On 22 January 2025, Rio Tinto committed to providing Arcadium  Lithium with a loan of US$200 million, which was fully drawn on  30 January 2025, and a further US$300 million loan facility to  support certain capital expenditures, subject to certain conditions  precedent. These loans are interest bearing and are due for  repayment on 1 September 2027, though earlier settlement without  penalty is permitted. Boyne Smelters Limited (BSL) Following approval from Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board  (FIRB), on 30 September 2024, we completed the acquisition of  Mitsubishi Corporation’s 11.65% interest in BSL, which owns and  operates the Boyne Island aluminium smelter in Gladstone Australia.  On 1 November 2024, we also completed the acquisition of Sumitomo  Chemical Company Limited’s (SCC) 2.46% interest in BSL, increasing  our total interest in BSL to 73.5%. BSL remains accounted for as an  investment in associate under the equity method.  New Zealand Aluminium Smelters Limited (NZAS)  On 1 November 2024, we acquired SCC’s 20.64% interest in NZAS,  which owns and operates the Tiwai Point aluminium smelter in New  Zealand. This transaction has been accounted for as a business  combination achieved in stages, with our previous 79.36% interest in  the NZAS joint operation being remeasured to fair value and forming  the majority of the consideration for the acquisition of this subsidiary. The fair value of 100% of NZAS has been calculated as US$386  million based on forecast post-tax cash flows consistent with the  methodology used for the impairment reversal. The extent of the  30 June 2024 impairment reversal was restricted to US$41 million,  as described in note 4.  However, business combination accounting  requires us to take into account the full fair value measurement  from the revised business outlook incorporating the new 20-year  power arrangements. A gain of US$638 million (post-tax US$467 million) has been  recorded within “Gains/(losses) on consolidation and disposal of  interests in businesses” in the consolidated income statement,  principally due to the net post-tax fair value of our share of the joint  operation of US$290 million, exceeding the carrying value of the  previously held interest of US$(78) million which includes the  closure provision. This resulted in an increase to the carrying value  of property, plant and equipment of US$650 million and deferred  tax liabilities of US$171 million. All other carrying value adjustments  were proportionate to our increase in equity ownership, and no  goodwill was recognised. WCS Rail and Port entities On 15 July 2024, our subsidiary SimFer Jersey Limited’s investment  in Winning Consortium Simandou (WCS) for co-development of the  rail and port infrastructure became unconditional. On 17 July 2024, we acquired a 34% equity interest in Winning  Consortium Simandou Railway Pte. Ltd and Winning Consortium  Simandou Ports Pte. Ltd (together referred to as “WCS Rail and Port  entities”), through our partially owned subsidiary SimFer Jersey for  US$313 million.  The Rio Tinto share of this consideration was  US$166 million and US$147 million was funded by Chalco Iron Ore  Holdings Ltd (CIOH). Further shareholder loan funding to the WCS  Rail and Port entities was made on the same day directly by Rio Tinto  and CIOH, in proportion to their respective 53% and 47% ownership  interest of SimFer Jersey, to these equity accounted units. 2023 Nuevo Cobre On 8 November 2023, we acquired Meridian Minera Limitada’s  (MML) 57.74% share in Agua de la Falda (ADLF) for US$45 million.  Subsequently, we entered into an agreement with Corporación  Nacional del Cobre de Chile (Codelco), a state-owned enterprise, to  explore and potentially acquire assets in Chile’s prospective  Atacama region - the project is known as Nuevo Cobre. The majority ownership of 57.74% equity confered voting rights that   allow Rio Tinto to control the relevant activities of Nuevo Cobre.  Therefore, we accounted for Nuevo Cobre as an investment in a  partially owned subsidiary. There was no goodwill recognised on   acquisition as the transaction was not accounted for as a business  combination. The difference between the net assets acquired and  the purchase consideration was recognised within Intangible assets  as Exploration and evaluation assets. The transaction gave rise to  the recognition of a non-controlling interest of US$33 million,  representing Codelco’s 42.26% equity stake in Nuevo Cobre.

We acquired a 50%  equity interest in Matalco Canada Inc. which owns one Canadian  aluminium recycling facility and a 50% equity interest in Matalco  USA LLC which owns 6 aluminium recycling facilities in the US for  combined consideration of US$738 million, inclusive of accrued  transaction costs and working capital adjustments.  Rio Tinto has joint control over the Matalco businesses and  therefore our investment is accounted for under the equity method. The fair value of the underlying identifiable assets acquired and  liabilities assumed had been provisionally determined at 31 December  2023. During 2024, the acquisition accounting for Matalco, which was  subject to the finalisation of working capital adjustments, was  completed and did not result in any material adjustments.   2022 Rincon Following approval from Australia’s Foreign Investment Review  Board (FIRB), on 29 March 2022 we completed the acquisition of  Rincon Mining Pty Limited (Rincon), the owner of a lithium project in  Argentina. Total cash consideration was US$825 million. In  determining whether Rincon’s set of activities is a business, we  assessed whether it had inputs and substantive processes which  together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs.  Based on this assessment, we concluded that Rincon did not meet  the definition of a business as defined by IFRS 3 “Business  Combinations” and therefore no goodwill was recorded. The  transaction was therefore treated as an asset purchase with  US$822 million of capitalised exploration and evaluation recorded  for the principal economic resource. The balance of total  consideration was allocated to property, plant and equipment and  other assets/liabilities. For the consolidated cash flow statement we  determined that, since Rincon constitutes a group of companies, it  was appropriate to present the cash outflow as “Acquisitions of  subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates” rather than as separate  asset purchases even though it did not meet the definition of a  business combination. Turquoise Hill Resources (TRQ) On 16 December 2022 we acquired the remaining 49% share of  TRQ. The consideration paid amounted to US$2,961 million. The  transaction was not classified as a business combination as it  related to the purchase of non-controlling interests in a subsidiary.  It was recognised in the statement of changes in equity as an  adjustment to retained earnings. Certain shareholders exercised their right to dissent to the  transaction. In accordance with the terms of the circular, the dissent  proceedings were concluded during 2024, and final consideration  has been paid to the dissenting shareholders.  Disposals Recognition and measurement If a group of assets and liabilities (disposal group) is sold, the  carrying value of the disposal group is de-recognised with the  difference between the carrying amount and the consideration  received recognised in the income statement. Certain amounts  previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of  the entity disposed of may be recycled to the income statement.  The cash proceeds of disposals are included within “Investing  activities” in the cash flow statement.  2024 Wyoming Uranium On 5 December 2024, we completed our sale of the Sweetwater  uranium mill facility together with mining projects (collectively known  as “Wyoming Uranium”) to Uranium Energy Corp. (UEC) for cash  consideration of US$175 million. Lake MacLeod On 2 December 2024, we completed our sale of Dampier Salt  Limited’s Lake MacLeod salt and gypsum operation in Carnarvon to  Leichhardt Industrials Group (Leichhardt) for cash consideration of  US$247 million. 2023 La Granja On 28 August 2023, we completed the sale of a 55% interest in the  undeveloped La Granja project in Peru for US$105 million to First  Quantum Minerals (FQM). The consideration received was recorded in  the cash flow statement for US$104 million (net of US$1 million of cash  balance), of which US$16 million relating to sale of land was included  within “net cash used in investing activities” and the remaining US$88  million was included within “net cash generated from operating  activities”. As a result of the sale, our retained interest in La Granja  represents a 45% owned associate (equity accounted) over which Rio  Tinto has significant influence during the evaluation phase. On initial recognition, the gain on fair valuation of interest retained  in the project of US$85 million was recognised to the extent of  US$47 million (relating to the 55% interest sold) within “profit  relating to interests in undeveloped projects” and the remaining  gain of US$38 million was eliminated against the fair value of the  EAU. In total, we recognised a pre-tax gain of US$154 million in the  income statement, primarily representing the consideration  transferred by First Quantum, plus the fair value of the retained  interest in the project. 2022 Roughrider As summarised in note 4, we sold our shareholding in the Roughrider  uranium undeveloped project on 17 October 2022 for consideration  of US$150 million (US$80 million in cash and US$70 million in shares  of UEC). This transaction was treated as a disposal of a subsidiary as  the carrying value was largely represented by assets recorded as a  purchase price allocation from the Hathor Exploration business  combination in 2012. Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 176 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 179 ===== 6  Revenue by destination and product Recognition and measurement  We recognise sales revenue related to the transfer of promised  goods or services when control of the goods or services passes to  the customer. The amount of revenue recognised reflects the  consideration to which the Group is, or expects to be, entitled in  exchange for those goods or services. Sales revenue is recognised on individual sales when control  transfers to the customer. In most instances, control passes and  sales revenue is recognised when the product is delivered to the  vessel or vehicle on which it will be transported once loaded, the  destination port or the customer’s premises. There may be  circumstances when judgement is required based on the 5  indicators of control below:  – The customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership  and has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially  all of the remaining benefits from, the good or service.  – The customer has a present obligation to pay in accordance with  the terms of the sales contract. For shipments under the  Incoterms cost, insurance and freight (CIF)/carriage paid to  (CPT)/cost and freight (CFR), this is generally when the ship is  loaded, at which time the obligation for payment is for both  product and freight.  – The customer has accepted the asset. Sales revenue may be  subject to adjustment if the product specification does not  conform to the terms specified in the sales contract but this  does not impact the passing of control. Assay and specification  adjustments have historically been immaterial.  – The customer has legal title to the asset. The Group usually retains  legal title until payment is received for credit risk purposes only. – The customer has physical possession of the asset. This  indicator may be less important as the customer may obtain  control of an asset prior to obtaining physical possession, which  may be the case for goods in transit.  Revenue is principally derived from sale of commodities. We sell the  majority of our products on CFR or CIF Incoterms. This means that the  Group is responsible (acts as principal) for providing shipping services  and, in some instances, insurance after the date at which control of  goods passes to the customer at the loading port. The Group,  therefore, has separate performance obligations for freight and  insurance services that are provided solely to facilitate the sale of the  products it produces. Other Incoterms commonly used by the Group  are free on board (FOB), where the Group has no responsibility for  freight or insurance once control of the goods has passed at the  loading port, and delivered at place (DAP), where control of the goods  passes when the product is delivered to the agreed destination. For  these Incoterms, there is only one performance obligation, being the  provision of product at the point where control passes. Within each sales contract, each unit of product shipped is a  separate performance obligation. Revenue is generally recognised  at the contracted price as this reflects the standalone selling price.  Sales revenue excludes any applicable sales taxes. Sales of copper  concentrate are stated net of the treatment and refining charges,  which will be required to convert it to an end product.  The Group’s products are sold to customers under contracts that  vary in tenure and pricing mechanisms, including some volumes sold  on the spot market. Pricing for iron ore is on a range of terms, the  majority being either monthly or quarterly average pricing  mechanisms, with a smaller proportion of iron ore volumes being  sold on the spot market. Certain of the Group’s products may be provisionally priced at the  date revenue is recognised and a provisional invoice issued; however,  substantially all iron ore and aluminium sales are reflected at final  prices in the results for the period. Provisionally priced receivables are  subsequently measured at fair value through the income statement  under IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” as described in note 24. The final  selling price for all provisionally priced products is based on the price  for the quotational period stipulated in the contract. Final prices for  copper concentrate are normally determined between 30 and 120  days after delivery to the customer. The change in value of the  provisionally priced receivable is based on relevant forward market  prices and is included in sales revenue. Refer to “Other revenue” within  the sales by product disclosure below. Revenues from the sale of significant by-products, such as gold, are  included in sales revenue. Third-party commodity swap arrangements  principally for delivery and receipt of smelter-grade alumina are offset  within operating costs. The sale and purchase of third-party  production for own use or to mitigate shortfalls in our production are  accounted for on a gross basis with sales presented within revenue  from contracts with customers. Other operating income includes  revenue incidental to the main revenue-generating activities of the  operations and is treated as a credit to operating costs.  Typically, the Group has a right to payment before or at the point that  control of the goods passes, including a right, where applicable, to  payment for provisionally priced products and unperformed freight and  insurance services. Cash received before control passes is recognised as  a contract liability. The amount of consideration does not contain a  significant financing component as payment terms are less than one  year. We have a number of long-term contracts to supply products to  customers in future periods. Generally, revenue is recognised on an  invoice basis, as each unit sold is a separate performance obligation and  therefore the right to consideration from a customer corresponds  directly with our performance completed to date.  We do not disclose sales revenue from freight and insurance  services separately as we do not consider that this is necessary in  order to understand the impact of economic factors on the Group.  Our Chief Executive, the CODM as defined under IFRS 8 “Operating  Segments”, does not review information specifically relating to these  sources of revenue in order to evaluate the performance of  business segments and Group information on these sources of  revenue is not provided externally.   We do provide information on freight revenue for the iron ore and  bauxite businesses on pages 25 and 27 to help stakeholders  understand FOB operating margins for those products.

Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 178 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 181 ===== 8  Exploration and evaluation expenditure  Exploration and evaluation expenditure includes costs that are directly attributable to:  – researching and analysing existing exploration data  – conducting geological studies, exploratory drilling and sampling  – examining and testing extraction and treatment methods   – compiling various studies (order of magnitude, pre-feasibility and feasibility) and/or – early works at mine sites prior to full notice to proceed.  Exploration expenditure relates to the initial search for deposits with economic potential. Expenditure on exploration activity undertaken by  the Group is not capitalised. Evaluation expenditure relates to a detailed assessment of deposits or other projects (including smelter and refinery projects) that have  been identified as having economic potential. These costs are also expensed until the business case for the project is sufficiently advanced.  For greenfield projects, expensing typically continues to a later phase of study compared with brownfield expansions.   The charge for the year and the net amount of intangible assets capitalised during the year are as follows.  2024  US$m  2023 US$m 2022 US$m Expenditure in the year (inclusive of net cash proceeds of nil (2023: US$88 million; 2022: US$1 million) on  disposal of undeveloped projects)(a)   (1,337)   (1,684)   (1,097)  Non-cash movements and non-cash proceeds on disposal of undeveloped projects   (15)   (17)   (6)  Amount capitalised during the year   416   471   207  Exploration and evaluation expenditure (net of profit from disposal of interests in undeveloped projects)  per income statement   (936)   (1,230)   (896)  Comprising: – Exploration and evaluation expenditures   (935)   (1,384)   (897)  – (Loss)/profit from disposal of interests in undeveloped projects(a)   (1)   154   1  (a) In 2023, net cash proceeds of US$88 million were received in relation to the sale of a 55% interest in the undeveloped La Granja project in Peru, for which we recognised a gain on  disposal of US$154 million.

Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 179 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 182 ===== 10  Taxation  Recognition and measurement  The taxation charge contains both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the tax expected to be payable on the taxable income for the year calculated using rates applicable during the year. It includes  adjustments for tax expected to be payable or recoverable in respect of previous periods. Where the amount of tax payable or recoverable  is uncertain, we establish provisions based on either: the Group’s judgement of the most likely amount of the liability or recovery; or, when  there is a wide range of possible outcomes, a probability weighted average approach. Deferred tax is calculated in accordance with IAS 12, at the rate expected to apply when the asset is realised or liability settled, according to  rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is generally recognised in respect of  differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are  recognised to the extent it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised.  Deferred tax is not recognised on the initial recognition of goodwill or of assets and liabilities, other than in a business combination, that at  the time of the transaction impact neither accounting nor taxable profit, except where the transaction gives rise to equal and offsetting  taxable and deductible temporary differences. Deferred tax is not recognised in respect of investments in subsidiaries and associates and  jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable they will  not reverse in the foreseeable future.  The mandatory exception to recognising and disclosing information related to deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income  taxes has been applied as required by IAS 12. The Pillar Two global minimum tax of 15% formulated by the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD) was substantively enacted by the United Kingdom on 20 June 2023, with application from 1 January  2024. Exposure to additional taxation under Pillar Two is immaterial to the Group. Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the balances are related to taxes levied by the same taxing authority, there is a  legally enforceable right to offset, and it is intended that they be settled on a net basis or realised simultaneously.  Other relevant judgements - uncertain tax positions The Group operates across a large number of jurisdictions and is subject to review and challenge by local tax authorities on a range of  tax matters. Where the amount of tax payable or recoverable is uncertain, whether due to local tax authority challenge or due to  uncertainty regarding the appropriate treatment, judgement is required to assess the probability that the adopted treatment will be  accepted. In accordance with IFRIC 23 “Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments”, if it is not probable that the treatment will be accepted,  the Group accounts for uncertain tax provisions for all matters worldwide based on the Group’s judgement of the most likely amount of  the liability or recovery, or, where there is a wide range of possible outcomes, using a probability weighted average approach. Uncertain  tax provisions include any related interest and penalties.  The Mongolian Tax Authority has issued a number of tax assessments covering the fiscal years 2013 to 2020, the most recent of which  was received in December 2023, which are inconsistent with the Oyu Tolgoi Investment Agreement and Mongolian legislation. The  matters under dispute have been referred to international arbitration. As required by Mongolian law, we have paid US$438 million (US  dollar equivalent at the time of payment) in respect of the assessments, including US$82 million paid in the current year, pending  resolution of the disputes through the arbitration. The assessments also seek to disallow tax deductions, including future tax deductions,  in respect of amounts accrued and payable in the future. Management regularly re-evaluates the likely outcomes from the dispute based on the progress of the arbitration proceedings, legal  advice, and discussions with the Government of Mongolia. In 2024, we have recorded a provision of US$295 million for uncertain tax  positions reflecting our best estimate of the likely outcome from the dispute. It is possible that the outcome of these proceedings could  result in a change in our estimated exposure in respect of the matters under dispute and therefore a material revision to this provision in  future periods.  Differences in interpretation of the Investment Agreement and Mongolian legislation could have a material impact on the recovery of  certain deferred tax assets, further details of which are provided in note 15.

Consequently, the tax effect on the profit from equity accounted units is included as a separate  reconciling item in this prima facie tax reconciliation.  (b) As a UK headquartered and listed Group, the reconciliation of expected tax on accounting profit to tax charge uses the UK corporate tax rate to calculate the prima facie tax payable.  Rio Tinto is also listed in Australia, and the reconciliation includes the impact of the higher tax rate in Australia where a significant proportion of the Group's profits are currently earned.  The impact of other tax rates applicable outside the UK and Australia is also included. The weighted average statutory corporate tax rate on profit before tax is approximately 29%  (2023: 31%; 2022: 29%).  (c) The recognition of previously unrecognised deferred tax assets in 2024 includes US$443 million in respect of Energy Resources of Australia (ERA) and relates to rehabilitation  provisions which are tax deductible when paid in the future. In November 2024, our interest in ERA increased from 86.3% to 98.43% and Rio Tinto stated its intention to proceed with  compulsory acquisition of the remaining shares during 2025. Tax deductions for rehabilitation payments made after completion of the compulsory acquisition process will be applied  against taxable profits from other Australian operations, including our iron ore business. In 2023 and 2022, recognition of previously unrecognised deferred tax assets relates primarily  to Oyu Tolgoi where reaching sustainable underground production has reduced the risk of tax losses expiring if not recovered against taxable profits within 8 years. (d) In 2024, the write-down of previously recognised deferred tax assets primarily relates to our Australian aluminium business. In 2022, the write-down of previously recognised deferred  tax assets relates to deferred tax assets of our US businesses following the introduction of a Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) regime.  (e) Unrecognised current year operating losses include tax losses around the Group, including increases in closure estimates in 2024 and 2023, for which no tax benefit is currently  recognised due to uncertainty regarding whether suitable taxable profits will be earned in future to obtain value for the tax losses.   (f) The uncertain tax provision of US$295 million in 2024 represents amounts provided in relation to disputes with the Mongolian Tax Authority for which the timing of resolution and  potential economic outflow are uncertain. Further information is included in the ‘Other relevant judgements - uncertain tax positions’ section of this note above.  (g) In 2023, the Canadian aluminium business completed an internal sale of assets which resulted in the utilisation of previously unrecognised capital losses and an uplift in the tax  depreciable value of assets on which a deferred tax asset of US$364 million was recognised.

The recoverable  amount has been assessed by reference to the CGU’s FVLCD, in line with the policy set out in note 4 and classified as level 3 under the fair  value hierarchy. FVLCD was determined by estimating cash flows until the end of the life-of-mine plan including anticipated expansions. In  arriving at FVLCD, a post-tax discount rate of 8.6% (2023: 8.6%) has been applied to the post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms.  The key assumptions to which the calculation of FVLCD for Richards Bay Minerals is most sensitive and the corresponding change in FVLCD  are set out below: 2024  US$m 2023 US$m 5% increase in the titanium slag price 144 217 1% increase in the discount rate applied to post-tax cash flows   (135)   (175)  10% strengthening of the South African rand   232   272  Future selling prices and operating costs have been estimated in line with the policy set out in note 4. The recoverable amount of the  CGU exceeds the carrying value when each of these sensitivities is applied while keeping all other assumptions constant.  12  Intangible assets  Recognition and measurement Purchased intangible assets are initially recorded at cost. Finite-life intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives on a  straight line or units of production basis, as appropriate. Intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite lives and intangible assets that  are not yet ready for use are not amortised; they are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in  circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The majority of our intangible assets relate to capitalised exploration and evaluation spend on undeveloped properties and contract-based  water rights. The water rights were acquired with Alcan in Canada. The carrying values for undeveloped properties are reviewed at each reporting date in accordance with IFRS 6 “Exploration for and  Evaluation of Mineral Resources”. The indicators of impairment differ from the tests in accordance with IAS 36 in recognition of the  subjectivity of estimating future cash flows for mineral interests under evaluation. Potential indicators of impairment include: expiry of the  right to explore, substantive expenditure is no longer planned, commercially viable quantities of Mineral Resources have not been  discovered and exploration activities will be discontinued, or sufficient data exists to indicate a future development would be unlikely to  recover the carrying amount in full. When such impairment indicators have been identified, the recoverable amount and impairment charge  are measured under IAS 36. Impairment reversals for undeveloped properties are not subject to special conditions within IFRS 6 and are  therefore subject to the same monitoring for indicators of impairment reversal as other CGUs.  Exploration and evaluation Evaluation expenditure relates to a detailed assessment of deposits or other projects (including smelter and refinery projects) that have  been identified as having economic potential. Capitalisation of evaluation expenditure commences when there is a high degree of  confidence that the Group will determine that a project is commercially viable; that is, the project will provide a satisfactory return relative to  its perceived risks and, therefore, it is considered probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group. The Group’s view is that a  high degree of confidence is greater than “more likely than not” (that is, greater than 50% certainty) and less than “virtually certain” (that is,  less than 90% certainty). Assessing whether there is a high degree of confidence that the Group will ultimately determine that an evaluation project is commercially  viable requires judgement and consideration of all relevant factors such as: the nature and objective of the project, the project’s current  stage, project timeline, current estimates of the project’s net present value (including sensitivity analyses for the key assumptions), and the  main risks of the project. Development expenditure incurred prior to the decision to proceed is subject to the same criteria for capitalisation,  being a high degree of confidence that the Group will ultimately determine that a project is commercially viable.  In some cases, undeveloped projects are regarded as successors to orebodies, smelters or refineries currently in production. Where this is  the case, it is intended that these will be developed and go into production when the current source of ore is exhausted or when existing  smelters or refineries are closed. Ore Reserves may be declared for an undeveloped mining project before its commercial viability has been  fully determined. Evaluation costs may continue to be capitalised in between declaration of Ore Reserves and approval to mine as further  work is undertaken in order to refine the development case to maximise the project’s returns. Carbon credits and Renewable Energy Certificates Carbon credits and Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) acquired for our own use are accounted for as intangible assets, initially recorded  at cost. They are amortised through the income statement when surrendered. Contract-based intangible assets The majority of the carrying value of our contract-based intangible assets relate to water rights in the Quebec region. These contribute to  the efficiency and cost effectiveness of our aluminium operations as they enable us to generate electricity from hydropower stations.  Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 183 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 186 ===== 12  Intangible assets continued Other relevant judgements - assessment of indefinite-lived water rights in Quebec, Canada We continue to judge the water rights in Quebec to have an indefinite life because we expect the contractual rights to contribute to the  efficiency and cost effectiveness of our operations for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the rights are not subject to amortisation but  are tested annually for impairment. We have no other indefinite-lived assets.  As at 31 December 2024, the remaining carrying value of the water rights (included in contract-based assets) of US$1,631 million (2023:  US$1,776 million) relates wholly to the Quebec smelters CGU. The Quebec smelters CGU was tested for impairment by reference to  FVLCD using discounted cash flows. The recoverable amount of the Quebec smelters is classified as level 3 under the fair value  hierarchy. In arriving at its FVLCD, post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms have been estimated over the expected useful economic  lives of the underlying smelting assets and discounted using a real post-tax discount rate of 6.6% (2023: 6.6%). The recoverable amounts were determined to be significantly in excess of carrying value, and there are no reasonably possible changes  in key assumptions that would cause the remaining water rights to be impaired. Impact of climate change on our business - water rights To manage the uncertainties of climate change and our impact on the area, our team of hydrologists in Quebec analyse different weather  scenarios on a daily basis. We monitor the water resource available to us along with the impact that our operation is having on the water  quality and quantity, and on the environment when we return the water following use. Based on our analysis to date, we do not consider  the renewal of our contractual water rights to be at risk from climate change for the foreseeable future. 2024 Exploration and  evaluation US$m Trademarks,  patented and  non-patented  technology US$m Contract-based  intangible assets US$m Other  intangible  assets(a) US$m Total US$m Net book value At 1 January 2024   1,979   9   1,953   448   4,389  Adjustment on currency translation   (44)   (1)   (159)   (39)   (243)  Additions(b)   416   –   –   116   532  Amortisation for the year   –   (4)   (7)   (127)   (138)  Disposals, transfers and other movements(c)   (1,789)   –   –   53   (1,736)  At 31 December 2024   562   4   1,787   451   2,804  – cost   564   207   2,758   1,922   5,451  – accumulated amortisation and impairment   (2)   (203)   (971)   (1,471)   (2,647)  Total   562   4   1,787   451   2,804  2023 Exploration and  evaluation US$m Trademarks,  patented and  non-patented  technology US$m Contract-based  intangible assets US$m Other intangible  assets (a) US$m Total US$m Net book value At 1 January 2023   1,368   12   1,875   390   3,645  Adjustment on currency translation   –   1   52   8   61  Additions(d)   471   –   –   121   592  Amortisation for the year   –   (4)   (7)   (113)   (124)  Impairment reversal(d)   231   –   –   –   231  Newly consolidated operations(e)   85   –   –   –   85  Disposals, transfers and other movements   (176)   –   33   42   (101)  At 31 December 2023   1,979   9   1,953   448   4,389  – cost   1,989   222   2,996   1,926   7,133  – accumulated amortisation and impairment(d)   (10)   (213)   (1,043)   (1,478)   (2,744)  Total   1,979   9   1,953   448   4,389  (a) Other intangible assets include US$50 million (2023: US$61 million) of carbon abatement spend.

(b) In 2024, additions primarily relate to project costs incurred at Simandou prior to Board approval of “notice to proceed” in February 2024 and at Rincon from July 2024 following  approval by the Argentine Congress of the new “RIGI” legislation, which underpinned the economic business case, until Board notice to proceed in December 2024. (c) “Transfers and other movements” includes reclassification between categories. In 2024, following approvals by the Board of notice to proceed, exploration and evaluation assets relating  to Simandou (US$732 million) and Rincon (US$1,013 million), were transferred in full to Property, plant and equipment after being assessed for indicators of impairment.

Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 184 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 187 ===== 12  Intangible assets continued Where amortisation is calculated on a straight line basis, the following useful lives have been determined:  Trademarks, patented and  non-patented technology Contract-based intangible assets Other intangible assets Type of intangible Trademarks Patented and  non-patented  technology Power contracts/ water rights Other purchase and  customer contracts Internally generated  intangible assets and  computer software Other intangible assets Amortisation profile  14 to 20 years 10 to 20 years 2 to 45 years  5 to 15 years  2 to 5 years 2 to 20 years 13  Property, plant and equipment  Recognition and measurement Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, as defined in IAS 16 “Property, Plant and Equipment”, less accumulated depreciation and  accumulated impairment losses. The cost of property, plant and equipment includes, where applicable, the estimated close-down and  restoration costs associated with the asset.  Property, plant and equipment includes right-of-use assets arising from leasing arrangements, shown separately from owned and leasehold  assets.  Once an undeveloped mining project has been determined as commercially viable and approval to mine has been given, further expenditure  is capitalised under “capital works in progress” together with any amount transferred from “Exploration and evaluation”. Once the project  enters into an operation phase, the amounts capitalised in capital work in progress are reclassified to their respective asset categories. Costs incurred while commissioning new assets, in the period before they are capable of operating in the manner intended by management, are  capitalised unless associated with pre-production revenue. Development costs incurred after the commencement of production are capitalised  to the extent they are expected to give rise to a future economic benefit. Interest on borrowings related to construction or development projects  is capitalised, at the rate payable on project-specific debt if applicable or at the Group or subsidiary’s cost of borrowing if not. This is performed  until the point when substantially all the activities that are necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use are complete. It may be  appropriate to use a subsidiary’s cost of borrowing when the debt was negotiated based on the financing requirements of that subsidiary.  Depreciation of non-current assets  Property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life, or over the remaining life of the mine, smelter or refinery if that is shorter  and there is no reasonable alternative use for the asset by the Group. Depreciation commences when an asset is available for use and  therefore there is no depreciation for capital work in progress.   Straight line basis  Assets within operations for which production is not expected to fluctuate significantly from one year to another or which have a physical life  shorter than the related mine are depreciated on a straight line basis as follows.  Type of Property, plant and equipment Land and buildings Plant and equipment Land Buildings Power-generating assets Other plant and equipment Depreciation profile Not depreciated 5 to 50 years See Power note below on  page 189 3 to 50 years The useful lives and residual values for material assets and categories of assets are reviewed annually and changes are reflected  prospectively.  Units of production basis  For mining properties and leases and certain mining equipment, consumption of the economic benefits of the asset is linked to production.  Except as noted below, these assets are depreciated on the units of production basis.  In applying the units of production method, depreciation is normally calculated based on production in the period as a percentage of total  expected production in current and future periods based on Ore Reserves and, for some mines, other Mineral Resources. Other Mineral  Resources may be included in the calculations of total expected production in limited circumstances where there are very large areas of  contiguous mineralisation, for which the economic viability is not sensitive to likely variations in grade, as may be the case for certain iron ore,  bauxite and industrial mineral deposits, and where there is a high degree of confidence that the other Mineral Resources can be extracted  economically. This would be the case when the other Mineral Resources do not yet have the status of Ore Reserves merely because the  necessary detailed evaluation work has not yet been performed and the responsible technical personnel agree that inclusion of a proportion of  Measured and Indicated Resources in the calculation of total expected production is appropriate based on historical reserve conversion rates.   The required level of confidence is unlikely to exist for minerals that are typically found in low-grade ore (as compared with the above), such  as copper or gold. In these cases, specific areas of mineralisation have to be evaluated in detail before their economic status can be  predicted with confidence.  Sometimes the calculation of depreciation for infrastructure assets, primarily rail and port, considers Measured and Indicated Resources. This is  because the asset can benefit current and future mines. The measured and indicated resource may relate to mines which are currently in  production or to mines where there is a high degree of confidence that they will be brought into production in the future. The quantum of Mineral  Resources is determined taking into account future capital costs as required by the JORC Code. The depreciation calculation, however, applies  to current mines only and does not take into account future development costs for mines which are not yet in production. Measured and  Indicated Resources are currently incorporated into depreciation calculations in the Group’s Australian iron ore business.  Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 185 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 188 ===== 13  Property, plant and equipment continued  Key judgement - estimation of asset lives The useful lives of the major assets of a CGU are often dependent on the life of the orebody to which they relate. Where this is the case,  the lives of mining properties, and their associated refineries, concentrators and other long-lived processing equipment are generally  limited to the expected life of the orebody. The life of the orebody, in turn, is estimated on the basis of the life-of-mine plan. Where the  major assets of a CGU are not dependent on the life of a related orebody, management applies judgement in estimating the remaining  service potential of long-lived assets. Factors affecting the remaining service potential of smelters include, for example, smelter  technology and electricity purchase contracts when power is not sourced from the Group, or in some cases from local governments  permitting electricity generation from hydropower stations.  Impact of climate change on our business - estimation of asset lives We expect there to be a higher demand for copper, aluminium, lithium and high-grade iron ore in order to meet demand for the minerals  required to transition to a low-carbon economic environment, consistent with the climate change commitments of the Paris Agreement.  We expect this to exceed new supply to the market and therefore increase prices. Under the Aspirational Leadership scenario, the  economic cut-off grade for our Ore Reserves is expected to be lower; in effect we would mine a greater volume of material before the  mines are depleted. We cannot quantify the difference this would make without undue cost as it would require revised mine plans, but for  property, plant and equipment this increased volume of material would reduce the depreciation charge during any given period for  assets that use the “Units of production” depreciation basis. Deferred stripping  In open pit mining operations, overburden and other waste materials must be removed to access ore from which minerals can be extracted  economically. The process of removing overburden and other waste materials is referred to as stripping. During the development of a mine  (or, in some instances, pit; see below), before production commences, stripping costs related to a component of an orebody are capitalised  as part of the cost of construction of the mine (or pit). These are then amortised over the life of the mine (or pit) on a units of production  basis.  Where a mine operates several open pits that are regarded as separate operations for the purpose of mine planning, initial stripping costs  are accounted for separately by reference to the ore from each separate pit. If, however, the pits are highly integrated for the purpose of  mine planning, the second and subsequent pits are regarded as extensions of the first pit in accounting for stripping costs. In such cases,  the initial stripping of the second and subsequent pits is considered to be production phase stripping (see below).  Key judgement - deferral of stripping costs We apply judgement as to whether multiple pits at a mine are considered separate or integrated operations. This determines whether the  stripping activities of a pit are classified as pre-production or production phase stripping and, therefore, the amortisation base for those  costs. The analysis depends on each mine’s specific circumstances and requires judgement: another mining company could make a  different judgement even when the fact pattern appears to be similar.  The following factors would point towards the initial stripping costs for the individual pits being accounted for separately:  – if mining of the second and subsequent pits is conducted consecutively following that of the first pit, rather than concurrently  – if separate investment decisions are made to develop each pit, rather than a single investment decision being made at the outset  – if the pits are operated as separate units in terms of mine planning and the sequencing of overburden removal and ore mining, rather  than as an integrated unit  – if expenditures for additional infrastructure to support the second and subsequent pits are relatively large  – if the pits extract ore from separate and distinct orebodies, rather than from a single orebody.  If the designs of the second and subsequent pits are significantly influenced by opportunities to optimise output from several pits  combined, including the co-treatment or blending of the output from the pits, then this would point to treatment as an integrated  operation for the purposes of accounting for initial stripping costs. The relative importance of each of the above factors is considered in  each case.  In order for production phase stripping costs to qualify for capitalisation as a stripping activity asset, 3 criteria must be met:  – it must be probable that there will be an economic benefit in a future accounting period because the stripping activity has improved  access to the orebody  – it must be possible to identify the “component” of the orebody for which access has been improved  – it must be possible to reliably measure the costs that relate to the stripping activity.  A “component” is a specific section of the orebody that is made more accessible by the stripping activity. It will typically be a subset of  the larger orebody that is distinguished by a separate useful economic life (for example, a pushback).  Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 186 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 189 ===== 13  Property, plant and equipment continued  Recognition and measurement of deferred stripping Phase Development Phase Production Phase Stripping activity  Overburden and other waste  removal during the development of a  mine before production commences. Production phase stripping can give access to 2 benefits: the extraction of ore in the current  period and improved access to ore which will be extracted in future periods. Period of benefit After commissioning of the mine. Future periods after first phase is complete. Current and future benefit are indistinguishable. Capitalised to  mining properties  and leases in  property, plant  and equipment During the development of a mine,  stripping costs relating to a  component of an orebody are  capitalised as part of the cost of  construction of the mine. It may be the case that subsequent phases of  stripping will access additional ore and that  these subsequent phases are only possible  after the first phase has taken place. Where  applicable, the Group considers this on a  mine-by-mine basis. Generally, the only ore  attributed to the stripping activity asset for  the purposes of calculating the life-of- component ratio is the ore to be extracted  from the originally identified component. Stripping costs for the component are deferred  to the extent that the current period ratio  exceeds the life-of-component ratio. Allocation to  inventory Not applicable Not applicable The stripping cost is allocated to inventory based  on a relevant production measure using a life-of- component strip ratio. The ratio divides the  tonnage of waste mined for the component for  the period either by the quantity of ore mined for  the component or by the quantity of minerals  contained in the ore mined for the component. In  some operations, the quantity of ore is a more  appropriate basis for allocating costs, particularly  when there are significant by-products. Component A “component” is a specific section of the orebody that is made more accessible by the stripping activity. It will typically be a subset of  the larger orebody that is distinguished by a separate useful economic life (for example, a pushback). Life-of-component  ratio The life-of-component ratios are based on the Ore Reserves of the mine (and for some mines, other Mineral Resources) and the annual mine  plan; they are a function of the mine design and, therefore, changes to that design will generally result in changes to the ratios. Changes in  other technical or economic parameters that impact the Ore Reserves (and for some mines, other mineral resources) may also have an  impact on the life-of-component ratios even if they do not affect the mine design. Changes to the ratios are accounted for prospectively. Depreciation basis Depreciated on a “units of production” basis based on expected production of either ore or minerals contained in the ore over the life of  the component unless another method is more appropriate.

Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 188 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 191 ===== 13  Property, plant and equipment continued  Impact of climate change on our business - useful economic lives of our power generating assets The Group has committed to reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions by 50% relative to our 2018 baseline by 2030 and  achieving net zero emission across our operations by 2050. We expect to invest US$5 billion to US$6 billion on carbon abatement  projects between 2022 and 2030. Transitioning electricity from principally fossil fuel-based power generating assets to principally  renewables is critical to achieving that goal. The carrying value of power generating assets is set out in the table below. The weighted  average remaining useful economic life of plant and equipment for fossil fuel-based power generating assets is 10 years (2023: 10 years).  Given the technical limitations of intermittent renewable energy generation and energy storage systems, and our need for reliable  baseload electricity, we expect our current generation assets will be integral to those needs for the foreseeable future. We are investing  in research and development and evaluating new market options that may overcome these technical challenges. Should pathways for  eliminating fossil fuel power generating assets be identified we may need to accelerate depreciation or impair the assets; however, at this  present moment the requirement for fossil fuel powered back-up means that early retirement of the assets is not expected and no  change to depreciation rates is required.  2024 2023 Net book value of power generating assets powered by Land and buildings US$m Plant and equipment US$m Land and buildings US$m Plant and equipment US$m – Fossil fuels   59   840   87   932  – Renewables   177   2,375   201   2,456  Right-of-use assets – leased  2024 2023 Land and buildings US$m Plant and equipment US$m Total US$m Land and buildings US$m Plant and equipment US$m Total US$m Net book value At 1 January    543   635   1,178   515   488   1,003  Adjustment on currency translation   (37)   (24)   (61)   11   4   15  Additions   150   420   570   96   420   516  Depreciation for the year   (125)   (353)   (478)   (88)   (305)   (393)  Net impairment reversal/(charges)(a)   –   5   5   (1)   (7)   (8)  Disposals   –   –   –   –   (1)   (1)  Transfers and other movements   (7)   21   14   10   36   46  At 31 December   524   704   1,228   543   635   1,178  (a) Refer to note 4 for details. The leased assets of the Group include land and buildings (mainly office buildings) and plant and equipment, the majority of which are  marine vessels. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of terms and conditions. Right-of-use assets are  depreciated on a straight line basis over the life of the lease, taking into account any extensions that are likely to be exercised.  14  Close-down, restoration and environmental provisions  Recognition and measurement The Group has provisions for close-down and restoration costs, which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, the removal  of residual materials and the remediation of disturbed areas for mines and certain refineries and smelters. The obligation may arise during  development or during the production phase of a facility. These provisions are based on all regulatory requirements and any other  commitments made to stakeholders. The provision excludes the impact of future disturbance that is planned to occur during the life of mine,  so that it represents only existing disturbance as at the balance sheet date.  Closure provisions are not made for those operations that have no known restrictions on their lives as the closure dates cannot be reliably  estimated; instead a contingent liability is disclosed. Refer to note 37 for details. This applies primarily to certain Canadian smelters that have  indefinite-lived water rights from local governments permitting electricity generation from hydropower stations and are not tied to a specific  orebody.  Close-down and restoration costs are a normal consequence of mining or production, and the majority of close-down and restoration  expenditure is incurred in the years following closure of the mine, refinery or smelter. Although the ultimate cost to be incurred is uncertain,  the Group’s businesses estimate their costs using current restoration standards, techniques and expected climate conditions. The costs are  estimated on the basis of a closure plan, and are reviewed at each reporting period during the life of the operation to reflect known  developments. The estimates are also subject to formal review, with appropriate external support, at regular intervals.   The timing of closure and the rehabilitation plans for the site can be uncertain and dependent upon future capital allocation decisions, which  involve estimation of future economic circumstances and business cases. In such circumstances, the closure provision is estimated using  probability weighting of the different remediation and closure scenarios.  Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 189 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 192 ===== 14  Close-down, restoration and environmental provisions continued  The initial close-down and restoration provision is capitalised within “Property, plant and equipment”. Subsequent movements in the close- down and restoration provisions for ongoing operations are treated as an adjustment to cost within “Property, plant and equipment”. This  includes those resulting from new disturbances related to expansions or other activities qualifying for capitalisation; updated cost estimates;  changes to the estimated lives of operations; changes to the timing of closure activities; and revisions to discount rates.  Changes in closure provisions relating to closed and fully impaired operations are charged/credited to “Net operating costs” in the income  statement.  Where rehabilitation is conducted systematically over the life of the operation, rather than at the time of closure, provision is made for the  estimated outstanding continuous rehabilitation work at each balance sheet date and the cost is charged to the income statement.  The closure provision is represented by forecast future underlying cash flows expressed in real terms at the balance sheet date. These are  discounted for the time value of money based on a long-term view of low-risk market yields which includes a review of historic trends plus  risks and opportunities for which future cash flows have not been adjusted, namely potential improvements in closure practices between the  reporting date and the point at which rehabilitation spend takes place. The real-terms discount rate used is 2.5% (2023: 2.0%) which is  applied to all locations since we expect to meet closure cash flows principally from US dollar revenues and financing, with activities  coordinated by the Group’s central closure team. To roll forward those real-terms cash flows between periods, we identify local rates of inflation based on Producer Price Inflation (PPI)  indices and, together with the real-terms discount rate, unwind the discount through the line “Amortisation of discount on provisions”, shown  within “Finance items” in the income statement. This nominal rate for cost escalation in the current financial year is estimated at the start of  each half-year and applied systematically for 6 months. At the end of each half-year we update the underlying cash flows for the latest  estimate of experienced inflation, if it differs materially from our forecast, for the current financial year and record this as “changes to existing  provisions”. For operating sites this adjustment usually results in a corresponding adjustment to property, plant and equipment, and for  closed and fully impaired sites the adjustment is charged or credited to the income statement. In some cases, our subsidiaries make a contribution to trust funds in order to meet or reimburse future environmental and decommissioning  costs. Amounts due for reimbursement from trust funds are not offset against the corresponding closure provision unless payments into the  fund have the effect of passing the closure obligation to the trust.  Environmental costs result from environmental damage that was not a necessary consequence of operations, and may include remediation,  compensation and penalties. Provision is made for the estimated present value of such costs at the balance sheet date. These costs are  charged to “Net operating costs”, except for the unwinding of the discount which is shown within “Amortisation of discount on provisions”.  Remediation procedures may commence soon after the time the disturbance, remediation process and estimated remediation costs  become known, but can continue for many years depending on the nature of the disturbance and the remediation techniques used.

These are included within “Receivables and other assets” on the  balance sheet. Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 190 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 193 ===== 14  Close-down, restoration and environmental provisions continued Key judgement - close-down, restoration and environmental obligations We use our judgement and experience to determine the potential scope of closure rehabilitation work required to meet the Group’s legal,  statutory and constructive obligations, and any other commitments made to stakeholders, and the options and techniques available to  meet those obligations in order to estimate the associated costs and the likely timing of those costs. Significant judgement is also  required to then determine both the costs associated with that work and the other assumptions used to calculate the provision. External  experts support the cost estimation process where appropriate but there remains significant estimation uncertainty.  The key judgement in applying this accounting policy is determining when an estimate is sufficiently reliable to make or adjust a closure  provision. Adjustments are made to provisions when the range of possible outcomes becomes sufficiently narrow to permit reliable  estimation. Depending on the materiality of the change, adjustments may require review and endorsement by the Group’s Closure  Steering Committee before the provision is updated. Cost provisions are updated throughout the life of the operation with conceptual study estimates reviewed every 5 years. Within 10 years from the  expected closure date, closure cost estimates must comply with the Group’s Capital Project Framework. This means, for example, that where an  Order of Magnitude (OoM) study is required for closure, it must be of the same standard as an OoM study for a new mine, smelter or refinery. In 2023, a reforecast for the Ranger Uranium mine operated by Energy Resources of Australia resulted in an increase to the closure  provision of US$850 million. The majority of the provision increase was attributable to rehabilitation activities post 2027 and is subject to  further study which could result in material change to the provision. These activities remain subject to a number of studies and are also  potentially sensitive to external events such as rainfall.  In some cases, the closure study may indicate that monitoring and, potentially, remediation will be required indefinitely - for example,  groundwater treatment. In these cases, the underlying cash flows for the provision may be restricted to a period for which the costs can  be reliably estimated, which on average is around 30 years. Where an alternative commercial arrangement to meet our obligations can be  predicted with confidence, this period may be shorter.

In developing  low-carbon solutions for our mobile fleet, this may include electrification of the vehicles during the mine life. The forecast cash flows for the heavy mobile equipment in the closure cost  estimate are based on existing fuel sources. The cost incurred during closure could reduce if these activities are powered by renewable energy. (b) Long-term water management relates to the post-closure treatment of water due to acid rock drainage and other environmental commitments and is an area of research and  development focus for our Closure team. The cost of this water processing can continue for many years after the bulk earthworks and demolition activities have completed and are  therefore exposed to long-term climate change. This could materially affect rates of precipitation and therefore change the volume of water requiring processing. It is not currently  possible to forecast accurately the impact this could have on the closure provision as some of our locations could experience drier conditions whereas others could experience greater  rainfall. A further consideration relates to the alternative commercial use for the processed water, which could support ultimate transfer of these costs to a third party. (c) Indirect costs, owners' costs and contingency include adjustments to the underlying cash flows to align the closure provision with a central-case estimate. This excludes allowances for  quantitative estimation uncertainties, which are allocated to the underlying cost driver and presented within the respective cost categories above.

Although the ultimate cost to be incurred is uncertain, the Group’s businesses estimate their respective costs  based on current restoration standards, techniques and expected climate conditions.                           Key accounting estimate - close-down, restoration and environmental obligations The most significant assumptions and estimates used in calculating the provision are: – Closure timeframes. The weighted average remaining lives of operations is shown above. Some expenditure may be incurred before  closure while the operation as a whole is in production. – The length of any post-closure monitoring period. This will depend on the specific site requirements and the availability of alternative  commercial arrangements; some expenditure can continue into perpetuity. The Rio Tinto Kennecott closure and environmental  remediation provision includes an allowance for ongoing monitoring and remediation costs, including groundwater treatment, of  approximately US$0.7 billion. – The probability weighting of possible closure scenarios. The most significant impact of probability weighting is at the Pilbara operations  (Iron Ore) relating to infrastructure, and incorporates the expectation that some infrastructure will be retained by the relevant State  authorities post closure. The assignment of probabilities to this scenario reduces the closure provision by US$0.5 billion. – Appropriate sources on which to base the calculation of the discount rate. The discount rate, by nature, is subjective and therefore  sensitivities are shown below for how the provision balance, which at 31 December 2024 was US$15,731 million, would change if  discounted at alternative discount rates.  There is significant estimation uncertainty in the calculation of the provision and cost estimates can vary in response to many  factors including: – changes to the relevant legal or local/national government requirements and any other commitments made to stakeholders – review of remediation and relinquishment options – additional remediation requirements identified during the rehabilitation – the emergence of new restoration techniques – precipitation rates and climate change – change in foreign exchange rates – change in the expected closure date – change in the discount rate. Experience gained at other mine or production sites may also change expected methods or costs of closure, although elements of the  restoration and rehabilitation can be unique to each site. Generally, there is relatively limited restoration and rehabilitation activity and  historical precedent elsewhere in the Group, or in the industry as a whole, against which to benchmark cost estimates. The expected timing of expenditure can also change for other reasons, for example because of changes to expectations relating to Ore  Reserves and Mineral Resources, production rates, renewal of operating licences or economic conditions.  Changes in closure cost estimates at the Group’s ongoing operations could result in a material adjustment to assets and liabilities in the  next 12 months and would also impact the depreciation and the unwinding of discount in future years. Changes to closure cost estimates for closed operations, and changes to environmental cost estimates at any operation, could cause a  material adjustment to the income statement and closure liability. We do not consider that there is significant risk of a change in  estimates for these liabilities causing a material adjustment to the income statement in the next 12 months. Any new environmental  incidents may require a material provision but cannot be predicted.  Project-specific risks are embedded within the cash flows which are based on a central case estimate of closure activities assuming that  the obligation is fulfilled by the Group. These cash flows are then discounted, as mentioned above, using a consistent discount rate  applied to all locations.  Impact of climate change on our business - close-down, restoration and environmental costs The underlying costs for closure have been estimated with varying degrees of precision based on a function of the age of the underlying  asset and proximity to closure. For assets within 10 years of closure, closure plans and cost estimates are supported by detailed studies  which are refined as the closure date approaches. These closure studies consider climate change and plan for resilience to expected  climate conditions with a particular focus on precipitation rates. For new developments, consideration of climate change and ultimate  closure conditions are an important part of the approval process. For longer-lived assets, closure provisions are typically based on  conceptual level studies that are refreshed at least every 5 years; these are evolving to incorporate greater consideration of forecast  climate conditions at closure. Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 192 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 195 ===== 14  Close-down, restoration and environmental provisions continued  Sensitivity analysis Close-down, restoration and environmental provisions of US$15,731 million (2023: US$17,150 million) are based on risk-adjusted cash flows  expressed in real terms. The recent upward trajectory in interest rates has resulted in expectations of higher yields from long-dated bonds,  including the 30-year US Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, which is a key input to our closure provision discount rate. On 30 June  2024, we revised the closure discount rate from 2.0% to 2.5% (2023: from 1.5% to 2.0% on 30 June 2023), applied prospectively from that  date. This assumption is based on the currency in which we plan to fund the closures and our expectation of long-term interest rate and  exchange rate parity in the locations of our operations.

The movement in deferred tax (liabilities)/assets during the year is as follows. 2024  US$m 2023 US$m At 1 January   1,040   (368)  Adjustment on currency translation   (10)   19  Credited/(charged) to the income statement   393   1,260  (Charged)/credited to statement of comprehensive income(a)   (32)   153  Other movements(b)   (10)   (24)  At 31 December   1,381   1,040  Comprising: – deferred tax assets(c)(d)   4,016   3,624  – deferred tax liabilities(e)   (2,635)   (2,584)  (a) The amounts credited/(charged) directly to the statement of comprehensive income include provisions for tax on cash flow hedges and on remeasurement gains/(losses) on pension  schemes and on post-retirement healthcare plans.  (b) “Other movements” include deferred tax relating to tax payable recognised by subsidiary holding companies on the profits of the equity accounted units to which it relates.  (c) Recognised deferred tax assets of US$1,293 million (2023: US$1,182 million) are subject to expiry if not recovered within certain time limits as specified in local tax legislation and  investment agreements. Of those recognised assets, US$66 million (2023: US$nil) would expire within one year if not used, US$93 million (2023: US$140 million) would expire within one  to 5 years, and US$1,134 million (2023: US$1,042 million) would expire in more than 5 years. (d) Recognised and unrecognised deferred tax assets are shown in the table on page 195 and totalled US$9,994 million at 31 December 2024 (2023: US$10,040 million). Of this total,  US$4,016 million has been recognised as deferred tax assets (2023: US$3,624 million), leaving US$5,978 million (2023: US$6,416 million) unrecognised, as recovery is not considered  probable.  (e) Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and joint ventures totalling US$2,152 million (2023: US$2,249 million) where the Group is able to  control the timing of the remittance and it is probable that there will be no remittance in the foreseeable future. If these earnings were remitted, tax of US$99 million (2023: US$110  million) would be payable.

(b) Other temporary differences include research and development, investment and other tax credits and allowances of US$540 million (2023: US$583 million). (c) Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and joint ventures totalling US$2,152 million (2023: US$2,249 million) where the Group is able to  control the timing of the remittance and it is probable that there will be no remittance in the foreseeable future. If these earnings were remitted, tax of US$99 million (2023: US$110  million) would be payable. Other relevant judgements - recoverability of deferred tax assets In considering the recoverability of deferred tax assets, judgement is required regarding the extent to which certain risk factors are likely  to affect the recovery of these assets. These risk factors include the risk of expiry of losses prior to utilisation, the impact of other  legislation or tax regimes, such as minimum taxes, and consideration of factors that lead to the generation of losses or other deferred tax  assets. IAS 12 requires us to consider whether taxable profits will be available against which deferred tax assets may be utilised.  The Mongolian Tax Authority has issued a number of tax assessments covering the fiscal years 2013 to 2020, the most recent of which  was received in December 2023, which are inconsistent with the Oyu Tolgoi Investment Agreement and Mongolian legislation. The  matters under dispute have been referred to international arbitration. Differences in interpretation of the Investment Agreement and  Mongolian legislation could have a material impact on the amount and/or recovery of recognised deferred tax items, including tax losses.  The arbitration process on matters of this complexity can typically take over 12 months to conclude.

Recognised Unrecognised At 31 December 2024  US$m 2023 US$m 2024  US$m 2023 US$m France   –   –   1,233   1,320  Canada    331   383   511   501  US(a)   262   204   926   977  Australia   1,132   991   563   842  Mongolia(b)   1,780   1,530   68   235  Other countries   511   516   2,677   2,541  Total(c)(d)   4,016   3,624   5,978   6,416  (a) Although our US Group companies expect to generate sufficient taxable profits to utilise existing Federal deferred tax assets, the application of the new Corporate Alternative Minimum  Tax (CAMT) rules has resulted in a position where the future tax benefit derived from utilisation of Federal deferred tax assets is limited and consequently these deferred tax assets are  included as “unrecognised” in this table. (b) Deferred tax assets in Mongolia include US$419 million (2023: US$310 million) from tax losses that expire if not recovered against taxable profits within 8 years. In addition, amounts  have been recognised as deferred tax assets relating to anticipated future deductions. Tax losses and other deferred tax assets have been calculated in accordance with the Oyu Tolgoi  Investment Agreement and Mongolian legislation. The interpretation of the Investment Agreement by the Mongolian Tax Authority is under dispute and has been referred to  international arbitration. Differences in interpretation of the Investment Agreement and Mongolian legislation could have a material impact on the amount and/or period of recovery of  deferred tax assets.  (c) US$2,561 million (2023: US$2,455 million) of the unrecognised assets relate to realised or unrealised capital losses, the recovery of which depends on the existence of capital gains in  future years. There are time limits, the shortest of which is one year, for the recovery of US$249 million of the unrecognised assets (2023: US$543 million). (d) In addition to the unrecognised deferred tax assets in this table, the Group has accumulated UK foreign tax credits of US$1.4 billion (2023: US$1.3 billion). The credits are not refundable  but would be available, if needed, to shelter any UK tax in respect of profits arising in the Escondida business. 16  Inventories Recognition and measurement Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value, primarily on a weighted average cost basis. Third-party production  purchased for our own use that is ordinarily interchangeable in accordance with IAS 2 “Inventories” is valued on the same basis, jointly with  our own production. Average costs are calculated by reference to the cost levels experienced in the relevant month together with those in  opening inventory.  The cost of raw materials and purchased components, and consumable stores, is the purchase price. The cost of work in progress and  finished goods and goods for resale is generally the cost of production, including directly attributable labour costs, materials and contractor  expenses, the depreciation of assets used in production and production overheads.   Work in progress includes ore stockpiles and other partly processed material. Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted and is  available for further processing. If there is significant uncertainty as to if and when the stockpiled ore will be processed, the cost of such ore  is expensed as mined. If the ore will not be processed within 12 months after the balance sheet date, it is included within non-current assets  and net realisable value is calculated on a discounted cash flow basis. Quantities of stockpiled ore are assessed primarily through surveys  and assays. Certain estimates, including expected metal recoveries, are calculated using available industry, engineering and scientific data,  and are periodically reassessed, taking into account technical analysis and historical performance.  2024  US$m 2023 US$m Raw materials and purchased components   971   1,050  Consumable stores   1,560   1,520  Work in progress   1,931   2,467  Finished goods and goods for resale   1,620   1,836  Total inventories   6,082   6,873  Comprising: Expected to be used within one year   5,860   6,659  Expected to be used after more than one year   222   214  Total inventories   6,082   6,873  During 2024, the Group recognised a net inventory write-off of US$49 million (2023: US$60 million write-off). This included inventory write- offs of US$77 million (2023: US$94 million) partly offset by a write-back of previously written down inventory due to an increase in realisable  values amounting to US$28 million (2023: US$34 million).  At 31 December 2024, US$947 million (2023: US$925 million) of inventories were pledged as security for liabilities. Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 195 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 198 ===== 17  Receivables and other assets  Recognition and measurement  Financial assets (except provisionally priced receivables) which are held under a hold to collect business model and have cash flows that  meet the solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) criteria are recognised at amortised cost. Provisionally priced receivables are  measured at fair value through profit or loss with subsequent fair value gains or losses taken to the income statement. As a part of our working capital management, we offer receivables factoring and letter of credit programs for our customers/receivables. For our  receivables under letter of credit programs, the business model of ''hold to collect'' has not changed and these continue to be recognised at  amortised cost as the sale of the letter of credit is made close to maturity of receivables and discounting costs are immaterial. The receivables  under our global factoring program do not meet the ''hold to collect'' model and therefore are recognised at fair value through profit or loss and  continue to be classified as trade receivables within operating cash flows. US$588 million of receivables (2023: US$475 million) are subject to our  factoring program and US$510 million (2023: US$372 million) of receivables subject to a letter of credit discounting program have been  transferred to the participating banks and derecognised at the reporting date. 2024 2023 Non-current US$m Current  US$m Total  US$m Non-current US$m Current US$m Total US$m Trade receivables(a)   –   2,344   2,344   –   2,461   2,461  Other financial receivables(a)   355   643   998   234   548   782  Other receivables(b)   380   429   809   470   347   817  Prepayment of tolling charges to jointly controlled entities(c)   94   –   94   113   –   113  Pension surpluses (note 28)   405   –   405   466   –   466  Other prepayments    163   825   988   376   589   965  Total(d)   1,397   4,241   5,638   1,659   3,945   5,604  (a) At 31 December 2024, trade receivables and other financial receivables are stated net of allowances for expected credit losses of US$72 million (2023: US$82 million). We apply the  “simplified approach” to trade receivables and receivables relating to net investment in finance leases and a “general approach” to all other financial assets.  (b) At 31 December 2024, other receivables include US$333 million (2023: US$349 million) related to Energy Resources of Australia Ltd’s (ERA) deposit held in a trust fund which is controlled by the  Government of Australia. ERA are entitled to reimbursement from the fund once specific phases of rehabilitation relating to the Ranger Project are completed. The fund is outside the scope of IFRS 9. (c) These prepayments will be charged to Group operating costs as tolling services are rendered and product processing occurs.  (d) There is no material element of receivables and other assets that is interest-bearing or financing in nature. The fair value of current trade and other receivables and the majority of  amounts classified as non-current trade and other receivables approximates to their carrying value.  Credit risk related to receivables  Our Commercial team manages customer credit risk by reference to our established policy, procedures and controls. The team establishes credit  limits for all of our customers. Where customers are rated by an independent credit rating agency, these ratings are used as a guide to set credit  limits. Where there are no independent credit ratings available, we assess the credit quality of the customer through a credit rating model and assign  appropriate credit limits. The Commercial team monitors outstanding customer receivables regularly and highlights any credit concerns to senior  management. Receivables to high-risk customers are often secured by letters of credit or other forms of credit enhancement. The expected credit loss on our trade receivable portfolio is insignificant. 18  Trade and other payables  Recognition and measurement  Trade payables are measured at amortised cost, with the exception of provisionally priced contracts which are held at fair value as per IFRS 9. 2024 2023 Non-current  US$m Current US$m Total US$m Non-current US$m Current US$m Total US$m Trade payables   –   3,196   3,196   –   3,265   3,265  Other financial payables   188   1,192   1,380   238   913   1,151  Other payables   42   143   185   56   208   264  Deferred income(a)   118   338   456   103   280   383  Accruals   –   1,751   1,751   –   1,702   1,702  Employee entitlements   –   920   920   –   992   992  Royalties and mining taxes   2   622   624   3   868   871  Amounts owed to equity accounted units   193   16   209   196   10   206  Total   543   8,178   8,721   596   8,238   8,834  (a) Deferred income includes contract liabilities of US$358 million (2023: US$275 million).  The fair value of trade payables and financial instruments within other financial payables approximates their carrying value.  Supplier finance arrangements The Group participates in supplier finance arrangements with designated banks whereby suppliers may elect to receive early payment of their invoice  from a third-party bank by factoring their receivable from Rio Tinto. These arrangements do not modify the terms of the original liability with respect to  either counterparty terms, settlement date or amount due. Although they are open to a wide range of suppliers, we typically see a take up for suppliers  with payment terms ranging from 60 to 105 days, similar to the prior year. For comparable trade payables that are not part of supplier finance  arrangements the range of payment terms are similar. Use of the early settlement facility is voluntary and at the suppliers' discretion on an invoice-by- invoice basis. Financial liabilities subject to supplier finance arrangements, therefore, continue to be classified as trade payables with cash outflows  showing within operating cash flows. There were no significant non-cash changes in the carrying amount of the trade payables included in the Group's  supplier finance arrangements. As at 31 December 2024, the carrying value of the financial liabilities that are part of supplier finance arrangements presented within trade  payables amounts to US$714 million (2023: US$821 million), of which US$603 million (2023: US$754 million) relates to amounts that  suppliers have already received as payment from the banks on the reporting date.  Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 196 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 199 ===== Our capital and liquidity Our overriding objective when managing capital and liquidity is to safeguard the business as a going concern. Capital is allocated in a consistent  and disciplined manner. Essential capital expenditure remains our priority for capital allocation. It includes sustaining capital to ensure the  integrity of our assets, high-returning replacement projects and decarbonisation investment. This is followed by ordinary dividends within our  well-established returns policy. We then test investment in compelling growth projects against debt management and additional cash returns to  shareholders.  Our Board and senior management regularly review the capital structure and liquidity of the Group. They take into account our strategic priorities, the  economic and business conditions, and any identified investment opportunities, along with the expected returns to shareholders. We expect total cash  returns to shareholders over the longer term to be in a range of 40–60% of underlying earnings in aggregate through the commodity cycle.  We consider various financial metrics when managing our capital structure and liquidity risk, including total capital, net debt, gearing, the  overall level of borrowings and their maturity profile, liquidity levels, future cash flows, underlying EBITDA and interest cover ratios.  Our total capital as at 31 December is shown in the table below. Note 2024  US$m 2023 US$m Equity attributable to owners of Rio Tinto (see consolidated balance sheet)   55,246   54,586  Equity attributable to non-controlling interests (see consolidated balance sheet)   2,719   1,755  Net debt 19   5,491   4,231  Total capital   63,456   60,572  We have access to various forms of financing including corporate bonds issued in debt capital markets through our US Shelf and European  Medium Term Note Programmes, commercial paper, project finance, bank loans and credit facilities. In November 2024, we entered into a US$7 billion bridge facility to support the funding required for the proposed acquisition of Arcadium  Lithium, which is expected to close in March 2025 (refer to note 5 for details). The Group also has an existing US$7.5 billion multi-currency  revolving credit facility which matures in November 2028. Both facilities remained undrawn throughout the year. At 31 December 2024, the  Group’s subsidiaries had available in aggregate US$738 million (2023: US$558 million) of committed borrowing facilities; these amounts are  available for use by the respective holders of each facility only and are not available for use across the Group.   Our credit ratings as at 31 December, as provided by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investor Services, were:  2024 2023 Long-term rating A/A1 A/A1 Short-term rating A-1/P-1 A-1/P-1 Outlook Stable/Stable Stable/Stable Our unified credit status is maintained through cross guarantees, which mean the contractual obligations of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto  Limited are automatically guaranteed by the other.  Financial liability analysis In the table below, we summarise the maturity profile of our financial liabilities on our balance sheet based on contractual undiscounted  payments as at 31 December. When the amount payable is not fixed, the amount disclosed is determined by reference to the conditions  existing at the end of the reporting period.

Interest  payments have been projected using interest rates applicable at the end of the applicable financial year. Where debt is subject to variable interest rates, future interest payments are subject  to change in line with market rates.  (b) The maturity grouping is based on the earliest payment date.

Our  policy is to predominantly borrow in US dollars (USD) at floating interest rates, either directly or through the use of derivatives, as:  – the majority of our sales are in USD  – historically a lower cost of borrowing has been observed from maintaining a floating rate exposure  – historically there has been a correlation between interest rates and commodity prices.  For bonds with fixed interest rates, we generally enter into interest rate swaps to convert them to floating rates. The tenor of the interest rate  swaps is sometimes shorter than the tenor of the bond which means we remain exposed to long-term fixed-rate funding. As interest rate  swaps mature, new medium dated swaps are generally transacted to maintain this floating rate exposure; however, we may elect to maintain  a proportion of fixed-rate funding after considering market conditions, the cost and form of funding and other related factors. We have designated the swaps to be in fair value hedge relationships with the corresponding period of future interest payments of the  respective debt. Where we borrow non-US denominated debt, we generally enter into cross-currency interest rate swaps to convert the principal and fixed  interest coupon to a USD nominal with a USD interest coupon.

(b) The LIBOR reference rates derivatives were transitioned to Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) with effect from 1 July 2023 in accordance with International Swaps and  Derivatives Association (ISDA) Fallback Protocol. Weighted average interest rate after swaps for 2023 can be found in note 20 to the Financial Statements in our 2023 Annual Report. (c) On 11 December 2024 we repaid our €417 million (nominal value) Rio Tinto Finance plc Euro Bonds on their maturity. The cash outflow relating to the repayment of the bonds and the  realised loss on the derivatives have been recognised within ''Repayment of borrowings and associated derivatives'' in the Group cash flow statement and totalled US$546 million. (d) In November 2024, our interest rate swap which converted our fixed coupon interest payments on this bond to 3 month SOFR +5.69%, matured. We entered into a new interest rate  swap to convert our fixed coupon interest payments on this bond to 6 month SOFR + 3.33%. (e) Rio Tinto has a US$10 billion (2023: US$10 billion) European Medium Term Note Program against which the cumulative amount utilised was US$626 million equivalent at 31 December  2024 (2023: US$1,102 million). The carrying value of these bonds after hedge accounting adjustments amounted to US$624 million (2023: US$1,063 million) in aggregate.  (f) .We applied cash flow hedge accounting to this bond and the corresponding cross currency interest rate swap. The hedge is fully effective as the notional amount, maturity, payment  and reset dates match. In 2019, we swapped the resulting fixed US dollar annual interest coupon payments to floating rates. Fair value hedge accounting has been applied to this  relationship in addition to the pre-existing cash flow hedge. In December 2024, our existing interest rate swap on this bond matured, therefore, the bond is no longer in a hedged  position. (g) In April and October 2024 we entered into new interest rate swaps to convert our fixed coupon on this bond to 6 month SOFR +0.96%. (h) In February, March and April 2024 we entered into a new interest rate swap to convert our fixed coupon on this bond to 6 month SOFR +1.18%. (i) In December 2024 we entered into a new interest rate swaps to convert our fixed coupon on this bond to 6 month SOFR +0.65%. (j) These borrowings relate to the Oyu Tolgoi LLC project finance facility and the due dates stated represent the final repayment date. The interest rates stated are pre-completion and will  increase by 1.2% post-completion, which is expected to take place in 2029 subject to meeting certain conditions. Refer below on the refinancing of the facility made during 2023.   (k) Our bank borrowings in Oyu Tolgoi (OT) are subject to financial covenants which require that OT maintains a certain level of debt-equity ratio and a debt service coverage ratio. These  covenants are tested at the end of each month. Based on our forecasting, we consider this risk of non-compliance with these covenants to be remote. (l) The Group’s borrowings of US$12,442 million (2023: US$13,001 million) include US$3,945 million (2023: US$3,994 million) of subsidiary entity borrowings that are subject to various  financial and general covenants with which the respective borrowers were in compliance as at 31 December 2024 and are expected to be in compliance within 12 months after the  reporting date. The non-compliance with these covenants, if not remediated, would permit the lender to immediately call the loan and borrowings. In the prior year, we refinanced the Oyu Tolgoi project finance with a syndicate of international financial institutions, export credit agencies  and commercial lenders. The lenders agreed to a deferral of the principal repayments by 3 years to June 2026 and to an extension of the  final maturity date by 5 years from 2030 to 2035. As part of refinancing, the debt transitioned to the SOFR benchmark to which we applied  the Phase 2 IBOR reform relief under IFRS 9. The refinancing did not result in a derecognition of the drawn down amount, however we  recognised an accounting loss on modification of US$123 million related to changes other than the benchmark transition and capitalised  transaction costs incurred of US$50 million.  Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 199 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 202 ===== 21  Leases  Recognition and measurement IFRS 16 applies to the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. Certain leases are exempt from the standard, including  leases to explore for or use minerals, oil, natural gas and similar non-regenerative resources. We apply the scope exemptions in paragraphs 3(e)  and 4 of IFRS 16 and do not apply the standard to leases of any assets which would otherwise fall within the scope of IAS 38 “Intangible Assets”.  A significant proportion of our lease arrangements relate to dry bulk vessels and office properties. Other leases include land and non-mining  rights, warehouses, ports, equipment and vehicles.   We recognise all lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet, with the exception of short-term (12 months or  fewer) and low-value leases, where payments are expensed as incurred. Lease liabilities are recorded at the present value of fixed payments;  variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate; amounts payable under residual value guarantees; and extension options expected  to be exercised. Where a lease contains an extension option that we can exercise without negotiation, lease payments for the extension  period are included in the liability if we are reasonably certain that we will exercise the option. Variable lease payments not dependent on an  index or rate are excluded from the calculation of lease liabilities at initial recognition. Payments are discounted at the incremental borrowing  rate of the lessee, unless the interest rate implicit in the lease can be readily determined. For lease agreements relating to vessels, ports and  properties, non-lease components are excluded from the projection of future lease payments and recorded separately within operating  costs as services are being provided. The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The right-of-use  asset arising from a lease arrangement at initial recognition reflects the lease liability, initial direct costs, lease payments made before the  commencement date of the lease, and capitalised provision for dismantling and restoration of the underlying asset, less any lease incentives.  We recognise depreciation on right-of-use assets and interest on lease liabilities in the income statement over the lease term. Repayments  of lease liabilities are separated into a principal portion (presented within financing activities) and an interest portion (which the Group  presents in operating activities) in the cash flow statement. Payments made before the commencement date are included within financing  activities unless they in substance represent investing cash flows, for example where pre-commencement cash flows are significant relative  to aggregate cash flows of the leasing arrangement. Other relevant judgements - accounting for renewable power purchase agreements We have to apply judgement for certain contractual arrangements, such as renewable energy power purchase agreements (PPAs), in  evaluating whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the renewable energy assets,  including the right to obtain physical energy these assets generate. Based on our evaluation, we determine whether an arrangement is a  lease, an executory contract or a derivative. An immaterial amount was recognised as a lease at 31 December 2024 for a fixed component  of the QMM renewable PPA. The Amrun PPA is a lease, which has not yet commenced and is included in capital commitments (note 37).

Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 200 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 203 ===== 22  Cash and cash equivalents Recognition and measurement For the purpose of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents covers cash on hand, deposits held with banks, and short-term, highly  liquid investments (mainly money market funds and reverse repurchase agreements) that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash  and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts are shown as current liabilities on the balance sheet. For the  purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of overdrafts.

Of  this balance, US$194 million (2023: US$156 million) could be used to repay subsidiaries’ third-party borrowings.  There are also restrictions on a further US$1,150 million (2023: US$553 million) of cash and cash equivalents, the majority of which is held by  partially owned subsidiaries and is not available for use in the wider Group due to legal and contractual restrictions currently in place. Of this  balance US$157 million (2023: US$129 million) could be used to repay these subsidiaries’ third-party borrowings.  Credit risk related to cash and cash equivalents  Our Treasury team manages credit risk from our investing activities in accordance with a credit risk framework which sets the risk  appetite. We make investments of surplus funds only with approved investment grade (BBB+ and above) counterparties who have been  assigned specific credit limits. The limits are set to minimise the concentration of credit risk and therefore mitigate the potential for  financial loss through counterparty failure.  23  Other financial assets and liabilities Recognition and measurement Derivatives are measured at fair value through profit or loss unless they are designated as hedging instruments. For details about our  hedging strategy and risks, refer to note 24. The Group has made an irrevocable choice to measure investments in equity shares at fair value  through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) except for those held for trading purposes.

Credit risk related to other financial assets Our Treasury team manages credit risk in relation to applicable other financial assets in accordance with our counterparty credit framework  (which is reviewed biannually) to minimise our counterparty risk and mitigate financial loss through counterparty failure. Derivatives and  investments with any given counterparty are required to be within the credit limit (based on a quantitative credit risk model) for that  counterparty as approved by the Group’s Financial Risk Management Committee. Our investments are dictated by the Group’s investment  policy which sets out a number of criteria for eligible investments, including credit quality, duration, maturity and concentration limits.

Agreements with derivative counterparties are  based on the International Swaps and Derivatives Association master netting agreements that do not meet the criteria for offsetting, but allow for  the related amounts to be set-off in certain circumstances. During the year, there were no material amounts offset in the balance sheet.  24  Financial instruments and risk management  Recognition and measurement We classify our financial assets into those held at amortised cost and those to be measured at fair value either through the profit and loss  (FVTPL) or through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) based on the business model for managing the financial assets and the  contractual terms of the cash flows.  Classification of  financial asset Amortised cost Fair value through profit  and loss Fair value through other comprehensive income Recognition and  initial  measurement At initial recognition, trade receivables that do  not have a significant financing component are  recognised at their transaction price. Other  financial assets are initially recognised at fair  value plus related transaction costs. The asset is initially  recognised at fair value  with transaction costs  immediately expensed to  the income statement.  The asset is initially recognised at fair value.   Subsequent  measurement Amortised cost using the effective interest  method.  Fair value movements are  recognised in the income  statement. Fair value gains or losses on revaluation of such equity  investments, including any foreign exchange component,  are recognised in other comprehensive income. Dividends  are recognised in the income statement when the right to  receive payment is established.  Derecognition Any gain or loss on derecognition or modification  of a financial asset held at amortised cost is  recognised in the income statement. Not applicable. When the equity investment is derecognised, there is no  recycling of fair value gains or losses previously recognised  in other comprehensive income to the income statement. Borrowings and other financial liabilities (including trade payables but excluding derivative liabilities) are recognised initially at fair value, net  of transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Financial risk management objectives Our financial risk management objectives are:  – to have in place a robust capital structure to manage the organisation through the commodity cycle  – to allow our financial exposures, mainly commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rates to, in general, float with the market.  Our Treasury and Commercial teams manage the following key economic risks generated from our operations: – capital and liquidity risk  – credit risk – interest rate risk – commodity price risk – foreign exchange risk. These teams operate under a strong control environment, within approved limits. (i) Capital and liquidity risk Our capital and liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may not be able to settle or meet our obligations as they fall due. Refer to our  capital and liquidity section on page 197. As disclosed in note 18, under the supplier finance arrangements, the Group makes payments to participating banks on the same date as  stated on the vendor’s invoice, and as such these arrangements do not give rise to additional liquidity risk. (ii) Credit risk  Credit risk is the risk that our customers, or institutions that we hold investments with, are unable to meet their contractual obligations.  We are exposed to credit risk in our operating activities (primarily from customer trade receivables); and from our investing activities that  include government securities (primarily US Government), corporate and asset-backed securities, reverse repurchase agreements,  money market funds, and balances with banks and financial institutions. Refer to note 17, note 22 and note 23 for an understanding of  the size of, and the credit risk related to, each balance. (iii) Interest rate risk Our interest rate management policy is generally to borrow and invest at floating interest rates. However, we may elect to maintain a proportion  of fixed-rate funding after considering market conditions, the cost and form of funding and other related factors. After the impact of hedging,  76% (2023: 68%) of our borrowings (including leases) were at floating rates. To understand how we manage interest rate risk, refer to note 20. Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 202 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 205 ===== 24  Financial instruments and risk management continued Sensitivity to interest rate changes  Based on our floating rate financial instruments outstanding at 31 December 2024, the effect on our net earnings of a 100 basis point  increase in US dollar Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would be an expense of  US$23 million (2023: US$5 million). This reflects the net debt position in 2024 and 2023.  We are also exposed to interest rate volatility within shareholders’ equity. This is because we have designated some cross-currency interest  rate swaps to be in a cash flow hedge relationship with our 2029 British pound sterling (GBP) loan. As we receive fixed GBP interest and pay  fixed USD interest, any change in the GBP interest rate or the USD interest rate will have an impact on the fair value of the derivative within  shareholders’ equity. With all factors remaining constant, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates in each of the currencies in isolation  would impact equity, before tax, by a charge of US$27 million (2023: US$33 million) for GBP and a credit of US$35 million (2023: US$42  million) for USD. A 100 basis point decrease would have broadly the same impact in the opposite direction. (iv) Commodity price risk  Our broad commodity base means our exposure to commodity prices is diversified. Our normal policy is to sell our products at prevailing  market prices. For certain physical commodity transactions for which the price was fixed at the contract date, we enter into derivatives to  achieve the prevailing market prices at the point of revenue recognition. We do not generally consider that using derivatives to fix  commodity prices would provide a long-term benefit to our shareholders. Exceptions to this rule are subject to limits, and to defined market risk tolerances and internal controls. Substantially all iron ore and aluminium sales are reflected at final prices at each reporting period. Final prices for copper concentrate,  however, are normally determined between 30 and 180 days after delivery to our customer. At 31 December 2024, we had 186 million pounds of copper sales (31 December 2023: 92 million pounds) which were provisionally priced at  US 397 cents per pound (2023: US 387 cents per pound). The final price of these sales will be determined during the first half of 2025. A  10% change in the price of copper realised on the provisionally priced sales, with all other factors held constant, would increase or reduce  net earnings by US$46 million (2023: US$22 million).  Power costs represent a significant portion of costs in our aluminium business and, therefore, we are exposed to fluctuations in power  prices. To mitigate our exposure to changes in the relationship between aluminium prices and power prices, we have a number of electricity  purchase contracts that are directly linked to the daily official LME cash ask price for high-grade aluminium (LME price) and to the US  Midwest Transaction Premium (Midwest premium).  In accordance with IFRS 9, we apply hedge accounting to 2 embedded derivatives within our power contracts. The embedded derivatives  (nominal aluminium forward sales) have been designated as the hedging instrument. The forecast aluminium sales, priced using the LME  price and the Midwest premium, represent the hedged item.  The hedging ratio is 1:1, as the quantity of sales designated as being hedged matches the notional amount of the hedging instrument. The  hedging instrument’s nominal amount, expressed in equivalent metric tonnes of aluminium, is derived from our expected electricity  consumption under the power contracts as well as other relevant contract parameters.  When we designate such embedded derivatives as the hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge, we recognise the effective portion of the  change in the fair value of the hedging instrument in other comprehensive income, and it is accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve. The  amount that is recognised in other comprehensive income is limited to the lesser of the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging  instrument and the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged item, in absolute terms. On realisation of the hedges, realised amounts  are reclassified from reserves to consolidated sales revenue in the income statement.  We recognise any ineffectiveness relating to the hedging relationship immediately in the income statement.  Sources of ineffectiveness include differences in the timing of the cash flows between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, non- zero initial fair value of the hedging instrument, the existence of a cap on the Midwest premium in the hedging instrument and counterparty  credit risk.

There was no cost of hedging recognised in 2024 (2023: no cost) relating to this hedging relationship.  Sensitivity analysis  Our commodity derivatives are impacted by changes in market prices. The table below summarises the impact that changes in aluminium  market prices have on aluminium forward and option contracts embedded in power supply agreements outstanding at 31 December 2024.  Any change in price will result in an offsetting change in our future earnings. Change in market prices 2024  US$m 2023 US$m Effect on net earnings  +10 %   (42)   (52)   (10) %   69   67  Effect on equity  +10 %   (68)   (81)   (10) %   42   70  We exclude our “own use contracts” from this sensitivity analysis as they are outside the scope of IFRS 9. Our business units continue to  hold these types of contracts to satisfy their expected purchase, sale or usage requirements.  Impact of climate change on our business - renewable power purchase agreements in Queensland, New Zealand and the USA As part of the program to develop renewable energy solutions for our Queensland aluminium assets, in 2023 and 2024, we entered into long- term renewable 2.2GW PPAs to buy renewable electricity and associated carbon credits to be generated in the future from the Upper Calliope  solar farm and the Bungaban wind farm. In 2024, our New Zealand Aluminium Smelters signed long term PPAs with electricity generators for a  total of 572MW of hydro electricity. We also signed a PPA with the Monte Cristo wind farm in the US. These contracts are recorded as  derivatives, with net unrealised losses of US$111 million recognised in the current year (2023: US$nil) and require complex derivative  measurement over the contract’s term categorised under level 3 with significant unobservable inputs related to future energy prices. A 10%  increase in forecast electricity prices over the remaining term of the contracts would result in a US$499 million increase in fair value and a 10%  decrease in forecast electricity prices would result in a US$500 million decrease in fair value. (v) Foreign exchange risk  The broad geographic spread of our sales and operations means that our earnings, cash flows and shareholders’ equity are influenced by a  wide variety of currencies. The majority of our sales are denominated in USD.  Our operating costs are influenced by the currencies of those countries where our mines and processing plants are located, and by those  currencies in which we buy imported equipment and services. The USD, the Australian dollar (AUD) and the Canadian dollar (CAD) are the  most important currencies influencing our costs. In any particular year, currency fluctuations may have a significant impact on our financial  results. A strengthening of the USD against the currencies in which our costs are partly denominated has a positive effect on our net  earnings. However, a strengthening of the USD reduces the value of non-USD denominated net assets, and therefore total equity.  In most cases, our debt and other financial assets and liabilities, including intragroup balances, are held in the functional currency of the relevant  subsidiary. There are instances where these balances are held in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary. This  means we recognise exchange gains and losses in our income statement (except where they can be taken to equity) as these balances are  translated into the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary. Our income statement also includes exchange gains and losses arising on USD  net debt and intragroup balances. On consolidation, these balances are retranslated to our USD presentational currency and there is a  corresponding and offsetting exchange difference recognised directly in the currency translation reserve. There is no impact on total equity.  Under normal market conditions, we do not consider that active currency hedging of transactions would provide long-term benefits to  shareholders. We review our exposure on a regular basis and will undertake hedging if deemed appropriate. We may deem currency  protection measures appropriate in specific commercial circumstances. Capital expenditures and other significant financial items such as  acquisitions, disposals, tax and dividend cash flows may be economically hedged.

We deem 10% to be the annual  exchange rate movement that is reasonably probable (on an annual basis over the long run) for any of our significant currencies and  therefore an appropriate representation for the sensitivity analysis. 2024 2023 Currency exposure Closing exchange  rate US cents Effect on net earnings US$m Impact directly on  equity US$m Closing exchange  rate US cents Effect on net  earnings US$m Impact directly on  equity US$m Australian dollar   62   391   (977)   69   228   (1,036)  Canadian dollar   70   (362)   –   76   (361)   –  We calculate sensitivities in relation to the functional currencies of our individual entities. We translate the impact of these on net earnings  into USD at the exchange rates on which the sensitivities are based. The impact to net earnings associated with a 10% weakening of a  particular currency, shown above, is broadly offset within equity through movements in the currency translation reserve and therefore  generally has no impact on our net assets. The offsetting currency translation movement is not shown in the table above. The impact is  expressed in terms of the effect on net earnings and equity, assuming that each exchange rate moves in isolation. The sensitivities are based  on financial assets and financial liabilities held at 31 December, where balances are not denominated in the functional currency of the  subsidiary or joint operation, and exclude financial assets and liabilities held by equity accounted units. These balances will not remain  constant throughout 2025 and, therefore, this illustrative information should be used with caution.  Valuation hierarchy of financial instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis The table below shows the classifications of our financial instruments by valuation method in accordance with IFRS 13 “Fair Value  Measurement” at 31 December.

(e) Investments in equity shares and funds include US$221 million (2023: US$157 million) of equity shares, not held for trading, where we have irrevocably elected to present fair value gains  and losses on revaluation in other comprehensive income. The election is made at an individual investment level. (f) Other investments, including loans, covers cash deposits in rehabilitation funds, government bonds, managed investment funds and royalty receivables. (g) Trade receivables include provisionally priced invoices. The related revenue is initially based on forward market selling prices for the quotation periods stipulated in the contracts with  changes between the provisional price and the final price recorded separately within “Other revenue”. The selling price can be measured reliably for the Group's products, as it operates  in active and freely traded commodity markets. At 31 December 2024, US$1,374 million (2023: US$1,362 million) of provisionally priced receivables were recognised.  (h) Level 3 derivatives mainly consist of derivatives embedded in electricity purchase contracts linked to the LME, midwest premium and billet premium with terms expiring between 2025  and 2036 (2023: 2025 and 2036). Derivatives related to renewable power purchase agreements are linked to forward electricity prices with terms expiring between 2026 and 2054. (i) Net debt derivatives include interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps. As part of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Fallbacks Protocol, on 1 July 2023 we  completed the transition of our US LIBOR derivatives to SOFR on cessation of US LIBOR at 30 June 2023. There was no impact on our hedging arrangements after taking into account  the IFRS 9 IBOR reform reliefs. (j) Trade and other financial payables comprise trade payables, other financial payables, accruals and amounts due to equity accounted units within note 18. There were no material transfers between level 1 and level 2, or between level 2 and level 3 in the current or prior year. Valuation techniques and inputs The techniques used to value our more significant fair value assets/(liabilities) categorised under level 2 and level 3 are summarised below: 2024 2023 Description Fair value US$m Fair value US$m Valuation technique Significant inputs Level 2 Interest rate swaps   (156)   (163) Discounted cash flows – Applicable market quoted swap yield curves – Credit default spread Cross-currency interest rate swaps   (187)   (266) Discounted cash flows – Applicable market quoted swap yield curves – Credit default spread – Market quoted FX rate Provisionally priced receivables    1,374   1,362 Closely related listed product – Applicable forward quoted metal price Level 3 Renewable power purchase  agreements   (111)   – Discounted cash flows – Forward electricity price – Energy volume Derivatives embedded in electricity  contracts   (132)   (186) Option pricing model – LME forward aluminium price – Midwest premium and billet premium Royalty receivables   252   214 Discounted cash flows – Forward commodity price – Mine production Sensitivity analysis in respect of level 3 financial instruments For assets/(liabilities) classified under level 3, the effect of changing the significant unobservable inputs on carrying value has been  calculated using a movement that we deem to be reasonably probable. Net derivative liabilities related to our renewable power purchase agreements have a fair value of US$111 million at 31 December 2024 (2023:  nil). The fair value is calculated as the present value of the future contracted cash flows using risk-adjusted forecast prices including credit  adjustments. A 10% increase in forecast electricity prices over the remaining term of the contracts would result in a US$499 million increase  in fair value and a 10% decrease in forecast electricity prices would result in a US$500 million decrease in fair value. To value long-term aluminium embedded power derivatives, we use unobservable inputs when the term of the derivative extends beyond  observable market prices. Changing the level 3 inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions does not change the fair value  significantly, taking into account the expected remaining term of contracts for either reported period. The fair value of these derivatives is a  net liability of US$132 million at 31 December 2024 (2023: US$186 million). Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 206 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 209 ===== 24  Financial instruments and risk management continued Impact of climate change on our business - coal royalty receivables At 31 December 2024, royalty receivables include amounts arising from our divested coal businesses with a carrying value of  US$252 million (2023: US$214 million). These are classified as “Other investments, including loans” within note 23. The fair values are  determined using level 3 unobservable inputs. These royalty receivables include US$96 million from forecast production beyond 2030.  These have not been adjusted for potential changes in production rates that could occur due to climate change targets impacting  the operator.  The main unobservable input is the long-term coal price used over the life of these royalty receivables. A 15% increase in the coal spot  price would result in a US$24 million increase (2023: US$64 million) in the carrying value. A 15% decrease in the coal spot price would  result in a US$61 million decrease (2023: US$39 million) in the carrying value. We have used a 15% assumption to calculate our exposure  as it represents the annual coal price movement that we deem to be reasonably probable (on an annual basis over the long run). Fair values disclosure of financial instruments The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of our borrowings including those which are not carried at an amount which  approximates their fair value at 31 December. The fair values of some of our financial instruments approximate their carrying values because  of their short maturity, or because they carry floating rates of interest. 2024 2023 Carrying value US$m Fair value US$m Carrying value US$m Fair value US$m Listed bonds   8,137   7,702   8,607   8,672  Oyu Tolgoi project finance   3,852   4,103   3,850   4,090  Other   453   416   544   494  Total borrowings (including overdrafts)   12,442   12,221   13,001   13,256  Borrowings relating to listed bonds are categorised as level 1 in the fair value hierarchy while those relating to project finance drawn down by  Oyu Tolgoi use a number of level 3 valuation inputs.

Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 208 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 211 ===== 27  Share-based payments   The Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited share-based incentive plans  are as follows. UK Share Plan  The fair values of Matching and Free share awards are the market  value of the shares on the date of award. The awards are settled in  equity. Equity Incentive Plan  Since 2018, all long-term incentive awards have been granted under  the 2018 Equity Incentive Plans which allow for awards in the form  of Performance Share Awards (PSA), Management Share Awards  (MSA) and Bonus Deferral Awards (BDA) to be granted. In general,  these awards will be settled in equity, including the dividends  accumulated from date of award to vesting and therefore the  awards are accounted for in accordance with the requirements  applying to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.  Performance Share Awards  The vesting of these awards is dependent on service conditions  being met; performance conditions apply. Awards granted in previous years (since 2018) are subject to a Total  Shareholder Return (TSR) performance condition. Awards granted  in 2024 are subject to both a TSR performance condition (80%  weighting), and a decarbonisation measure (20% weighting). Details  are set out in the Remuneration Report.  The fair value of the awards  subject to a TSR performance condition is calculated using a Monte  Carlo simulation model. For the part of the awards subject to a  decarbonisation target, as this is a non-market related performance  condition, the fair value is reviewed at each accounting date, based  on the prevailing projected outcome. Forfeitures prior to vesting are  assumed at 5% per annum of outstanding awards (2023: 5% per  annum). Management Share Awards  The vesting of these awards is dependent on service conditions  being met; no performance conditions apply.  The fair value of each award on the day of grant is based on the  share price on the day of grant. Forfeitures prior to vesting are  assumed at 7% per annum of outstanding awards (2023: 7% per  annum).  Bonus Deferral Awards Bonus Deferral Awards provide for the mandatory deferral of 50%  of the bonuses for Executive Directors and Executive Committee  members.  The vesting of these awards is dependent only on service  conditions being met. The fair value of each award is based on the  share price on the day of grant. Forfeitures prior to vesting are  assumed at 3% per annum of outstanding awards (2023: 3% per  annum).  Global Employee Share Plans  The Global Employee Share Plans were re-approved by  shareholders in 2021. Under these plans, the companies provide a  Matching share award for each Investment share purchased by a  participant. The vesting of Matching awards is dependent on service  conditions being met and the continued holding of Investment  shares by the participant until vesting. These awards are settled in  equity including the dividends accumulated from date of award to  vesting. The fair value of each Matching share on the day of grant is  equal to the share price on the date of purchase less a deduction of  15% (5% per annum) for estimated cancellations (caused by  employees withdrawing their Investment shares prior to vesting) in  addition to a deduction for forfeitures prior to vesting which are  assumed at 5% per annum of outstanding awards (2023: 5% per  annum). The PSA, MSA, BDA and awards under the Global Employee Share  Plans and UK Share Plan together represent 100% (2023: 100%) of  the total IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment” charge for Rio Tinto plc  and Rio Tinto Limited plans in 2024. Recognition and measurement These plans are accounted for in accordance with the fair value  recognition provisions of IFRS 2. The fair value of the Group’s share plans is recognised as an  expense over the expected vesting period with an offset to retained  earnings for Rio Tinto plc plans and to other reserves for Rio Tinto  Limited plans. The Group uses fair values provided by independent actuaries  calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model where required. The terms of each plan are considered at the balance sheet date to  determine whether the plan should be accounted for as equity- settled or cash-settled. The Group does not operate any material  plans as cash-settled although certain awards can be settled in  cash at the discretion of the Directors or where settling awards in  equity is challenging or prohibited by local laws and regulations. The  value of these awards is immaterial. The Group’s equity-settled share plans are settled either by the  issuance of shares by the relevant parent company; the purchase of  shares on market; or the use of shares held in treasury. If the cost of  shares acquired to satisfy the plans differs from the expense  charged, the difference is taken to retained earnings or other  reserves, as appropriate.

The total liability  for these awards at 31 December 2024 was US$4 million (2023: US$5 million). 28  Post-retirement benefits  Description of plans  The Group operates a number of pension and post-retirement healthcare plans which provide lump sums, pensions, medical benefits and  life insurance to retirees. Some of these plans are defined contribution and some are defined benefit, with assets held in separate trusts,  foundations and similar entities.  Defined benefit pension and post-retirement healthcare plans expose the Group to a number of risks.  Uncertainty in benefit  payments The value of the Group’s liabilities for post-retirement benefits will ultimately depend on the amount of benefits paid out. This in turn will depend on the level of future pay increases, the level of inflation (for those benefits that are subject to some  form of inflation protection) and how long individuals live. Volatility in asset values The Group is exposed to future movements in the values of assets held in pension plans to meet future benefit payments. Uncertainty in cash funding Movements in the values of the obligations or assets may result in the Group being required to provide higher levels of cash  funding, although changes in the level of cash required can often be spread over a number of years. In some countries  control over the rate of cash funding or over the investment policy for pension assets might rest to some extent with a  trustee body or other body that is not under the Group’s direct control. In addition the Group is also exposed to adverse  changes in pension regulation. For these reasons, the Group has a policy of moving away from defined benefit pension provisions and towards defined contribution  arrangements. The defined benefit pension plans for non-unionised employees are closed to new entrants in all countries. For unionised  employees, some plans remain open. The Group does not usually participate in multi-employer plans in which the risks are shared with other companies using those plans. The  Group’s participation in such plans is immaterial and therefore no detailed disclosures are provided in this note.  Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 211 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 214 ===== 28  Post-retirement benefits continued  Pension plans  The majority of the Group’s defined benefit pension obligations are in Canada, the UK, the US and Switzerland. In Australia the main  arrangements are principally defined contribution in nature, but there are sections providing defined benefits linked to final pay. The features  of the Group’s defined benefit pension obligations are summarised as follows. Calculation of benefit Regulatory requirements Governing body Canada Linked to final average pay for non-unionised  employees. For unionised employees linked to  final average pay or to a flat monetary amount  per year of service. Regulatory requirements in the  relevant provinces and territories  (predominantly Quebec). Pension committee, a number of members are appointed  by the sponsor and a number appointed by plan  participants. In some cases, independent committee  members are also appointed. UK Linked to final pay, subject to an earnings cap. Regulatory requirements that  apply to UK pension plans. Trustee board, a number of directors appointed by the  sponsor and a number appointed by plan participants and  an independent trustee director.  US Linked to final average pay for non-unionised  employees and to a flat monetary amount per  year of service for unionised employees. US regulations. Benefit Governance Committee. Members are appointed  by the sponsor. Switzerland Linked to final average pay. Swiss regulations. Trustee board. Members are appointed by the plan  sponsor, by employees and by retirees. Australia Linked to final pay and typically paid in lump  sum form. Local regulations in Australia. An independent financial institution. One-third of the  board positions are nominated by employers. Remaining  positions are filled by independent directors and directors  nominated by participants. The Group also operates a number of unfunded defined benefit plans, which are included in the reported defined benefit obligations.  Post-retirement healthcare plans  Certain subsidiaries of the Group, mainly in the US and Canada, provide healthcare and life insurance benefits to retired employees and in  some cases to their beneficiaries and covered dependants. Eligibility for coverage is dependent upon certain age and service criteria. These  arrangements are unfunded, and are included in the reported defined benefit obligations.  Recognition and measurement For post-employment defined benefit schemes, in accordance with IAS 19 “Employee Benefits”, local actuaries calculate the fair value of the  plan assets and the present value of the plan obligations using a variety of valuation techniques dependent on the type of asset or liability.  The difference is recognised as an asset or liability in the balance sheet. Where appropriate, the recognition of assets may be restricted to the present value of any amounts the Group expects to recover by way of  refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions. In determining the extent to which a refund will be available the Group considers  whether any third party, such as a trustee or pension committee, has the power to enhance benefits or to wind up a pension plan without the  Group’s consent.  The current service cost, any past service cost and the effect of any curtailment or settlements and the interest cost less interest income on  assets held in the plans are recognised in the income statement. Actuarial gains/(losses) and returns from assets are recognised in other  comprehensive income. The Group’s contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate.  All amounts charged to the income statement in respect of these plans are included within “Net operating costs” or in “Share of profit after  tax of equity accounted units”, as appropriate.  Plan assets  The assets of the pension plans are invested predominantly in a diversified range of bonds, equities, property and qualifying insurance  policies. Consequently, the funding level of the pension plans is affected by movements in interest rates and also in the level of equity  markets. The Group monitors its exposure to changes in interest rates and equity markets and also measures its balance sheet pension risk  using a value at risk approach. These measures are considered when deciding whether significant changes in investment strategy are  required. Investment strategy reviews are conducted on a periodic basis to determine the optimal investment mix. This is performed while bearing in  mind the risk tolerance of the Group and local sponsor companies, and the views of the Pension Committees and trustee boards who are  legally responsible for the plans’ investments. The assets of the pension plans may also be invested in qualifying insurance policies which  provide a stream of payments to match the benefits being paid out by the plans. This would therefore remove the investment, inflation and  longevity risks.  Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 212 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 215 ===== 28  Post-retirement benefits continued  In Canada, the UK and Switzerland, the Group works with the governing bodies to ensure that the investment policy adopted is consistent  with the Group’s tolerance for risk. In the US, the Group has direct control over the investment policy, subject to local investment  regulations. The proportions of the total fair value of assets in the pension plans for each asset class at 31 December were as follows.  2024 2023 Equities  17.6%   16.6%  – Quoted(a)  11.1%   11.1%  – Private(b)  6.5%   5.5%  Bonds(c)  47.7%   47.4%  – Government fixed income  21.0%   21.6%  – Government inflation-linked  1.6%   1.6%  – Corporate and other publicly quoted  17.5%   16.5%  – Private  7.6%   7.7%  Property(d)  6.9%   8.7%  – Quoted property funds  2.2%   2.5%  – Unquoted property funds  4.7%   6.2%  Qualifying insurance policies(e)  24.3%   24.9%  Cash and other(f)(g)  3.5%   2.4%  Total  100.0%   100.0%  (a) The holdings of quoted equities are invested in either pooled funds or segregated accounts held in the name of the relevant pension funds. These equity portfolios are well diversified in  terms of the geographic distribution and market sectors.  (b) Investments in private equity, private debt and property are less liquid than the other investment classes listed above and therefore the Group’s investment in those asset classes is  restricted to a level that does not endanger the liquidity of the pension plans. (c) The holdings of government bonds are generally invested in the debt of the country in which a pension plan is situated. Corporate and other quoted bonds are usually of investment  grade. Private debt is mainly held in the North American and UK pension funds and is invested in North American and European companies.  (d) The property funds held by pension plans are invested in a diversified range of properties.  (e) Qualifying insurance policies are held with insurance companies that are regulated by the relevant local authorities. The value of those policies is calculated by the local actuaries using  assumptions consistent with those adopted for valuing the insured obligations.  (f) The holdings of cash and other are predominantly cash and short-term money market instruments.  (g) The Group makes limited use of futures, repurchase agreements and other instruments to manage the interest rate risk in some of its plans. Fund managers may also use derivatives to  hedge currency movements within their portfolios and, in the case of bond managers, to take positions that could be taken using direct holdings of bonds but more efficiently. Exposure  to these instruments is closely monitored and maintained at a level that does not endanger the liquidity of any pension plan.  The assets of the plans are managed on a day-to-day basis by external specialist fund managers. These managers may invest in the Group’s  securities subject to limits imposed by the relevant fiduciary committees and local legislation. The approximate total holding of Group  securities within the plans is US$1 million (2023: US$2 million).

The bulk  annuity contract is a Fund asset which provides an income to the RT09 that matches the pension paid out by the Fund. No formal decision to progress to buy-out and winding up of  the RT09 can be made until such time as the Company and trustee agree on a number of key areas, including use of any residual surplus. As such, the trustee retains the legal  responsibility to make benefit payments and the loss arising on this transaction was charged to other comprehensive income.

See note 17.  Deficits are shown in the balance sheet within “Provisions (including post-retirement benefits)”. See note 26.  Funding policy and contributions to plans  The Group reviews the funding position of its pension plans on a regular basis and considers whether to provide funding above the minimum  level required in each country. In Canada and the US, the minimum level is prescribed by legislation. In the UK and Switzerland, the minimum  level is negotiated with the local trustee in accordance with the funding guidance issued by the local regulators. In deciding whether to  provide funding above the minimum level, we consider other possible uses of cash elsewhere, the local sponsoring entity’s tax situation and  any strategic advantage we might obtain. The Group does not generally pre-fund post-retirement healthcare arrangements.  2024 2023 2022 Pension benefits US$m Other benefits US$m Total US$m Total US$m Total US$m Contributions to defined benefit plans   71   36   107   237   211  Contributions to defined contribution plans   448   3   451   410   363  Total   519   39   558   647   574  Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 214 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 217 ===== 28  Post-retirement benefits continued The level of surplus in the Rio Tinto Pension Fund in the UK is such that it may be used to pay for the employer contributions to the defined  contribution section of that Fund, in accordance with the funding arrangements agreed with the trustee of that Fund. Consequently, the  cash paid to defined contribution plans is lower than the defined contribution service cost by US$7 million. Contributions to defined benefit  pension plans are kept under regular review and actual contributions will be determined in line with the Group’s wider financing strategy,  taking into account relevant minimum funding requirements. As contributions to many plans are reviewed on at least an annual basis, the contributions for 2025 and subsequent years cannot be determined  precisely in advance. Most of the Group’s largest pension funds are fully funded on their local funding basis and at present do not require long-term  funding commitments. Contributions to defined benefit pension plans for 2025 are estimated to be around US$120 million but may be higher or lower  than this depending on the evolution of financial markets and voluntary funding decisions taken by the Group. Contributions for subsequent years are  expected to be at similar levels. Healthcare plans are generally unfunded and contributions for future years will be equal to benefit payments net of  participant contributions. The Group’s contributions for healthcare plans in 2025 are expected to be similar to the amounts paid in 2024.

The resulting effect of applying an asset ceiling is a gain of US$12 million and a gain of US$4 million for the change in currency exchange  rate during the year. In determining the extent to which the asset ceiling has an effect, the Group considers the funding legislation in each  country and the rules specific to each pension plan. The calculation takes into account any minimum funding requirements that may be  applicable to the plan, whether any reduction in future Group contributions is available, and whether a refund of surplus may be available. In  considering whether any refund of surplus is available, the Group considers the powers of trustee boards and similar bodies to augment  benefits or wind up a plan. Where such powers are unilateral, the Group does not consider a refund to be available at the end of the life of a  plan. Where the plan rules and legislation both permit the employer to take a refund of surplus, the asset ceiling may have no effect,  although it may be the case that a refund will only be available many years in the future.  Main assumptions (rates per annum)  Key estimate - Estimation of obligations for post-employment costs The value of the Group’s obligations for post-employment benefits is dependent on the amount of benefits that are expected to be paid  out, discounted to the balance sheet date. The most significant assumptions used in accounting for pension plans are: – The discount rate - used to determine the net present value of the obligations, the interest cost on the obligations and the interest  income on plan assets. We use the yield from high-quality corporate bonds with maturities and terms that match those of the post- employment obligations as closely as possible. Where there is no developed corporate bond market in a currency, the rate on  government bonds is used. – The long-term inflation rate - used to project increases in future benefit payments for those plans that have benefits linked to  inflation. The assumption regarding future inflation is based on market yields on inflation linked instruments, where possible, combined  with consensus views.  – The mortality rates - used to project the period over which benefits will be paid, which is then discounted to arrive at the net present  value of the obligations. The Group reviews the actual mortality rates of retirees in its major pension plans on a regular basis and uses  these rates to set its current mortality assumptions. It also uses its judgement with respect to allowances for future improvements in  longevity having regard to standard improvement scales in each relevant country and after taking external actuarial advice. The weighted-average assumptions used for the valuation at year-end are summarised below: At 31 December 2024 At 31 December 2023 Discount rate Long-term  inflation(a) Rate of increase  in pensions Discount rate Long-term  inflation(a) Rate of increase  in pensions Canada  4.6%   2.0%   0.2%   4.6%   1.9%   0.2%  UK  5.4%   3.1%   2.7%   4.5%   3.1%   2.6%  US  5.5%   2.3%   –%   4.8%   2.2%   –%  Switzerland  0.9%   1.0%   2.2%   1.5%   1.2%   2.3%  (a) The long-term inflation assumption shown for the UK is for the Retail Price Index. The assumption for the Consumer Price Index at 31 December 2024 was 2.7% (2023: 2.5%).  The main financial assumptions used for the healthcare plans, which are predominantly in the US and Canada, were: discount rate: 5.3%  (2023: 5.0%); medical trend rate: 9.7% reducing to 4.7% by the year 2034, broadly on a straight line basis (2023: 8.3%, reducing to 4.7% by  the year 2032); claims costs based on individual company experience.  For both the pension and healthcare arrangements, the post-retirement mortality assumptions allow for future improvements in longevity.  The mortality tables used imply that a man aged 60 at the balance sheet date has a weighted average expected future lifetime of 27 years  (2023: 27 years) and that a man aged 60 in 2044 would have a weighted average expected future lifetime of 28 years (2023: 28 years). The  mortality tables are generally based upon the latest standard tables published in each country, adjusted appropriately to reflect the actual  mortality experience of the plan participants where credible data is available. Adjustments have been made to some of our plans within the  demographic assumptions for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Sensitivity analysis  The values reported for the defined benefit obligations are sensitive to the actuarial assumptions used for projecting future benefit  payments and discounting those payments. In order to estimate the sensitivity of the obligations to changes in assumptions, we calculate  what the obligations would be if we were to make changes to each of the key assumptions in isolation. The difference between this figure  and the figure calculated using our stated assumptions is an indication of the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in each assumption.  The results of this sensitivity analysis are summarised in the table below. Note that this approach is valid for small changes in the  assumptions but will be less accurate for larger changes in the assumptions. The sensitivity to inflation includes the impact on pension  increases, which are generally linked to inflation where they are granted.

(b) Robe River Mining Co Pty Ltd (which is 60% owned by the Group) holds a 30% economic interest in Robe River Iron Associates (Robe River). North Mining Ltd (which is wholly owned  by the Group) holds a 35% economic interest in Robe River. Through these companies the Group recognises a 65% share of the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of Robe River,  with a 12% non-controlling interest. The Group therefore has a 53% economic interest in Robe River.  (c) Rincon Mining Pty Limited is incorporated in Australia but operates in Argentina. (d) Rio Tinto do Brasil Ltda holds the Group’s 10% interest in Consórcio de Alumínio do Maranhão, a joint operation in which the Group participates but is not a joint operator. The Group  recognises its share of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses relating to this arrangement.  (e) Iron Ore Company of Canada is incorporated in the US, but operates in Canada. (f) Rio Tinto SimFer UK Limited (which is wholly owned by the Group) holds a 53% interest in SimFer Jersey Limited (SimFer Jersey), a company incorporated in Jersey. SimFer Jersey, in  turn, has an 85% interest in SimFer S.A., the company that will carry out the Simandou mining operations in Guinea and an 85% interest in the company which will deliver Simfer Jersey’s  scope of the co-developed rail and port infrastructure. SimFer Jersey at present has a 100% interest in the companies that will own and operate the transhipment vessels, however this  is anticipated to reduce to 85% with the Government of Guinea taking a 15% interest before operations commence. These entities, together with the equity accounted WCS Rail and  Port entities described in note 32, are referred to as the Simandou iron ore project. (g) The Group’s shareholding in QIT Madagascar Minerals SA (QMM) carries an 80% economic interest and 80% of the total voting rights; a further 5% economic interest is held through  non-voting investment certificates to give an economic interest of 85%. In the prior year, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed with the Malagasy Government in relation  to their fiscal regime for QMM which expired at the end of May 2023. The MoU gave effect to the application of a new fiscal regime for the next 25 years, with terms effective as of 1 July  2023. Terms of the MoU included the granting of a 15% free-carry equity stake to the Malagasy Government that can no longer be diluted, while maintaining their current 20% of the  voting rights. As a result, the Malagasy Government's non-controlling interest was recognised for the first time in 2023, and QMM's net earnings has been presented net of amounts  attributable to non-controlling interests from 1 July 2023. The initial recognition of non-controlling interests, and any subsequent recognition arising from future contributions, gave rise  to a charge within equity as the transaction was between Rio Tinto and the Malagasy Government acting in their capacity as shareholders and there were no changes to the net assets  of QMM. As at 31 December 2024, the value of QMM’s non-controlling interest is US$4 million (2023: US$16 million). (h) On 1 November 2024, our interest in NZAS ceased to be a joint operation and became a wholly owned subsidiary following the acquisition of Sumitomo Chemical Company’s 20.64%  interest in the entity.

Aluminium production  40  Pechiney Reynolds Quebec Inc(c)(d) Aluminium smelting  50.2  (a) The Group owns a 54% interest in the Western Range Joint Venture (WRJV), an unincorporated arrangement in the Pilbara. The Group recognises its equity share of assets, revenue  and expenses relating to this arrangement. Liabilities are recognised at 54% with the exception of the close-down and restoration provision, which is recognised at 100% according to  WRJV’s contractual obligations, with a corresponding 46% receivable from China Baowu Group, for the co-owner’s share. (b) Although the Group has an 80% interest in Queensland Alumina Limited, decisions about activities that significantly affect the returns that are generated require agreement of both  parties to the joint arrangement, giving rise to joint control.  (c) Queensland Alumina Limited and Pechiney Reynolds Quebec Inc. are joint arrangements that are primarily designed for the provision of output to the parties sharing joint control. This  indicates that the parties have rights to substantially all the economic benefits of the assets. The liabilities of the arrangements are in substance satisfied by cash flows received from the  parties. This dependence indicates that the parties in effect have obligations for the liabilities. It is these facts and circumstances that give rise to the classification of these entities as  joint operations.  (d) Pechiney Reynolds Quebec Inc., an entity incorporated in the United States, has a 50.1% interest in the Aluminerie de Bécancour, Inc. aluminium smelter, which is located in Canada. As  Rio Tinto owns 50.2% of Pechiney Reynolds Quebec Inc our effective ownership of the Bécancour smelter is 25.2%. Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 219 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 222 ===== 31  Principal joint operations continued Other relevant judgements - accounting for the Pilbara Iron Arrangements A number of arrangements are in place amongst the Australian Iron Ore operations, managed by Rio Tinto, which allow their respective  assets to be operated as a single integrated network across the Pilbara region. In assessing the Pilbara Iron Arrangements, it has been  concluded that they collectively constitute a joint operation on the basis that decisions about relevant activities require unanimous  consent. The resulting efficiencies are shared between Rio Tinto and Robe River Iron Associates (Robe River), and the parties fund all of  the cash flow requirements of Pilbara Iron (Company) Services Pty Ltd and Pilbara Iron Pty Ltd. Each of the partners in the joint operation is able to request the other to construct assets on their tenure to increase the capacity of the  rail and port infrastructure network. The requesting partner’s (Asset User’s) share of the capacity of the network will increase by the  capacity of the newly constructed asset, but generally that capacity may be provided from any of the network assets. The Asset User will  pay an annual charge, Committed Use Charge (CUC) over a contractually specified period irrespective of network usage. The  constructing partner (Asset Owner) has an ongoing obligation to make available capacity from those assets and to maintain the assets in  good working order as required under relevant State Agreements and associated tenure. The arrangements are managed through two  wholly-owned subsidiaries: Pilbara Iron (Company) Services Pty Ltd and Pilbara Iron Pty Ltd. We have also considered whether the CUC arrangements give rise to a lease between the Asset Owner and the Asset User. We have  concluded that they do not, as there is no specified asset; rather the Asset User has a first priority right to the capacity in the CUC asset.  This treatment was grandfathered on adoption of IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019, following an assessment under the preceding standards IAS  17 “Leases” and IFRIC 4 “Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease”, with no change to the conclusion under IFRS 16 for  subsequent expenditure subject to the existing CUC arrangements. Management considers that these arrangements are unique and has  used judgement to apply the principles of IFRS to the accounting for the arrangements as described above. The obligation of the Asset  Owner to make capacity available is fulfilled over time and not at a point in time. The CUC arrangement is therefore an executory  contract as defined under IAS 37, whereby neither party has performed any of its obligations, or both parties have partially performed  their obligations to an equal extent, and so the CUC payments are expensed as incurred. An alternative interpretation of the fact pattern  could have resulted in a gross presentation in the Group’s balance sheet with an asset and a corresponding liability to reflect the present  value of the CUC payments. The Asset User is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto, whereas the Asset Owner is a joint operation. This  impact would be some US$929 million (calculated on the basis of grossing up the tax written down value of the CUC assets). Other  methods of calculating the gross-up might give rise to different numbers. 32  Entities accounted under the equity method  Principal joint ventures  The Group’s principal joint ventures at 31 December 2024 are summarised in the table below.

(b) Although the Group holds a 20% interest in Sohar Aluminium Co. L.L.C, decisions about relevant activities that significantly affect the returns that are generated require agreement of all  parties to the arrangement. It is therefore determined that Rio Tinto has joint control. Other relevant judgements - accounting for Minera Escondida Ltda Judgement has been applied on the determination that Escondida is a joint venture. We have based this on the nature of significant  commercial decisions, including those in relation to capital expenditure, which require approval of both Rio Tinto and its partner BHP  (holders of a 57.5% interest). In contrast, our partner has assessed Rio Tinto’s rights as protective and concluded that it controls  Escondida through its rights to direct relevant activities. Adoption of the equivalent judgement by the Group would result in  reclassification of Escondida from a joint venture to an associate, with no other financial reporting consequence since accounting under  the equity method would remain in place.

Although each combination requires Rio Tinto’s approval, this is not joint control as defined under IFRS 11 “Joint Arrangements”. Rio Tinto is therefore  determined to have significant influence over this company. During the period, we acquired an additional 14.11% interest (comprising 11.65% from Mitsubishi Corporation and 2.46% from  Sumitomo Chemical Company) in BSL, increasing our total interest to 73.5%. BSL remains accounted for as an investment in associate under the equity method.  (b) Rio Tinto SimFer UK Limited (which is wholly owned by the Group) holds a 53% interest in SimFer Jersey Limited (SimFer Jersey), a company incorporated in Jersey. During the year, SimFer  Jersey, through its wholly owned subsidiary, SimFer InfraCo Ltd., a company incorporated in the United Kingdom, acquired 34% interests in Winning Consortium Simandou Railway Pte. Ltd  and Winning Consortium Simandou Ports Pte. Ltd (together referred to as “WCS Rail and Port entities”). Refer to note 5 for further details. The WCS Rail and Port entities are incorporated in  Singapore, however their operations are in Guinea. As at 31 December 2024, the Group has an effective 18.02% indirect interest in the WCS Rail and Port entities. The Government of Guinea  holds a 15% interest in the WCS Rail and Port operations and therefore we have a 15.32% indirect interest in those operations. (c) The Group holds a 45% interest in Halco (Mining) Inc., a non-managed associate. Halco (Mining) Inc., in turn, has a 51% indirect interest in Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinée, a bauxite  mine, the core assets of which are located in Guinea.

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new shares are shown in equity as a  deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.  Where any Group company purchases the Group’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly  attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to owners of Rio Tinto. Where such shares are  subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental costs and the related income tax effects, is  included in equity attributable to owners of Rio Tinto. If purchased Rio Tinto plc shares are cancelled, an amount equal to the nominal value  of the cancelled share is credited to the capital redemption reserve.

Balances reflect the amount by which the company’s issued share capital is diminished in accordance with this section.  (b) Other reserves includes US$11,936 million which represents the difference between the nominal value and issue price of the shares issued arising from Rio Tinto plc’s rights issue  completed in July 2009. No share premium was recorded in the Rio Tinto plc financial statements through the operation of the merger relief provisions of the UK Companies Act 1985. Other reserves also include the cumulative amount recognised under IFRS 2 in respect of awards granted but not exercised to acquire shares in Rio Tinto Limited, less, where  applicable, the cost of shares purchased to satisfy share awards exercised. The cumulative amount recognised under IFRS 2 in respect of awards granted but not exercised to acquire  shares in Rio Tinto plc is recorded in retained earnings.  (c) Exchange differences arising on the translation of the Group’s net investment in foreign controlled companies are taken to the foreign currency translation reserve. The cumulative  differences relating to an investment are transferred to the income statement when the investment is disposed of.  (d) In 2024, currency translation reclassified on disposal primarily relates to the acquisition of the remaining 20.64% interest in NZAS. The transaction has been accounted for as a business  combination achieved in stages, with our previous 79.36% interest in the NZAS joint operation deemed to have been disposed of and, accordingly, the currency translation has been  reclassified to the income statement. In 2022, the sale of our Roughrider undeveloped project led to the recycling of currency translation reserve losses of US$105 million relating to the  entity that owns the project. Refer to note 5 for details. (e) Retained earnings and movements in reserves of subsidiaries include those arising from the Group’s share of joint operations.  (f) In 2024, there were US$6 million of remeasurement losses relating to equity accounted units (2023: gains of US$3 million, 2022: gains of US$5 million). (g) In 2024, this relates to the additional interest acquired in ERA (refer to note 30 for further details) as well as the settlement of deferred consideration payable to Turquoise Hill  Resources Ltd dissenting shareholders (refer to note 5 for further details). In 2022, the amount relates to forgiveness by Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd of the accrued interest and  funding balances from Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi and the purchase of the non-controlling interest of Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd.

The provision reflects the best estimate of the expenditure needed to settle the obligation which existed at the  balance sheet date. Where there is sufficient objective evidence of reasonably expected future events (such as changes in technology and  new legislation) we reflect this in the amounts recognised. Other provisions includes provision for legal claims, onerous contracts and claims  for past royalties.

Panguna mine, Bougainville During the year we utilised a provision of US$10 million to fund a legacy impact assessment study in relation to a Panguna mine of  Bougainville Copper Limited (BCL), our former subsidiary. The Panguna Mine Legacy Impact Assessment, an independent report published  in December 2024, assessed the environmental impacts and directly connected social and human rights impacts caused by the Panguna  mine since BCL ceased operations in 1989. In November 2024, Rio Tinto, BCL and the Autonomous Bougainville Government signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to discuss  ways forward. The MoU parties plan to address the findings of the independent report and develop a remedy mechanism consistent with the  UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  We have acknowledged a class action lawsuit filed in July 2024 in Papua New  Guinea's National Court of Justice, naming both Rio Tinto and our former subsidiary, BCL, as defendants. We submitted our defence against  the legal claim and will strongly defend our position in this case.  Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 225 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 228 ===== 37  Contingencies and commitments Recognition and measurement Contingent liabilities, indemnities and other performance guarantees represent the potential outflow of funds from the Group for the  satisfaction of obligations, including those under contractual arrangements (eg undertakings related to supplier agreements) not provided  for on the balance sheet, where the likelihood of the contingent liabilities, guarantees or indemnities being called is assessed as possible  rather than probable or remote. Other relevant judgements - contingencies Disclosure is made for material contingent liabilities unless the possibility of any loss arising is considered remote based on our  judgement and legal advice. These are quantified unless, in our judgement, the amount cannot be reliably estimated. The unit of account  for claims is the matter taken as a whole and therefore when a provision has been recorded for the best estimate of the cost to settle the  obligation there is no further contingent liability component. This means that when a provision is recognised for the best estimate of the  expenditure required to settle the present obligation from a single past event, a further contingent liability is not reported for the  maximum potential exposure in excess of that already provided. We have not established provisions for certain additional legal claims in cases where we have assessed that a payment is either not  probable or cannot be reliably estimated. A number of our companies are, and will likely continue to be, subject to various legal  proceedings and investigations that arise from time to time. As a result, the Group may become subject to substantial liabilities that could  affect our business, financial position and reputation. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and large judgements may at times occur. The  Group may in the future incur judgements or enter into settlements of claims that could lead to material cash outflows. We do not believe  that any of these proceedings will have a materially adverse effect on our financial position. Contingent liabilities - subsidiaries, joint operations, joint ventures and associates  2024  US$m 2023 US$m Contingent liabilities, indemnities and other performance guarantees(a)   192   435  (a) There were no material contingent liabilities arising in relation to the Group’s joint ventures and associates.  Contingent liabilities - not quantifiable The current status of contingent liabilities where it is not practicable to provide a reliable estimate of possible financial exposure is:  Litigation disputes Litigation matter Latest update 2011 Contractual payments  in Guinea In 2023, we resolved a previously self-disclosed investigation by the SEC into certain contractual  payments totalling US$10.5 million made to a consultant who had provided advisory services in 2011,  relating to the Simandou project in the Republic of Guinea. In August 2023, the UK Serious Fraud  Office closed its case and announced that the Australian Federal Police maintains a live investigation  into the matter. Rio Tinto continues to co-operate fully with relevant authorities.   At 31 December 2024, the outcome of this investigation remains uncertain, but it could ultimately  expose the Group to material financial cost. No provision has been recognised for the investigation. We  believe this case is unwarranted and will defend the allegation vigorously. Other contingent liabilities We continue to modernise agreements with Traditional Owner groups in response to the Juukan Gorge incident. We have created  provisions, within “Other provisions”, based on our best estimate of historical claims. However, the process is incomplete and it is possible  that further claims could arise relating to past events. Close-down, restoration and environmental provisions are not recognised for those operations that have no known restrictions on their lives  as the date of closure cannot be reliably estimated. This applies primarily to our Canadian aluminium smelters, which are not dependent  upon a specific orebody and have access to indefinite-lived power from owned hydropower stations with water rights permitted by local  governments. In these instances, a closure obligation may exist at the reporting date. However, due to the indefinite nature of asset lives it is  not possible to arrive at a sufficiently reliable estimate for the purposes of recognising a provision. Close-down, restoration and  environmental provisions are recognised at these operations for separately identifiable closure activities which can be reasonably estimated,  such as the demolition and removal of fixed structures after a predetermined period. Any contingent liability for these assets will crystallise  into a closure provision if and when a decision is taken to cease operations. Contingent assets  The Group has, from time to time, various insurance claims outstanding with reinsurers. Recognition of any assets arising takes place once  the insurance company has agreed to refund the claims and the amount is quantifiable. This is usually in the same period as payment is  received.

Other commitments The Group has also made other commitments to incur a minimum amount of expenditure on community development initiatives as part of its  agreements with various stakeholders. As of 31 December 2024, a total of US$154 million (2023: US$173 million) of such expenditure is  estimated to be incurred over the next 25 years, out of which US$27 million (2023: US$10 million) is expected to be incurred within the next  year. Unrecognised commitments to contribute funding or resources to joint ventures  Along with the other joint venture partners, we have commitments to provide emergency funding (such as funding required to preserve the  life of assets of the company or to comply with applicable laws) if required by Sohar Aluminium Company L.L.C., subject to approved  thresholds.  At 31 December 2024, Minera Escondida Ltda held an undrawn shareholder line of credit, of which Rio Tinto’s share was US$225 million  (2023: US$225 million). The current facility was extended during the year and will now mature in September 2026.  Purchase obligations  Purchase obligations are enforceable and legally binding agreements to buy goods or services. They specify all significant terms, including  fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased or consumed; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the  transactions.  Purchase obligations for goods mainly relate to purchases of raw materials and consumables, and purchase obligations for services mainly  relate to charges for the use of infrastructure, commitments to purchase power and freight contracts. These goods and services are  expected to be used in the business. To the extent that this changes, a provision for onerous obligations may be made. Purchases from joint arrangements or associates are included if the quantity to be purchased is in excess of our ownership interest in the  entity. However, purchase obligations exclude contracted purchases of bauxite, alumina and aluminium from joint arrangements and  associates and contracted purchases of alumina from third parties. This is because these purchases are made for commercial reasons and  the Group is, overall, a net seller of these commodities.

In  addition, Rio Tinto Finance plc and Rio Tinto Finance Limited have entered into undrawn facility arrangements for an aggregate amount of  US$7.5 billion (2023: US$7.5 billion). The facilities are guaranteed by Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited.  Rio Tinto plc has provided a guarantee, known as the completion support undertaking (CSU), in favour of the Oyu Tolgoi LLC project finance lenders.  In 2023, a wholly owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto plc became a lender under the project finance facility ranking pari passu with the external lenders. At 31 December 2024, a total of US$5.5 billion (2023: US$4.7 billion) of project finance debt was outstanding under this facility of which  US$3.9 billion (2023: US$3.9 billion) is owed to external third party lenders. Rio Tinto plc, through its subsidiaries, owns 66% of Oyu Tolgoi  LLC, with the remaining share owned by Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi LLC (34%), which is controlled by the Government of Mongolia. The project  finance was raised for development of the underground mine and the CSU will terminate on the completion of the underground mine  according to a set of completion tests set out in the project finance facility. The CSU contains a carve-out for certain political risk events.  In November 2024, the Group entered into a US$7 billion bridge facility agreement to support the proposed acquisition of Arcadium Lithium  (refer to note 5). Rio Tinto Plc and Rio Tinto Limited have jointly guaranteed the facility, which remains undrawn as at 31 December 2024.  38  Auditors’ remuneration  Group auditors’ remuneration(a)  2024  US$m 2023 US$m 2022 US$m Audit of the Group   20.7   19.1   17.3  Audit of subsidiaries   7.4   7.5   8.4  Total audit   28.1   26.6   25.7  Audit-related assurance service   1.7   1.1   1.0  Other assurance services(b)   3.5   3.0   2.3  Total assurance services   5.2   4.1   3.3  Tax compliance   –   –   –  Other non-audit services not covered above   0.2   0.1   0.3  Total non-audit services   5.4   4.2   3.6  Total Group auditors’ remuneration   33.5   30.8   29.3  Group auditors’ remuneration as required to be categorised under SEC regulations Audit fees 30.0 27.7 27.0 Audit-related fees 3.3 3.0 2.0 Tax fees – – – All other fees 0.2 0.1 0.3 Total Group auditors’ remuneration   33.5   30.8   29.3  Audit fees payable to other accounting firms Audit of the financial statements of the Group’s subsidiaries   0.3   0.3   0.2  Fees in respect of pension scheme audits   0.1   0.1   0.1  Total audit fees payable to other accounting firms   0.4   0.4   0.3  (a) The remuneration payable to KPMG, the Group auditors, is approved by the Audit & Risk Committee.

The fees disclosed above consolidate all payments,  including overruns, made to member firms of KPMG by the companies and their subsidiaries, along with fees in respect of joint operations paid for by the Group. Non-audit services  arise largely from assurance and regulation related work. (b) Other assurance services relates to the review of non-statutory financial information including sustainability reporting.

Except for the  Amendments to IAS 21 “The Effects Of Changes In Foreign Exchange Rates” (IAS 21), referred to below, they are not available for early  adoption because they have not yet been endorsed by the UK Endorsement Board.   IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (mandatory in 2027) will replace IAS 1. The new standard requires that  companies classify all income and expenses into 5 categories in the statement of profit or loss, namely the operating, investing, financing,  discontinued operations and income tax categories. Management defined performance measures are disclosed in a single note and  enhanced guidance is provided on how to group information in the financial statements. In addition, all entities are required to use the  operating profit subtotal as the starting point for the statement of cash flows. We are in process of assessing the impact of IFRS 18 and  expect that changes will be required to the presentation and disclosures in our financial statements. Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures (mandatory in 2026) will help companies better  report the financial effects of nature-dependent electricity contracts, which are often structured as power purchase agreements (PPAs).  The amendments include: clarifying the application of the ‘own-use’ requirements, permitting hedge accounting if these contracts are used  as hedging instruments; and adding new disclosure requirements to enable investors to understand the effect of these contracts on a  company’s financial performance and cash flows. We are in process of assessing the impacts from these amendments. The assessment is ongoing in relation to the amendments listed below, but no material impact has been identified to date: – Lack of exchangeability (Amendments to IAS 21 , mandatory in 2025) – Annual Improvements to IFRS Accounting Standards (Amendments to IAS 7 “Statement of Cash Flows” and IFRS 10 “Consolidated  Financial Statements” mandatory in 2026) – Amendments to the Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments (Amendments to IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” and IFRS 7  “Financial Instruments: Disclosures”, mandatory in 2026) – IFRS 19 “Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures” (mandatory in 2027)  Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 229 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 232 ===== 41  Rio Tinto Limited parent company disclosures The following disclosures are prepared under Australian Accounting Standards (AAS) and in accordance with Australian Corporations Act 2001  (see page 244).

These entities  also jointly guarantee the Group’s undrawn credit facility, which was A$12.1 billion at 31 December 2024 (2023: A$10.9 billion). In November 2024, the Group entered into a A$11.3 billion bridge facility agreement to support the proposed acquisition of Arcadium Lithium (refer to  note 5). Rio Tinto Plc and Rio Tinto Limited have jointly guaranteed the facility, which remains undrawn as at 31 December 2024.  Other external debt guaranteed by Rio Tinto Limited totalling A$0.1 billion in 2023 was repaid during the year ended 31 December 2024. In addition, Rio Tinto Limited has provided a guarantee of all third-party obligations, including contingent obligations, of Rio Tinto Finance  Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary. Pursuant to the DLC Merger, both Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited issued deed poll guarantees by which each company guaranteed  contractual obligations incurred by the other or guaranteed by the other. Financial statements  |  Notes to the consolidated financial statements Annual Report 2024 230 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 233 =====      Basis of preparation This consolidated entity disclosure statement (CEDS) has been prepared as at 31 December 2024 in accordance with: – subsection 295(3A) of the Australian Corporations Act 2001 (Corporations Act), and includes information for each entity that was part of  the Rio Tinto Group (being subsidiaries and other consolidated entities). – section 409 of the UK Companies Act 2006 (Companies Act), and includes information for the full list of related undertakings of the  Rio Tinto Group. Apart from “subsidiary undertakings” (subsidiaries), related undertakings also includes “associated undertakings”, and  “significant holdings in undertakings other than subsidiary companies”, which do not fall within the scope of subsection 295(3A) of the  Corporations Act. Therefore, disclosures required under the Corporations Act are only made for entities which are considered a  subsidiary of - or are otherwise consolidated in - the Rio Tinto Group. – The definition of a subsidiary undertaking in accordance with the Companies Act is different from the definition under IFRS. As a result,  the related undertakings included within this CEDS may not be the same as the related undertakings consolidated in the consolidated  financial statements. Unless otherwise disclosed, all undertakings with an effective equity holding of greater than 50% are considered  subsidiary undertakings for the purpose of this note. For all entities within this CEDS, place (country) of incorporation, classes of shares, the registered office address, the percentage of the  share class held by Group entities, and the effective percentage of equity owned by the Group calculated by reference to voting rights, are  disclosed. The share class held by the Group are ordinary (voting) shares (also referred to as common stock in certain countries), unless  identified with one of the following annotations against the entity name:  (1) ordinary/common; (2) preference; (3) redeemable preference; (4) unit; (5) redeemable preference B; (6) registered; (7) special voting; (8) DLC  dividend; (9) founder’s; (10) non-cumulative redeemable preference; (11) non-redeemable preference; (12) deferred; (13) Class A; (14) Class B; (15)  Class/Series C; (16) Class/Series D; (17) Class/Series E; (18) Series F; (19) Series G; (20) Class H; (21) Class J; (22) Class S; (23) Class Z; (24) E1  Class; (25) E2 Class; (26) F1 Class; (27) F2 Class; (28) G1 Class; (29) Stock Unit A; (30) Stock Unit B; (31) Stock Unit C; (32) C1 Class; (33) C2 Class.  Additionally, for subsidiaries and other consolidated entities, the entity’s tax residency; whether the entity was a body corporate, partnership  or trust; and whether the entity was a partner in a partnership, a trustee of a trust or a participant in a joint venture within the consolidated  Group, are also disclosed. Unless otherwise disclosed, each entity in this CEDS is a body corporate.  Unless otherwise disclosed, the tax residency of subsidiaries and other consolidated entities is the same as the country of incorporation. The  determination of tax residency involves judgement as the determination of tax residency is highly fact dependent and requires interpretation  of relevant legislation, guidance and judicial precedent. Different interpretations could be adopted which could give rise to a different  conclusion on residency. In determining tax residency, the Group has applied current legislation, judicial precedent and other available  guidance, including where relevant, the Australian Commissioner of Taxation’s public guidance in Tax Ruling TR 2018/5.  Refer to the “Basis of consolidation” on page 154 for further information on accounting policies, basis of consolidation, principal subsidiaries,  joint operations, joint ventures and associates. An explanation of the dual listed companies structure of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited can be found on pages 325 to 326.  For completeness, the effective ownership by the Group relates to effective holdings by both entities either together or individually.

Basis of preparation The Rio Tinto plc (“the Company”) company financial statements have  been prepared using the historical cost convention, as modified by the  revaluation of certain financial liabilities and in accordance with the UK  Companies Act 2006 and Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced  Disclosure Framework (FRS 101). The financial statements have been  prepared on a going concern basis.  In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the  recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of UK- adopted international accounting standards, but makes  amendments where necessary in order to comply with the UK  Companies Act 2006. The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently  to all periods presented in these financial statements. The following  exemptions available under FRS 101 have been applied: – paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2 “Share-based  Payment” (details of the number and weighted average exercise  prices of share options and how the fair value of goods and  services received was determined) – paragraphs 91 to 99 of IFRS 13 “Fair Value  Measurement” (disclosure of valuation techniques and inputs  used for fair value measurement of assets and liabilities) – IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” – paragraph 38 of IAS 1 “Presentation of financial statements”,  comparative information requirements in respect of Paragraph  79(a)(iv) of IAS 1 – the following paragraphs of IAS 1 “Presentation of  financial statements”: – 10 (d) (statement of cash flows) – 16 (statement of compliance with all IFRS) – 38A (requirement for minimum of 2 primary statements,  including cash flow statements) – 38B-D (additional comparative information) – 111 (cash flow statement information) – 134-136 (capital management disclosures). – IAS 7 “Statement of Cash Flows” – paragraph 30 and 31 of IAS 8 “Accounting policies, changes in  accounting estimates and errors” (requirement for the disclosure  of information when an entity has not applied a new IFRS that has  been issued and is not yet effective) – paragraph 17 of IAS 24 “Related party disclosures” (key  management compensation) – the requirements of IAS 24, “Related party disclosures” to  disclose related party transactions entered into between 2 or  more members of a group. b. Judgements in applying accounting policies and key  sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of the financial statements requires management to  make assumptions, judgements and estimates and to use judgement  in applying accounting policies and making critical accounting  estimates. These judgements, estimates and assumptions are based  on management’s best knowledge of the relevant facts and  circumstances, having regard to previous experience, but actual  results may differ materially from the amounts included in the  financial statements. The key area of judgement that has the most significant effect on  the amounts recognised in the financial statements is the review for  impairment of investment carrying values. Investments in subsidiaries are reviewed for impairment where  events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying  amount of the investment may not be recoverable. The unit of  account being the equity of the subsidiary taken as a whole, which  may include interests in multiple cash-generating units. If any such indication exists, Rio Tinto plc makes an assessment of the  recoverable amount. If the asset is determined to be impaired, an  impairment loss will be recorded and the asset will be written down  based on the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds the  higher of fair value less cost of disposal and value in use. An  impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. c. Currency translation Items included in the financial statements are measured using the  currency of the primary economic environment in which the  Company operates (the functional currency). The financial  statements are presented in US dollars, which is the Company’s  functional and presentation currency. Transactions denominated in  other currencies, including the issue of shares, are translated into  the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the  date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of  such transactions, and from the translation at year-end exchange  rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign  currencies, are recognised in the profit and loss account. Exchange rates used are consistent with the rates used by the  Group as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements on  page 156. d. Investments Investments in Group companies are valued at cost less  accumulated impairment losses. Investments are reviewed for  impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the  carrying amount may not be recoverable. e. Financial guarantees Financial guarantees are recognised initially at fair value.  Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the best  estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation  and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation. f. Share-based payments The Company operates a number of share-based payment plans for  Group employees, the details of which are included in the  consolidated financial statements (note 27). The fair value of the  Company’s share plans is recognised as an addition to the cost of  the investment in the subsidiary in which the relevant employees  work over the expected vesting period, with a corresponding entry  to retained earnings. Payments received from the Company’s  subsidiaries in respect of these share-based payments are  recognised as a reduction in the cost of the investment. The  Company uses fair values provided by independent actuaries  calculated using either a lattice-based option valuation model or a  Monte Carlo simulation model. The fair value of the share plans is  determined at the date of grant, taking into account any market- based vesting conditions attached to the award. Non-market vesting conditions (eg Total Shareholder Return (TSR)  performance condition) are taken into account in estimating the  number of awards likely to vest. The estimate of the number of  awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date up to  the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect  the actual awards issued. No adjustment is made after the vesting  date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised. g. Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment  is established. h. Treasury shares The consideration paid for shares repurchased by the Company  and held as treasury shares is recognised as a reduction in  shareholders’ funds through retained earnings.

G  Rio Tinto plc guarantees Rio Tinto plc provides a number of guarantees in respect of Group companies. Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited have jointly guaranteed the Group’s external listed debt under the US Shelf Programme, European Debt  Issuance Programme and Commercial Paper Programme which totalled US$6.8 billion at 31 December 2024 (2023: US$7.3 billion). These  entities also jointly guarantee the Group’s undrawn credit facility, which was US$7.5 billion at 31 December 2024 (2023: US$7.5 billion). At  31 December 2024, Rio Tinto plc has provided guarantees in respect of certain derivative contracts that are in a liability position of US$221  million (2023: US$381 million). Rio Tinto plc has provided a guarantee, known as the completion support undertaking (CSU), in favour of the Oyu Tolgoi LLC project finance lenders.  In 2023, a wholly owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto plc became a lender under the project finance facility ranking pari passu with the external lenders. At 31 December 2024, a total of US$5.5 billion (2023: US$4.7 billion) of project finance debt was outstanding under this facility of which  US$3.9 billion (2023: US$3.9 billion) is owed to external third party lenders. Rio Tinto plc, through its subsidiaries, owns 66% of Oyu Tolgoi  LLC, with the remaining share owned by Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi LLC (34%), which is controlled by the Government of Mongolia. The project  finance was raised for development of the underground mine and the CSU will terminate on the completion of the underground mine  according to a set of completion tests set out in the project finance facility. The CSU contains a carve-out for certain political risk events.  During 2024, fees of US$77 million (2023: US$77 million) were received from Oyu Tolgoi LLC as consideration for the provision of the CSU.  In November 2024, the Group entered into a US$7.0 billion bridge facility agreement to support the proposed acquisition of Arcadium Lithium  (refer to note 5). Rio Tinto Plc and Rio Tinto Limited have jointly guaranteed the facility, which remains undrawn as at 31 December 2024.  Rio Tinto plc has provided a number of guarantees in relation to various pension funds. Subject to certain conditions, Rio Tinto plc would  pay any contributions due from Group companies participating in these funds should the companies fail to meet their contribution  requirements. The guarantees were not called upon in 2024. The aggregate of company contributions to these plans in 2024 was US$8  million (2023: US$8 million). At 31 December 2024, other guarantees issued by Rio Tinto plc in relation to Rio Tinto Group entities amount to US$594 million (2023:  US$525 million). Included within this balance is US$19 million (2023: US$17 million) in relation to non-wholly-owned subsidiaries. Pursuant to the DLC Merger, both Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited issued deed poll guarantees by which each company guaranteed  contractual obligations incurred by the other or guaranteed by the other. The liability recognised for financial guarantees is US$12 million (2023: US$37 million) presented in “Other financial liabilities” in the  balance sheet.

Financial statements  |  Other statutory information  Annual Report 2024 243 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 246 ===== Pursuant to section 340 of the Australian Corporations Act 2001  (Corporations Act), the Australian Securities and Investments  Commission (ASIC) issued an order dated 11 July 2024 that granted  relief to Rio Tinto Limited from certain requirements of the  Corporations Act in relation to its financial statements and  associated reports. The order essentially continues the relief that  has applied to Rio Tinto Limited since the formation of the Group’s  dual listed companies (DLC) structure in 1995. The order applies to  Rio Tinto Limited’s financial reporting obligations for the financial  years up to and including 31 December 2027. In essence, instead of being required under the Corporations Act to  prepare consolidated financial statements covering Rio Tinto  Limited and its controlled entities, it allows the Company to prepare  consolidated financial statements in which it, Rio Tinto plc and their  respective controlled entities are treated as a single economic  entity. In addition, those consolidated financial statements are to  be prepared: – in accordance with the principles and requirements of  International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the  United Kingdom (UK IFRS) rather than the Australian Accounting  Standards (AAS) (except for one limited instance in the case of  any concise report), and in accordance with UK financial  reporting obligations generally – on the basis that the transitional provisions of International  Financial Reporting Standard 1, First-time Adoption of  International Financial Reporting Standards, should be applied  using the combined financial statements previously prepared for  Rio Tinto Limited, Rio Tinto plc and their respective controlled  entities under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the  UK, under which the DLC Merger between Rio Tinto Limited and  Rio Tinto plc was accounted for using “merger”, rather than  “acquisition”, accounting (reflecting that neither Rio Tinto Limited  nor Rio Tinto plc was acquired by, or is controlled by, the other;  and meaning that the existing carrying amounts, rather than fair  values, of assets and liabilities at the time of the DLC Merger  were used to measure those assets and liabilities at formation) – on the basis that Rio Tinto Limited and Rio Tinto plc are a single  company (with their respective shareholders being the  shareholders in that single company) – with a reconciliation, from UK IFRS to AAS, of the following  amounts: consolidated loss/profit for the financial year, total  consolidated comprehensive loss/income for the financial year  and total consolidated equity at the end of the financial year  (see page 161). Those consolidated financial statements must also be audited in  relation to their compliance with relevant Australian and UK  requirements. Rio Tinto Limited must also prepare a Directors’  report which satisfies the content requirements of the Corporations  Act (applied on the basis that for these purposes, the consolidated  entity is the Group, and the consolidated financial statements cover  the Group). This includes a Remuneration report (see pages 119 to  145) prepared in accordance with the requirements of the  Corporations Act. Rio Tinto Limited is also required to comply generally with the  lodgement and distribution requirements of the Corporations Act  (including timing requirements) in relation to those consolidated  financial statements (including any concise financial statements),  the Auditors’ report and the Directors’ report. The Corporations Act  also requires that a non-binding resolution to adopt the  Remuneration report be voted on by shareholders at Rio Tinto  Limited’s annual general meeting. Rio Tinto Limited is not required to prepare separate consolidated  financial statements solely for it and its controlled entities. Rio Tinto  Limited is also not required to prepare and lodge parent entity  financial statements for itself in respect of each relevant  financial year. Rio Tinto Limited must, however, in accordance with the  Corporations Act include in the consolidated financial statements  for the Group, as a note, various parent entity information regarding  Rio Tinto Limited (including in relation to assets, liabilities,  shareholders’ equity, profit and loss, income, guarantees, contingent  liabilities, and contractual commitments) prepared in accordance  with AAS (see page 230).

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’  responsibilities for the audits of the financial statements section of our report.  KPMG Australia has also considered the Consolidated entity  disclosure statement and accompanying basis of preparation on page 231, the Directors’ declaration on page 245, the Reconciliation with  Australian Accounting Standards note on page 161, and the Australian Corporation Act – Summary of ASIC relief note on page 244 to be  part of the contents of the Group financial statements when forming its opinion under the requirements of the Australian Corporation Act  2001, as amended by the ASIC Class Order, the ASAs and Australian Corporations Regulations 2001. KPMG Australia has also audited the  Remuneration Report information of Rio Tinto Limited, required by the Australian Corporations Act, included in the Directors’ report pages  119 to 145 for FY24. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinions.  Our audit opinions and matters  included in this report are consistent with those discussed and included in our reporting to the Audit and Risk Committee (“ARC”).   We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements  including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities; the Australian Corporations Act 2001 as amended by the  ASIC Class Order; and the relevant ethical requirements of the Australian Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s APES 101  Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards). 2. OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDITS FACTORS DRIVING  OUR VIEW OF  RISKS  Following our FY23 audits and considering  developments  affecting the Group since then,  our assessment of risks and our view of how  these impact the audits of the financial  statements has been reassessed for the  current year. In the current year, we identified a new Key  Audit Matter (‘KAM’) in relation to our  evaluation of the impairment assessment for  the Kennecott Utah Copper cash generating  unit. This arose as a result of the impairment  trigger identified requiring an impairment  assessment to be performed. Our assessment  of risk on specific closure provisions remained  consistent with prior year. The closure  provisions for Rio Tinto Iron Ore remains as a  Key Audit Matter (‘KAM’) in FY24. Our view of the risk associated with the  Group’s assessment of impairment or  impairment reversal of property, plant and  equipment remains unchanged and continues  to be a KAM. We continued to focus on the  Oyu Tolgoi CGU due to the significance of the  operation and associated complexity, which  has heightened risk of impairment or  impairment reversal.  Our assessment of the recoverability of the UK  Parent company’s investment in subsidiaries  has remained consistent and remains a KAM  for the UK parent company. Key Audit Matters Vs FY23 Item Evaluation of the impairment assessment  for the Kennecott Utah Copper cash  generating unit (‘KUC CGU’) + 4.1 Evaluation of specific provisions for the  close-down, restoration and environmental  obligations (‘closure provisions’) – 4.2 Evaluation of indicators of impairment or  impairment reversal of property, plant and  equipment for the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold  mine cash generating unit (‘Oyu Tolgoi CGU’) – 4.3 Evaluation of recoverability of Rio Tinto plc’s  investments in subsidiaries (KPMG UK only) – 4.4 AUDIT AND RISK  COMMITTEE  INTERACTION In relation to FY24, the Audit and Risk committee (“ARC”) met 6 times. KPMG are invited to attend all ARC  meetings and are provided with an opportunity to meet with the ARC in private sessions without the Executive  Directors or management being present. For each Key Audit Matter, we have set out communications with the  ARC in section 4, including matters that required particular judgement for each.  The matters included in the Audit and Risk committee Chair’s report on page 113 are materially consistent with  our observations of those meetings.

We have not performed any non-audit services during  the year ended 31 December 2024 or subsequently  which are prohibited by the FRC Ethical Standard or  Australian Corporations Act 2001 or  Australian  Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s  APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants.  We were first appointed as auditors by the members  for the financial year ended 31 December 2020. The  period of total uninterrupted engagement is for the  five financial years ended 31 December 2024.  The Group engagement partners are required to rotate  every 5 years. The Group engagement partners are  Trevor Hart and Jonathan Downer who are required to  rotate off after the FY24 and FY25 audits respectively. The average tenure of component engagement  partners as set out in section 7 is 4 years, with the  shortest being 1 year and the longest 5 years. Total fee US$33.5m Audit related fees  including interim review US$29.8m Other services US$3.7m Non-audit fee as a % of  total audit and audit  related fee %  12.4%  Date first appointed KPMG UK – 8 April 2020 KPMG Australia – 5 May 2020 Uninterrupted audit tenure 5 years Next financial period which  requires a tender 2030 Tenure of Group  engagement partner Trevor Hart – 5 years Jonathan Downer – 4 years Average tenure of  component partners 4 years MATERIALITY  (SECTION 6 BELOW)  The scope of our work is influenced by our view of  materiality and our assessed risk of material  misstatement.  We have determined overall materiality for the Group  financial statements as a whole at US$700m (FY23:  US$700m).  For both FY24 and FY23, we determined  profit before taxation to be an appropriate benchmark  (‘the benchmark’) and considered qualitative factors  that impact our assessment of materiality. The  rationale for this benchmark is the Group is profit- orientated and, in an industry like mining, the cost of  operations show the Group’s ability to control costs to  generate value over volume. We consider this to be  key to users of the financial statements. In FY24 we adjusted profit before taxation to exclude  certain items that were significant and did not represent  normal, continuing operations of the Group in  determining our materiality (‘normalised Group profit  before taxation’). The exclusions were US$538m related  to the pre-tax impairment charge as disclosed in Note 4  and US$1,214m of pre-tax gains on consolidation and  disposal of interests in businesses as disclosed in Note  5 of the Group financial statements. In FY23 there was  an exclusion of US$936m related to the net pre-tax  impairment charge as disclosed in Note 4 of the Group’s  financial statements. The Group materiality for FY24  represents 4.7% of the normalised Group profit before  taxation (FY23: 4.8%). KPMG UK have determined materiality for the Rio Tinto  plc Company financial statements as a whole at  US$410m (FY23: US$410m). Consistent with FY23 we  determined total assets remain an appropriate  benchmark because the entity’s role as a parent  company means it holds significant assets. The  materiality benchmark represents 1% (FY23: 1%) of  Rio Tinto plc’s total assets.

We identified components and determined those  which are considered to be quantitatively significant,  require special audit considerations or would  otherwise require procedures to be performed.  This has resulted in 15 components in scope, please  refer to section 7 below for further details of  these components.  In addition, for the remaining components for which we  performed no audit procedures, we performed analysis  at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our  assessment that there is not a reasonable possibility of  a material misstatement in these components.  We consider the scope of our audit, as communicated  to the Audit and Risk Committee, to be an appropriate  basis for our audit opinion. Our audit procedures covered 77% of  Group revenue: Group revenue We performed audit procedures in relation  to components that accounted for the  following percentages: Total profits and losses that made up group profit  before tax Group Total assets THE IMPACT  OF CLIMATE  CHANGE ON  OUR AUDITS As part of our risk assessment throughout the audits, we considered the potential impacts of climate change on  the Group’s business and the financial statements, based on our knowledge of the Group’s operations and their  stated climate change strategy. Recognising the increased shareholder focus on the impact of climate change  on financial reporting and financial statement audits, we are providing enhanced disclosure on the impact of  climate change on our audit in this report. We do not identify the impact of climate change as a separate Key  Audit Matter in our audit given the nature of the Group’s operations, the impact of climate change on the  Group’s key judgements and estimates, and the resulting impact on our audit effort. The context of climate change for the Group The Group does not mine or extract hydrocarbons such as coal, natural gas or oil. It does, however, emit  greenhouse gases directly from energy used in its mining operations, the processing of metals and minerals and  the transportation of its products. Certain of the Group’s products are used in energy and carbon intensive  industries including steel and aluminium production. Other of the Group’s products, such as copper, are  expected to continue to be important in the transition to a low-carbon economy. Targets and expected capital expenditure Within page 157 of the Group’s financial statements, the Group has discussed its target to reduce scope 1 and  scope 2 emissions relative to its 2018 baseline by 15% in 2025, by 50% in 2030 and aim to achieve net zero by  2050. Whilst the Group expects to have made financial commitments to abatement projects designed to  achieve the 15% emissions reduction by the end of 2025, the actual emissions abatement will lag these. Climate change scenarios The Group has detailed within page 158 its climate change scenarios, with Group’s Conviction scenario being  the central reference case for commodity forecasts and valuations, to support strategic decision making, capital  allocation and financial reporting. The Group’s Resilience and Aspirational scenario are two ends of the  spectrum, with the Group’s Resilience scenario being a lower GDP growth world and the Group’s Aspirational  scenario the stretch goal of the Paris Agreement.

Those assumptions may not align  with the ways in which the global economy, society and government policies will need to change to meet the  targets to limit global warming to 1.50C, which is aligned with the stretch goal of the 2015 COP 21 Paris Agreement. The Group has detailed how it considered the financial reporting consequences of climate change on pages 157 to  160, of the financial statements including cross references where further disclosure is included in notes to the  Group financial statements Our audit response General risk assessment procedures As part of our risk assessment procedures, we made inquiries, with the assistance of our sustainability specialists,  of key members of management. Our inquiries focused on understanding the reason for and make-up of the  Group’s new Conviction scenario, progress of the Group’s climate strategy and identifying those areas where  climate change could have a potentially material impact on the financial statements. Our inquiries also focused on  understanding the progress made by the Group in meeting its Scope 1 and Scope 2 targets, progress of its  decarbonisation programmes and understanding the Group’s actual capital expenditure in relation to its  decarbonisation strategy and financial commitments to abatement projects. We involved our sustainability  specialists in our inherent risk assessment and planning discussions, where we discussed the Group’s climate  strategy, and considered potential material impacts to the financial statements. Specific risk assessment procedures with regards to the carrying value of the Group’s assets, consideration of  asset obsolescence and assessment of useful economic lives As the Group continues to progress its climate change strategy, we have considered the impact of climate change  when evaluating potential impairment of property, plant and equipment or cash-generating units (‘CGUs’) including  when responding to the Key Audit Matters (‘KAM) with respect to the Oyu Tolgoi and Kennecott Utah Copper CGUs. Our climate risk assessment procedures, including making specific inquiries with Group personnel to assess risk of  material misstatement on the Group’s financial statements, included : – Understanding the status of the Group’s plans relating to renewable energy solutions to the Australian  Aluminium assets and related considerations for asset obsolescence or re-estimation of useful lives. – Understanding the status of the Group’s plan to decarbonise elements of its operations, including attaining net  zero shipping vessels by 2030, decarbonising elements of its existing mobile fleet, in the Pilbara, and related  considerations for asset obsolescence or re-estimation of useful lives. – Understanding the Group’s process to continue assessing the impact of climate change on physical risks to its  operations and the accounting impacts, if any. This included, for example, whether physical risk had impacted  the Group’s judgment on the useful economic life of its water rights in Quebec (currently indefinite-life  intangible assets). – As a result of our risk-assessment procedures, considering factors such as the stage of development and expected  timing of asset replacement projects compared to existing useful economic lives, we have not identified a separate  risk of material misstatement arising from the impact of climate change to these financial statements. As the Group continues implementing its climate strategy, there may be material accounting considerations and  consequences in the future, including impacts on recoverable amounts of key assets and re-estimation of useful  economic lives. Other audit procedures During the course of our audits our specialists, including sustainability specialists, assisted us in carrying out  additional audit procedures including: – Evaluating the potential impact of new and emerging climate-related legislation on the Group. This included the  Australian Safeguard mechanisms. – Evaluating the material closure provisions of the Group where cost estimates consider the impact of climate  change in inputs, such  as expected precipitation rates. This consideration was not significant to warrant  separate discussion in our KAM on evaluation of specific provision for close-down, restoration and environment – Evaluating the Group’s disclosures related to climate change in the financial statements – Reading the disclosures related to climate change in the Directors’ Report and Strategic report, including the TCFD  recommended disclosures, and considering their consistency with the financial statements and our audit knowledge – Assessing the consistency between the Group’s expectation of capital expenditure planned for decarbonisation  with cash flows used in the going concern and viability assessments.

GOING CONCERN, VIABILITY AND PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES  (KPMG UK ONLY) The Directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Group or the UK  parent or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the Group’s and UK parent company’s financial position means that  this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to  continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements (“the going concern period”).   GOING CONCERN We used our knowledge of the Group, its industry, and the general economic  environment to identify the inherent risks to its business model and analysed  how those risks might affect the Group’s financial resources or ability to  continue operations over the going concern period. The risks we considered  most likely to adversely affect the Group’s and UK Parent Company’s  available financial resources over this period  relate to levels of demand and  commodity pricing of key products. We critically assessed the assumptions in the Directors’ downside scenarios  relevant to liquidity and covenant metrics, in particular in relation to revenue  growth by assessing: – The directors’ forecasting by comparing previous forecasts with actual results – The assumptions in the Group’s forecast of reasonably possibly  downsides – The impact of applying more severe downside scenarios. The extent of our work was influenced by the level of liquidity. We also  assessed the completeness of the going concern disclosure. Accordingly, based on those procedures, we found the directors’ use of the  going concern basis of accounting without any material uncertainty for the  Group and Parent Company to be acceptable.  However, as we cannot  predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result  in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at  the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the  Group or the Parent Company will continue in operation. Our conclusions – We consider that the directors’ use of the going  concern basis of accounting in the preparation of  the Group’s and UK parent company’s financial  statements is appropriate; – We have not identified, and concur with the  directors’ assessment that there is not, a material  uncertainty related to events or conditions that,  individually or collectively, may cast significant  doubt on the Group’s or UK parent company's  ability to continue as a going concern for the going  concern period; – We have nothing material to add or draw attention  to in relation to the directors’ statement on the  ‘about the presentation of our financial statements’  section in the financial statements on the use of the  going concern basis of accounting with no material  uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over  the Group and UK parent company’s use of that  basis for the going concern period, and we found  the going concern disclosure to be acceptable; and – The related statement under the UK Listing Rules  set out on page 151 is materially consistent with the  financial statements and our audit knowledge. Financial statements  |  Independent Auditors’ Report Independent Auditors’ Report Of KPMG LLP (“KPMG UK”) to the members of Rio Tinto plc and of KPMG (“KPMG Australia”)  to the members of Rio Tinto Limited Annual Report 2024 251  ===== PAGE 254 ===== DISCLOSURES OF EMERGING AND PRINCIPAL RISKS AND LONGER-TERM VIABILITY Our responsibility  We are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material  inconsistency between the directors’ disclosures in respect of emerging and  principal risks and the viability statement, and the financial statements and  our audit knowledge.  Based on those procedures, we have nothing material to add or draw  attention to in relation to:   – the directors’ confirmation within the longer-term viability statement on  page 90 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging  and principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten  its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity; – the Principal Risks disclosures describing these risks and how emerging  risks are identified and explaining how they are being managed and  mitigated; and – the directors’ explanation in the longer-term viability statement of how  they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they  have done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and  their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the  Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they  fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related  disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or  assumptions. We are also required to review the longer-term viability statement set out on  page 90 under the Listing Rules. Our work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only the  knowledge acquired during our financial statements audit.  As we cannot  predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result  in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at  the time they were made, the absence of anything to report on these  statements is not a guarantee as to the Group’s and UK Parent Company’s  longer-term viability. Our reporting We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in  relation to these disclosures. We have concluded that these disclosures are  materially consistent with the financial statements and  our audit knowledge. 3. KEY AUDIT MATTERS WHAT WE MEAN Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audits of the current year  financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by  us, including those which had the greatest effect on:  – the overall audit strategies;  – the allocation of resources in the audits; and – directing the efforts of the engagement teams.  We include below the Key Audit Matters (‘KAMs’) for the Group and Rio Tinto plc in decreasing order of audit significance, together with our  key audit procedures to address those matters and, as required for public interest entities, our results from those procedures. These matters  were addressed  in the context of, and our results are based on procedures undertaken specific to each of our discrete audits of the  financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinions thereon, and consequently are incidental to those opinions, and we do not  provide separate opinions on these matters.  4.1 EVALUATION OF THE IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT FOR THE KENNECOTT UTAH COPPER CGU (‘KUC  CGU’) Financial Statement Elements Our results FY24 FY24: Acceptable Carrying value of the Kennecott Utah Copper CGU US$2,200m Financial statements  |  Independent Auditors’ Report Independent Auditors’ Report Of KPMG LLP (“KPMG UK”) to the members of Rio Tinto plc and of KPMG (“KPMG Australia”)  to the members of Rio Tinto Limited Annual Report 2024 252  ===== PAGE 255 ===== Description of the Key Audit Matter Our response to the risk As described in note 4, the Group has determined that  there is an indicator of impairment of property, plant  and equipment in the Kennecott Utah Copper CGU, as  a result of worsening geotechnical conditions, which  led to the Group estimating the recoverable amount of  the CGU (based on fair value less costs of disposal  methodology) and comparing to the respective  carrying amount. The Group concluded that the  Kennecott Utah Copper CGU’s recoverable amount  exceeded its carrying value. The Group’s determination of recoverable amount of  the CGU requires judgement and estimation in arriving  at key assumptions, including: – forecast copper commodity prices; and   – timing and volume of forecast production in the life  of mine plans.  We have identified the Group’s impairment assessment  of property, plant and equipment in the Kennecott  Utah Copper CGU as a key audit matter. This was due  to the complex auditor judgement and the level of  specialised skills required to evaluate the key  assumptions noted above.   Our procedures to address the risk included: Control operation Evaluating the design and testing the operating effectiveness of certain  internal controls of the Group related to the impairment process for  determination of the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment  for the Kennecott Utah Copper CGU. Test of details We performed the following procedures to challenge the Group when  evaluating the key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount:  – involved our valuation professionals with specialist skills and knowledge  who assisted us in assessing the forecast long-term copper commodity  prices used in the Group’s assessment by comparing them to, and  considering changes in, market observable price forecasts; – assessed the scope, competency and objectivity of the Group’s internal  experts who prepared the life of mine plans (which details the timing and  production volumes) utilised in the Group’s impairment assessment by  examining the work they were involved to perform, their professional  qualification and experience; and  – used our audit knowledge, judgement and industry experience to evaluate  and challenge the Group’s assumptions on timing and volume of production,  including with reference to historical performance and through inquiries of  senior finance and operational personnel within the Group Assessing disclosures We have assessed the disclosures in note 4 of the Group financial statements   using our understanding obtained from our testing, against the requirements  of the accounting standards. Communications with the Rio Tinto’s Audit and Risk Committee Our discussions with and reporting to the Audit and Risk Committee included: – Key factors impacting our risk assessment and procedures performed as listed above – Key procedures performed to respond to the risk as listed above; and  – Involvement of our valuations professionals, who assisted us in assessing the forecast copper commodity prices Areas of particular auditor judgement There is inherent judgement and complexity in assessing the Group’s forecast copper commodity prices and the timing and volume of  the forecast production and life of mine plan. Our results We found the impairment assessment of the Kennecott Utah Copper CGU to be acceptable. 4.2 EVALUATION OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS FOR CLOSE-DOWN, RESTORATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL  OBLIGATIONS (‘CLOSURE PROVISIONS’) Financial Statement Elements Our assessment of risk vs FY23 Our results FY24 FY23 ïñ Our assessment of risk on  specific closure provisions  remained consistent with the  prior year. FY24: Acceptable FY23: Acceptable Carrying value of the closure provisions  within Rio Tinto Iron ore (‘Pilbara’) Included in  US$15,731m  of close- down and  restoration  provisions  Included in  US$17,150m   of close-down  and  restoration  provisions Financial statements  |  Independent Auditors’ Report Independent Auditors’ Report Of KPMG LLP (“KPMG UK”) to the members of Rio Tinto plc and of KPMG (“KPMG Australia”)  to the members of Rio Tinto Limited Annual Report 2024 253  ===== PAGE 256 ===== Description of the Key Audit Matter Our response to the risk The Group incurs legal and constructive obligations for  close-down and restoration activities which include the  dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, the removal  of residual materials and the remediation of disturbed  areas for mines and certain refineries and smelters.  Generally, there is relatively limited activity within the  Group or broader industry of completing large scale  restoration and rehabilitation projects, and elements of  restoration and rehabilitation of each site are relatively  unique to the site. As such, there are limited comparable  historical precedents against which to assess estimates  of future costs, which increases estimation uncertainty  for the Group, and increases audit focus for us. A significant proportion of the Group’s assets have long  remaining lives, which also increases the estimation  uncertainty relating to the restoration and rehabilitation  activities required and the timing of the associated future  cash flows. Because of this, the effect of the time value of  money is significant. Close-down, restoration and environmental remediation  activities are governed by a combination of legislative  requirements and the Group’s policies. These vary across  location, product and operation. The Group has disclosed that the determination of when  an estimate associated with close-down, restoration and  environmental obligations is sufficiently reliable to update  is an area of judgement that may have a significant effect  on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. The evaluation of closure provisions for Rio Tinto Iron  Ore (‘Pilbara’) is a KAM due to the significant amount of  the provision and the judgement and specialised skills  involved in our audit testing of key assumptions used by  the Group to determine the provision, including: – the future close-down and restoration costs including  costs associated with post-closure monitoring; and – the life of operation and probability, nature and timing  of closure rehabilitation activities. Refer to note 14, and the Audit and Risk Committee’s  views set on page 114. Our procedures to address the risk included: Control operation Evaluating the design and testing the operating effectiveness of certain  internal controls over the Group’s process to estimate provisions for close- down, restoration and environmental obligations including the Group’s  selection of key assumptions to be used. Test of details – We evaluated the scope, objectivity and competence of the Group’s  experts, both internal and external to the Group, who produce the cost  estimates, by examining the work they were involved to perform, their  professional qualification and experience; – We compared a sample of previous forecast cost assumptions to actual  costs to assess the Group’s ability to accurately forecast closure costs; – We inspected the most recent closure studies and other technical  material prepared by the Group relating to changes in the closure  provision to assess the nature and scope of restoration work planned  to be undertaken. This included assumptions related to the life of the  operation and the probability, nature and timing of closure rehabilitation  activities and strategy; – On a sample basis, we compared the nature, timing and quantum of  costs contained in the Group’s provisions to the Group’s third-party  expert reports and internal and external underlying documentation; and – We evaluated the completeness of the provisions against the Group’s  analysis for where disturbances require rehabilitation and comparing to  our understanding of the Pilbara sites, including the probability, nature  and timing of possible closure rehabilitation activities. Our closure expertise For a sample of sites, we involved our own mine closure professionals with  specialist skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating the methodology  applied by the Group’s third-party experts and assisted us in assessing  certain assumptions regarding the nature and costs of future rehabilitation  based on their experience and familiarity with applicable legislative  requirements and industry practice and Group’s closure commitments. Assessing disclosures We have assessed the disclosures in note 14 of the Group financial statements,  including the accounting policy, using our understanding obtained from our  testing, against the requirements of the accounting standards. This included  evaluating the current and non-current closure provision disclosure for  consistency to the planned timing of the expenditure, and whether the  disclosure reflected the risks inherent in the estimation of the provision. Communications with the Rio Tinto’s Audit and Risk Committee Our discussions with and reporting to the Audit and Risk Committee included: – Key factors impacting our risk assessment and procedures performed as listed above – Involvement of our mine closure professionals, in assessing certain assumptions regarding the forecast closure costs of closure  activities within the Pilbara; and – Conclusions from our audit procedures.  Areas of particular auditor judgement There is inherent judgement and complexity in: – assessing the accuracy of close-down and restoration costs (including contingencies) given the limited comparable historical  precedents of similar activities being undertaken  – the length of time until the closure activities are due to be completed which impacts the estimation of cost; and – the assessment of the probability of whether certain closure activities will be required to be undertaken based on the interpretation  of legislative requirements   Our results We found the level of provision for close-down, restoration and environmental obligations for Rio Tinto Iron Ore to be acceptable.

FY24: Acceptable FY23: Acceptable  Carrying value of the Oyu Tolgoi CGU  Included in  US$67,345m  of property,  plant and  equipment  Included in  US$65,290m of  property plant  and equipment Description of the Key Audit  Our response to the risk The Group has determined that there were no indicators of an  impairment or impairment reversal of property, plant and  equipment on the Oyu Tolgoi CGU. Please see Note 4 for the  group’s assessment The assessment of whether indicators of impairment or impairment  reversal exist over the Oyu Tolgoi CGU is a KAM due to: – The history of impairment in the CGU meaning it is more  susceptible to further indicators of impairment or  impairment reversal – The level of auditor judgement required in challenging the  Group’s determination that there were no indicators of  impairment or impairment reversal requiring involvement of  valuations professionals alongside our senior audit  team members We focussed on the key internal and external factors impacting  the Oyu Tolgoi CGU, including: – The continued ramp up of the underground production  – Volatility in forecast commodity prices which are subject to  greater uncertainty in the current economic environment Our procedures to address the risk included: Control operation Evaluating the design, implementation and testing the operating  effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Group’s process  for identifying indicators of impairment or impairment reversal of  property, plant and equipment for the Oyu Tolgoi CGU. Test of details We performed the following procedures, amongst others, to  challenge the Group’s determination that no indicators of  impairment or impairment reversal were present: – evaluated the Group’s assessment with reference to our  knowledge of the Group, our industry experience, current  economic conditions and requirements of IAS 36 – Impairment  of Assets; – involved our valuation professionals with specialised skills and  knowledge who assisted us in assessing the forecast  commodity prices used in the Group’s assessment, by  comparing them to, and considering changes in, market  observable price forecasts; – compared the actual ramp up of underground mine  production to the Group’s plans, to assess whether any  deviation from these plans could represent an indicator of  impairment or impairment reversal; and – inquired of operational management to corroborate certain  changes in assumptions. Assessing disclosures We have assessed the disclosures in note 4 of the Group financial  statements, including the accounting policy, using our  understanding obtained from our testing, against the  requirements of the accounting standards.  Communications with Rio Tinto’s Audit and Risk Committee Our discussions with and reporting to the Audit and Risk Committee included: – Key factors impacting our risk assessment and procedures performed as listed above; – Key procedures performed to respond to the risk as listed above; and  – Involvement of our own valuations professionals, who assisted us in assessing the forecast commodity prices. Areas of particular auditor judgement Particular auditor judgement was required to assess whether certain internal and external factors impacting the Oyu Tolgoi CGU, in  particular the volatility of forecast commodity prices and the continued ramp up of underground production, result in indicators of  impairment or impairment reversal. Our results We found the Group’s determination that there were no indicators or impairment or impairment reversal in respect of the Oyu Tolgoi  CGU to be acceptable.

FY24: Acceptable FY23: Acceptable Carrying value of Rio Tinto plc’s  investments in Group companies US$36,212m US$36,218m Description of the Key Audit  Our response to the risk In respect of KPMG UK’s audit of the UK parent company,  Rio Tinto plc, the sole KAM relates to the recoverability of its  investment in its subsidiaries of the Group. The carrying amount of  the UK parent Company’s investments in subsidiaries is disclosed  in Note B of the Rio Tinto plc company financial statements  represents 81.8% (FY23: 87.7%) of the UK parent company’s  total assets. Their recoverability is not at a high risk of material misstatement or  subject to significant auditor judgement. However, due to the  value of these investments in the context of the UK parent  company’s financial statements, this is the area that had the  greatest effect overall on our UK parent company audit. We performed the tests below rather than seeking to rely on any  of the company’s controls because the nature of the balance is  such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily  through the detailed procedures described.  Our procedures to address the risk included: Test of details – We compared the carrying value of its investments with the  relevant subsidiaries’ draft balance sheets to identify whether  their net assets, being an approximation of their minimum  recoverable amounts, were in excess of the carrying amount – We evaluated the UK parent company’s considerations of  indicators of impairment or impairment reversal of the Group’s  CGUs within the subsidiaries owned by the UK parent company  using our knowledge obtained from the Group’s impairment or  impairment reversal assessment. Communications with Rio Tinto plc’s Audit and Risk Committee We reported to the Audit and Risk Committee that based on the risks identified and our procedures performed, we found the  company’s conclusion that there is no impairment of its investments in subsidiaries to be acceptable.  Areas of particular auditor judgement There were no areas of particular auditor judgement. Our results We found the company’s conclusion that there is no impairment of its investment in subsidiaries to be acceptable.  4. KPMG UK’S REPORTING ON OUR ABILITY TO DETECT IRREGULARITIES, AND OUR RESPONSE   FRAUD - IDENTIFYING AND RESPONDING TO RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT DUE TO FRAUD FRAUD RISK  ASSESSMENT To identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud (‘fraud risks’) we assessed events or conditions that  could indicate an incentive or pressure by the Directors and other management to commit, or provide an  opportunity to commit, fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included: – Inquiries of the Directors, other management, internal audit and the Audit and Risk Committee, including  obtaining and reviewing underlying documentation, covering the Group’s policies and procedures related to: • Detecting and responding to the risks of fraud • Internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud – Inquiries of the Directors, other management, internal audit and the Audit and Risk Committee as to  whether they had knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud – Reading Board and Audit and Risk Committee minutes – Considering remuneration incentive schemes and performance targets for Directors and other  management, including the flexed and unflexed underlying earning and STIP free cash flow target ranges  for executive remuneration Financial statements  |  Independent Auditors’ Report Independent Auditors’ Report Of KPMG LLP (“KPMG UK”) to the members of Rio Tinto plc and of KPMG (“KPMG Australia”)  to the members of Rio Tinto Limited Annual Report 2024 256  ===== PAGE 259 ===== FRAUD RISK  ASSESSMENT  (continued) – Using analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationship between financial  statement line items – Discussion among the engagement team regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial  statements and any potential indicators of fraud. The engagement team includes audit partners and staff  who have extensive experience of working with companies in the mining sector, and this experience was  relevant to the decision about where fraud risks may arise. The discussions also involved our own forensic  specialists to assist us in identifying fraud risks based on discussions of the circumstances of the Group  who advised the engagement team of fraud schemes that had arisen in similar sectors and industries and  participated in the fraud risk assessment discussions. RISK  COMMUNICATIONS We communicated fraud risks throughout the team and remained alert to any indicators of fraud throughout  the audits. This included communication from the group audit team to component auditors of relevant fraud  risks identified at the group level and requests to component audit teams to report to the group audit team  any instances of fraud that could give rise to a material misstatement of the Group financial statements. FRAUD RISKS As required by UK auditing standards we addressed the risk of management override of controls and the risk  of fraudulent revenue recognition. In particular we considered the risk that revenue is recorded in the wrong  period, specifically overstated and the risk that Group and component management may be in a position to  make inappropriate accounting entries, and the risk of bias in accounting estimates and judgments, with an  additional risk focused on manual journals to revenue. We did not identify any additional fraud risks. PROCEDURES TO  ADDRESS FRAUD  RISKS Our audit procedures included evaluating the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of internal  controls relevant to mitigate these risks. We also performed audit procedures including: – Comparing journal entries to supporting documentation for a selection based on risk including, for example,  those posted by senior finance management, those posted to unusual accounts or those containing unusual  journal descriptions. Additionally, we identified high-risk manual journal entries related to revenue. – Assessing significant accounting estimates for bias – Obtaining third party confirmations for all material cash balances – Assessing when revenue was recognised, particularly focusing on revenue recognised in the days before year-end,  and whether it was recognised in the appropriate year in line with the requirements of the accounting standards. LAWS AND REGULATIONS - IDENTIFYING AND RESPONDING TO RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT RELATING  TO COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS LAWS AND  REGULATIONS RISK  ASSESSMENT  We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on  the financial statements: – From our general commercial and mining sector experience – From inspection of the Group’s regulatory and legal correspondence – Discussed with the Directors and other management about the policies and procedures regarding  compliance with laws and regulations As the Group operates in a regulated environment, our assessment of risks of material misstatement also  involved gaining an understanding of the control environments including the Group’s higher-level  procedures for complying with regulatory requirements. RISK  COMMUNICATIONS We communicated identified laws and regulations risks throughout our team and remained alert to any non- compliance throughout the audits. This included communication from the group audit team to components  audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at the group level and requests to component  auditors to report to the group audit team any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that  could give rise to a material misstatement of the Group financial statements. DIRECT LAWS  CONTEXT AND  LINK TO AUDIT The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably. Firstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements, including: – Financial reporting legislation (including related companies’ legislation) – Distributable profits legislation – Taxation legislation (direct and indirect) – Pensions legislation We assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the  related financial statement items. Financial statements  |  Independent Auditors’ Report Independent Auditors’ Report Of KPMG LLP (“KPMG UK”) to the members of Rio Tinto plc and of KPMG (“KPMG Australia”)  to the members of Rio Tinto Limited Annual Report 2024 257  ===== PAGE 260 ===== MOST SIGNIFICANT  INDIRECT LAW/  REGULATION AREAS Secondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non- compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance  through the imposition of fines or litigation or harm to the Group’s license to operate We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect: – Anti-bribery, fraud and corruption – Health and safety legislation – Employment and social security legislation – Environmental protection legislation – Competition legislation Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and  regulations to enquiry of the Directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal  correspondence, if any. Therefore, if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident  from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach. KNOWN ACTUAL  MATTERS For the contingent liabilities disclosed in note 37 we assessed the disclosures against our understanding  from legal confirmations received from external legal counsel and the requirements of the accounting  standards. CONTEXT CONTEXT OF THE  ABILITY OF THE  AUDIT TO DETECT  FRAUD OR  BREACHES OF LAW  OR REGULATION Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected  some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and  performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non- compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial  statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by UK auditing standards would identify  it.  In addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as fraud may involve  collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit  procedures are designed to detect material misstatement.  We are not responsible for preventing non- compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations. 5. OUR DETERMINATION OF MATERIALITY The scope of our audits was influenced by our application of materiality. We set quantitative thresholds and overlay qualitative  considerations to help us determine the scope of our audits and the nature, timing and extent of our procedures, and in evaluating the effect  of misstatements, both individually and in the aggregate, on the distinct financial statements as a whole.  USUS$700M (FY23: US$700M) MATERIALITY FOR  THE GROUP  FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS AS  A WHOLE What we mean A quantitative reference for the purpose of planning and performing our audits. Basis for determining materiality and judgements applied Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set by us at US$700m (FY23: US$700m). This  was determined with reference to a benchmark of profit before taxation of the Group.  For both FY24 and FY23, we determined profit before taxation to be an appropriate benchmark (‘the  benchmark’) and considered qualitative factors that impact our assessment of materiality. The rationale for  this benchmark is the Group is profit-orientated and, in an industry like mining, the cost of operations show  the Group’s ability to control costs to generate value over volume. We consider this to be key to users of the  financial statements. In FY24 we adjusted profit before taxation to exclude certain items that were significant and did not  represent normal, continuing operations of the Group in determining our materiality (‘normalised Group  profit before taxation’). The exclusions were US$538m related to the pre-tax impairment charge as disclosed  in Note 4 and US$1,214m of pre-tax gains on consolidation and disposal of interests in businesses as  disclosed in Note 5 of the Group financial statements. In FY23 there was an exclusion of US$936m related to  the net pre-tax impairment charge as disclosed in Note 4 of the Group’s financial statements. The Group  materiality for FY24 represents 4.7% of the normalised Group profit before taxation (FY23: 4.8%). KPMG UK have determined materiality for the Rio Tinto plc Company financial statements as a whole at  US$410m (FY23: US$410m). Consistent with FY23 we determined total assets remain an appropriate  benchmark because the entity’s role as a parent company means it holds significant assets. The materiality  benchmark represents 1% (FY23: 1%) of Rio Tinto plc’s total assets. Financial statements  |  Independent Auditors’ Report Independent Auditors’ Report Of KPMG LLP (“KPMG UK”) to the members of Rio Tinto plc and of KPMG (“KPMG Australia”)  to the members of Rio Tinto Limited Annual Report 2024 258  ===== PAGE 261 ===== US$455M (FY23: US$455M) PERFORMANCE  MATERIALITY What we mean Our procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to a lower threshold,  performance materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial  misstatements in individual account balances add up to a material amount across the financial statements as  a whole. Basis for determining performance materiality and judgements applied We have considered performance materiality at a level of 65% (FY23: 65%) of materiality for the Group  financial statements as a whole to be appropriate. We applied this percentage in our determination of  performance materiality based on our expectation of control risk at the start of the audit and based on the  findings of previous audits. We have determined the Parent Company performance materiality to be set at US$307m (FY23: US$307m),  which equates to 75% (FY23: 75%) of materiality for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole.  KPMG UK applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality because we did not  identify any factors indicating an elevated level of risk. US$35M (FY23: US$35M) AUDIT  MISSTATEMENT  POSTING  THRESHOLD What we mean This is the amount below which identified misstatements are considered to be clearly trivial from a  quantitative point of view. We may become aware of misstatements below this threshold which could alter  the nature, timing and scope of our audit procedures, for example if we identify smaller misstatements which  are indicators of fraud.  This is also the amount above which all misstatements identified are communicated to Rio Tinto’s Audit and  Risk Committee. Basis for determining performance materiality and judgements applied Basis for determining the audit misstatement posting threshold and judgements applied We set our audit misstatement posting threshold at 5% (FY23: 5%) of our materiality for the Group financial  statements and UK parent company financial statements. We also report to the Audit and Risk Committee any other identified misstatements that warrant reporting on  qualitative grounds. The overall materiality for the Group financial statements of US$700m (FY23: US$700m) compares as follows to the main financial  statement caption amounts:  Total Group Revenue  Group profit before tax  Total Group Assets FY24 FY23 FY24 FY23 FY24 FY23 Financial statement Caption US$53,658m US$54,041m US$15,615m US$13,785m US$102,786m US$103,549m Group Materiality as % of caption  1.3%   1.3%   4.5%   5.0%   0.7%   0.7%  Financial statements  |  Independent Auditors’ Report Independent Auditors’ Report Of KPMG LLP (“KPMG UK”) to the members of Rio Tinto plc and of KPMG (“KPMG Australia”)  to the members of Rio Tinto Limited Annual Report 2024 259  ===== PAGE 262 ===== 6. THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDITS GROUP SCOPE  What we mean How the Group audit team determined the procedures to be performed across the Group. This year, we applied the revised group auditing standard in our audit of the Group financial statements. The  revised standard changes how an auditor approaches the identification of components, and how the audit  procedures are planned and executed across components.  In particular, the definition of a component has changed, shifting the focus from how the entity prepares  financial information to how we, as the group auditor, plan to perform audit procedures to address group  risks of material misstatement. Similarly, the group auditor has an increased role in designing the audit  procedures as well as making decisions on where these procedures are performed (centrally and/or at  component level) and how these procedures are executed and supervised.  As a result, we assess scoping  and coverage in a different way and comparisons to prior period coverage figures are not meaningful. In this  report we provide an indication of scope coverage on the new basis. We performed risk assessment procedures to determine which of the Group’s components are likely to  include risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements and which procedures to perform at  these components to address those risks. In total, we identified 15 components, having considered our evaluation of the Group’s operational structure,  the Group’s legal structure, the existence of common information systems, the existence of common risk  profiles across entities and our ability to perform audit procedures centrally.  Of those, we identified quantitatively significant components which contained the largest percentages of  either total revenue or total assets of the Group, for which we performed audit procedures.  We also identified components that required special audit consideration, owing to Group risk relating to  revenue recognition and impairment considerations residing in these components. Additionally, having considered qualitative and quantitative factors, we selected additional components  with accounts and/or disclosures contributing to the specific risks of material misstatement of the Group  financial statements. The below summarises where we performed audit procedures: Component type Number of components  where we performed  audit procedures Range of materiality applied Quantitatively significant components 4 US$440m - US$240m Components requiring special audit consideration 3 US$200m - US$160m Other components where we performed procedures 8 US$334m - US$160m Total 15 Financial statements  |  Independent Auditors’ Report Independent Auditors’ Report Of KPMG LLP (“KPMG UK”) to the members of Rio Tinto plc and of KPMG (“KPMG Australia”)  to the members of Rio Tinto Limited Annual Report 2024 260  ===== PAGE 263 ===== GROUP SCOPE  (continued) We involved component auditors in performing the audit work on 15 components. We set the component  materialities having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components.  The parent companies are not components for the group audit. Our audit procedures covered 77% of Group revenue.  We performed audit procedures in relation to components that accounted for 80% of total profits and  losses that made up Group profit before tax and 88% of Group total assets. For the remaining components for which we performed no further audit procedures, no component  represented more than 6% of Group total revenue, Group profit before tax or Group total assets.  We performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there is not a  reasonable possibility of a material misstatement in these components. Certain Group sales and purchases transactions that originate in various countries are processed in  Singapore and Delhi respectively. These transactions are tested centrally by our audit teams in Singapore  and Delhi on behalf of our component teams. The Group team has also performed audit procedures on the  following areas on behalf of the components as they are controlled at the group level: – Testing of IT Systems and configuration – Consolidation of financial information – Climate considerations and impact on the financial statements – Identifying journal entries with a defined high-risk criteria – Group level macro-economic assumptions for closure and impairment testing; and – Pensions and post-retirement benefits The Group team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the  relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back. Impact of controls on our group audit We identified the main finance IT system used by the majority of the Group, the consolidation system and  two separate finance systems used by two of the group’s components to be the main IT systems relevant to  our audit. With the involvement of our IT auditors, we assessed the design and operating effectiveness of key general IT  and automated controls relevant to our audit for these aforementioned systems. For all of our in-scope components we tested the operating effectiveness of relevant IT general controls and  did not identify a need to change the planned audit approach that gained evidence including from testing  the operating effectiveness of controls and substantive testing. We also tested the design and operating effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls over financial  reporting in several areas of our audit, including key revenue streams. As a result of our testing, were able to  rely on controls in these areas, which enabled us to reduce the scope of our substantive audit. In the other  areas the scope of the audit work performed was fully substantive.

In working with component auditors, we: – Held planning calls with component audit teams to discuss the significant areas of the audit relevant to  the components, including the key audit matters in respect of: • Evaluation of the impairment assessment for the Kennecott Utah Copper CGU (‘KUC CGU’) • Evaluation of specific provisions for close-down, restoration and environmental obligations (‘closure  provisions’); and • Evaluation of indicators of impairment or impairment reversal of property, plant and equipment for the  Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine cash generating unit (‘Oyu Tolgoi CGU’) – Issued group audit instructions to component auditors on the scope and nature of their work, including  significant areas to be covered, relevant risks and the information to be reported back.  – Held a global in-person conference with all component audit teams – Held risk assessment alignment meetings and workshops with all component audit teams before the  commencement of each phase of the audit. – Visited 11 (2023: 6) components in-person as the audit progressed to understand and challenge the audit  approach and organised fortnightly video conferences with the partners and directors of the Group and  component audit teams. At these visits and video conferences, the findings reported to the Group team  were discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the Group team was then performed by  the component audit teams. – Inspection of component audit teams’ key work papers (in person and/or using remote technology  capabilities) to evaluate the appropriateness of conclusions drawn from the audit evidence obtained and  consistencies between communicated findings and work performed, with a particular focus on the key  audit matters. Sites visited along with our component auditors, where we also held meetings with relevant Rio Tinto personnel Scope FY24 FY23 Sites visited – Pilbara operations – Oyu Tolgoi operations – Kennecott Utah Copper operations – Commercial Hub in Singapore – Simandou operations – Group Services Hub in Brisbane, Perth  and Montreal – Pilbara operations – Oyu Tolgoi operations – Kitimat operations – Iron Ore of Canada operations – Group Services Hub in Delhi, Brisbane,  Perth and Montreal – Commercial Hub in Singapore 7.

RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES  Directors’ responsibilities for the  financial statements  As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 245, the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements  in accordance with relevant laws and regulations including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the financial position and  performance of the Group and Rio Tinto Plc in accordance with the relevant financial reporting frameworks and in compliance with relevant  laws and regulations; implementing such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements in  accordance with relevant laws and regulations, including giving a true and fair view of the financial position and performance of the Group  and Rio Tinto Plc , and that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group, Rio Tinto plc’s and  Rio Tinto Limited’s ability to continue as a going concern and whether the use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate,  disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to  liquidate the Group, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited, or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements    Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether each of the distinct financial statements as a whole are free from material  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinions in an auditor’s report.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of  assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) or ASAs will always detect a material misstatement  when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably  be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.   A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

classified according to the Group’s management  structure. Our management structure is based on product groups  together with global support functions whose leaders make up the  Executive Committee. The Executive Committee members each  report directly to our Chief Executive who is the chief operating  decision maker and is responsible for allocating resources and  assessing performance of the operating segments. Finance costs  and net debt are managed on a Group-wide basis and are therefore  excluded from the segmental results. The disclosures in this note include certain alternative performance  measures (non-IFRS measures). For more information on the non- IFRS measures used by the Group, including definitions and  calculations, refer to section entitled alternative performance  measures (pages 269 to 273). (a) Segmental revenue, Underlying EBITDA and Capital expenditure  are defined and calculated in note 1 from pages 167 to 168.  Underlying earnings is defined and calculated within the  Alternative performance measures section on page 270.  (b) Pilbara represents the Group’s 100% holding in Hamersley, 50%  holding in Hope Downs Joint Venture, 54% holding in Western  Range Joint Venture and 65% holding in Robe River Iron  Associates. The Group’s net beneficial interest in Robe River Iron  Associates is 53%, as 30% is held through a 60% owned  subsidiary and 35% is held through a 100% owned subsidiary. (c) Segmental revenue, Underlying EBITDA, Underlying earnings and  Operating assets within Evaluation projects/other include  activities relating to the shipment and blending of Pilbara and  Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC) iron ore inventories held  portside in China and sold to domestic customers. Transactions  between Pilbara and our portside trading business are  eliminated through the Iron Ore “intra-segment” line and  transactions between IOC and the portside trading business are  eliminated through “inter-segment transactions”.  (d) Bauxite represents the Group’s 100% interest in Gove and Weipa,  22% interest in Porto Trombetas and 22.9% interest in Sangarédi. (e) Alumina represents the Group’s 100% interest in Jonquière  (Vaudreuil), Yarwun, 80% interest in Queensland Alumina and  10% interest in São Luis (Alumar). (f) North American Aluminium represents the Group’s 100%  interest in Alma, Arvida, Arvida AP60, Grande-Baie, ISAL, Kitimat,  Laterrière, 40% interest in Alouette, 25.1% interest in Bécancour,  20% interest in Sohar and 50% interest in Matalco. (g) Pacific Aluminium represents the Group’s 100% interest in Bell  Bay, 73.5% interest in Boyne Island, 100% interest in Tiwai Point  and 51.6% interest in Tomago. On 30 September 2024, our  interest in Boyne Island was increased from 59.4% to 71.05%  following our acquisition of Mitsubishi Corporation’s 11.65%  interest in Boyne Smelters Limited (BSL). On 1 November 2024,  our interest was further increased to 73.5% following our  acquisition of Sumitomo Chemical Company’s (SCC) 2.46%  interest in BSL. On 1 November 2024, we also acquired SCC’s  20.64% interest in New Zealand Aluminium Smelters, increasing  our interest from 79.36% to 100%. (h) Until 16 December 2022, our interest in Oyu Tolgoi (OT) was  held indirectly through our 50.8% investment in Turquoise Hill  Resources Ltd (TRQ), where TRQ’s principal asset was its 66%  investment in Oyu Tolgoi LLC, which owned the OT copper-gold  mine. Following the purchase of TRQ we now directly hold a  66% investment in Oyu Tolgoi LLC. (i) Includes our interests in Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Quebec  Operations (100%), QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM, economic  interest of 85%) and Richards Bay Minerals (attributable interest  of 74%). (j) Relates to our 100% interest in the Diavik diamond mine and  diamond marketing operations. (k) Rio Tinto SimFer UK Limited (which is wholly owned by the  Group) holds a 53% interest in SimFer Jersey Limited (SimFer  Jersey) which in turn, has an 85% interest in SimFer S.A., the  company that will carry out the Simandou mining operations in  Guinea, and an 85% interest in the company which will deliver  SimFer Jersey’s scope of the co-developed rail and port  infrastructure. SimFer Jersey at present has a 100% interest in  the companies that will own and operate the transhipment  vessels, however this is anticipated to reduce to 85% with the  Government of Guinea taking a 15% interest before operations  commence. These entities, together with the equity accounted  WCS Rail and Port entities described in note 32, are referred to  as the Simandou iron ore project. (l) Other operations includes our 98.43% interest in Energy  Resources of Australia (increased from 86.3% in November  2024 - refer to note 30), sites being rehabilitated under the  management of Rio Tinto Closure, Rio Tinto Marine, and the  remaining legacy liabilities of Rio Tinto Coal Australia. These  include provisions for onerous contracts, in relation to rail  infrastructure capacity, partly offset by financial assets and  receivables relating to contingent royalties and disposal  proceeds.  (m) Accountability for Rio Tinto Guinea, our in-country external  affairs office remains with Bold Baatar, and has therefore moved  from the Copper product group to “Other operations” following  his change in role to Chief Commercial Officer. Accordingly,  prior period amounts have been adjusted for comparability even  though there is no material impact as a result of the change.  (n) Refer to note 4 for allocation of impairment charges net of  reversals between consolidated amounts and share of profit in  EAUs. (o) Capital expenditure is the net cash outflow on purchases less  sales of property, plant and equipment, capitalised evaluation  costs and purchases less sales of other intangible assets as  derived from the consolidated cash flow statement. The details  provided include 100% of subsidiaries’ capital expenditure and  Rio Tinto’s share of the capital expenditure of joint operations  but exclude equity accounted units. (p) Operating assets of the Group represents equity attributable to  Rio Tinto adjusted for net debt. Operating assets of subsidiaries,  joint operations and the Group’s share relating to equity  accounted units are made up of net assets adjusted for net debt  and post-retirement assets and liabilities, net of tax. Operating  assets are stated after the deduction of non-controlling  interests; these are calculated by reference to the net assets of  the relevant companies (ie inclusive of such companies’ debt  and amounts due to or from Rio Tinto Group companies).  Financial statements  |  Additional financial information Annual Report 2024 268 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 271 ===== The Group presents certain alternative performance measures (non-IFRS measures) which are reconciled to directly comparable IFRS  financial measures below. These non-IFRS measures, hereinafter referred to as alternative performance measures (APMs), are used by  management to assess the performance of the business and provide additional information, which investors may find useful. APMs are  presented in order to give further insight into the underlying business performance of the Group's operations. APMs are not consistently defined and calculated by all companies, including those in the Group’s industry. Accordingly, these measures  used by the Group may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures made by other companies. Consequently, these  APMs should not be regarded as a substitute for the IFRS measures and should be considered supplementary to those measures. The following tables present the Group's key financial measures not defined according to IFRS and a reconciliation between those APMs  and their nearest respective IFRS measures. Reconciliation of APMs to the nearest comparable IFRS financial measures for the year 2021 and 2020 can be found in the section APM of  our 2021 Annual Report. Reconciliation of underlying return on capital employed and Net (debt)/cash for the year 2022 can be found in our  2022 Annual Report. APMs derived from the income statement The following income statement measures are used by the Group to provide greater understanding of the underlying business performance  of its operations and to enhance comparability of reporting periods. They indicate the underlying commercial and operating performance of  our assets including revenue generation, productivity and cost management. Segmental revenue  Segmental revenue includes consolidated sales revenue plus the equivalent sales revenue of equity accounted units (EAUs) in proportion to our  equity interest (after adjusting for sales to/from subsidiaries). The reconciliation can be found in “Our financial performance” on page 167. Underlying EBITDA Underlying EBITDA represents profit before taxation, net finance items, depreciation and amortisation adjusted to exclude the EBITDA  impact of items that do not reflect the underlying performance of our reportable segments. The reconciliation of profit after tax to  underlying EBITDA can be found in “Our financial performance” on page 168. Underlying EBITDA margin Underlying EBITDA margin is defined as Group underlying EBITDA divided by the aggregate of consolidated sales revenue and our share of  equity account unit sales after eliminations. 2024 US$m 2023  US$m 2022  US$m Underlying EBITDA 23,314 23,892 26,272 Consolidated sales revenue 53,658 54,041 55,554 Share of equity accounted unit sales and inter-subsidiary/equity accounted unit sales eliminations 4,048 3,016 2,850 57,706 57,057 58,404 Underlying EBITDA margin  40%   42%   45%  Pilbara underlying FOB EBITDA margin The Pilbara underlying free on board (FOB) EBITDA margin is defined as Pilbara underlying EBITDA divided by Pilbara segmental revenue,  excluding freight revenue. 2024 US$m 2023  US$m 2022  US$m Pilbara Underlying EBITDA 16,543 19,828 18,474 Pilbara segmental revenue 27,849 30,867 29,313 Less: Freight revenue (2,344) (2,098) (2,206) Pilbara segmental revenue, excluding freight revenue 25,505 28,769 27,107 Pilbara underlying FOB EBITDA margin  65%   69%   68%  Underlying EBITDA margin from integrated operations and product group operations Aluminium - integrated operations Copper - product group operations Minerals - product group operations 2024 US$m 2023  US$m 2022  US$m 2024 US$m 2023  US$m 2022  US$m 2024 US$m 2023  US$m 2022  US$m Underlying EBITDA 3,857 2,436 3,842 4,046 2,436 2,947 1,423 1,780 2,665 Segmental revenue 12,896 11,513 13,136 8,207 5,811 5,975 5,485 5,918 6,742 Underlying EBITDA margin  30%   21%   29%   49%   42%   49%   26%   30%   40%  Financial statements  |  Additional financial information   Alternative performance measures Annual Report 2024 269 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 272 ===== Underlying earnings  Underlying earnings represents net earnings attributable to the owners of Rio Tinto, adjusted to exclude items that do not reflect the  underlying performance of the Group’s operations. Exclusions from underlying earnings are those gains and losses that, individually or in aggregate with similar items, are of a nature and size to  require exclusion in order to provide additional insight into underlying business performance. The following items are excluded from net earnings in arriving at underlying earnings in each period irrespective of materiality:  – net (gains)/losses on consolidation or disposal of interests in businesses – impairment charges and reversals  – (profit)/loss after tax from discontinued operations  – exchange and derivative gains and losses. This adjustment includes exchange (gains)/losses on external net debt and intragroup balances, unrealised  (gains)/losses on currency and interest rate derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting, unrealised (gains)/losses on certain commodity  derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting, and unrealised (gains)/losses on embedded derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting – adjustments to closure provisions where the adjustment is associated with an impairment charge, or for legacy sites where the  disturbance or environmental contamination relates to the pre-acquisition period.  In addition, there is a final judgemental category which includes, where applicable, other credits and charges that, individually or in  aggregate if of a similar type, are of a nature or size to require exclusion in order to provide additional insight into underlying business  performance. In 2024 this includes provision for uncertain tax positions in relation to disputes with the Mongolian Tax Authority and the  recognition of deferred tax assets at Energy Resources of Australia.

Disposals include the sale of Wyoming Uranium and Lake MacLeod, as described in note 5. (b) Exchange (gains)/losses on external net debt, intragroup balances and derivatives includes post-tax gains on intragroup balances of US$647 million (2023: US$316 million loss; 2022:  US$478 million gain) offset by post-tax losses on external net debt of US$354 million (2023: US$73 million gain; 2022: US$262 million loss), primarily as a result of the Australian dollar  weakening against the US dollar. (c) Valuation changes on currency and interest rate derivatives, which are ineligible for hedge accounting, other than those embedded in commercial contracts, and the currency  revaluation of embedded US dollar derivatives contained in contracts held by entities whose functional currency is not the US dollar. (d) Valuation changes on derivatives, embedded in commercial contracts that are ineligible for hedge accounting but for which there will be an offsetting change in future Group earnings.  Mark-to-market movements on commodity derivatives entered into with the commercial objective of achieving spot pricing for the underlying transaction at the date of settlement are  included in underlying earnings. In 2024, the charge includes unrealised losses recognised in relation to our renewable PPAs.  (e) In 2024, the charge to the income statement relates to the change in estimates of underlying closure cash flows, net of impact of a change in discount rate, expressed in real-terms,  from 2.0% to 2.5% as applied to provisions for close-down, restoration and environmental liabilities at legacy sites where the environmental damage preceded ownership by Rio Tinto. In  2023, the charge included US$0.9 billion related to the closure provision update announced by Energy Resources of Australia on 12 December 2023 together with the update included  in their half year results for the period ended 30 June 2023, published in August 2023. This update was considered material and therefore it was aggregated with other closure study  updates which were similar in nature and have been excluded from underlying earnings. The other closure study updates were at legacy sites managed by our central closure team as  well as an update at Yarwun alumina refinery which was expensed due to the impairment earlier in the year. In 2022, the charge related to re-estimates of underlying closure cash flows  for legacy sites where the environmental damage preceded ownership by Rio Tinto.  (f) The uncertain tax provision in 2024 represents amounts provided in relation to disputes with the Mongolian Tax Authority for which the timing of resolution and potential economic  outflow are uncertain. Further information is included in the “other relevant judgements – uncertain tax positions” section of note 10 Taxation. (g) Recognition of deferred tax assets at Energy Resources of Australia (ERA) relates to rehabilitation provisions which are tax deductible when paid in the future. In November 2024, our interest  in ERA increased from 86.3% to 98.43% and Rio Tinto stated its intention to proceed with compulsory acquisition of the remaining shares during 2025. Tax deductions for rehabilitation  payments made after completion of the compulsory acquisition process will be applied against taxable profits from other Australian operations, including our iron ore business. (h) In 2023, the Canadian aluminium business completed an internal sale of assets which resulted in the utilisation of previously unrecognised capital losses and an uplift in the tax  depreciable value of assets on which a deferred tax asset of US$364 million was recognised. (i) In 2022, LNG Canada elected to terminate their option to purchase additional land and facilities for expansion of their operations at Kitimat, Canada. The resulting gain was excluded  from underlying earnings consistent with prior years as it was part of a series of transactions that together were material.  (j) In 2022, we completed the sale of a gross production royalty which was retained following the disposal of the Cortez Complex in 2008. The gain recognised on sale of the royalty was  excluded from underlying earnings on the grounds of individual magnitude. (k) In 2022, we wrote down our deferred tax assets in the US following the introduction of the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax regime. Refer to note 10 for details.

Interest cover Interest cover is a financial metric used to monitor our ability to service debt. It represents the number of times finance income and finance  costs (including amounts capitalised) are covered by profit before taxation, before finance income, finance costs, share of profit after tax of  equity accounted units and items excluded from underlying earnings, plus dividends from equity accounted units. 2024 US$m 2023  US$m Profit before taxation 15,615 13,785 Add back Finance income   (514)   (536)  Finance costs   763   967  Share of profit after tax of equity accounted units   (838)   (675)  Items excluded from underlying earnings   (715)   2,498  Add: Dividends from equity accounted units   1,067   610  Calculated earnings   15,378   16,649  Finance income   514   536  Finance costs   (763)   (967)  Add: Amounts capitalised   (424)   (279)  Total net finance costs before capitalisation   (673)   (710)  Interest cover   23   23  Payout ratio The payout ratio is used by us to guide the dividend policy we implemented in 2016, under which we have sought to return 40-60% of  underlying earnings, on average through the cycle, to shareholders as dividends. It is calculated as total equity dividends per share to  owners of Rio Tinto declared in respect of the financial year divided by underlying earnings per share (as defined above). Dividends declared  usually include an interim dividend paid in the year, and a final dividend paid after the end of the year.

This is equivalent to “Purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets” in the cash flow statement less “Sales of property,  plant and equipment and intangible assets”. This measure is used to support management's objective of effective and efficient capital allocation as we need to invest in existing assets in  order to maintain and improve productive capacity, and in new assets to grow the business. 2024 US$m 2023  US$m 2022  US$m Purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets   9,621   7,086   6,750  Less: Sales of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets   (30)   (9)   –  Capital expenditure   9,591   7,077   6,750  Rio Tinto share of capital investment Rio Tinto’s share of capital investment represents our economic investment in capital projects. This measure was introduced in 2022 to  better represent the Group’s share of funding for capital projects which are jointly funded with other shareholders and which may differ from  the consolidated basis included in the Capital expenditure APM. This better reflects our approach to capital allocation.  The measure is based upon purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and adjusted to deduct equity or shareholder  loan financing provided to partially owned subsidiaries by non-controlling interests in respect of major capital projects in the period. In  circumstances where the funding to be provided by non-controlling interests is not received in the same period as the underlying capital  investment, this adjustment is applied in the period in which the underlying capital investment is made, not when the funding is received.  Where funding which would otherwise be provided directly by shareholders is replaced with project financing, an adjustment is also made to  deduct the share of project financing attributable to the non-controlling interest. This adjustment is not made in cases where Rio Tinto has  unilaterally guaranteed this project financing. Lastly, funding contributed by the Group to Equity Accounted Units for its share of investment  in their major capital projects is added to the measure. No adjustment is made to the Capital expenditure APM where capital expenditure is  funded from the operating cash flows of the subsidiary or EAU. 2024 US$m 2023  US$m 2022  US$m Purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets   9,621   7,086   6,750  Funding provided by the group to EAUs(a)   965   –   –  Less: Equity or shareholder loan financing received/due from non-controlling interests(b)   (1,063)   (125)   –  Rio Tinto share of capital investment   9,523   6,961   6,750  (a) In 2024, funding provided by the group to EAUs relates to funding of WCS rail and port entities (WCS) in relation to the Simandou project, consisting of a direct equity investment in  WCS of US$431 million and loans provided totalling US$534 million. (b) In 2024, we received US$1,505 million from Chalco Iron Ore Holdings Ltd (CIOH), of which US$1,063 million relates to CIOH's 47% share of capital expenditure incurred on the  Simandou project and associated funding provided by the Group to EAUs during the year, accounted for on an accrual basis. Free cash flow Free cash flow is defined as net cash generated from operating activities minus purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangibles  and payments of lease principal, plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. This measures the net cash returned by the business after the expenditure of sustaining and development capital.

On 30 November 2023, Rio Tinto's ownership interest in Porto Trombetas increased from 12% to 22%. Production is reported including this change from 1 December 2023. 6. Rio Tinto has a 22.95% shareholding in the Sangaredi mine, but benefits from 45% of production. 7. Borate quantities are expressed as B2O3. 8. On 16 December 2022, Rio Tinto completed the acquisition of 100% of Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd, increasing our ownership interest in Oyu Tolgoi from 33.52% to 66%. Production is  reported including this change from 1 January 2023.  9. Includes 100% of production from Paraburdoo, Mount Tom Price, Western Turner Syncline, Marandoo, Yandicoogina, Brockman, Nammuldi, Silvergrass, Channar, Gudai-Darri and the  Eastern Range mines. While we own 54% of the Eastern Range mine, under the terms of the joint venture agreement, Hamersley Iron manages the operation and is obliged to purchase  all mine production from the joint venture and, therefore, all of the production is included in Rio Tinto’s share of production. 10. Quantities comprise 100% of Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Quebec Operations and our 74% share of Richards Bay Minerals’ production. Ilmenite mined in Madagascar is processed  in Canada. Production, Ore Reserves, Mineral Resources and operations  |  Metals and minerals production  Annual Report 2024 276 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 279 ===== Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves for  Rio Tinto managed operations are reported  in accordance with the Australasian Code  for Reporting of Exploration Results,  Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, 2012  edition (the JORC Code), as required by  the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).  Rio Tinto also files an annual report on  Form 20-F (Form 20-F) with the US  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  and prepares the Form 20-F Mineral  Resources and Mineral Reserves in  accordance with subpart 1300 of  Regulation S-K (SK-1300). Mineral Reserves  under SK-1300 are the equivalent of Ore  Reserves under ASX. Some variations may  occur between the reporting in accordance  with the JORC Code and SK-1300. A Mineral Resource is a concentration or  occurrence of solid material of economic  interest in or on the Earth’s crust in such  form, grade (or quality) and quantity that  there are reasonable prospects for eventual  economic extraction. Estimates of such  material are based largely on geological  information with only preliminary  consideration of mining, economic and  other factors. While in the judgement of the  Competent Person there are realistic  expectations that all or part of the Mineral  Resources will eventually become Proved or  Probable Ore Reserves, there is no  guarantee that this will occur, as the result  depends on further technical and economic  studies and prevailing economic conditions  in the future. An Ore Reserve is the economically  mineable part of a Measured and/or  Indicated Mineral Resource. It includes  diluting materials and allowances for losses,  which may occur when the material is mined  or extracted. It is defined by studies at pre- feasibility or feasibility level as appropriate,  with the application of modifying factors.  Such studies demonstrate that, at the time  of reporting, extraction can reasonably  be justified. Rio Tinto’s Mineral Resources are reported  as additional (exclusive) to the reported  Ore Reserves, with the exception of the  Rincon lithium brines Mineral Resources  which are reported inclusive of Ore  Reserves. Reporting of Mineral Resources  inclusive of Ore Reserves is industry- standard for in situ lithium brines. For Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves  reporting, the JORC Code envisages the  use of reasonable investment assumptions  to test the economic viability of the Ore  Reserves and the reasonable prospects of  eventual economic extraction for the  Mineral Resources. To achieve this,  Rio Tinto uses internally generated,  projected long-term commodity prices. SK-1300 requires the use of a justifiable  commodity price to test the economic  viability of the Mineral Reserves and the  reasonable prospects of economic  extraction for the Mineral Resources, and  prices used in calculating the estimates  must be disclosed. As a result of the  commercial sensitivity of Rio Tinto’s  long-term commodity prices, we use  commercially available consensus pricing or  historical pricing for SEC reporting. For this  reason and others, some Mineral Resources  and Mineral Reserves reported to the SEC  in the Form 20-F may differ from those  Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves  reported herein. Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves  information in the following tables is based  on information compiled by Competent  Persons (as defined by the JORC Code),  most of whom are full-time employees of  Rio Tinto or related companies. Each has  had a minimum of 5 years’ relevant  experience and is a member of a  recognised professional body whose  members are bound by a professional  code of ethics. These bodies include the  Australasian Institute of Mining and  Metallurgy (AusIMM), Australian Institute  of Geoscientists (AIG) or recognised  professional organisations (RPO). Each  Competent Person consents to the  inclusion in this Annual Report of  information they have provided in the form  and context in which it appears. Competent  Persons responsible for the estimates are  listed on page 301, by operation, along with  their professional affiliation, employer, and  accountability for Mineral Resources and/ or Ore Reserves. Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves  from our managed operations are the  responsibility of the managing directors of  the business units and estimates are carried  out by the Competent Persons. Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves from  externally managed operations, in which  Rio Tinto holds a minority share, are  reported as received from the managing  entity and in accordance with the  JORC Code. The Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves  figures in the following tables are reported  as of 31 December 2024. Summary data for  year end 2023 are shown for comparison.  Metric units are used throughout. The  figures used to calculate Rio Tinto’s Mineral  Resources and Ore Reserves are more  precise than the rounded numbers shown in  the tables, hence small differences might  result if the calculations are repeated using  the tabulated figures. JORC Table 1 reports for new or materially  changed significant deposits are released  to the market. They are also available at  riotinto.com/resourcesandreserves.

A JORC Table 1 in support of this change will be  released to the market contemporaneously with the release of this Annual Report and can be viewed at riotinto.com/resourcesandreserves. The decrease in Ore Reserves tonnes at both Andoom and Gove, is due to mining depletion.  Mining operations ceased at East Weipa in 2024. Porto Trombetas (MRN) Ore Reserves tonnes increased due to the conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves at the West Zone Project, following the approval of the Preliminary  Environmental Licence.

Australian iron ore Ore Reserves are all located on State Agreement mining leases. Prior to mining, state government approvals (including environmental and heritage) are required.  Reported Ore Reserves include select areas where one or more approvals remain outstanding. In these areas, it is expected that these approvals will be obtained within the timeframes  required in the current production schedule. 5. Ore Reserves of Brockman Ore are 86.2% Rio Tinto-owned, with the remainder split between the non-Rio Tinto partners in the Bao-HI joint venture and the Hope Downs joint venture. 6.

Ore Reserves of Pisolite Ore are 80.2% Rio Tinto-owned, with the remainder split between the non-Rio Tinto partners in the Robe River joint venture. 8. Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC) Ore Reserves are reported as marketable product (61% pellets and 39% concentrate for sale) at a natural moisture content of 2%. The marketable  product is derived from mined material comprising 355 million dry tonnes at 39% iron, 34% silica, 0.20% alumina, 0.022% phosphorus (Proved) and 610 million dry tonnes at 39% iron,  34% silica, 0.19% alumina, 0.022% phosphorus (Probable) using process recovery factors derived from current IOC concentrating and pellet operations. No meaningful relationship has  been established between the product and feed grades of alumina and phosphorus, so these grades cannot be reported for Ore Reserves. Saleable product is produced to meet silica  grade specifications, so the Ore Reserves silica grade is the targeted silica grade for the currently anticipated long-term product mix. Loss on Ignition (LOI) is not determined for  resource drilling samples, so no estimate of % LOI is available for Ore Reserves. 9. Simandou Ore Reserves tonnes are reported on a dry weight basis.

Ore Reserves classification is determined based on confidence in all the modifying factors. Generally, Proved Ore Reserves are derived from Measured Mineral  Resources, and Probable Ore Reserves are derived from Indicated Mineral Resources. In 2024, portions of the Ore Reserves derived from Measured Mineral  Resources have been classified as Probable Ore Reserves. This classification primarily represents areas where one or more state government approvals remain  outstanding or specific Traditional Owner engagement is required prior to mining.  Simandou Ore Reserves updates reflect a classification change from Proved Ore Reserves to Probable Ore Reserves due to geotechnical parameters supporting design  being largely at pre-feasibility study level.

Ore Reserves of diamonds are shown as recoverable Ore Reserves of marketable product after accounting for all mining and processing losses. Mill recoveries are therefore not shown. 4. Diavik Ore Reserves are based on a nominal 1 millimetre lower cut-off size and a final re-crushing size of 6 millimetres. 5. Ore Reserves for Rincon lithium brine are based on the cumulative brine volume pumped for the entire wellfield over a 40 year duration and the average lithium grade is lithium brine  grade from all wells in the wellfield averaged for pumping period. 6. To obtain the equivalent tonnage for lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE), the estimated mass of lithium was multiplied by a factor that is based on the atomic weights of each element in  lithium carbonate to obtain the final compound weight. The factor used was 5.322785 to obtain LCE mass from lithium mass.

It should be noted that Rio Tinto generally reports Mineral Resources exclusive of Ore Reserves, but  such methodology is not considered applicable for lithium brines. Reporting of Mineral Resources inclusive of Ore Reserves is industry-standard for in situ lithium brines and is  compliant with JORC code reporting criteria. 6. Rincon Mineral Resources lithium metal and LCE tonnages are in situ values assuming 100% recovery as per standard brine reporting practices.  To obtain the equivalent tonnage for  LCE, the estimated mass of lithium was multiplied by a factor that is based on the atomic weights of each element in lithium carbonate to obtain the final compound weight. The factor  used was 5.322785 to obtain LCE mass from lithium mass.

Production, Ore Reserves, Mineral Resources and operations  |  Mineral Resources  Annual Report 2024 299 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 302 ===== Mineral Resources and Ore  Reserves governance and  internal controls Rio Tinto has well-established governance  processes and internal controls to support  the generation and publication of Mineral  Resources and Ore Reserves, including a  series of business unit and product group  structures and processes independent of  operational reporting. Audit & Risk Committee The Audit & Risk Committee’s remit includes  the governance of Mineral Resources and  Ore Reserves. This includes an annual  review of Mineral Resources and Ore  Reserves at a Group level, as well as a  review of findings and progress from the  Group Internal Audit program. Ore Reserves Steering Committee The Ore Reserves Steering Committee  (ORSC), chaired by the Chief Technical  Officer, Development & Technology, meets  at least quarterly. The ORSC comprises  senior representatives across our technical,  financial, governance and business groups,  and oversees the appointment of  Competent Persons nominated by the  business units; reviews Exploration Results,  Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves releases  prior to public reporting; and oversees the  development of the Group Mineral  Resources and Ore Reserves standards  and guidance. Orebody Knowledge Centre  of Excellence The Orebody Knowledge Centre of  Excellence contains a dedicated Orebody  Knowledge Technical Assurance team.  Orebody Knowledge Technical Assurance,  in conjunction with the ORSC, is the  guardian and author of Group Mineral  Resources and Ore Reserves standards and  guidance, and is responsible for the  governance and compilation of Group  Mineral Resources, Ore Reserves and  reconciliation reporting. The Technical  Assurance team also advises on disclosure  obligations, monitors the external reporting  environment and facilitates internal audits. Internal Auditing Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves  internal audits are conducted by  independent external consulting personnel  in a program managed by Orebody  Knowledge Technical Assurance. Material  findings are reported outside of the  product group reporting line to the ORSC,  and all reports and action plans are  reviewed by the ORSC for alignment to  internal and external reporting standards.  During 2024, 3 internal Mineral Resources  and Ore Reserves audits were completed.  Geoscientific information  management and assurance We employ industry-standard drilling,  sampling, assaying and quality assurance/ quality control (QA/QC) practices  supported by formally documented  procedures. Diamond core and reverse circulation are  our primary drilling methods. We use other  methods such as sonic and air core if  appropriate for the style of deposit. Drill  hole locations are typically confirmed by  high-precision differential Global  Positioning System (GPS) and down-hole  trace positioning is primarily achieved by  gyroscopic survey. Drill sample recovery is typically recorded,  and all geological data is collected by  qualified geoscientific professionals.  Geological logging consistency is secured  via formal logging procedures and training,  reference materials, application of  geological code libraries and digital logging  directly to the geological database.  On-site or commercial laboratories provide  appropriate analytical (assaying)  techniques, according to the commodity  and style of deposit. Reliability of assay data  is maintained via QA/QC procedures, which  monitor assay accuracy and precision  through the analysis of blanks, sample  duplicates and matrix-matched certified  reference materials. Our geoscientific information management  standard is the industry-leading acQuire  system and we employ strict QA/QC  criteria to ensure only high-quality assay  data is uploaded to a project’s database. Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves  risk management Risks to our Mineral Resources and  Ore Reserves estimates are managed  through comprehensive risk assessments  undertaken in support of the annual  reporting cycle. Risks are identified and  managed by verifying controls, determining  and undertaking suitable actions to remove  or reduce the risk, conducting reviews, and  maintaining compliance with standards and  procedures. Risks are managed through a  commercial risk management solution. At the end of each reporting cycle, we  analyse the Mineral Resources and Ore  Reserves risks across all business units to  ensure both consistency of reporting and  determine any Group-wide risks to the  various processes.

History Mount Tom Price began operations in 1966, followed by  Paraburdoo in 1974. During the 1990s, Channar (1990),  Brockman 2 (1992), Marandoo (1994) and Yandicoogina  (1998) achieved first ore. Nammuldi achieved first ore in 2006  followed by Brockman 4 (2010), Western Turner Syncline  (2011) and Silvergrass (2017). The latest addition to the  network of Hamersley Iron mines, Gudai-Darri, had first ore  railed in December 2021, and commissioned its primary  crusher in the second quarter of 2022. Property description/type of mine All mines operated by Rio Tinto within the property are open  pit mines. The mining method employed uses conventional  surface mining, whereby shovels and loaders are used to load  drilled and blasted material into trucks for removal to waste  dumps and stockpiles or feed to process plants. In addition to  mining activities, Rio Tinto conducts both exploration and  development drilling across the property. Type of mineralisation Brockman 2, Brockman 4, Channar, Gudai-Darri, Tom Price,  Paraburdoo and Western Turner Syncline: mineralisation  occurs as haematite/goethite within the banded iron  formation of the Brockman Formation. Detrital deposits also  occur at these sites. At Brockman 2, Brockman 4, Tom Price  and Western Turner Syncline, some goethite/haematite within  the banded iron formation of the Marra Mamba Formation  also occurs. Marandoo, Nammuldi and Silvergrass: mineralisation occurs as  goethite/haematite within the banded iron formation of the Marra  Mamba Formation. Some detrital mineralisation also occurs.  Yandicoogina: goethite mineralisation occurs as pisolite ores  within the paleo-channel of a channel iron formation. Processing plants and other available facilities At Brockman 2, Brockman 4, the Nammuldi dry plant and  Gudai-Darri, dry crushing and screening is used to produce  lump and fines iron ore products. Ore from the Silvergrass and  Nammuldi mines is blended and processed through a wet  scrubbing and screening plant, ahead of desliming of the fines  product using hydrocyclones. At Marandoo, wet scrubbing and  screening is used to produce lump and fines iron ore products,  prior to desliming of fines products using hydrocyclones. Ore  from the Channar and Paraburdoo mines is crushed and then  processed through a central tertiary crushing and dry screening  plant to produce a dry lump product, with further wet  processing of the fines using hydrocyclones to remove slimes.  Ore from the Tom Price and Western Turner Syncline mines is  directed to either the high-grade plant for dry crushing and  screening to dry lump and fines products, or to the low-grade  plant for beneficiation. Heavy media separation is used to  beneficiate low-grade lump, and a combination of heavy media  hydrocyclones and spirals is used to beneficiate the low-grade  fines. At Yandicoogina, ore is crushed to fines product only  through a combination of dry crushing and screening, or  crushing and wet processing of ore using classification to  remove finer particles. The processing plants within the Hamersley Iron network vary  considerably in age, and many plants have been subject to  brownfields development since original construction.

Title/lease/acreage The last extension of the Jadar exploration licence expired on  14 February 2020, with no legal basis for further extension of  its term. During the feasibility study the project has completed the  Elaborate on Resources and Reserves (declaration based on  Serbian law), obtained the Certificate on Resources and  Reserves on 6 January 2021 and has submitted the request  for exploitation field licence (with Serbian Feasibility Study  being one of the supporting documents to this request).  In January 2022, the Government of Serbia cancelled the  Spatial Plan for the Jadar project (SPSPA) and required all  related permits to be revoked.  On 16 July 2024, the Government of Serbia enacted the Decree  on reinstatement of the SPSPA based on the Decision of the  Constitutional Court of Serbia, dated 12 July 2024, which  determined that the Decree on cancellation of the SPSPA was  not compliant with the Constitution and laws of the Republic of  Serbia. As a result of this, Rio Tinto initiated the scoping and  content procedure for Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)  for the mine. The Ministry for Environmental Protection issued  the EIA Scoping Decision for the Mine which was published on  21 November 2024. This is one of the key documents required  to apply for the exploitation field license. Key permit conditions The project is governed by 2 main pieces of Serbian  legislation: Mining Law is administered by the Ministry of  Mining and Energy (MME), and Planning and Construction  Law is administered by the Ministry of Construction,  Transportation and Infrastructure (MCTI). The permitting process base case foresees the following:  – Mine, beneficiation plant and mine surface facilities are  subject to the permitting procedure of MME – Processing plant, industrial waste landfill and infrastructure  (rail, roads, power and water pipelines) are subject to the  unified permitting procedure under MCTI. History The Jadar deposit was discovered in 2004 by Rio Tinto  Exploration geologists during a regional exploration program  for borates in the Balkans. The deposit is in its majority  composed of a mineral new to science named Jadarite with  high concentrations of lithium and boron. Resource definition  and processing workflow development and testing were  conducted for over a decade. The pre-feasibility study (PFS)  completed in July 2020 has shown that the Jadar project has  the potential to produce both battery grade lithium carbonate  and boric acid.

Property description/type of mine Open pit. Type of mineralisation Supergene-enriched itabirite hosted iron ore deposits. The  deposits are part of a supracrustal belt with the banded iron  formation proto-ore likely deposited in a shallow marine  setting within a forearc basin. The age of deposition is  considered to be between 2.7Ga and 2.2Ga. Processing plants and other available facilities Current plans are for the run-of-mine ore to be coarsely  crushed at the Ouéléba mine site at a maximum rate of  60Mtpa phase 1 capacity to P100 of -100mm through 2  identical primary and secondary crushing stations in a staged  arrangement. The coarsely crushed ore will then be conveyed  to the mine stockyard. The ore will be reclaimed from the  stockpiles and conveyed to the train load-out facility for  loading into trains which transport materials to the port  facility where it will be likely shipped by bulk carrier to several  ports including in China. Other major facilities that will  support the operations include power generation, explosives  facilities, fuel and lubricants facilities, administration buildings,  workshops and a permanent village. Power source Current designs contemplate that power for the mine site and  other areas will be supplied by a hybrid power plant  consisting of diesel generators and a regenerative battery  power solution. Further, there is a plan to connect the facility  to the power grid local operator Électricité de Guinée. This will  require an approximately 20km connection line to the main  grid once it is available and would substantially reduce energy  costs and fuel consumption.

Additional information  |  Independent assurance report Independent assurance report Of KPMG (KPMG Australia) to the Directors of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited (Rio Tinto) Annual Report 2024 322  ===== PAGE 325 ===== Basis for conclusion We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), Assurance  Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and ISAE 3410, Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas  Statements issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB), and Australian Standard on Assurance  Engagements (ASAE) 3000, Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and ASAE 3410,  Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements issued by the Australian Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (AUASB). Our  responsibilities under this standard are further described in the “Our responsibilities” section of our report.    We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including  Independence Standards) issued by the Accounting Professional Ethical Standards Board (APESB). Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM1), Quality Management for Firms that Perform Audit or Reviews of  Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Service Engagements, issued by the IAASB and Auditing Standard ASQM1 Quality  Management for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Reports and Other Financial Information, or Other Assurance or Related  Services Engagements, issued by the AUASB. This standard requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality  management, including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal  and regulatory requirements. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion. Restriction on use or distribution This report has been prepared for the Directors of Rio Tinto, to assist the Directors in responding to their governance responsibilities by  obtaining an independent assurance report in connection with the subject matter information, for the purpose of providing assurance  conclusions on the Information Subject to Assurance and may not be suitable for another purpose.  We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this report, to any person other than the Directors of Rio Tinto or for any  other purpose other than that for which it was prepared. Our conclusion is not modified in respect of this matter. Responsibilities for the information subject to assurance Management of Rio Tinto are responsible for:  – designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation of the Information Subject to Assurance such that it  is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;  – selecting or developing suitable criteria for preparing the Information Subject to Assurance and appropriately referring to or describing  the criteria used;  – determining appropriate reporting topics and selected or establishing suitable criteria for measuring, evaluation and preparing the  Information Subject to Assurance; – making judgements and estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances; and – preparing the Information Subject to Assurance in accordance with Reporting Criteria. Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the reporting process for the entity’s Information Subject to Assurance. Inherent limitations Inherent limitations exist in all assurance engagements due to the selective testing of the information being examined. It is therefore possible  that fraud, or error may occur and not be detected. Non-financial data may be subject to more inherent limitations than financial data, given  both its nature and the methods used for determining, calculating, and estimating such data. The precision of different measurement  techniques may also vary. The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial  information allows for different, but acceptable, evaluation and measurement techniques that can affect comparability between entities and  over time. Greenhouse gas quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty due to the nature of the information and the uncertainties inherent in: (i)  the methods used for determining or estimating the appropriate amounts, (ii) information used to determine emission factors and (iii) the  values needed to combine emissions of different gases. Our responsibilities We are responsible for: – planning and performing the engagement to obtain reasonable and limited assurance about whether the Information Subject to  Assurance is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; – forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained; and – reporting our conclusion to the Directors of Rio Tinto.

We designed and performed our  procedures to obtain evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable assurance opinion and limited  assurance conclusion.  Reasonable assurance opinion The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depended on our judgement, including an assessment of the risks of material  misstatement of the Information Subject to Reasonable Assurance, whether due to fraud or error. We identified and assessed the risks of  material misstatement through understanding the Information Subject to Reasonable Assurance and the engagement circumstances. We  also obtained an understanding of the internal control relevant to the Information Subject to Reasonable Assurance in order to design  procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal  controls. In carrying out our engagement, the procedures we performed primarily consisted of: – Analytical procedures over the Total Scope 1 and 2 GHG Emissions; – Substantively tested the Total Scope 1 and 2 GHG Emissions, on a sample basis at corporate and operational level, which included testing  a selection of 18 operations being Bell Bay Aluminium, Boyne Smelters, Gladstone Power Station, Queensland Alumina Ltd, Yarwun,  Tomago, RTA Alma, RTA Isal, Pilbara Rail Operations, Tom Price, Brockman 2 Nammuldi, Escondida, Richards Bay Minerals, Alouette,  Power Operations, Sept-Iles, Sohar and Oyu Tolgoi; – Interviews and walkthroughs with corporate and operational level personnel to assess the key systems, processes and internal controls to  capture, collate, calculate and report the Total Scope 1 and 2 GHG Emissions at an operational level, and how this information is reported  and captured at corporate level; – Testing the mathematical accuracy of a sample of calculations underlying the Total Scope 1 and 2 GHG Emissions; and – Assessing the appropriateness of a sample of emission factors applied in calculating the Total Scope 1 and 2 GHG Emissions. Limited assurance conclusion Our procedures selected depended on our understanding of the Information Subject to Limited Assurance and other engagement  circumstances, and our consideration of areas where material misstatements are likely to arise. In carrying out our engagement, the  procedures we performed primarily consisted of: – Enquiries with relevant Rio Tinto personnel to understand and evaluate the design and implementation of the key systems, processes and  internal controls to capture, collate, calculate and report the Information Subject to Assurance; – Assessment of the suitability and application of the Reporting Criteria in respect of the Information Subject to Assurance; – Analytical procedures over the Information Subject to Assurance; – Testing the Scope 3 GHG Emissions to source documentation on a sample basis; – Substantively testing the Information Subject to Assurance on a sample basis at corporate and operational level, which included testing a  selection of six managed operations and projects being NZAS, Resolution Copper, Paraburdoo, QIT Madagascar Minerals, Oyu Tolgoi  (Projects and Operations) and Kitimat with a focus on Safety Maturity Model testing during those site visits; – Testing the mathematical accuracy of a sample of calculations underlying the Information Subject to Assurance; – Corroborative enquiries with relevant management to understand progress against the Climate Action Plan commitments;  – Testing the disclosed information on CAP Progress to source documentation on a sample basis; – Reconciling the Information Subject to Assurance to underlying information; – Assessing Rio Tinto’s incorporation of the requirements of the ICMM 10 principles for sustainable development, and the mandatory  requirements set out in the ICMM Position Statements, into its own policies, strategies and standards; and – Reviewing the Scope 1, 2 and 3 Emissions Calculation and Climate Methodology for the year ended 31 December 2024 and the  Information Subject to Assurance in its entirety to ensure it is consistent with our overall knowledge of Rio Tinto and our observation of  its operations. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable  assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the  assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.

LSX is the principal trading market for Rio  Tinto plc shares, and ASX for Rio Tinto  Limited shares. Rio Tinto plc has a sponsored American  Depositary Receipts (ADR) facility, with  underlying shares registered with the US  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  and listed on the New York Stock Exchange  as RIO.N. Further details on Rio Tinto plc ADRs are  available in Rio Tinto's annual reports on  Form 20-F. Rio Tinto is headquartered in London with a  corporate office in Melbourne. Nomenclature and financial data Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited operate  together and are referred to in this report as  Rio Tinto, the Rio Tinto Group or the Group.  These expressions are used for convenience  notwithstanding that they are separate and  distinct legal entities. Likewise, the words  ''we'', ''us'', ''our'' and ''ourselves'' are used in  some places to refer to one, some or the  companies of the Rio Tinto Group in general.  Financial data in US dollars ($) is derived  from, and should be read in conjunction with,  the 2024 financial statements. In general,  where we have provided financial data in  other currencies, it has been translated from  the consolidated financial statements, and is  provided solely for convenience. Exceptions  arise where data has been extracted directly  from source records. History Rio Tinto plc was incorporated on  30 March 1962, as The Rio Tinto-Zinc  Corporation Limited (RTZ). Rio Tinto Limited  was incorporated (under a different name)  on 17 December 1959 and following a merger  with other Australian interests in 1962,  formed a group that was later renamed  CRA Limited (CRA).  In 1997, RTZ became Rio Tinto plc and CRA  became Rio Tinto Limited. Dual-listed companies structure The businesses of RTZ and CRA were  merged contractually in 1995 by way of a  dual-listed companies structure ('DLC  structure'). Both companies agreed to be  managed in a unified way, implementing  arrangements to provide shareholders of  both companies with a common economic  interest in the DLC structure, under a  common board of directors. The ratio of dividend, voting and capital  distribution rights attached to each share in  Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited was fixed  by a “DLC Sharing Agreement” at an  Equalisation Ratio of 1:1. This has remained  unchanged, although can be revised in  special circumstances or with the approval  of shareholders of each company under the  class rights action approval procedure  (described below) and subject to any  adjustments to be confirmed by the  Group's external auditors. Rio Tinto  shareholders cannot directly enforce the  provisions of the DLC Sharing Agreement.  To ensure that the Boards of both  companies are identical, resolutions to  appoint or remove Directors must be put to  shareholders of both companies as Joint  Decisions (described below), and Directors  can only be a Director of one company if  they are a Director of both companies.  Dividend arrangements Dividends paid on Rio Tinto plc and  Rio Tinto Limited shares are equalised  on a net cash basis without taking into  account any associated tax credits.  Dividends are determined in US dollars  (except for ADR holders) and both  companies must announce and pay  distributions (including dividends)  as close to the same time as possible. If the payment of an equalised dividend  would contravene the law applicable to one  of the companies, they can depart from the  Equalisation Ratio but the relevant  company must put aside reserves for  payment on the relevant shares at a  later date. Voting arrangements The shareholders of Rio Tinto plc and Rio  Tinto Limited vote as one combined body  on any matters that affect them similarly,  subject to limited exceptions. These are  called Joint Decisions, and include creating  new classes of share capital, changing  directors and auditors, and receiving annual  financial statements. In class rights actions, where both  companies are not affected equally such  as changes to a company’s articles of  association or constitution, the resolution  must be passed by the shareholders of  each company on a standalone basis. In other circumstances, only one company  requires a vote, and these matters are  single electorate matters. All shareholder resolutions that include a  Joint Decision or class rights action are  decided by a poll, although in exceptional  circumstances, certain shareholders can be  excluded from voting at their respective  company's general meeting (such as where  they have breached the limitations on  ownership of shares discussed below). Where a matter has been expressly  categorised as a Joint Decision or a class  rights action, the Directors cannot change  that categorisation. If a matter is  categorised as both, it is treated as a class  rights action. Otherwise, the Directors  decide how issues should be put to  shareholders for approval. Both companies have entered into  shareholder joint voting agreements, where  a Special Voting Share is issued to a special  purpose company and held in trust for  shareholders by a trustee. When a resolution is put as a Joint Decision,  each Rio Tinto plc share carries one vote at  Rio Tinto plc shareholders meeting. The  holder of the Special Voting Share has one  vote for each vote cast by the public  shareholders of Rio Tinto Limited in their  parallel meeting. Holders of Rio Tinto  Limited ordinary shares do not hold voting  shares in Rio Tinto plc by virtue of their  holding in Rio Tinto Limited, and cannot  enforce the voting arrangements relating to  the Special Voting Share.  Instead, the  trustee holding the Special Voting Share  must vote in accordance with the votes cast  by public shareholders on the equivalent  resolution at the parallel Rio Tinto Limited  shareholders' meeting.  The same arrangements apply for the  trustee holding the Special Voting Share  issued by Rio Tinto Limited to cast a vote  at the Rio Tinto Limited shareholders  meeting for each vote cast by the public  shareholders of Rio Tinto plc in their  parallel meeting.  Capital distribution arrangements If either company goes into liquidation,  the surplus assets of both companies are  valued. If the surplus assets available for  distribution by one company exceed the  surplus assets available for distribution by  the other company (on each of the shares  held by its shareholders), then, to the extent  permitted by law, an equalising payment  must be made so that the amount available  for distribution on each share held by  shareholders of both companies reflects  the Equalisation Ratio. Additional information   Annual Report 2024 325 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 328 ===== Limitations on ownership of shares and  merger obligations Control of interests in publicly listed  companies in excess of defined thresholds,  is regulated in both Australia and the UK.  Under UK law, which applies to Rio Tinto plc,  the threshold is 30% and under Australian  law which applies to Rio Tinto Limited, the  threshold is 20%. These thresholds also  apply on a joint basis as Rio Tinto plc's  Articles of Association and Rio Tinto  Limited's Constitution extend these laws to  apply to the combined entity. These  provisions also ensure that a person cannot  exercise control over one company without  having made offers to the public  shareholders of both companies. If one of  these thresholds is exceeded, the person's  voting and distribution rights are  suspended, and their shares may be  divested – until they offer for all publicly  held shares of the other company, reduce  their controlling interest below the  thresholds specified, or acquire (by a  permitted means) at least 50% of each  company's publicly held shares. This ensures equal treatment for all  shareholders, with the Directors unable to  offer exemptions. Guarantees Subject to limited exceptions, each company  guarantees the other company's contractual  obligations, creditors and the obligations of  other persons guaranteed by the other  company. All creditors can make demands on  their guarantor without first having recourse  to the company or persons whose  obligations are being guaranteed. The guarantor's obligations expire on  termination of the Sharing Agreement (but  only for obligations arising after termination)  and under other limited circumstances (after  due notice is given).

As far as is  permitted by the UK Companies Act 2006,  the Australian Corporations Act 2001 and  ASX Listing Rules, this principle is reflected  in the Articles of Association of Rio Tinto plc  and in the Constitution of Rio Tinto Limited. The following summaries describe the  material rights of shareholders of both  Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited. Objects At the 2009 AGMs, shareholders of  Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited  approved amendments to their Articles of  Association and Constitution whereby the  object clauses were removed to allow the  companies to have the widest possible  scope of activities. Directors’ interests Under Rio Tinto plc’s Articles of Association,  a Director may not vote in respect of any  proposal in which he or she, or any other  person connected with him or her, has any  interest, other than by virtue of his or her  interests in shares or debentures or other  securities of, in or through the company,  except in certain circumstances, including in  respect of resolutions: – Indemnifying him or her or a third party  in respect of obligations incurred by the  Director on behalf of, or for the benefit  of, the company, or in respect of  obligations of the company, for which  the Director has assumed responsibility  under an indemnity, security or  guarantee. – Relating to an offer of securities in which  he or she may be interested as a holder  of securities or as an underwriter. – Concerning another body corporate in  which the Director is beneficially  interested in less than 1% of the issued  shares of any class of shares of such a  body corporate. – Relating to an employee benefit in which  the Director will share equally with  other employees. – Relating to liability insurance that the  company is empowered to purchase for  the benefit of Directors of the company  in respect of actions undertaken as  Directors (or officers) of the company. – Concerning the giving of indemnities in  favour of Directors or the funding of  expenditure by Directors to defend  criminal, civil or regulatory proceedings  or actions against a Director. Under Rio Tinto Limited’s Constitution,  a Director may be present at a meeting of  the Board while a matter in which the  Director has a material personal interest is  being considered and may vote in respect  of that matter, except where a Director is  constrained by Australian law. The Directors are empowered to exercise all  the powers of the companies to borrow  money; to charge any property or business  of the companies or all, or any, of their  uncalled capital; and to issue debentures or  give any other security for a debt, liability or  obligation of the companies or of any other  person. The Directors shall restrict the  borrowings of Rio Tinto plc to the limitation  that the aggregate amount of all monies  borrowed by the company and its  subsidiaries shall not exceed an amount  equal to 1.5 times the companies’ share  capital plus aggregate reserves unless  sanctioned by an ordinary resolution of  the company. Directors are not required to hold any  shares of either company by way of  qualification. The Remuneration Report on  pages 119-145 provides information on  shareholding policies relating to Executive  and Non-Executive Directors. Please refer  to the Directors’ Report for information on  the appointment of Directors. Rights attaching to shares Under UK law, dividends on shares may only  be paid out of profits available for  distribution, as determined in accordance  with generally accepted accounting  principles and by the relevant law.  Shareholders are entitled to receive such  dividends as may be declared by the  Directors. Directors may also pay interim  dividends to shareholders as justified by the  financial position of the Group. Under the Australian Corporations Act  2001, dividends on shares may only be paid  if the company’s assets exceed its liabilities  immediately before the dividend is declared,  the excess is sufficient for the payment of  the dividend, the payment is fair and  reasonable to the company’s shareholders  as a whole, and the payment does not  materially prejudice the company’s ability to  pay its creditors. Any Rio Tinto plc dividend  unclaimed after 12 years from the date the  dividend was declared, or became due for  payment, will be forfeited and returned to  the company. Any Rio Tinto Limited  dividend unclaimed may be invested or  otherwise used by the Board for the benefit  of the company until claimed or otherwise  disposed of according to Australian law.  Rio Tinto Limited is governed by the State  of Victoria’s unclaimed monies legislation,  which requires the company to pay to the  state revenue office any unclaimed dividend  payments of A$20 or more that on 1 March  each year have remained unclaimed for  over 12 months. Voting Voting at any general meeting of  shareholders on a resolution on which the  holder of the Special Voting Share is  entitled to vote shall be decided by a poll,  and any other resolution shall be decided  by a show of hands unless a poll has been  duly demanded. On a show of hands, every  shareholder who is present in person or by  proxy (or other duly authorised  representative) and is entitled to vote, has  one vote regardless of the number of  shares held. The holder of the Special  Voting Share is not entitled to vote in a  show of hands. On a poll, every shareholder  who is present in person or by proxy (or  other duly authorised representative) and is  entitled to vote, has one vote for every  ordinary share for which he or she is the  holder. In the case of Joint Decisions, the  holder of the Special Voting Share has one  vote for each vote cast in respect of the  publicly held shares of the other company. A poll may be demanded by any of  the following: – The Chair of the meeting. – At least 5 shareholders entitled to vote  on the resolution. – Any shareholder(s) representing in the  aggregate not less than one tenth  (Rio Tinto plc) or one 20th (Rio Tinto  Limited) of the total voting rights of all  shareholders entitled to vote on the  resolution. – Any shareholder(s) holding Rio Tinto plc  shares conferring a right to vote at the  meeting on which there have been paid- up sums in the aggregate equal to not  less than one tenth of the total sum paid  up on all the shares conferring that right.  – The holder of the Special Voting Share  of either company. A proxy form gives the proxy the authority  to demand a poll, or to join others in  demanding one. The necessary quorum for a Rio Tinto plc  general meeting is 3 members present  (in person or by proxy or other duly  authorised representative) and entitled to  vote. For a Rio Tinto Limited general  meeting it is 2 members present (in person  or by proxy or other duly authorised  representative). Matters are transacted at general  meetings by the proposing and passing of  resolutions as: – Ordinary resolutions (for example the  election of Directors), which require the  affirmative vote of a majority of persons  voting at a meeting for which there is  a quorum. – Special resolutions (for example  amending the Articles of Association of  Rio Tinto plc or the Constitution of  Rio Tinto Limited), which require the  affirmative vote of not less than three- quarters of the persons voting at a  meeting at which there is a quorum. Additional information  |  Shareholder information  Annual Report 2024 328 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 331 ===== The Sharing Agreement further classifies  resolutions as Joint Decisions and class  rights actions as explained on pages  325-326. AGMs must be convened with 21 days’  written notice for Rio Tinto plc and with 28  days’ notice for Rio Tinto Limited. In  accordance with the authority granted by  shareholders at the Rio Tinto plc AGM in  2024, other meetings of Rio Tinto plc may  be convened with 14 days’ written notice for  the passing of a special resolution, and with  14 days’ notice for any other resolution,  depending on the nature of the business to  be transacted. All meetings of Rio Tinto  Limited require 28 days’ notice. In  calculating the period of notice, any time  taken to deliver the notice and the day of  the meeting itself are not included.  The notice must specify the nature of the  business to be transacted. Variation of rights If, at any time, the share capital is divided  into different classes of shares, the rights  attached to each class may be varied,  subject to the provisions of the relevant  legislation, the written consent of holders of  three-quarters in value of the shares of that  class, or upon the adoption of a special  resolution passed at a separate meeting of  the holders of the shares of that class. At  every such meeting, all of the provisions of  the Articles of Association and Constitution  relating to proceedings at a general  meeting apply, except that the quorum for  Rio Tinto plc should be 2 or more persons  who hold or represent by proxy not less  than one-third in nominal value of the  issued shares of the class. Rights upon a winding-up Except as the shareholders have agreed or  may otherwise agree, upon a winding-up,  the balance of assets available for  distribution after the payment of all  creditors (including certain preferential  creditors, whether statutorily preferred  creditors or normal creditors), and subject  to any special rights attaching to any class  of shares, is to be distributed among the  holders of ordinary shares according to the  amounts paid-up on the shares held by  them. This distribution should generally be  made in cash. A liquidator may, however,  upon the adoption of a special resolution of  the shareholders, divide among the  shareholders the whole or any part of the  assets in specie or kind. The Sharing Agreement describes the  distribution of assets of each of the  companies in the event of a liquidation, as  explained on page 325. Facility agreements Details of the Group’s credit facilities are set  out in the Our capital and liquidity section  to the financial statements on page 197. Exchange controls and foreign  investment Rio Tinto plc There are no UK foreign exchange controls  or other restrictions on the import or export  of capital by, or on the payment of  dividends to, non-resident holders of  Rio Tinto plc shares, or that materially affect  the conduct of Rio Tinto plc’s operations. It  should be noted, however, that various  sanctions, laws, regulations or conventions  may restrict the import or export of capital  by, or the payment of dividends to, non- resident holders of Rio Tinto plc shares.  There are no restrictions under Rio Tinto  plc’s Articles of Association or under UK law  that specifically limit the right of non- resident owners to hold or vote in Rio Tinto  plc shares. However, certain of the  provisions of the Australian Foreign  Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (the  Takeovers Act) described below also apply  to the acquisition by non-Australian  persons of interests in securities of  Rio Tinto plc. Rio Tinto Limited Under current Australian legislation,  Australia does not impose general  exchange or foreign currency controls.  Subject to some specific requirements and  restrictions, Australian and foreign currency  may be freely brought into and sent out of  Australia. There are requirements to report  cash transfers in or out of Australia of  A$10,000 or more. There is a prohibition on  (or in some cases the specific prior  approval of the Department of Foreign  Affairs and Trade or Minister for Foreign  Affairs must be obtained for) certain  payments or other dealings connected with  countries or parties identified with terrorism,  or to whom United Nations or autonomous  Australian sanctions apply. Sanction, anti- money laundering and counter terrorism  laws may restrict or prohibit payments,  transactions and dealings or require  reporting of certain transactions. Rio Tinto Limited may be required to deduct  withholding tax from foreign remittances of  dividends, to the extent that they are  unfranked, and from payments of interest. Acquisitions of interests in shares, and  certain other equity instruments in  Australian companies by non-Australian  (“foreign”) persons are subject to review  and approval by the Treasurer of the  Commonwealth of Australia under the  Takeovers Act.  In broad terms, the Takeovers Act applies to  acquisitions of interests in securities in an  Australian entity by a foreign person where,  as a result, a single foreign person (and any  associate) would control 20% or more of  the voting power or potential voting power  in the entity. The potential voting power in  an entity is determined having regard to the  voting shares in the entity that would be  issued if all rights (whether or not presently  exercisable) in the entity were exercised.  The Takeovers Act also applies to direct  investments by foreign government  investors, in certain circumstances  regardless of the size of the investment.  Persons who are proposing relevant  acquisitions or transactions may be  required to provide notice to the Treasurer  before proceeding with the acquisition or  transaction, and may be required to register  their interest on the Register of Foreign  Ownership of Australian Assets. The Treasurer has the power to order  divestment in cases where relevant  acquisitions or transactions have already  occurred, including where prior notice to  the Treasurer was not required. The  Takeovers Act does not affect the rights of  owners whose interests are held in  compliance with the legislation. Limitations on voting and shareholding  Except for the provisions of the Takeovers  Act, there are no limitations imposed by law,  Rio Tinto plc’s Articles of Association or  Rio Tinto Limited’s Constitution, on the  rights of non-residents or foreigners to hold  the Group’s ordinary shares or ADRs, or to  vote that would not apply generally to  all shareholders. Directors Appointment and removal of Directors The appointment and replacement of  Directors is governed by Rio Tinto plc’s  Articles of Association and Rio Tinto  Limited’s Constitution, relevant UK and  Australian legislation, and the UK Corporate  Governance Code. The Board may appoint  a Director either to fill a casual vacancy or  as an addition to the Board, so long as the  total number of Directors does not exceed  the limit prescribed in these constitutional  documents. An appointed Director must  retire and seek election to office at the next  AGM of each company. In addition to any  powers of removal conferred by the UK  Companies Act 2006 and the Australian  Corporations Act 2001, the company may  by ordinary resolution remove any Director  before the expiry of his or her period of  office and may, subject to these  constitutional documents, by ordinary  resolution appoint another person who is  willing to act as a Director in their place. In  line with the UK Corporate Governance  Code, all Directors are required to stand for  re-election at each AGM.  Additional information  |  Shareholder information  Annual Report 2024 329 riotinto.com  ===== PAGE 332 ===== Directors’ powers The Board manages the business of Rio Tinto under the powers set out in these constitutional documents. These powers include the  Directors’ ability to issue or buy back shares. Shareholders’ authority to empower the Directors to purchase its own ordinary shares is  sought at the AGM each year.

Our drive for innovation and continuous  improvement is at the core of our purpose. Today, you will find our teams around the   world seeking opportunities to reduce our  carbon footprint, partnering to develop new  technologies to decarbonise steel and  aluminium production, and creating new  products from waste. Our ambition is to be a  business with a commodity mix that is aligned  with evolving customer demand in a  decarbonising world.  But we cannot do it on our own. So we strive   to create partnerships that solve problems   and create win-win solutions with lower  societal and environmental impact. The  approach applies as much to large-scale,  transformational innovation as to incremental  everyday progress, such as our safety and  operational performance.  And we are finding better ways to   partner with Indigenous peoples and host  communities. From continuing to rebuild   our relationships to putting in place our   new co-management agreements and  improved ways of working, we are focusing   on open and transparent engagement.  Our aspiration is to be the partner of choice   for communities, governments, customers,  suppliers and joint venture partners.  We want to be a home to curious people   who care about their work and colleagues,   are courageous about the challenges they   face and find better ways to do things.

Our portfolio includes iron ore, copper, aluminium, lithium  and other materials needed for people, communities and nations to grow and prosper, and for the  world to cut carbon emissions to net zero.  We have been mining for 150 years, and we continue to build on a history and knowledge that span  generations and continents.

Our focus is on growing our business  while decarbonising, providing products to our customers that support the transition to a low-carbon  economy and delivering attractive returns to our shareholders. Many of our products are essential for the energy transition: we expect this new source of demand,  combined with traditional sources, to drive significant volume growth in our products over the  coming decades. In developed markets, customer demand for low-carbon and recycled materials is  growing with supply security top of mind. In developing economies, reliable access to raw materials  for domestic processing is critical. We have the people, orebodies, technology, processing  capabilities, access to capital and relationships to meet these diversifying needs.

Our strength and scale reflect the courage shown by past generations, and the  curiosity of our current employees, who continue to shape important partnerships  with companies, communities, and countries – constantly evolving our business  and our products to support the world around us.  We have marked a wide range of milestones through our 150 years of operation;  these are a few of the moments that shaped the Rio Tinto of today.  1873 Rio Tinto commences   copper mining in Spain The Rio Tinto Company was registered in  London after a British-European investor  group bought the Rio Tinto mines in Spain,  first mined in Phoenician and Roman times.  We introduced new processing facilities and  techniques that transformed the operation,  and by the turn of the century, we were  producing 10% of the world’s copper.  1929-1953 Exploring new lands  We looked beyond Spain’s borders for growth  opportunities, setting up a series of joint ventures   to explore and develop mines, starting in 1929   with the great copper belt of what is now known   as Zambia. Come 1952, our exploration team  expanded into South Africa and Canada, and the  following year Australia, resulting in new uranium  mines in Canada and Australia.  1955-1963  The red cliffs of Australia In 1955, a geologist discovered bauxite   in Queensland and commercial bauxite  mining began at Weipa in 1963, where we  still mine today.  2007 Becoming a global leader  in aluminium  We acquired Alcan, becoming a global  leader in aluminium, and further diversifying  our portfolio. Through this deal, we also  obtained access to water rights and  renewable power through a vast network  of hydropower facilities in Canada, a  major competitive advantage to our  smelting business. While Alcan was  clearly a leader in green aluminium, the  acquisition resulted in an unsustainable  level of debt when the global financial  crisis happened and left the company   in a vulnerable financial situation. 2000-2022  Shaping our portfolio  At the turn of the new century, we embarked on an acquisition and  divestment programme, which simplified the business, focused the Group   on large, low-cost mines and culminated in our divestment of our coal   assets in 2018. We became the first major miner to cease coal production.  We acquired North Ltd in 2000, significantly expanding our iron ore assets,  including mines, rail and port capacity. And in 2006, we partnered with  Ivanhoe Mines to construct and operate Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia. In 2022,   we acquired full ownership of Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd, increasing our  direct ownership in Oyu Tolgoi to 66%. 2008-2019  Technology redefines the business In an attempt to transform the efficiency and safety of the way we mine,   we partnered with Komatsu to be among the first in the world to trial the world’s  first driverless haul trucks. This initiative set us on a path to become a global  leader in fully integrated, automated mining. In 2019, together with our partner  Hitachi, we launched the world’s first fully autonomous, long-distance,   heavy-haul rail network – AutoHaulTM.   ===== PAGE 7 ===== 5 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Strategic report 1961-1973 The founding of our iron ore  business in the Pilbara In 1961, geologists set out across Western  Australia to assess the iron ore prospects.  By 1965, the signing of a long-term contract to  supply the Japanese steel mills enabled us to  develop our first iron ore mine in the Pilbara,  and in 1966 we shipped our first iron ore to  Japan. By 1973, we had started shipping to  South Korea and China. Our partnerships with  these countries endure today.  1989  Securing copper and  mineral assets We were ready to focus solely on mining,   so sold all oil and gas assets and set our sights  on BP Minerals. We acquired Kennecott’s  Bingham Canyon copper and gold mine in Utah,  US. The purchase also secured the RTIT Quebec  Operations1 in Quebec, Canada and interests in  QIT Madagascar Minerals and Richards Bay  Minerals in South Africa.  1995  Becoming Rio Tinto  In one of the most significant events in our  history, the RTZ Corporation PLC merged with  ConZinc RioTinto of Australia (CRA) to form  RTZ-CRA. In 1997, we changed our name to  Rio Tinto plc/Ltd (dual listed), becoming one   of the largest mining companies in the world.  1998 Tragedy sharpens   safety focus  A horrific disaster at our talc mine in   Lassing, Austria, claimed the lives of ten  members of our rescue team following a  series of collapses. The profound impact   of the Lassing disaster was a catalyst for  major change in the way we manage safety.  We had our first fatality-free year in 2019,   with no fatalities since.  2002  China supporting   the iron ore boom The rapid industrialisation of the  Chinese economy and the emergence  of China as a global economic power  was a major catalyst for our iron ore  business in the early 2000s. In 2002,   we set up a joint venture with Baosteel  Group to supply 10 million tonnes of iron  ore per year over 20 years, supporting  the expansion of our business in the  Pilbara and marking our continuing and  vital partnership with China. 2018-2019  A step closer to carbon-free  aluminium smelting In 2018, we formed ELYSIS, in partnership  with Alcoa and supported by Apple and the  Governments of Canada and Quebec,  which later delivered a disruptive  technology that eliminates all direct  greenhouse gas emissions from the  aluminium smelting process.  2020  Juukan Gorge rock shelters Our destruction of the Juukan Gorge rock  shelters in Western Australia fell far short of  our values and breached the trust placed   in us by the Traditional Owners of the lands  on which we operate. It is our collective  responsibility to earn back the trust that has  been lost, improve our internal practices   and culture to minimise our impacts, and  manage cultural heritage responsibly. 2021-2022  Creating a safe, respectful   and inclusive workplace  In 2021, we commissioned an independent  review of our workplace culture to better  understand, prevent and respond to harmful  behaviours across our operations. The review  found disturbing cases of discrimination and  sexual harassment in the business. We are now  working to implement the 26 recommendations  of the report, and to evolve our culture to create  a safe, respectful and inclusive workplace.  1. Previously known as QIT Fer et Titane.  ===== PAGE 8 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 6 Chair’s statement 2022 saw Rio Tinto deliver another   set of strong financial results, while  keeping our operations fatality-free.  In recognition of this, the Board is  recommending a final dividend of  225 US cents (2021: 417 US cents),  taking total dividends declared to  shareholders this year to $8 billion.  More broadly, Jakob Stausholm and his  Executive team have led the Group out of a  challenging period, with the foundations now  being laid for us to become the global mining  company of choice. A lot remains to be done. We must continue to  focus on the pursuit of our four key objectives:  becoming the best operator, having impeccable  environmental, social and governance (ESG)  credentials, excelling in development and  strengthening the Group’s social licence.  In particular, we must continue to strive for  greater consistency in our operating  performance. This year, we have secured a  healthy pipeline of future growth projects –  Oyu Tolgoi (with the successful buyout of  Turquoise Hill minority shareholders), Rhodes  Ridge and Rincon, and the Western Range  replacement project. These now need to be  successfully developed, while we continue our  efforts to realise other critical growth projects,  such as Simandou, Resolution and Jadar. Finally, we must focus on embedding the  important culture and leadership changes that  are such critical enablers for achieving our  strategic objectives and to creating the future  organisation that we all wish to see.  Building a thriving culture I believe everything we aspire to achieve should  be underpinned by our people feeling emotionally  safe, empowered, included and respected.  One of my priorities as Chair is to ensure that   we create a work environment where everyone  can be at their best. I commend Jakob and the Executive Committee  for the care and courage shown in commissioning  and openly sharing the external review of the  company’s workplace culture at the beginning of  2022. Since then, a great deal has been done to  make positive change. The Board and I fully support  the implementation of the 26 recommendations  made in the Everyday Respect Report, which we  are monitoring closely. We are working closely  with Elizabeth Broderick, the former Australian  Sex Discrimination Commissioner who conducted  the report, on how we, as a Board, can help ensure  progress and lead by example in embedding the  culture changes that we all wish to see. We have  also reinforced the Board and the Executive  Committee’s commitment in this area, by  expanding our new Remuneration & People  Committee’s scope to include an ongoing focus  on people and culture. Incentivising the things that matter One of the key learnings from the past few years  is that how we achieve our strategy is just as  important as what we achieve. As our strategy  has evolved, so has the need for an appropriate  incentive framework to better support it. In 2022,  we undertook a review of our incentives and, from  2023, our Group short-term incentive plan (STIP),  which applies to around 24,000 employees,  will have a greater focus on how outcomes are  achieved. By driving delivery of our four objectives  in a manner consistent with our values and  behaviours and which advance our culture change  agenda, we are confident that we will see great  progress towards our strategic ambitions.  For more information about changes to STIP, see the Remuneration  report on pages 112-113. Seizing opportunities Since joining as Chair, I have visited sites  around the world and all of our hub offices,  interacting with employees across all levels of  the organisation. I have been amazed by the  calibre of talent – from our engineers to our  economists, from our ecologists to our  explorers. There has been one common trait  among everyone I have met – a focus on  finding better ways of working and a  determination to innovate.  The shift to electric vehicles and renewable  power will require more copper, aluminium,  lithium and high-quality iron ore to decarbonise  society, but developing new mines is becoming  more challenging. To excel in this future  development, we must seek to partner with a  strengthened social licence and to operate  with impeccable ESG credentials. Strategically,  we must think long term if we are to harness   the right opportunities, while also keeping  shorter-term opportunities and risks sharply  in view.  Alongside supplying the materials for the world’s  energy transition, we are aiming to reduce our  own emissions by 50% by 2030 and to reach  net zero by 2050. This a challenging set of  targets but ones that we are determined to  achieve. We are delivering this through a range  of initiatives and partnerships that are helping  us decarbonise our existing operations and  secure green energy, as we support the  development of low-carbon solutions to help  our customers meet their own goals.  With access to more than four million hectares  of land globally, we are looking to implement  natural climate solutions on a significant scale.  We also have the opportunity to be a leader in  environment by finding better ways to manage  water, care for species and rehabilitate land.  These are areas where our drive to improve  can bring significant social and local benefits. As we enter 2023, the global operating  environment has certainly become more volatile  and complex and yet there is a sense that  Rio Tinto has reached an inflection point,  with strong momentum in the business.   ===== PAGE 9 ===== 7 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Strategic report Engaging with stakeholders and  the workforce  The Board is passionate about further  strengthening our relationships with our  shareholders, customers, local communities  and other partners to incorporate a broad  range of views in our decision making. As travel  restrictions began to ease in 2022, we stepped  up meeting people in person, including regular  dialogue with the Indigenous peoples of the  land on which we operate, local communities,  governments and, of course, our customers,  suppliers and shareholders.  We also hosted three civil society roundtables,  in Australia, Europe and North America. Engaging  with civil society organisations is an important  way for us to challenge ourselves to keep  improving. One of the key topics of interest   at this year’s roundtables was the role that  Rio Tinto can play in protecting biodiversity,   as well as in the world’s transition to a  low-carbon future.  I am encouraged by the progress our  Communities and Social Performance teams  have made this year, with new co-management  agreements in place and improved ways of  working to deliver better outcomes for  Indigenous peoples. A highlight of 2022 was the  creation of the Juukan Gorge Legacy Foundation  as part of a remedy agreement reached with the  Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura Aboriginal  Corporation relating to the destruction of the  rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in 2020. Earlier in  the year, I was grateful to meet with the Puutu  Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people for the first  time and at a second meeting later in the year  I heard how they feel our engagement and  remediation have been progressing. As the  leadership team continues to embed the values  and new purpose across the business, I am  convinced we will see even greater progress.  The Board also met with employees, through  site visits, town halls and listening sessions.  Feedback suggests that, although we need to  continue to improve, people are optimistic  about the changes taking place, with good  support for the new purpose and the Everyday  Respect initiative. We are successful in  attracting talented people, including more  women, into Rio Tinto, but must now focus  on retention.  For more information about the Board’s engagement with our  stakeholders, see pages 95-98. Board changes  We have had some changes to the Board over  the past year. Simon Thompson stepped down  as Chairman in May 2022, and Hinda Gharbi  retired from the Board at the conclusion of our  annual general meeting in April. Our thanks go  to Simon and Hinda for their outstanding  service and contribution.  In 2022, we evaluated the mix of skills and  experience on the Board, and concluded   that we need to refresh our composition,   with a particular focus on deepening our  mining, operations and projects experience,   as well as our renewable energy and  sustainability capabilities. In December 2022,  we announced the appointment of Kaisa  Hietala as a Non-Executive Director with   effect from 1 March 2023. Kaisa brings a deep  understanding of renewables and sustainability  from her experience in the resources industry,  as well as broad commercial capabilities, and  these are all qualities that will be invaluable as  we work to ensure Rio Tinto thrives in a  decarbonising world. Separately, we have taken a fresh look at our  governance arrangements to ensure that the  Board and our committees are focusing our  time on supporting the delivery of the Group’s  strategic objectives. This includes putting a  greater emphasis on people and culture, on  risk management and resilience capabilities,  and on strengthening our social licence  through stakeholder engagement. For more information see my introduction to the Corporate  Governance report on page 89. “...as I look to the future, I am  confident that we have all of  the right ingredients in place  – great people, world-class  assets, emerging technologies  and new partnerships.” Looking ahead As we enter 2023, we will need to maintain a  keen eye on near-term opportunities and risks,  while always creating sufficient time and space  to capture key strategic opportunities as they  emerge for the longer term. Without doubt, there is considerable work  ahead – to create a safe and empowering  culture, to improve the consistency of our  operational performance, to anticipate and  respond to a shifting competitive landscape  and to continue to strengthen our partnerships.  But as I look to the future, I am confident that  we have all of the right ingredients in place –  great people, world-class assets, emerging  technologies and new partnerships. As we reach our 150th anniversary this year,  we have an opportunity to place the energy  transition at the heart of our new strategy as   we seek to diversify and extend our portfolio.  This opportunity is now embodied in our new  purpose: Finding better ways to provide the  materials the world needs. And it is this new  purpose that will drive the right decisions for  our business, our shareholders, our other  stakeholders and the environment. Let me end by thanking the leadership   team and the many thousands of Rio Tinto  employees, contractors and partners who  delivered for the company and its shareholders  during the year.  Dominic Barton Chair 22 February 2023  ===== PAGE 10 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 8 How can evolving our culture unlock  improvements needed to make us the  best operator?  Changing our culture is key to achieving each  of our four objectives. When people feel  respected and valued, they feel empowered to  be their best selves and bring their best ideas.  For example, our Safe Production System (SPS)  relies on this – unlocking the potential of our  employees, their skills and expertise, and  creating stable, predictable operations. I’ve  been impressed by our progress in 2022,  achieving a number of operational records,  including a record second half performance  across the Pilbara iron ore mine and rail system.  We now have 30 deployments at 16 sites and  86 Kaizens (rapid problem-solving activities)  completed or in progress. We are seeing  excellent results. Where we have been  deploying the SPS, we have sites that are safer,  more engaged employees, and assets that are  more productive. We will continue to deploy  the SPS to more sites in 2023. More broadly, we are embedding a change in  mindset and behaviours throughout the  organisation, with the implementation of the  Everyday Respect Report recommendations  being absolutely crucial to driving this change.  Achieving culture change will take time, but we  are heading in the right direction.  How are we progressing our objective to  achieve impeccable ESG credentials?  Starting with our social licence, for the past  two years we have been changing the way we  partner, especially with Indigenous peoples  and the communities where we work. Moving  to a model of co-management of land and  waters, and improving our agreements, will  deliver more enduring socioeconomic, heritage  and environmental outcomes and, in turn,  greater certainty for mine development.  And we have continued to develop cultural  competency across the Group to help us  become a better partner.  How did we perform in 2022? This year has been all about progressing our  strategy and delivering against our four  objectives to build a stronger Rio Tinto for the  long term. The strong foundations of our business  – world-class assets, great people and strength  of balance sheet – allowed us to achieve solid  financial performance despite the challenging  environment we faced. We definitely made  progress in 2022, but there is lots more to do. Most importantly, 2022 was our fourth  consecutive fatality-free year. But we continue  to see serious incidents in our business and  therefore we must continue to focus, every day,  on strengthening our safety culture. This is  about bringing together best practices from  across the business and beyond to inform and  improve our risk management and work  planning. In terms of financials, we generated  underlying earnings of $13.3 billion (2021:  $21.4 billion) and net cash generated from  operating activities of $16.1 billion (2021:  $25.3 billion). Profit after tax attributable to  owners of Rio Tinto was $12.4 billion (2021:  $21.1 billion) and our balance sheet remains  strong with net debt of $4.2 billion (2021: net  cash of $1.6 billion). As a result, the Board has  recommended a final ordinary dividend of  225 US cents per share, resulting in total  shareholder returns declared this year of  $8 billion. This represents a pay-out ratio of  60%, in line with our policy.  What was the thinking behind the new  purpose, “finding better ways to provide  the materials the world needs”?  Defining our purpose was an exciting process.  We looked at what society needs and then  considered our own strengths and found ten  words that really capture our contribution to  the world. It’s partly in our DNA, and partly  about setting the direction for the company to  evolve. It speaks to our drive for both  innovation and continuous improvement, while  also emphasising how materials are produced.  Consumers are looking for lower-carbon  materials, which must be produced responsibly,  and we are continuously seeking ways to do  things better. 2022 highlights Zero  fatalities (2021: zero) $16.1bn net cash generated from  operating activities  (2021: $25.3bn) $12.4bn profit after tax attributable to  owners of Rio Tinto  (2021: $21.1bn) $8bn total dividend declared (2021: $16.8bn) Q&A with Jakob Stausholm  Chief Executive’s Q&A  ===== PAGE 11 ===== 9 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Strategic report In terms of climate change, quite frankly we  have not advanced our abatement projects as  fast as we would like. But despite that our  Scope 1 and 2 emissions were 7% below our  2018 baseline. Our capital spend on  decarbonisation was also lower than we  anticipated in 2021. It is important to note that  this is a multi-decade journey and today we  have a more robust roadmap to our 2030 and  2050 targets. We are ramping up our technical skills, building  competencies and capabilities, and forming  partnerships across our value chain to find  solutions to some of the bigger challenges we  are facing. We have set up six large abatement  programmes focused on the decarbonisation  challenges that cut across our product groups:  repowering our Pacific Aluminium Operations,  renewables, ELYSISTM, alumina process heat,  minerals processing and diesel transition.  We have also established one additional  programme to increase our investments in  nature-based solutions projects and expect  these to make a more significant contribution  to our targets. Some of the technology we  need to reach net zero by 2050 does not exist  today, so we established the Office of the Chief  Scientist and increased our yearly research  and development target spend to $400 million.  We know we can’t solve these challenges  alone, so we’re also partnering with other  organisations to find solutions. The ELYSIS  partnership to develop emissions-free  aluminium smelting technology is a good  example of this. Our objective to excel in development is  all about growing in materials enabling  the low-carbon transition. How did we  perform in 2022? We expect the energy transition will add as  much as 25% in additional demand above  traditional sources across our key products by  2035. That is why our strategy is about growing  in the materials required to achieve the energy  transition, such as copper, lithium and  high-quality iron ore.  A highlight this year was resetting our  relationship with the Mongolian Government  and successfully executing our first significant  M&A in a decade through our acquisition of  Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. This doubled our  interest in Oyu Tolgoi to 66%, a mine that is on  track to be the fourth-largest copper mine in  the world.  We progressed our Western Range and  Rhodes Ridge iron ore projects in Western  Australia, positioning us strongly to meet future  customer needs. They are both exciting  developments – Western Range represents  our first co-designed mine with Traditional  Owners, and the Rhodes Ridge deposits are  among the largest and highest quality  undeveloped resources globally.  At the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea, we  are working through all necessary permits and  approvals in relation to the infrastructure. We  have also hired critical roles with a significant  focus on local Guinean businesses.  In lithium, we acquired the Rincon project in  Argentina for $825 million. We have also  approved $194 million to develop a small  starter battery-grade lithium carbonate plant  with a capacity of 3,000 tonnes per year and  first saleable production in 2024. As part of this,  we are progressing early works, including  constructing a camp and airstrip. We also  continue to believe that the Jadar lithium- borate project in Serbia can contribute to  enhancing the electric vehicle supply chain  ecosystem in Serbia. We are exploring options  with all stakeholders on how to progress this  world-class opportunity to the highest  environmental standards. Our fourth objective, strengthening our  social licence, is ultimately judged by  others. What have been some of your  highlights this year? We’ve been working hard to implement  meaningful change in the way we partner with  communities. Over the past 12 months we have  signed new agreements with the Yindjibarndi  and Yinhawangka people in Australia, and the  Pekuakamiulnuatsh First Nation in Canada.  Most notably, in November we signed an  agreement with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and  Pinikura people to create the Juukan Gorge  Legacy Foundation as part of the remedy for  the destruction of the rock shelters in May 2020.  This is a significant step forward, but we know it  will be a long journey to rebuild trust.  What is the focus of 2023? I am really excited about the momentum   we’re building. We have a clear purpose, an  ambitious strategy, and I am convinced we  have the best people in the industry. The early  evidence of progress against each of the four  objectives is heartening, not just in terms of our  2022 performance, but also in giving us  confidence that we have a truly exciting  improvement journey in the years to come. For me, 2023 is all about making further  progress against our strategy and delivering on  our key projects. We will continue to empower  and unleash the quality of our people through  the SPS and develop both leadership and  technical excellence. We will advance projects  like Rincon and Simandou, and at Oyu Tolgoi  we expect to reach sustainable production in  the first quarter of the year. As we mark 150  years of Rio Tinto, we will reflect on our past  and the role it has played in our evolution and   in helping us live our purpose in the future.  Our people are at the very centre of this –   over the next year we will continue our work to  transform our culture and how we partner with  our stakeholders. I want to thank our thousands  of employees and contractors, host  governments and communities, customers,  shareholders and partners. Together, we’re  committed to finding better ways to deliver well  into the next 150 years.  Jakob Stausholm Chief Executive 22 February 2023 “The early evidence of  progress against each of the  four objectives is heartening,  not just in terms of our 2022  performance, but also in giving  us confidence that we have a  truly exciting improvement  journey in the years to come.”  ===== PAGE 12 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 10 Living our purpose Delivered through our strategy and four objectives We have put climate change and the low-carbon transition at the heart of our strategy.

These set the context for our industry and underpin  our portfolio choices and how we operate. Our success relies  on our ability to strengthen our resilience to the physical,  societal and economic effects of climate change and the  energy transition, while building partnerships and capabilities  that enable us to secure new opportunities. Energy transition and climate action While global efforts to tackle climate change  have continued, the long-term pledges   made by governments and companies still   fall short of what is required to limit the global  temperature rise to below 1.5°C above  pre-industrial levels. In recognition of this,  and faced with increasing societal demands,  governments are creating new policies to  support the development of low-carbon  economies. These include the US’s Inflation  Reduction Act (IRA) and the EU’s Carbon  Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).  Increasing electrification and renewable  energy incentives will bolster demand for  several commodities, including lithium,   copper, aluminium and high-grade iron ore.  Interventions by governments are becoming   as important as traditional market forces for  commodity trajectories and will have important  implications for project economics and  regional price premiums. New policies could  help incentivise new mining projects and  accelerate the deployment of large-scale  renewable energy and firming solutions  essential for steel and aluminium production. Geopolitical tensions and global  supply disruption The compound effects of COVID-19 and  ongoing geopolitical issues have resulted in  major disruption to the global supply of goods  and services. The onset of the Russia-Ukraine  war resulted in extreme price volatility for fossil  fuels and several metals, contributing to record  inflation in some jurisdictions. The ongoing  global energy crisis and growing concerns  about an economic downturn have continued  to erode trust in global institutions, fuelling a  backlash against globalisation in some  quarters. In addition, we have seen increasing  regional tensions surrounding new climate  policies as governments look to tackle climate  change while addressing energy supply issues.  Supply chain disruptions have helped support  prices for several key products including  iron ore, aluminium, copper and nickel,  where Russia is a major global supplier.  However, the mining sector has faced  headwinds, including increased energy   costs and ongoing mobility and procurement  challenges, which have put pressure on  margins across most commodities. Geopolitical  tensions have also exacerbated concerns   for critical mineral supply, with governments  showing increasing support for new projects   to help diversify and nearshore supply.  Evolving customer demands Customers are becoming more ESG-conscious  in their purchasing behaviours, taking into  consideration a range of sustainability themes  beyond carbon footprint, including biodiversity,  water consumption, waste generation and  social impact. This is helping to drive a holistic  shift towards increasingly transparent,  sustainable and circular value chains. Mining companies will need to work closely  with a range of stakeholders to improve their  ESG metrics and attract new customers and  partners. A key opportunity is in recycling,  which could allow metal suppliers to supplement  their low-carbon primary products with highly  sustainable recycled materials to create   unique commercial offerings for customers.  Nature-based solutions could also provide new  revenue streams, while creating opportunities  for communities and helping drive emissions  towards net zero.  Our scenario approach We use global scenarios in our strategy  and capital allocation processes to stress  test our portfolio and investment decisions  under alternative macroeconomic settings.  Our scenario framework focuses on two  prevailing macro-level business concerns:  the speed of global economic growth and  the trajectory of climate action, each  heavily influenced by global geopolitics  and governance.  Consistent with the Task Force on Climate- related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)  recommendations, our central reference  case commodity forecasts and valuations  are informed by a blend of our two core  scenarios (Competitive Leadership and  Fragmented Leadership). These are used to  derive critical accounting estimates and are  included as inputs for impairment testing;  estimating remaining economic life for units  of production, depreciation and discounting;  and closure and rehabilitation provisions.  Further detail is provided in “Impact of  climate change on the Group” section to the  financial statements on pages 152-155. We use additional scenarios (including our  Aspirational Leadership scenario, which is  aligned with the stretch goal of the Paris  Agreement) to further stress test decisions  and assess potential risks to our portfolio.  Our two core scenarios Competitive Leadership reflects a world  of high growth and strong climate action  post-2030, with change driven by policy  and competitive innovation. A proactive  reform environment encourages business  innovation and helps boost investment and  productivity. This allows global GDP to  continue growing at near recent historical  levels with an increasing contribution from  India and other developing countries. Fragmented Leadership represents a  world where economic growth and climate  action are constrained by ineffective  policy and rising social and geopolitical  tensions. In this world, investment in new  technologies slows and their global  adoption is highly inconsistent. This,  combined with more significant climate  damage, results in weaker long-term  productivity growth. For more information about our scenarios, methodology and  portfolio implications, see our 2022 Climate  Change Report at riotinto.com/climatereport.  ===== PAGE 15 ===== 13 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Strategic report Climate change and the low-carbon transition are at the   heart of our strategy. We aim to strengthen our resilience to  changing market fundamentals and pursue new opportunities  and partnerships that help deliver strong returns and growth  options for our business, reduce our environmental footprint  and aid our customers in their efforts to decarbonise. Our strategy  and four  objectives Best operator We aim to improve our operational performance  by identifying and replicating best practices  across our portfolio and empowering our  people to make positive changes.  Excel in development We will expand and progress our pipeline   of growth opportunities and build capabilities  and partnerships to execute projects and  establish a strong track record of capital- efficient delivery. Impeccable ESG credentials We will strive to align our business priorities  with society’s expectations and ensure  sustainability considerations are at the   core of every decision we make. Social licence We need to be humbler and more responsive,  building meaningful relationships and  partnerships with our stakeholders by listening,  learning and respecting diverse perspectives. Our culture is a key enabler of our  strategic ambitions. It will guide   us on the journey to best operator,  make us a better partner and help us  solve problems as we work towards  net zero.  By building a safe, respectful and  inclusive workplace, we can attract  and retain curious people who care  about their work and colleagues and  are courageous about finding better  ways to do things – this is how we  will deliver on our purpose. Our strategy has three pillars Accelerate the decarbonisation of  our assets Due to the scale of our mining operations   and processing activities we have significant  Scope 1 and 2 emissions (30.3Mt CO2e).  We are working with a range of stakeholders   to find commercial and technology solutions   to repower our assets, deploy large-scale  renewables, scale up ELYSISTM, decarbonise  process heat and replace diesel across  our portfolio.  Develop products and technologies  that help our customers decarbonise Our Scope 3 emissions were 584Mt CO2e   in 2022 – over 1% of the global total. We are  working closely with our customers and others  to develop more secure and sustainable value  chains and accelerate the development of  cleaner production pathways for our products.  Processing of iron ore accounts for two-thirds  of our Scope 3 emissions. Grow in materials essential for the  energy transition The energy transition will create significant  additional demand for our commodities,  including copper, lithium and aluminium.  We aim to grow in these commodities as well  as in the production of high-quality iron ore.  This iron ore will support the production of  low-carbon steel required for infrastructure for  the energy transition and ongoing urbanisation.  We will deliver our strategy through four objectives, which guide how we want to run our business: to be the best operator,  to achieve impeccable ESG credentials, to excel in development and to strengthen our social licence. These essential  components will help improve our productivity, reduce capital intensity and assist us in becoming a partner of choice for a  range of stakeholders globally.

Long-term contracts  and operational expenditure will also be  an important additional part of our  decarbonisation spend.  To work with our customers to tackle full  value chain emissions and reduce our  significant indirect Scope 3 emissions:   – We will increase research and development  to accelerate the development of cleaner  products for our customers.   – We will step up our customer engagements  and partnerships to help them meet their  Scope 1 and 2 emissions goals.   – We plan to deploy net zero vessels by  2030 and reach net zero emissions from  shipping our products by 2050. To capture new growth opportunities with a  focus on materials that will see strong demand  growth from the low-carbon transition:   – Our ambition is to increase our growth  capital to $2 billion in 2023 and up to  $3 billion annually in 2024 and 2025.   – We will seek to grow further in copper and  battery materials and bring additional  tonnes of high-grade iron ore and  low-carbon aluminium to market.   – We will maintain our strong commitment  to disciplined capital allocation. Highlights High-grade iron ore/green steel   – Pilbara: Planned investment of  $600 million in 230MW of solar power  facilities and 200MWh of storage.

Progress against our four objectives in 2022  ===== PAGE 18 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 16 Our people and culture Our values guide how we work together and how we treat each  other, the communities we operate in, and our environment. We  act with care, courage and curiosity, empowering our people to  build meaningful relationships and find better ways to provide the  materials the world needs. To help embed our values throughout  the business, we updated our Code of Conduct in early 2023. Care We act with care by prioritising the physical  and emotional safety and wellbeing of those  around us. We respect others, build trusting relationships  and consider the impact of our actions. We look for ways to contribute to a better  future for our people, communities and  the planet. Courage We act with courage by showing integrity,  speaking up when something is not right and  taking decisive action when needed. We are not afraid to try new things. We respond positively in difficult situations   and demonstrate commitment to achieving  shared goals. Curiosity We act with curiosity by inviting diverse ideas  and collaborating to achieve more together  than can be done alone. We are continuously learning and creatively  looking for better and safer ways of doing things. We draw inspiration from others and the world  around us. We are finding better ways   to support and empower our  people, which means creating  an environment where  everyone feels comfortable  being themselves, has the  courage to speak up if  something is not right and  listens to each other with    care and curiosity. Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine, Mongolia. Guided by our values, we are committed to  building a safe, respectful and inclusive workplace.  There are elements of our culture today that we  are proud of and want to amplify, such as our  commitment to safety, teamwork and agility in  times of change. But we know there is more to do  in some areas, and we recognise that how we  achieve is just as important as what we achieve. In February 2022, we reported the findings   and recommendations from the Everyday  Respect Report, an independent review of   our workplace culture that we commissioned   to better understand, prevent and respond   to harmful behaviours across our global  operations. We know from the findings that   we can do better as a company. We aspire   to be a home for curious people who care  about their work and colleagues and are  courageous about finding better ways to do  things. This starts with ensuring everyone feels  safe, respected and included. Implementing  the 26 recommendations from the report is   one way we are evolving our culture, this was   a primary focus for 2022 and it will continue  in 2023. We have accelerated some immediate actions:   – Building capable leaders. We have trained  91% of our leaders in the foundations of  building psychological safety and moving  from bystander to upstander, exceeding our  target of 80% by the end of 2022.   – Creating safe and inclusive facilities. All sites  have completed a self-assessment of their  facilities, and unsafe areas such as locks,  lighting and access to amenities have been  updated. This work is ongoing and done in  collaboration with our employees to make  our facilities safe and more inclusive.   – Providing a more people-centric response.  We expanded the scope of work for the  Business Conduct Office (BCO) and  developed a discrete unit that will be  responsible for delivering safe, confidential  and caring support. For more information  about the BCO and our confidential reporting  programme myVoice, see page 74. We want to play our part in eliminating harmful  behaviours, and we are also working closely  with industry bodies across the globe to  implement changes and collectively evolve  our industry. To further support our culture journey, in 2022  we also:   – Updated our global minimum standard   for paid parental leave to suit different  family needs.   – Continued to increase the number of women  in our workforce, from 21.6% to 22.9%.    – Developed, empowered and invested in our  people through the Safe Production System  and the Voyager development programme  for senior leaders.   – Reviewed our incentives and performance  management framework. From 2023, our  performance management and incentives  for around 24,000 people will be aligned to  our strategy and culture journey, focusing on  both how and what we deliver.

Underpinned by disciplined capital allocation  Our business is underpinned by a disciplined approach to capital allocation; we strive to use every  dollar prudently. Today, our balance sheet is a key strength, providing a resilient platform for strong  and consistent shareholder returns, as well as enabling us to invest throughout the commodity cycle. 1 Explore and  evaluate  2 Develop and  innovate  3 Mine and  process  4 Market and  deliver  5 Repurpose  and renew  We use some of the most advanced  exploration technologies in the world to find  potential sources of minerals and metals.  We consider new commodities and products  with an understanding of customers’ and  communities’ needs. We are also mindful  of our potential future social and environmental  impact as well as the diversity and balance  of our portfolio.  With the low-carbon transition at the heart  of our strategy, we will continue to focus our  exploration efforts on commodities essential  for the energy transition. We also evaluate  emerging opportunities in the circular economy  and green energy production.  We aim to grow our business while finding  better ways to provide the materials the world  needs. As we develop new mining and  processing options, we are also investing in  research and development projects to help  improve our productivity, reduce capital  intensity, unlock new revenue opportunities  and improve our environmental and social  performance. Reaching our net zero ambition  will rely on new technologies, and we work with  a range of value chain participants to  accelerate the development of greener  production pathways.  We develop opportunities with a focus on safety,  potential returns and long-term value, and  sustainability. We partner with a growing network  of stakeholders – governments, communities,  customers and suppliers – to expand our  understanding, capabilities and, ultimately, our  ability to develop and operate new projects.  We share best practices across our assets to  support safe, productive and environmentally  responsible operational performances.  Our operations benefit local economies by  contributing training and skills development,  jobs, taxes and royalties, contracts with local  businesses, and social and community  investment. We also support the economic  diversification of regions where we are based,  in alignment with national and regional  development plans, playing our role in ensuring  our host communities can thrive long after   our operations close. Our ambition is for our  operations to reach net zero carbon emissions  by 2050.  By understanding and respecting our business  partners, employees, communities and the  environment, we can create sustainable value  for all our stakeholders.  We align our products with market and  customer needs. Our minerals and metals are  essential as enablers of the energy transition  and are used in a vast array of everyday  products – from electric vehicles to  smartphones to skyscrapers. The transition  to net zero will create additional demand for  materials such as copper, lithium, aluminium  and high-quality iron ore. We will support  growth in these commodities while developing  new technologies and products that help our  customers decarbonise.  Our network of rail, ports and ships enables us  to control end-to-end logistics to deliver our  products safely, efficiently and reliably.  We aim to design and run our assets in a way  that creates a positive legacy once our mining  or processing activity concludes. We engage  stakeholders of our sites nearing closure –  including Indigenous peoples, government,  employees and host communities – and  actively involve them in the planning.  Each of our sites has rehabilitation plans that  we review every year. Planning and operating  with the future in mind is integral to running  a safe, responsible and profitable business.  ===== PAGE 20 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 18 Our stakeholders Partnerships and collaboration  are essential to the long-term  success of our business.   They give us a competitive  edge and allow us to work  more thoughtfully and  responsibly, benefiting from  the expertise and insight of  others. By engaging with our  stakeholders and listening to  their views, we can make a  more meaningful contribution  to society while becoming a  more valuable company for  our shareholders. Section 172(1) statement This stakeholder section,  together with our stakeholder  pages in the Governance  section (pages 95-98),  explains how the Board takes  account of stakeholder  interests. These comprise our   “Section 172(1) statement”. Workforce  Our people are key to our success. We are  focusing on creating a safe, respectful and  inclusive workplace where our people feel  empowered and engaged. Guided by our  values, we are evolving our culture: we are  implementing the recommendations from the  Everyday Respect Report, rolling out the Safe  Production System, enhancing our safety  maturity model, empowering our people,  training our leaders and listening to employee  feedback through our employee survey. In our  most recent survey conducted in October  2022, our employee satisfaction score (eSAT)  increased by two points (71 to 73). We are  making good progress, but we know there is  more to do. Communities Communities are the places and the people  who make up where we live, work and call  home – from the Gobi Desert in Mongolia,  to KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and  Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean, Quebec, Canada.  We continue to strive to engage consistently  and honestly with communities on a range of  issues, such as jobs and local procurement,  as well as the impact of our operations on the  local environment. Over the past few years, we  have focused on our own standards of open  and transparent engagement. For example, we  are moving to a model of co-management of  Country in our Pilbara iron ore business, and  we are updating our agreements with  Indigenous peoples.  Governments Governments – national, state and provincial,  and local – are important stakeholders for   our business. They regulate our operations,   are among our commercial partners, and  receive revenue from our taxes and royalties.  Our economic contribution can be significant  for national budgets and local development  priorities, such as job creation and skills  training. It is important that we engage with  officials on issues such as how we explore,  mine and process ore; conditions of land tenure;  health, safety and environment; taxation;  intellectual property; competition and foreign  investment; data privacy; conditions of trade  and export; and infrastructure access.

It is important that we understand our investors’  needs and their vision for the company. We  therefore communicate and engage extensively  with them throughout the year, both in person  and through virtual forums across multiple  jurisdictions. In addition to our annual general  meetings in the UK and Australia, we also held  two investor seminars in 2022, one in London  and one in Sydney, where our Executive  Committee launched our new purpose  externally and provided an update on our  progress against our strategy. Customers  Our customers’ needs are central to our  operational decision making. Using the insights  generated from everything we buy, sell and move  around the world, our Commercial team works  closely with customers to ensure that we deliver  products that meet their specific requirements.  Every year, we ask our customers for their  feedback via a survey and the insights help us  deliver new and better products and services.  Where possible, we partner to co-develop  solutions that support our environmental, social  and governance commitments. For example,  in 2022, we signed a separate memorandum of  understanding with both Volvo Group and Ford  Motor Company to supply low-carbon materials  for a range of their products.  1. Shareholders, primarily through myShare, our global employee share plan.  Suppliers  Engaging with suppliers is an important way  in which we can have a positive impact on  communities. We partner with, and help  develop, local businesses where we operate,  so they can share in our success. Having good  relationships with our suppliers also helps   us take part in technological and market  developments, and we continually strive to  improve our supplier experiences. As with our  customers, we ask our suppliers to share their  feedback in a yearly survey to better understand  how we can develop our collaboration.

A change of approach We have worked with the Yinhawangka   people to co-develop a social cultural heritage  management plan as part of our proposed  development of the Western Range iron ore  mine in the Pilbara, Western Australia. The plan  includes clearly defined roles and responsibilities  regarding life of mine planning, heritage site  protection, water management, land access,  cultural awareness training and ongoing  monitoring of the area. See an interview with  Clint, Traditional Owner Engagement Lead in  our Iron Ore business, where he shares how the  Western Range engagement process differed  to our past approach.

Alignment to our four objectives All-injury frequency rate  (AIFR) per 200,000 hours worked Definition We define AIFR as the number of injuries per  200,000 hours worked by employees and  contractors at the operations that we manage.  It includes medical treatment cases, restricted  workday and lost-day injuries. Relevance to strategy  The safety and wellbeing of our employees and  contractors is our number one priority and  essential to everything we do.  We are committed to having a safe work  environment and our focus is on maintaining  zero fatalities, preventing catastrophic events  and reducing injuries. We continue to  implement our safety maturity model (SMM)  which, as our blueprint for safety, describes the  systems and behaviours we apply to create a  strong safety culture. In 2023, we will begin  planning for the integration of our SMM with  our Safe Production System. This is our new,  people-centric approach to engage our  workforce and develop and share best practice  solutions across our assets. We continue to share learnings and strengthen  our partnerships with industry and associated  committees (eg the International Council on  Mining and Metals), contracting partners and  local communities to improve health, safety  and wellbeing outcomes. Link to executive remuneration AIFR and SMM are included as performance  metrics in the safety component of the  short-term incentive plan (see pages 121-122). Our performance in 2022 We had a fourth year in a row of zero fatalities.  Our AIFR has remained stable at 0.40 compared  to 2021.  Forward plan We will renew focus on our critical risk  management programme. We will also work   on embedding enhancements to the SMM.  We will increase our focus on managing  psychosocial hazards, and continue to  innovate to reduce exposure to safety and  health risks. We will continue to implement our major hazard  standards, including process safety,  underground safety and tailings, and apply  strong assurance processes.

Relevance to strategy  Our strategy aims to maximise shareholder  returns through the commodity cycle, and TSR  is a direct measure of that. Link to executive remuneration TSR is reflected in the long-term incentive plan,  measured equally against the EMIX Global  Mining Index and the MSCI World Index  (see pages 124-125). 1. The TSR calculation for each period is based on the change in the calendar-year average share prices for Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited over the preceding five years. This is consistent with the  methodology used for calculating the vesting outcomes for Performance Share Awards (PSA). The data presented in this chart accounts for the dual corporate structure of Rio Tinto. Our performance in 2022 TSR performance over the five-year period  was driven principally by movements in  commodity prices and changes in the global  macro environment. Rio Tinto significantly  outperformed both the EMIX Global Mining  Index and the MSCI World Index over the  five-year period. Forward plan We will continue to focus on generating free  cash flow from our operations. This allows   us to return cash to shareholders (short-term  returns) while investing in the business  (long-term returns).

Underlying earnings and  underlying EBITDA $ millions Definition Underlying earnings and underlying EBITDA  are non-IFRS measures.  Underlying earnings represents net earnings  attributable to the owners of Rio Tinto,   adjusted to exclude items that do not reflect  the underlying performance of the Group’s  operations. For more information on these  exclusions and a reconciliation to the nearest  IFRS measures refer to Alternative Performance  Measures (pages 273-278). Underlying EBITDA is a segmental performance  measure and represents profit before tax, net  finance items, depreciation and amortisation.  Exclusions from underlying EBITDA and a  reconciliation to the nearest IFRS measures  can be found in note 1. Relevance to strategy  These financial KPIs measure how well we are  managing costs, increasing productivity and  generating the most revenue from each of  our assets. Link to executive remuneration Underlying earnings are reflected in the  short-term incentive plan. In the longer term,  both measures influence TSR, which is the  primary measure for the long-term incentive  plan (see pages 124-125). Our performance in 2022 Underlying earnings of $13.3 billion were  $8.1 billion lower than in 2021. Underlying  EBITDA of $26.3 billion was $11.4 billion lower  than in 2021. The 30% decrease in underlying  EBITDA resulted from lower iron ore prices,  higher energy and raw material costs, partially  offset by movements in sales volumes. Forward plan We will continue to drive attractive margins and  returns throughout the cycle through a focus  on best operating performance and a  disciplined focus on cash costs.

Net cash generated from  operating activities $ millions Definition This KPI refers to cash generated by our  operations after tax and interest, including  dividends received from equity accounted  units and dividends paid to non-controlling  interests in subsidiaries. Relevance to strategy  This KPI measures our ability to convert  underlying earnings into cash. Link to executive remuneration Net cash generated from operating activities is  included in the short-term incentive plan.

In the longer term, underlying  ROCE also influences TSR, which is   included in the long-term incentive plan   (see pages 124-125). Our performance in 2022 Underlying ROCE decreased 19 percentage  points to 25% in 2022, reflecting the decrease  in underlying earnings driven by lower iron ore  prices, and an increase in capital employed  due to capital expenditure and acquisitions.

For more information and a  reconciliation of free cash flow to the nearest  comparable IFRS measure, see Alternative  Performance Measures (pages 273-278). Relevance to strategy  This KPI measures the net cash returned by the  business after the expenditure of sustaining  and growth capital. This cash can be used for  shareholder returns, reducing debt and  other investment. Link to executive remuneration Free cash flow is included in the short-term  incentive plan. In the longer term, the measure  influences TSR, which is included in the  long-term incentive plan (see pages 124-125). Our performance in 2022 Free cash flow decreased by $8.7 billion to  $9 billion in 2022, primarily due to the decrease  in net cash generated from operating activities.  This was partially offset by a decrease in  replacement and development capital  expenditure as projects reached completion. Forward plan We will focus on effectively delivering strong  and resilient cash flows from our quality  portfolio of assets throughout the cycle. Alignment to our four objectives  and associated risks   – Best operator   – Excel in development For more information see page 79. Net (debt)/cash $ millions Definition Net (debt)/cash is a non-IFRS measure defined  as total borrowings plus lease liabilities less  cash and cash equivalents and other liquid  investments, adjusted for derivatives related to  net (debt)/cash (see note 19 of the financial  statements). For more information and a  reconciliation of net (debt)/cash to the nearest  comparable IFRS measure, see Alternative  Performance Measures (pages 273-278). Relevance to strategy  This KPI measures how we are managing our  balance sheet and capital structure. A strong  balance sheet is essential for giving us the  flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as  they arise, and for returning cash to shareholders. Link to executive remuneration Net cash/(debt) is, in part, an outcome of   free cash flow, which itself is reflected in the  short-term incentive plan. In the longer term,  net cash/(debt) influences TSR, which is  reflected in the long-term incentive plan  (see pages 124-125). Alignment to our four objectives  and associated risks   – Best operator   – Excel in development For more information see page 79. Our performance in 2022 Net cash reduced by $5.8 billion in 2022,  resulting in a net debt position of $4.2 billion.  This reflected $11.7 billion returned to  shareholders in the year, $3.0 billion1  acquisition of the remaining non-controlling  interest of TRQ and $0.8 billion acquisition   of the Rincon Lithium Project, partially offset   by $9.0 billion of free cash flow and the  $0.5 billion received from the sale of the  Cortez royalty.

Total consideration of $3,139 million for the minority interest in TRQ excludes transaction costs of $74 million. In 2022, we paid $2,928 million to shareholders and $33 million of transaction costs.  In 2023, we expect to pay the remaining $41 million of transaction costs and approximately $211 million to dissenting shareholders, depending on the outcome and timing of dissent proceedings.  ===== PAGE 26 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 24 Key performance indicators continued 2018 17.7% 20202 2019 18.4% 20202 20.1% 2021 2022 21.6% 22.9% 19.0% 2019 31.4 2021 2020 31.7 2022 30.3 31.0 20181 32.5 Scope 1 and 2  greenhouse gas emissions (equity Mt CO2e) Definition We measure our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse  gas emissions on an equity basis. It includes  the equity share of Scope 1 and 2 emissions  from managed and non-managed operations  expressed in million metric tonnes of carbon  dioxide equivalent. Relevance to strategy  Climate risks and opportunities have formed  part of our strategic thinking and investment  decisions for over two decades. The low-carbon  transition is at the heart of our business strategy.  We focus on growth in the materials that enable  the transition, decarbonising our operations  and partnering with our customers to  decarbonise our value chains.  Link to executive remuneration Climate change is included in our ESG metrics  for executive remuneration with a weighting   of 5% of the short-term incentive plan   (see pages 121-122). In 2022, we approved   or delivered abatement projects towards   our 2025 target that would contribute   0.29Mt CO2 of abatement compared   to an abatement target of 0.8Mt that year.  Our performance in 2022 In 2022, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions were  30.3Mt CO2e, 7% below our 2018 baseline.  This reduction is primarily the result of  switching to renewable power at Kennecott  and Escondida in prior years, as well as lower  than planned production from our Kitimat and  Boyne aluminium smelters in 2022. We did not  advance the actual implementation of our  abatement projects as fast as we would have  liked last year. Challenges have included late  delivery of equipment, resourcing constraints  impacting study progress, construction and  commissioning delays, and project readiness.  Forward plan We announced ambitious climate targets in  2021 and aim to reduce emissions from our  operations by 15% by 2025 and by 50% by  2030. We are committed to reaching net zero  emissions by 2050. In 2022, we established six  abatement programmes, with dedicated people,  to focus on the decarbonisation challenges that  cut across our product groups: repowering our  Pacific Aluminium Operations, renewables,  ELYSISTM, alumina process heat, minerals  processing and diesel transition. We are building  capability and gaining a deeper understanding  of our decarbonisation challenge and are better  placed to deliver the structural change needed  to achieve our 2030 target.  Our progress and plans to meet these targets  are summarised in the Climate Action Plan in our  2022 Climate Change Report, which can be  found at riotinto.com/climatereport. 1. The 2018 figure is the baseline for our 2025 and 2030 targets and is adjusted to include emissions from acquisitions and exclude emissions from divestments. Actual emissions in 2018 were 33.7 MtCO2e. 2. Baseline reset with definition for 2020 to 2021 gender diversity. 3.

Gender diversity representation of women within our workforce Definition Includes our total workforce based on  managed operations (excludes the Group’s  share of non-managed operations and  joint ventures)3. Relevance to strategy  Inclusion and diversity are imperative for   the sustainable success of the business.   Our sustained performance and growth   rely on having workforce diversity that is  representative of the communities in which   we operate and having a workplace where  people are valued for who they are and  encouraged to contribute to their full potential. Link to executive remuneration In 2022, our target was to increase the  proportion of women in our workforce by 2  percentage points. This target is included in  our ESG metrics for executive remuneration,  with a weighting of 5% of the short-term  incentive plan. For more information,  see pages 121-122. Our performance in 2022 In 2022, we increased our representation of  women at Rio Tinto by 1.4 percentage points4  from 21.6% to 22.9%. This falls short of our 2  percentage points target. The increases were  distributed across all levels of the organisation  with senior leaders increasing from 27.4% to  28.3%, and operations and general support  increasing by 1.1 percentage points to 16.2%.  Forward plan Our aspiration to increase the proportion of  women in our workforce by 2 percentage  points year-on-year will continue in 2023.  The implementation of the Everyday Respect  Report recommendations remain our priority  and we are confident that this will improve both  the attraction and retention of women and  other diverse groups to Rio Tinto.

Solid financial results Our 2022 financial results were solid, set  against a context of record prices and results  in 2021. While the business remained resilient,  cyclical cost inflation accelerated, leading to  pressure on margins. We experienced cost  increases as a result of COVID-19, the  commodity cycle and broad-based market  inflation. Our focus has been to remain  disciplined, leading to net cash generated  from operating activities of $16.1 billion,  underlying earnings of $13.3 billion and profit  after tax attributable to owners of Rio Tinto of  $12.4 billion.  We maintained our financial strength, ending  the year with net debt of $4.2 billion,  compared with a net cash position of  $1.6 billion at the end of 2021, with the  movement reflecting, in part, our acquisitions  of the Turquoise Hill Resources (TRQ)  minorities and the Rincon Lithium Project in  Argentina. This balance sheet strength  enables us to run our business consistently  and maintain investment, regardless of where  we are in the cycle. We do not have a net debt  target, but have a principles-based approach  to anchor the balance sheet around a single A  credit rating.  Disciplined investing for growth and  decarbonisation We will continue to invest consistently through  the cycle, balancing near-term returns to  shareholders with reinvestment for growth and  de-risking future cash flows. Essential capital  remains our priority for capital allocation. It  includes sustaining capital to ensure the  integrity of our assets, high-returning  replacement projects and decarbonisation  investment. This is followed by ordinary  dividends within our well-established returns  policy. We then test investment in compelling  growth projects against debt management  and additional cash returns to shareholders. In 2022, we made some significant  investments in growth with the $0.8 billion  acquisition of Rincon and the $3.1 billion  purchase of non-controlling interests in TRQ,  giving us a 66% shareholding in the Oyu  Tolgoi copper-gold mine, our largest growth  project. Our exploration and evaluation spend  also gathered momentum at $0.9 billion, with  greenfield exploration mainly focused on  copper and evaluation prioritised on those  projects where we expect near-term  investment decisions. Capital expenditure  decreased by 9% to $6.8 billion, reflecting a  stronger US dollar and the successful  commissioning of our Pilbara iron ore  replacement projects in Western Australia. We expect a disciplined increase in capital  expenditure over the coming years as our  growth projects accelerate and  decarbonisation projects advance. This is  critical to ensure we have the right portfolio to  keep creating value for decades to come, to  benefit from the energy transition.  60% average payout on the ordinary  dividend over the past seven years Our shareholder returns policy dates back to  2016. We have committed to returning 40% to  60% of underlying earnings on average  through the cycle, with additional returns in  periods of strong earnings and cash  generation. Over the past seven years, we  have paid out at the top end of the range, at  60% for the ordinary dividend, in each year. We have remained very consistent with our  shareholder returns policy, with the payout  ratio giving us some flexibility with regard to  the macro-economic environment. It remains  a core part of our equity story, which we see  as paramount for maintaining discipline. Our  financial strength means that we can reinvest  for growth, accelerate our decarbonisation  and continue to pay attractive dividends  through the cycle. For 2022, we are returning 60% of underlying  earnings to shareholders, which equates to a  full-year ordinary dividend of 492 US cents  per share, or $8.0 billion.  Energy transition drives additional  long-term value We foresee a significant uplift in new demand  from the energy transition – adding as much  as 25% over and above traditional sources of  demand on a copper equivalent basis across  our key products by 2035.  Decarbonisation is therefore positive for our  industry. Given that the world will need more  aluminium, more copper, more high-grade  iron ore and more lithium, this is where we are  focusing our growth investments. Net cash generated from operating  activities $16.1 billion (2021: $25.3 billion) Profit after tax attributable to owners of Rio  Tinto (net earnings) $12.4 billion (2021: $21.1 billion) Underlying earnings $13.3 billion (2021: $21.4 billion) However, we will only invest in quality assets  which give robust returns under a range of  economic, geopolitical and carbon scenarios,  creating a resilient portfolio with significant  upside to the energy transition. We will  continue to allocate our capital with great  discipline and remain committed to attractive  shareholder returns, underpinned by our  resilient cash flows and the strength of our  balance sheet.

Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 26  ===== PAGE 29 ===== – $16.1 billion in net cash generated from operating activities, 36%  lower than 2021, was primarily driven by price movements for our  major commodities and a $0.5 billion rise in working capital, primarily  due to elevated prices for raw materials in aluminium inventory. We  also incurred some items of a non-recurring nature which were not  representative of the underlying strength of the performance of the  business. These comprised; higher tax payments (relative to profit) in  2022 as a result of a $1.1 billion (A$1.5 billion) final payment to the  Australian Taxation Office (ATO) in respect of 2021 profits; $0.4  billion (A$0.6 billion) settlement with the ATO in respect of 12  historical years; and $0.4 billion of cash losses from currency hedges  on our external dividends. At the end of 2022, we had no material  outstanding tax payable on Australian profits.  – We made some significant investments in growth with the $0.8 billion  acquisition of Rincon and the $3.0 billion2 purchase of non- controlling interests in TRQ (including transaction costs), giving us a  66% shareholding in the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine, our largest  growth project. Our capital expenditure of $6.8 billion encompassed  $0.6 billion of growth capital, $2.2 billion of replacement capital,  $3.9 billion of sustaining capital and $0.1 billion of decarbonisation  spend. We funded our capital expenditure from operating activities  and expect to continue funding our capital programme from internal  sources, except for the Oyu Tolgoi underground development, which  is project-financed. – $11.7 billion of dividends paid in 2022, being the 2021 final ordinary  and special dividends paid in April 2022 ($7.6 billion) and the 2022  interim ordinary dividend paid in September ($4.1 billion), including  foreign exchange impacts. – The above movements, together with disposals including the $525  million of cash received from the sale of the gross production royalty  at the Cortez Complex in Nevada, USA (Cortez royalty), resulted in  net cash1 decreasing by $5.8 billion in 2022, and gave rise to net  debt1 of $4.2 billion at 31 December 2022.

Continuing to invest in greenfield exploration We have a strong portfolio of greenfield exploration projects in  early exploration and studies stages, with activity in 18 countries  across seven commodities. This is reflected in our pre-tax central  spend of $253 million in 2022. The bulk of this exploration  expenditure was focused on copper projects in Australia,  Colombia, Namibia, Peru, the United States and Zambia;  diamonds in Angola; and heavy mineral sands projects in  Australia and South Africa. Exploration is ongoing for nickel in  Canada and Finland and in lithium across all regions, with  opportunities emerging in the United States and Africa. Mine- lease exploration continued at Rio Tinto managed businesses,  including Pilbara Iron in Australia, Diavik in Canada and Cape  York bauxite operations in Australia.

Total consideration of $3,139 million for the minority interest in TRQ excludes transaction costs of $74 million. In 2022, we paid $2,928 million to shareholders and $33 million of transaction costs.

Movements in commodity prices resulted in a $8,101 million decline in  underlying EBITDA overall compared with 2021. This was primarily from  lower iron ore prices ($9,155 million) and lower London Metal Exchange  (LME) copper prices and a negative provisional pricing impact            ($733  million).  This was partly offset by a price uplift for our Aluminium business    ($886 million), driven by a first-half rise in LME prices, improved  product premiums and higher alumina pricing, which fell away sharply  in the second half. We have included a table of prices and exchange  rates on page 344. The monthly average Platts index for 62% iron fines converted to a Free  on Board (FOB) basis was 25% lower on average compared with 2021. The average LME price for copper was 6% lower, while the average  LME aluminium price was 9% higher, compared with 2021. The gold  price was flat compared with 2021. The midwest premium duty paid for aluminium in the US averaged $655  per tonne, 12% higher than in 2021. Weaker local currencies during 2022 Compared with 2021, on average, the US dollar strengthened by 8%  against the Australian dollar and by 4% against the Canadian dollar.  Currency movements increased underlying EBITDA by $801 million  relative to 2021. Improvement in sales volumes and mix Higher sales volumes and changes in product mix across the portfolio  increased underlying EBITDA by $606 million compared to 2021. This  was mostly attributable to increased iron ore sales from the ramp-up of  Gudai-Darri along with higher portside sales in China, and favourable  value-added product premiums for our Aluminium business.  Impact of rising inflation and significantly higher energy  prices Average movements in energy prices compared with 2021 reduced  underlying EBITDA by $1,169 million, mainly due to higher diesel prices  for our trucks, trains and ships. In addition, rising general price inflation  across our global operations resulted in a $1,478 million reduction in  underlying EBITDA, including $0.2 billion for the impact of higher than  expected inflation on closure provisions (for closed or fully impaired  sites and environmental liabilities). Disciplined focus on costs offset some of the market- linked increases We remained focused on cost control throughout the year, in particular  maintaining discipline on fixed costs. However, a rise in our operating  cash unit costs reduced underlying EBITDA by $2,202 million (on a unit  cost basis) compared with 2021. This mainly reflected cyclical cost  pressures from higher market-linked prices for raw materials, in  particular in our Aluminium business. We also experienced fixed cost  inefficiencies from lower volumes at our Pacific alumina refineries and  at the Boyne aluminium smelter due to production disruptions. In  addition, we increased resourcing in our iron ore business to support  the ramp-up at Gudai-Darri and targeted investment in pit health and  asset maintenance across the Pilbara.  Increasing our global exploration and evaluation  activity  We increased our exploration and evaluation expenditure by $171  million, or 24%, to $897 million. This was mainly attributable to  increased activity at the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea and the  Rincon Lithium Project in Argentina. Non-cash costs/other Movements in non-cash costs, one-off and other items increased  underlying EBITDA by $266 million compared with 2021. This mainly  reflected the acquisition of the remaining 40% of Diavik in November  2021 (+$163 million), lower incremental COVID-19 costs (+$123 million),  gain on asset sale at Kennecott (+$133 million) and lower charges to the  income statement on updates to closure cost estimates relating to  closed and legacy sites (+$166 million). This was partially offset by  reduced capacity at the Kitimat aluminium smelter (-$329 million) as  ramp-up activities progressed in 2022 following the strike which  commenced in July 2021. Net earnings  The principal factors explaining the movements in underlying earnings and net earnings are set out below. US$m 2021 net earnings   21,094  Total changes in underlying EBITDA   (11,448)  Increase in depreciation and amortisation (pre-tax) in underlying earnings   (319)  Increase in interest and finance items (pre-tax) in underlying earnings   (1,112)  Decrease in tax on underlying earnings   3,949  Decrease in underlying earnings attributable to outside interests   825  Total changes in underlying earnings   (8,105)  Changes in exclusions from underlying earnings: Write-off of Federal deferred tax assets in the United States   (820)  Movement in exchange differences and gains/losses on derivatives   (683)  Gain recognised by Kitimat relating to LNG Canada's project   (230)  Loss on disposal of interest in subsidiary   (105)  Movement in impairment charges net of reversals   145  Movement in closure estimates (non-operating and fully impaired sites)   793  Gain on sale of Cortez royalty   331  2022 net earnings   12,420  Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 28 Financial review continued  ===== PAGE 31 ===== Depreciation and amortisation, net interest and finance  items, tax and non-controlling interests The depreciation and amortisation charge was $319 million higher than  2021, mainly due to an increase in capitalised closure costs in 2021 at a  number of our Aluminium sites. Our capital base was also higher in Iron  Ore, Copper and Minerals as a result of our investment activities. This  was partially offset by a stronger US dollar against the Australian dollar. Interest and finance items (pre-tax) were higher mainly as a result of a  $1,101 million increase in amortisation of discount on provisions, as  higher inflation had an impact on the Group's closure and restoration/ environmental liabilities. The amortisation charge of $1,517 million  (2021: $415 million) incorporates an estimate of inflation at the start of  each six-month reporting period. At the end of each half year we  update the underlying cash flows for the latest estimate of experienced  inflation for the current financial year and record this as “changes to  existing provisions”. For operating sites this adjustment usually results  in a corresponding adjustment to Property, plant and equipment, and  for closed and fully impaired sites the adjustment is charged or credited  to the Income statement. These income statement amounts are  included within underlying earnings except for the re-measurement of  provisions for legacy sites that were never operated by Rio Tinto. The 2022 effective corporate income tax rate on pre-tax earnings,  excluding equity accounted units, was 30.9%, compared with 27.7% in  2021. The effective tax rate on pre-tax earnings in Australia was 31.7%  in 2022, compared with 30.7% in 2021. We reached agreement with the  Australian Taxation Office (ATO) on all tax matters in dispute. As part of  this agreement, in August we paid the ATO additional tax of A$613  million for the period from 2010 to 2021. Over this 12-year period, we  paid nearly A$80 billion in tax and royalties in Australia. Items excluded from underlying earnings The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 in the United States may give rise to  investment credits on some of our existing projects, with longer dated  projects potentially becoming more favourable. However, it also  includes a new Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax regime, which has  led to the Group reviewing the carrying value of US Federal deferred  tax balances. The resulting $820 million write down of Federal deferred  tax assets has been excluded from underlying earnings on the grounds  of materiality. In 2022, we recognised an exchange and derivative loss of $137 million.  This includes losses of $373 million on revaluation of certain derivatives  which do not qualify for hedge accounting. These include currency  hedges relating to our external dividends, and exchange losses of $262  million on US dollar debt in non-US dollar functional currency Group  companies, partly offset by $478 million of exchange gains on  intragroup balances. These losses compared with a 2021 gain of $546  million, giving rise to an unfavourable year-on-year movement of $683  million. The exchange gains are largely offset by currency translation  losses recognised in equity. The quantum of US dollar debt is largely  unaffected and we will repay it from US dollar sales receipts.  During 2022, LNG Canada elected to terminate their option to purchase  additional land at Kitimat, Canada. This resulted in a $106 million gain  which includes the release of deferred income and receipt of a  cancellation fee payment. During 2021, we recognised a $336 million  gain on recognition of a new wharf at Kitimat that was built and paid for  by LNG Canada. These gains have been excluded from underlying  earnings consistent with prior years, as they are part of a series of  material transactions unrelated to the core business. Impairment charges, net of reversals, decreased by $145 million  compared with 2021. In 2022, we impaired the remaining full value of  the Boyne Smelter in Queensland, Australia, as a result of reduced  capacity and the high cost of energy from the coal-fired power station  impacting economic performance. In 2022, we also completed the sale  of the Roughrider uranium undeveloped project in Saskatchewan,  Canada, which resulted in a reversal of previous impairments. There is a detailed explanation of the impairment process on pages 165  to 168. In 2022, we recognised $178 million in closure costs representing  adjustments to the closure estimates relating to legacy sites where the  disturbance preceded ownership by Rio Tinto, including inflationary  increases to provisions for these sites in excess of the unwind of  discount. This was $793 million lower than 2021 closure charges, which  related to Energy Resources of Australia (ERA), Gove refinery and  Diavik closure provision increases, and further increases at a number of  the Group's legacy sites where the disturbance preceded our  ownership. In 2022, we completed the $525 million sale of a gold royalty which was  retained following the disposal of the Cortez mine in 2008. The carrying  value of the royalty at 31 December 2021 was $88 million, resulting in a  post-tax gain of $331 million. This has been excluded from underlying  earnings on the grounds of materiality. Profit  Net earnings and underlying earnings refer to amounts attributable to  the owners of Rio Tinto. The net profit attributable to the owners of Rio  Tinto in 2022 was $12.4 billion (2021: $21.1 billion). We recorded a profit  after tax in 2022 of $13.1 billion (2021: $22.6 billion) of which a profit of  $0.7 billion (2021: $1.5 billion) was attributable to non-controlling  interests.

This reflected $11.7 billion  returned to shareholders in the year, $3.0 billion2 acquisition of the  remaining non-controlling interest of TRQ and $0.8 billion acquisition of  the Rincon Lithium Project, partially offset by $9.0 billion of free cash  flow and the $0.5 billion received from the sale of the Cortez royalty. Our net gearing ratio1 (net debt/ (cash) to total capital) was 7% at  31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: (3)%), see page 278. Our total financing liabilities excluding net debt derivatives at  31 December 2022 (see page 191) were $12.3 billion (31 December  2021: $13.5 billion) and the weighted average maturity was around        11 years. At 31 December 2022, approximately 77% of these liabilities  were at floating interest rates (85% excluding leases). The maximum  amount within non-current borrowings maturing in any one calendar  year is $1.5 billion, which matures in 2024. We had $8.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents plus other short-term  cash investments at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021:  $15.2 billion). Provision for closure costs  At 31 December 2022, provisions for close-down and restoration costs  and environmental clean-up obligations were $15.8 billion  (31 December 2021: $14.5 billion). The principal movements during the  year were the result of a remeasurement of underlying cash flows,  including the effect of inflation. This was recorded as an increase to  mining properties for current operating sites ($0.5 billion) and as a  charge to profit for legacy sites ($0.5 billion). Also contributing to the  increase in the provision was amortisation of discount ($1.5 billion)  which includes the effect of higher inflation in the year. These increases  were partly offset by utilisation of the provision through spend  (-$0.6 billion) and a weaker Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and  South African rand against the US dollar (-$0.7 billion).  Of the $15.8 billion in provisions, $11.6 billion relates to operating sites  and $4.2 billion is for legacy sites. Remaining lives of operations and  infrastructure range from one to over 50 years with an average for all  sites, weighted by present closure obligation, of around 15 years (2021:  16 years). The provisions are based on risk-adjusted real cash flows using a real- rate discount rate of 1.5% to reflect obligations at the present value of  cash flows on 31 December 2022 terms. In 2023, we expect to utilise around $0.8 billion of the provisions as we  advance our closure activities at Argyle, ERA, Gove alumina refinery  and legacy sites. Our shareholder returns policy The Board is committed to maintaining an appropriate balance between cash returns to shareholders and investment in the business, with the  intention of maximising long-term shareholder value.   At the end of each financial period, the Board determines an appropriate total level of ordinary dividend per share. This takes into account the  results for the financial year, the outlook for our major commodities, the Board’s view of the long-term growth prospects of the business and the  company’s objective of maintaining a strong balance sheet. The intention is that the balance between the interim and final dividend be weighted to  the final dividend.   The Board expects total cash returns to shareholders over the longer term to be in a range of 40% to 60% of underlying earnings in aggregate  through the cycle. Acknowledging the cyclical nature of the industry, it is the Board’s intention to supplement the ordinary dividend with additional  returns to shareholders in periods of strong earnings and cash generation.  60% payout ratio on the ordinary dividend 2022 US$ bn 2021 US$ bn Ordinary dividend Interim 4.3  6.1  Final 3.7  6.7  Full-year ordinary dividend 8.0  12.8  Payout ratio on ordinary dividend  60 %  60 % Additional returns Special dividend announced in July 2021, paid in September 2021 n/a 3.0  Special dividend announced in February 2022, paid in April 2022 n/a 1.0  Total cash returns to shareholders declared* 8.0  16.8  Combined total as % of underlying earnings  60 %  79 % * Based on weighted average number of shares and declared dividends per share for the respective periods and excluding foreign exchange impacts on payment.

American Depositary Receipt (ADR) holders receive dividends at the declared rate in US dollars. 1. This financial performance indicator is a non-IFRS (as defined below) alternative performance measure (APM). It is used internally by management to assess the performance of the business and  is therefore considered relevant to readers of this document. It is presented here to give more clarity around the underlying business performance of the Group’s operations. APMs are reconciled  to directly comparable IFRS financial measures on pages 273 to 278. Our financial results are prepared in accordance with IFRS — see page 148 for further information. 2. Total consideration of $3,139 million for the minority interest in TRQ excludes transaction costs of $74 million. In 2022, we paid $2,928 million to shareholders and $33 million of transaction costs.  In 2023, we expect to pay the remaining $41 million of transaction costs and approximately $211 million to dissenting shareholders, depending on the outcome and timing of dissent proceedings.

The investment incorporates a  processing plant and infrastructure including a 166-kilometre  rail line connecting the mine to our existing network.  $3.1bn We delivered first ore in June 2022. Production from the mine ramped up in  the second half of the year and we expect Gudai-Darri to reach its  nameplate capacity of 43 million tonne per year on a sustained basis during  2023. The mine has an expected life of more than 40 years. Investment in the Robe River Joint Venture (West Angelas C and  D and Mesa B, C and H at Robe Valley) in the Pilbara to sustain  production capacity. $1.0bn (Rio Tinto share) In the third quarter of 2022, Mesa A rectification works were successfully  completed, with the plant operating at design rates. Final train load out tie- in works at Mesa J were also completed, with first ore achieved. Investment in a second tunnel at the 1000MW Kemano  hydropower facility at Kitimat, British Columbia, Canada, which  will ensure the long-term reliability of the power supply to the  Kitimat smelter. $0.8bn The new 16-kilometre tunnel produced its first megawatt of electricity in  July 2022 after construction was completed in May 2022. Ongoing Iron Ore Investment in the Western Range iron ore project, a joint venture  between Rio Tinto (54%) and China Baowu Steel Group Co. Ltd  (46%) in the Pilbara to sustain production of the Pilbara Blend  from Rio Tinto's existing Paraburdoo hub.  $1.3bn (Rio Tinto share)1 Announced in September 2022, the mine will have a production capacity of  25 million tonnes per year. The project includes construction of a primary  crusher and an 18-kilometre conveyor connection to the Paraburdoo  processing plant. Early works construction commenced in 2022 and major  contracts have been awarded by Rio Tinto. First production is anticipated  in 2025. Copper Phase two of the south wall pushback to extend mine life at  Kennecott by a further six years. A $108 million investment in  underground characterisation studies is ongoing, with  $55 million in development capital approved to commence  underground mining. $1.5bn Approved in December 2019, the investment will further extend strip waste  rock mining and support additional infrastructure development. This will  allow mining to continue into a new area of the orebody between 2026 and  2032. Development of the Oyu Tolgoi underground copper/gold mine  in Mongolia (Rio Tinto 66%), which is expected to produce (from  the open pit and underground) an average of ~500,000 tonnes2  of copper per year from 2028 to 2036 and an average of  ~350,000 tonnes2 of copper per year for a further five years,  compared with 130,000 tonnes in 2022 (open pit). $7.06bn3 The project was originally approved in May 2016 for $5.3 billion, with an  additional $1.45 billion approved by the Rio Tinto Board in December 2020,  following completion of the Definitive Estimate. By the end of 2022, a total  of 19 drawbells had been fired. Progression accelerated as a result of  improvement initiatives implemented by the Oyu Tolgoi teams, bringing  projected first sustainable production from Panel 0 forward to the first  quarter of 2023. This followed the comprehensive agreement between the  Oyu Tolgoi partners announced in January 2022. Minerals Development of the Zulti South project at Richards Bay Minerals  (RBM) in South Africa (Rio Tinto 74%). $0.5bn Approved in April 2019 to underpin RBM’s supply of zircon and ilmenite  over the life of the mine. The project remains on full suspension. Development of the greenfield Jadar lithium-borates project in  Serbia. The development will include an underground mine with  associated infrastructure and equipment, including electric haul  trucks, as well as a beneficiation chemical processing plant. $2.4bn The Board committed the funding in July 2021, subject to receiving all  relevant approvals, permits and licences. We are focused on consultation  with all stakeholders to explore all options following the Government of  Serbia's cancellation of the Spatial Plan in January 2022. 1. Rio Tinto share includes 100% of funding costs for Paraburdoo plant upgrades. 2. The 500ktpa target (stated as recovered metal) for the Oyu Tolgoi underground and open pit mines is underpinned 21% by Proved Ore Reserves and 79% by Probable Ore Reserves for the years  2028 to 2036. The 350ktpa production target for the following five years is underpinned 22% by Proved Ore Reserves and 78% by Probable Ore Reserves. These production targets have been  scheduled from current mine designs by Competent Persons in accordance with the requirements of the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Minerals Resources and Ore  Reserves, 2012 Edition (the JORC code). 3. A cost and schedule reforecast was performed in June 2022 and estimates that $7.06 billion is required to complete the Hugo North 1 project (an increase of $0.3 billion beyond the 2020  Definitive Estimate). The 2022 Reforecast excludes impacts of COVID-19 restrictions arising after June 2022. The 2022 reforecast remains subject to Oyu Tolgoi Board approval. Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 32  ===== PAGE 35 ===== Future options Iron Ore: Pilbara brownfields Over the medium term, our Pilbara system capacity remains between 345  and 360 million tonnes per year. Meeting this range, and the planned  product mix, will require the approval and delivery of the next tranche of  replacement mines. In addition to Western Range (Greater Paraburdoo), which has commenced early  works construction, other key projects to be delivered over the next five years include  Hope Downs 1 Sustaining (Hope Downs 2 and Bedded Hilltop), West Angelas  Sustaining, Greater Nammuldi Sustaining and Brockman 4 Sustaining (Brockman  Syncline 1).  We continue to work closely with local communities, Traditional Owners  and government to progress approvals for the new mining projects. Iron Ore: Rhodes Ridge In October, Rio Tinto (50%) and Wright Prospecting Pty Ltd (50%) agreed  to modernise the joint venture covering the Rhodes Ridge project in the  Eastern Pilbara, providing a pathway for development utilising Rio Tinto’s  rail, port and power infrastructure. Rhodes Ridge contains 5.8 billion tonnes  of high grade Mineral Resources at an average grade of 62.3% Fe. The  project’s total resource, 6.7 billion tonnes at an average grade of 61.6% Fe,  represents approximately one third of our existing Resource base in the  Pilbara.1 A resource-drilling programme is currently underway to support  future project studies. The participants have commenced an Order of Magnitude study, conducted by Rio  Tinto, which will consider the development of an operation before the end of the  decade with initial plant capacity of up to 40 million tonnes annually, subject to the  receipt of relevant approvals. We expect to complete the Rhodes Ridge Order of  Magnitude study in 2023. Iron Ore: Simandou The Simandou iron ore project in Guinea2 contains one of the world’s  largest known undeveloped high-grade low-impurity iron ore deposits,  demand for which is increasing as steelmakers look to reduce carbon  emissions. Simandou is set to diversify our strong iron ore portfolio,  complementing our high-grade Iron Ore Company of Canada products  and supporting the long-term attractiveness of our Pilbara Blend™ offering. Negotiations towards the co-development of project infrastructure progressed further  with the December signing of a non-binding term sheet between our Simfer joint  venture, Baowu, Winning Consortium Simandou (WCS) and the Government of  Guinea3. The term sheet further establishes the co-development principles following  the incorporation of La Compagnie du TransGuinéen on 27 July 2022, and is a pivotal  next step towards securing the shareholder agreement, cost estimates and regulatory  authority approvals necessary to progress the co-development of rail and port  facilities. Lithium: Rincon We completed the acquisition of the Rincon Lithium Project in Salta  province, Argentina in March 2022. Development of a small starter, battery- grade lithium carbonate plant with a capacity of 3,000 tonnes per year is  underway.   In July 2022, we approved $140 million of investment and $54 million for early works to  support a full-scale operation to be expensed through exploration and evaluation  expenditure. Construction activities progressed on phase one camp facilities with  rooms for 250 persons completed. Airstrip permits were received and contractors  mobilised. First saleable production from the small starter plant  is expected in the first  half of 2024. Copper: Resolution The Resolution Copper project is a proposed underground copper mine in  the Copper Triangle, in Arizona, United States. It has the potential to supply  up to 25% of US copper demand. The US Forest Service continued work to progress the Final Environmental Impact  Statement and complete actions necessary for the land exchange. We continued to  advance partnership discussions with several federally recognised Native American  Tribes who are part of the formal consultation process. Copper: Winu In late 2017, we discovered copper-gold mineralisation at the Winu project  in the Paterson Province in Western Australia. In 2021, we reported our first  Indicated Mineral Resource. The pathway is expected to take longer than  originally anticipated and remains subject to regulatory and other required  approvals. We continued to strengthen our relationships and advanced agreement making with  our host Traditional Owners, the Martu and Nyangumarta groups. Planned drilling,  fieldwork and study activities continued, strengthening the development pathway  ahead of applications for regulatory and other required approvals. Aluminium: ELYSIS ELYSIS, our joint venture with Alcoa, supported by Apple, the Government  of Canada and the Government of Quebec, is developing a breakthrough  inert anode technology that eliminates all direct greenhouse gases from the  aluminium smelting process. Construction of the first commercial-scale prototype cells is underway at our Alma  smelter and is expected to become operational in 2023. ELYSIS aims to have its  technology available for installation from 2024 and production of larger volumes of  carbon-free aluminium approximately two years later. 1. The Mineral Resource estimates for the Rhodes Ridge Joint Venture (JV) were reported in our 2020 Annual Report released to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) on 22 February 2021 (and  form part of the Pilbara Mineral Resource estimates reported in our 2021 Annual Report released to the ASX on 24 February 2022). The Competent Persons responsible for reporting these  Mineral Resource estimates were Mr P Savory, who is a Fellow of The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, and Ms N Brajkovich and Mr C Kyngdon, who are Members of The  Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. We are not aware of any new information or data that materially affects these Mineral Resource estimates and confirm that all material assumptions  and technical parameters underpinning the estimate continue to apply and have not materially changed. The form and context in which the Competent Persons’ findings are presented have not  been materially modified from when they were reported. Mineral Resources are quoted in this release on a 100% basis, as dry in-situ tonnes. 2. The Simandou iron ore project operates under the Simfer joint venture where the Government of Guinea holds 15% and Simfer Jersey holds 85%. Simfer Jersey is owned by Rio Tinto (53%) and  Chalco Iron Ore Holdings (CIOH) (47%). CIOH is owned by Chinalco (75%), Baowu (20%), China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) (2.5%) and China Harbour Engineering  Company (CHEC) (2.5%). This structure has been in place since 2017. 3. This followed notification to Rio Tinto and the Government of Guinea of Baowu’s earlier entry into a term sheet agreement with WCS in respect of an investment into WCS mine (blocks 1 and 2)  and infrastructure vehicle – an agreement welcomed by Rio Tinto. 33 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Strategic report  ===== PAGE 36 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 34 Innovation  through  collaboration Working safer and smarter  While empowering our people to find more  efficient ways of working, we always treat   their health and safety as our most important  priority. In 2022, we introduced several new  technologies to help us work safer and smarter.  For example, we are trialling agile autonomous  haul trucks together with Scania at our  Channar operation in Western Australia’s  Pilbara region. We use these driverless vehicles  in a simulated load and haul cycle environment,  and they offer a range of potential safety,  productivity and decarbonisation benefits.  Channar is the first active site for these  vehicles, with plans for a future transition to  electric-powered vehicles.  We are also trialling battery-powered electric  vehicles underground at our Kennecott  operations. As well as offering significant  productivity and decarbonisation opportunities,  these vehicles also protect the health and  safety of our people by minimising exposure   to potentially dangerous diesel emissions and  particulates underground. We will use the  lessons we learn at Kennecott as we continue  these trials on other sites in 2023. We are also partnering with other suppliers,  including Komatsu, Caterpillar and Volvo, to  progress options for electrified vehicles, with  further trials to take place in the coming years.  In parallel, we are also working to reduce  emissions from our fleet today using biofuels.  In 2022, we began trials of renewable diesel   at our Boron and Kennecott operations.  We are also focusing on learning and  implementing lessons from our own pockets   of excellence. In 2021, we launched the Safe  Production System (SPS) to improve how we  operate our assets, manage performance and  help our people innovate. Through SPS, we are  drawing on data more efficiently to understand  asset health, maintenance scheduling and  bottleneck solutions. We have started to see  improved production efficiency, safety and  engagement at the sites where we have  deployed SPS.  For more information about SPS, see our website.  Our Pioneer Portal, used to source innovative  solutions to current business challenges,  continued to deliver new ideas. In 2022, we  launched six new challenges through the portal,  focused on developing our people, reducing our  environmental footprint, recovering value from  our water, and progressing our work towards net  zero. We received more than 200 submissions  from across the world, resulting in 20 new  partnerships underpinned by more than  $40 million in research and development (R&D)  funds, significantly reducing our discovery and  development cycles.  Product innovation  We have continued our focus on applied  innovation and R&D to address technical  barriers that may help unlock new orebodies or  significantly reduce environmental, social and  governance (ESG) impacts. These include:    – Copper: advancing commercialisation  opportunities for our proprietary Copper  Heap Leach technology via the NutonTM  Venture and a range of existing product  group and exploration deployment options.   – Rincon: developing process technical  support for progression of our operations,  including a focus on water recovery and  recycling and process optimisation.   – Aluminium: progressing ELYSIS, our joint  venture with Alcoa, supported by Apple and  the Governments of Canada and Quebec.  ELYSIS is developing a breakthrough  technology that eliminates all direct  greenhouse gases from the aluminium  smelting process. Construction of the first  commercial-scale prototype cells of  ELYSISTM inert anode technology is  underway at our Alma smelter, and they are  expected to become operational in 2023.   – Green steelmaking: development of the  innovative BioIronTM process and hydrogen- based steelmaking, and creating a deeper  understanding of Pilbara ore characteristics  for performance in a green steelmaking world.   – Technology leveraging: fast-tracking ideas  from our R&D network. Driving R&D ideas  and delivery for growth, closure and ESG  priorities with a specific focus on resolving  technical barriers within critical metals  extraction, future net zero flowsheets,  mineralised carbon sequestration, dry stack  tailings, zero carbon ilmenite smelting, dry  processing and hydrogen-based processing.   – Capability investments: planning to add  battery materials and mineralised carbon  sequestration testing facilities.  Accelerating the net zero transition We cannot realise a decarbonised world  without significant progress in technology  solutions. Partnering with suppliers, industry  and other organisations to reduce emissions,  as well as growing and developing new  markets, remain key components in our  decarbonisation journey. Through these  partnerships, we are switching to renewable  power, electrifying processing and, where  possible, running electric mobile fleets.  For more information about how we are working to decarbonise   the steel and aluminium value chain,   see our 2022 Climate Change Report   at riotinto.com/climatereport. For 150 years, we have been looking for  new and better ways of doing things.  This drive for continuous improvement  is at the core of our purpose, but we  cannot do it on our own. Together with  our partners, we work on inventing new  processes and technologies that can  make mining safer, more sustainable  and more efficient. Many of the challenges that lie ahead – from  decarbonising our operations to improving  productivity – will need new technologies   and approaches, some of which have not yet  been developed. Nurturing an innovative  culture will be essential to helping us meet  these challenges.  Look inside a mine of the futureTM  Autonomous drills, water carts and fuelling units are just a few examples of how innovation is  shaping our iron ore operations at Gudai-Darri in Western Australia, our most technologically  advanced mine yet. Learn more on our website about how we are partnering with global leaders in  technology to ensure Gudai-Darri remains at the pioneering edge of mining well into the future.

Speed. The energy transition will require a  herculean effort from governments, society  and industry to pull this off. An average mine  takes eight years of permitting before it can be  brought onstream. We also need to transform  our flowsheets so that the supply we bring  onstream does not have a disproportionate  social and environmental cost – the technologies  required for this still need much work. We need  to create whole supply chains to support  these efforts. We know we cannot do this alone, and we need  to bring the outside world in. This is a crucial  time to partner with universities, companies and  our competitors to create a lower carbon future  and bring in new ideas and technologies as well  as development partners to build and install  infrastructure in our operations. Who are some of these partners and what do  they specialise in? There are many examples, so I will just touch   on what we are doing with start up companies  and universities. We created a small venture  capital fund to invest in start ups, and we are  impressed with the science and technologies  being explored. Some of these concepts  sound a bit like magic, but to give you a  snapshot they involve pulling CO2 out of the air,  low-carbon cementitious products, using  biomass as a reductant, aluminium ion batteries  and using renewable power to convert water  into hydrogen. We have formed several  partnerships with universities.  Where do you see our biggest opportunity? We are researching, developing and  implementing so many new technologies to  supply the minerals we need for the energy  transition as well as reducing the carbon, waste  and water footprint of our operations. This may  result in new business streams in CO2 capture  and hydrogen, and the sale of what we once  thought of as waste, as products. Nigel, you were appointed Chief Scientist in  2021. Where do you think we need to focus  our future efforts?  Our job is to find solutions for the big  challenges across our business. These include  health and safety, ESG, carbon abatement,  productivity, and growth in critical metals  and minerals. We play an important role in  introducing new science, technology and  expertise to solve problems and identify  opportunities; accelerating delivery and  facilitating technology and R&D solutions; and  collaborating with our product groups to build  our internal skills and create an environment  where R&D can flourish. We will continue to  focus on these areas in 2023.  Through an R&D lens, what critical metals and  minerals are we focusing on for the future? Our products are critical to the energy  transition. We will need more aluminium and  copper as we electrify the world and replace  fossil fuels, and this will also drive steel growth.  Other minerals and metals will be required to  supply the emerging technologies of the  energy transition. Battery systems require  lithium and nickel; fuel cells require scandium,  cerium, zirconium and yttrium; green hydrogen  electrolyzers need iridium, ruthenium, and  titanium; flow batteries need vanadium; our 5G  phones need gallium and indium; electric  vehicles need neodymium and praseodymium;  and next generation solar panels will need  tellurium. We are focusing on resetting the  carbon footprint of today’s products; valorising  waste or extracting critical minerals in our  waste streams; and growing copper, lithium  and other battery minerals. We have already  had some success: at Kennecott we have  extracted tellurium, at Sorel-Tracy, we have  extracted scandium and we are finding more  opportunities to extract other critical minerals  and find uses for our wastes. Partnerships An interview with Nigel Steward, Chief Scientist, Rio Tinto  “This is a crucial time to partner with  universities, companies and our  competitors to create a lower carbon  future and bring in new ideas and  technologies as well as development  partners to build and install  infrastructure in our operations.” Nigel Steward Chief Scientist Some of our new initiatives and partnerships in 2022   – We have set up a new China Technology  and Innovation Centre (CTIC) to harness  China’s leading expertise in research,  technology and innovation to help   solve some of our operational and  business challenges.   – We are exploring carbon storage potential  with a team of climate innovation and  research leaders. This three-year project,  backed by the US Department of Energy’s  ARPA-E innovation challenge, will explore  new approaches to safely and permanently  store carbon as rock.   – We have become a member of the Australian  Remote Operations for Space and Earth  organisation, to support our development of  new flowsheets for critical minerals.   – We have become a member of the MIT  Future Energy Systems Initiative, the MIT  Industrial Liaison Programme, and the MIT  Regional Entrepreneurship Acceleration  Programme in Western Australia in  partnership with Woodside.   – We are partnering with BHP on new tailings  technology that could significantly increase  water recovery from mine tailings. Through our venture capital fund, we have  invested in technology and start ups to help solve  critical business challenges. These include:   – Lumo Analytics: rapid characterisation of  exploration drill core using laser induced  breakdown spectroscopy.   – TerraCO2: supplementary cementitious  materials from copper tailings to lower the  carbon dioxide emissions of cement and  concrete production.   – CarbonCapture Inc.: direct air capture  technology to remove carbon dioxide from  the atmosphere.    – Aymium: production of high quality,  low impurity BioChar to support the   net zero CO2 reduction projects for  ilmenite smelting.    – Electric Hydrogen: low-cost green  hydrogen production to decarbonise iron  and titanium smelting, alumina calcination  and steel making.   – ElectraLith: electrically-driven filtration  process to extract lithium from brine.   – NanoOne: innovative cathode materials  manufacturing for batteries in electric  vehicles and energy storage.   ===== PAGE 38 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 36 Enabling the low-carbon transition In 2022, our Iron Ore business’s absolute  greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were  3.1Mt CO2e (on an equity basis), an increase   of 0.50Mt CO2e compared to the 2018  emissions baseline. This was driven   by an increase in diesel emissions due to  increased haul distances, pre-strip ratios   and material movement.  With abundant wind and solar resources in   the Pilbara, we are developing large-scale  renewables projects to contribute to our  emissions reductions targets. For more information about our decarbonisation efforts in   the Iron Ore product group, see our   2022 Climate Change Report at   riotinto.com/climatereport.  Iron Ore We are one of the world’s leading producers of iron ore,   the primary raw material in steelmaking. In the Pilbara region  of Western Australia, we operate a network of 17 iron ore  mines, four port terminals and a rail network spanning nearly  2,000 kilometres. Steel remains essential for ongoing  urbanisation and will support the global shift to decarbonise.

Our all-injury  frequency rate (AIFR) increased to 0.68  compared to 0.67 for 2021, with the rate of  injuries in our contractor workforce decreasing.  We are committed to preventing harm to our  people. In 2022, we developed the mentally  healthy Iron Ore strategy to mature our  workplace safety culture and create an  environment where our people are both  physically and psychologically safe  and healthy. With changes in workforce dynamics, in  particular levels of experience, we examined  underlying organisational and people factors   to determine the most critical gaps to be  addressed. We made significant progress on  influencing mindsets, behaviours and the felt  experience; however, more work is underway  to strengthen the application of existing safety  systems such as critical risk management. For more information about our global health and safety initiatives,  see pages 57-58. In January 2023, a radioactive capsule was lost  after being sent offsite to Perth. The capsule  was subsequently recovered in a search  operation led by Western Australia’s  Department of Fire and Emergency Services  and supported by other agencies. The safety   of our communities, our employees, and  contractors is our main priority and we are  undertaking an investigation, with involvement  of the relevant specialist contractor, to ensure it  does not happen again. For more information see the media release on our website.   ===== PAGE 39 ===== 37 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Strategic report “Last year, we continued to  strengthen our partnerships with  local communities and Traditional  Owners, and made substantial  progress in securing the future of   our Pilbara business.” Simon Trott Chief Executive, Iron Ore Read the full interview with Simon on our website. Financial performance  We achieved a number of operational records  across the mine and rail system in the second  half of 2022, due to operational improvements  and the ramp-up of Gudai-Darri. In the year,   we safely commissioned our Pilbara projects,  despite challenging conditions with COVID-19,  labour and supply chain disruptions. The focus  now moves to the next tranche of mines  starting with Western Range.  Underlying EBITDA of $18.6 billion was  33% lower than 2021, due to lower prices  ($8.8 billion), following the 25% drop in the  monthly average Platts index for 62% iron fines  adjusted to an FOB basis. Higher sales volumes  were achieved from our portside operations in  China, which improved underlying EBITDA by  $0.6 billion. We also increased resourcing to  support the ramp-up at Gudai-Darri and  targeted investment in pit health and asset  maintenance across the Pilbara.  This additional investment, together with rising  input prices, including diesel price escalation  and labour, resulted in 2022 Pilbara unit cash  costs of $21.3 per tonne (excluding COVID-19  costs of $0.4 per tonne). This compared with  $18.6 per tonne in 2021 (excluding COVID-19  costs of $0.5 per tonne).  Our Pilbara operations delivered an underlying  FOB EBITDA margin of 68%, compared with  76% in 2021, largely due to the change in the  iron ore price. We price the majority of our iron ore sales  (77%) by reference to the average index price,  for the month of shipment. In 2022, we priced  approximately 10% of sales with reference to  the prior quarter’s average index lagged by  one month with the remainder sold either on  current quarter average, current month  average or on the spot market. We made  approximately 72% of sales including freight  and 28% on an FOB basis. We achieved an average iron ore price  of $97.6 per wet metric tonne on an FOB   basis (2021: $132.3 per wet metric tonne)  across our product suite. This equates to  $106.1 per dry metric tonne, assuming 8%  moisture (2021: $143.8 per dry metric tonne),  which compares with the monthly average  Platts index for 62% iron fines converted to   an FOB basis of $109.8 per dry metric tonne  (2021: $146.9 per dry metric tonne). The 3%  lower realised price compared to the Platts  index was due to lower average grades,  partially offset by higher premiums for  lump products.  Segmental revenue for our Pilbara operations  included freight revenue of $2.2 billion (2021:  $2.7 billion). Net cash generated from operating activities  of $14.0 billion was $5.2 billion lower than 2021,  with lower pricing partly offset by a monetisation  of working capital. Free cash flow of $11.0 billion  was $4.1 billion lower than 2021 due to the factors  above, partially offset by a $1.0 billion reduction  in capital expenditure to $2.9 billion following  completion of brownfield mine replacement  tie-in projects.  Review of operations Pilbara operations produced 324.1 million  tonnes (Rio Tinto share 272.9 million tonnes),  1% higher than 2021. Shipments of 321.6 million  tonnes (Rio Tinto share 270.8 million tonnes),  in line with 2021, included 35.5 million tonnes of  lower grade SP10 products, 11% of shipments,  on a 100% basis (2021: 11% of shipments). Performance improvements continued   across the system and we achieved a number  of operational records in the second half  across the mine and rail system. System  inventories at the end of December were  healthy, including strong blasted stocks,   mine stocks and port stocks. Our iron ore portside sales in China were  24.3 million tonnes in 2022 (14.0 million tonnes  in 2021). At the end of the December, inventory  levels were 7.8 million tonnes, including 5.5 million  tonnes of Pilbara product. In 2022, approximately  80% of our portside sales were either screened  or blended in Chinese ports. For more information about our capital projects and future growth  options, see pages 32-33.

This reduction includes  improvements in processing efficiency,  increased use of hydroelectric boilers in  refining instead of natural gas boilers, and  reduced aluminium production at the Kitimat  smelter, which continues to ramp up after a  strike in 2021. The 2022 emissions intensity of  our managed Atlantic smelters, powered by  hydroelectricity, was 2.21Mt CO2e per tonne of  aluminium. Our Vaudreuil alumina refinery has  one of the lowest carbon footprints of any  metallurgical alumina refinery in the  world today. For more information about our decarbonisation efforts in   the Aluminium product group, see our   2022 Climate Change Report at   riotinto.com/climatereport. Aluminium As a global leader in low-carbon aluminium, we are uniquely  positioned to further decarbonise our business and support the  world’s transition towards a lower-carbon footprint. A critical  material – lightweight and infinitely recyclable – aluminium is  found in diverse products ranging from solar panels to electric  vehicles and smartphones. Snapshot of the year 0.35 AIFR (2021: 0.33) 29% Underlying EBITDA  margin (integrated  operations) (2021: 38%) $3.7bn Underlying   EBITDA (2021: $4.4bn) $14.1bn Segmental   revenue (2021: $12.7bn) $1.4bn Capital  expenditure (2021: $1.3bn) $3.1bn Net cash generated  from operating  activities (2021: $3.6bn) 21.1Mt Scope 1 and 2  GHG emissions  (equity Mt CO2e) (2021: 21.7Mt) 15,000 Employee   numbers (2021: 14,000) Safety In 2022, we continued to progress in our safety  maturity journey, expanding our focus on  contractors and integrating health and  environment into the daily leadership rituals.  Our Pacific assets significantly improved their  all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) to a best-ever  of 0.27, while a difficult year at Kitimat  contributed to an AIFR in the Atlantic of 0.43,  for an overall AIFR of 0.35 in 2022 compared to  0.33 in 2021. The number of potentially fatal  incidents (PFIs) in our business remained  steady in 2022 (29), and we remain committed  to reducing these risks. The work programme  we commenced in 2021 to address overhead  crane asset maintenance continued into 2022,  and the number of PFIs relating to falling  objects has reduced by 47% compared to  2021. We will be integrating the learnings from  the 2022 safety maturity model assessments   to strengthen our front-line risk assessment  and critical risk management programme,  as well as our Safe Production System to reduce  fatality risk, prevent injuries and stabilise our  operations. The occupied building programme  helped remove over 2,000 of our workforce  from buildings with exposure to process  hazards in our business. This programme is a  significant step forward for process safety. For more information about our global health and safety initiatives,  see pages 57-58.  ===== PAGE 41 ===== 39 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Strategic report “2022 has been a year of transition  for our Aluminium business.  We sustained investment to  strengthen the health of our assets,  and announced several growth  projects including AP60, Alma’s  billet centre and early stage  expansions in recycling.” Ivan Vella Chief Executive, Aluminium Read the full interview with Ivan on our website. Financial performance  Strong pricing in the first half fell away sharply  in the second, which, together with rising  energy and raw materials costs, led to a  significant margin squeeze on our Aluminium  business and a 16% decrease in underlying  EBITDA for the year as a whole. Underlying  EBITDA margin fell nine percentage points, but  remained robust for the year at 29%. Underlying EBITDA of $3.7 billion benefited  from higher product premiums for primary  metal in addition to the stronger pricing  environment for primary metal and alumina in  the first half. However, this was offset by higher  coal prices and costs for key materials such as  caustic soda, coke, pitch and anodes, leading  to an increase in cash costs for alumina and  primary metal. We achieved an average  realised aluminium price of $3,330 per tonne,  15% higher than 2021 ($2,899 per tonne).  Average realised aluminium prices comprise  the LME price, a market premium and a  value-added product (VAP) premium.   The cash LME price averaged $2,703 per  tonne, 9% higher than 2021, while in our key   US market, the Midwest premium duty paid,  which is 57% of our volumes (2021: 55%),  increased by 12% to $655 per tonne (2021:  $584 per tonne). Our VAP sales were   stable at 50% of the primary metal we   sold (2021: 50%) and generated product  premiums averaging $431 per tonne of   VAP sold (2021: $230 per tonne). Our conversion of underlying EBITDA to cash  remained relatively strong, with net cash  generated from operating activities of  $3.1 billion and free cash flow of $1.7 billion.  Review of operations Bauxite production of 54.6 million tonnes was  1% higher than 2021, despite equipment  reliability issues at Weipa and Gove in Australia. We shipped 38.0 million tonnes of bauxite to third  parties in 2022, 1% higher than 2021. In 2022,  segmental revenue for bauxite increased 9% to  $2.4 billion this includes freight revenue of  $635 million (2021: $462 million). Alumina production of 7.5 million tonnes was  4% lower than 2021. The refineries in the  Pacific (Yarwun and Queensland Alumina  Limited) were impacted by a range of  challenges in 2022, including unplanned  outages and equipment reliability issues.  COVID-19 absenteeism impacted production  in early 2022 but eased in the second half.  Production at the Vaudreuil refinery in Quebec  remained stable. As the result of Queensland Alumina Limited's  (QAL) activation of a step-in process following  sanction measures by the Australian Government,  we have taken on 100% of capacity for as long  as the step-in continues. We are using Rusal’s  20% share of capacity under the tolling  arrangement with QAL. This additional output   is excluded from our production results as   QAL remains 80% owned by Rio Tinto and  20% owned by Rusal. Aluminium production of 3.0 million tonnes was  4% lower than 2021, due to reduced output at  our Kitimat smelter in British Columbia, Canada  and Boyne smelter in Queensland, Australia.  The rate of pot restarts at Kitimat picked   up in the fourth quarter and Boyne smelter   cell recovery efforts continued on plan.  Recovery at both smelters is progressing,   with full ramp-up expected to be completed  during the course of 2023. All of our other  aluminium smelters continued to demonstrate  stable performance.

And we were down 33% in  emissions year-on-year. The decrease in  emissions was mainly driven by the closure   of the coal-fired power plant at Kennecott in  2019, with the balance of power met by the  utility with commensurate renewable energy  certificates. Escondida also completed its  repowering in 2021, sourcing green power   for its operations. In 2022, we considered  long-term sustainable green power solutions,  and how to address emissions from diesel  haulage with ongoing trials and studies.  This has involved collaborative partnerships  with third parties. For more information about our decarbonisation efforts in   the Copper product group, see our   2022 Climate Change Report at   riotinto.com/climatereport.  Copper Copper is essential to creating a sustainable, low-carbon world.  Rapid electrification across all aspects of daily life is set to drive  long-term demand for copper. With assets spanning the globe  and an evolving suite of technologies to enable low-carbon  production, we are accelerating growth and decarbonisation   by producing the materials that enable a cleaner future.

An anticipated  decrease in by-product sales volumes  (particularly lower gold in concentrate at Oyu  Tolgoi), rising cash costs, higher energy prices  and an increase in exploration and evaluation  expenditure also impacted EBITDA in 2022.  Underlying EBITDA margin remained strong  at 49%. Our copper unit costs, at 163 cents per pound,  increased by 81 cents, largely driven by the  decline in by-product credits, together with  rising input and higher labour costs, following  the implementation of new labour laws in  Mongolia and a new five-year collective  bargaining agreement at Kennecott. We generated $1.4 billion in net cash from  operating activities, a 48% decrease on 2021,  from the same drivers as underlying EBITDA,  together with a smaller increase in working  capital compared to 2021. Negative free cash flow of $0.3 billion reflected  the significant investment of $2.0 billion in our  projects, an increase of 26% on 2021. This mainly  related to the ongoing development of the Oyu  Tolgoi underground project, underground  growth projects at Kennecott and the  Simandou iron ore project in Guinea. Review of operations Mined copper production, at 521 thousand  tonnes, was 6% higher than 2021 due to higher  grades at Kennecott and Escondida, partly  offset by lower grades and recoveries at Oyu  Tolgoi as a result of planned mine sequencing. The 4% increase in refined copper production  to 209 thousand tonnes mainly reflected a  furnace failure in 2021 at Kennecott which  resulted in the smelter being offline for the  majority of the fourth quarter of 2021.  Unplanned maintenance was required in the  fourth quarter of 2022 in our anode furnaces,  leading to extended downtime and continued  poor anode production. Oyu Tolgoi underground project A comprehensive agreement was reached with  the Government of Mongolia on 25 January  2022, resetting the relationship between the  partners, increasing the value the project  delivers for Mongolia, and allowing  underground operations to commence. In 2022, Rio Tinto and the Government of  Mongolia remained focused on supporting  Oyu Tolgoi to reach the sustainable production  milestone, and continuing progress on the  remaining measures contained in Mongolian  Parliamentary Resolution 103. At the end of 2022, a total of 19 drawbells had  been fired. Drawbell progression accelerated as  a result of improvement initiatives implemented  by the Oyu Tolgoi teams, bringing projected  first sustainable production from Panel 0 forward  to the first quarter of 2023 (previously first half  of 2023). At the end of December, shafts 3 and 4 sinking  had reached 378 metres and 507 metres below  ground level respectively. Operational safety  sinking pauses have caused some delays  against the 2022 reforecast5 to shaft sinking.  Final depths required for shafts 3 and 4 are  1,148 and 1,149 metres below ground level  respectively. Construction of conveyor-to- surface works continued with civil scope of  works completed and other contractors  mobilised to site. Study work for Panels 1 and 2, which are  required to support the ramp-up to 95,000  tonnes of ore per day, remains on track to be  completed in the first half of 2023. It will  incorporate any ventilation impacts due to the  shaft 3 and 4 delays as a result of COVID-19  restrictions and reprioritisation of the mobilised  workforce over the course of 2022. On 16 December, we completed the  acquisition of Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd  (TRQ) for consideration of approximately  $3.1 billion6, simplifying ownership of the Oyu  Tolgoi mine, significantly strengthening our  copper portfolio, and demonstrating our  long-term commitment to the project and  Mongolia. We now hold a 66% direct interest  with the remaining 34% owned by the  Government of Mongolia through Erdenes Oyu  Tolgoi. This is allowing us to focus fully on  strengthening our relationship with the  Government of Mongolia and moving the  project forward with a simpler and more  efficient ownership and governance structure.

The increase in emissions was mainly  driven by Richards Bay Minerals (RBM)  operating continuously in 2022 as opposed   to reduced production in 2021. In 2022,   we also advanced several key strategic  decarbonisation projects. For example, we  signed a 130MW solar power purchase  agreement with Voltalia at RBM in South Africa,  which would eventually deliver abatement of  more than 200kt CO2/year in 2025. We have  also partnered with the Government of Canada  in support of technological innovations at our  Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Quebec Operations  in Sorel-Tracy, such as the BlueSmeltingTM  project, a new ilmenite smelting technology  that, if fully implemented, has the potential to  deliver a reduction of up to 70% in the site’s  overall greenhouse gas emissions. For more information about our decarbonisation efforts in   the Minerals product group, see our   2022 Climate Change Report at   riotinto.com/climatereport. Minerals Our Minerals portfolio includes a global suite of businesses  producing materials essential to a low-carbon future and projects  well-positioned to meet the growing demand for electric vehicles.  We produce high-grade, low-impurity iron ore pellets and  concentrate, titanium dioxide, diamonds and borates from our  operations in Canada, Madagascar, South Africa and the US. 1.

In 2022, we saw an increase in  the number of potentially fatal incidents (PFIs)  with 19 this year, compared to 16 in 2021.  The rate of injuries remained the same, with   our all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) at 0.38.  However, we ended 2022 with a significant  increase in the AIFR of our contractor  workforce, going from 0.22 in 2021 to  0.42 in 2022. In 2023, we will continue our improvement  journey, enabled by the safety maturity model,  including health and environment, to achieve  our objectives of creating a safe and  productive workplace for our employees   and contractor partners.

For example, we’re  extracting high purity scandium  oxide from the waste streams of  titanium dioxide production, and   we continue to invest in research  and development and form key  partnerships with experts from  industry, academia and government.” Sinead Kaufman Chief Executive, Minerals Read the full interview with Sinead on our website. Financial performance  In 2022, we benefited from strong market  conditions for titanium dioxide pigment and  borates, partially offset by a weaker market for  iron ore pellets and concentrate, albeit off  record levels. We also saw higher diamond  prices compared with 2021, following a  pandemic-related build up of demand and   low inventory levels. Underlying EBITDA of $2.4 billion was 7%   lower than 2021, primarily due to inflationary  pressures, energy price increases and Rincon  evaluation costs. This was partially offset by  prices and higher EBITDA in relation to the  increased ownership in Diavik. Net cash generated from operating activities of  $1.5 billion was 6% higher than 2021, while free  cash flow of $0.8 billion was 7% higher,  reflecting a higher EBITDA cash conversion  supported by lower dividends paid to holders  of non-controlling interests at Iron Ore  Company of Canada. Review of operations Production of iron ore pellets and concentrate  at IOC was 6% higher than 2021 due to the  successful deployment of the Safe Production  System (SPS) at the concentrator, which was  completed in the year. Record performance  metrics were achieved in the year, including  monthly records for concentrate production  and total material moved in the second quarter.  Planning for SPS deployment at the pellet plant  commenced in December. Titanium dioxide production of 1.2 million  tonnes was 18% higher than 2021 due to  community disruptions at Richards Bay  Minerals (RBM) in South Africa in 2021,   and continued improved performance of  operations at Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium  Quebec Operations, Canada. Nationwide  loadshedding of electrical power caused  production constraints at RBM in late 2022. Borates production was 9% higher than 2021,  with strong production rates, higher grades  and improved equipment reliability. Our share of carats recovered was 21%   higher than 2021, from our increased share   of production since taking 100% ownership   of Diavik in November 2021, partly offset by  lower carats recovered due to lower grades.

Lithium, a material for the future The Rincon Lithium Project – a large,  undeveloped lithium-brine project  located in the heart of the “lithium  triangle” in Argentina – will be a valuable  source of rapidly produced, high-quality  lithium for the global energy transition. A long-life, scalable resource capable   of producing battery-grade lithium  carbonate from raw brine, the project will  help us deliver this vital resource to the  global energy industry while meeting our  commitment to decarbonise our  operations by 2050. With the Rincon acquisition completed  in early 2022, we are now developing a  three thousand tonne per annum lithium  carbonate starter plant. To optimise the  process and recoveries, we also  continue to produce battery-grade  lithium carbonate from raw brine from  the existing pilot plant operating at site.  We are now advancing detailed studies  for the full scale of operation and  progressing exploration activities to  further understand Rincon’s basin and  brine reservoir. We continue to engage  with communities, the province of Salta  and the Government of Argentina to  ensure an open and transparent  dialogue with stakeholders about the  works underway.

We have also successfully  proven the effectiveness of BioIronTM,   a low-carbon iron-making process using  raw sustainable biomass and microwaves. Supplier partnerships In the areas where we operate, we work hard   to partner with and develop local businesses   so they can share in our success. In 2022, we  increased our spend with Indigenous suppliers  in Australia by 40% from 2021 to A$565 million. We also actively seek partnerships with our  suppliers to reduce our own emissions.  In 2022, we have:   – Continued our partnership with Scania to  develop smaller and more agile autonomous  haul trucks. In April 2022, we launched new  trials on Scania’s 40-tonne-payload  autonomous mining trucks and quickly  reached a key milestone of driverless  operation in a simulated load and haul   cycle environment. These trucks will   require less energy and have a smaller  infrastructure footprint.    – Signed an MoU with Volvo Group to work  towards decarbonising our operations  through piloting Volvo’s sustainable  autonomous hauling solutions.   – Joined the First Movers Coalition, a global  initiative to help commercialise zero-carbon  technologies by harnessing purchasing  power and supply chains.

Safety and wellbeing In 2022, we recorded zero fatalities and a 0.14  all-injury frequency rate (AIFR), compared to 0.07  for 2021. As we continue to navigate COVID-19  impacts, we have maintained our strong focus on  critical risk management and prevention  programmes across areas of greatest exposure.  We continue to work on our safety performance  within our maritime fleet of 17 owned, and more  than 230 contracted, vessels. Although we had no  fatalities on our managed operations in 2022,  tragically, there was a fatality on one of the  non-managed marine vessels and, in a separate  incident, another mariner suffered a permanent  disabling injury. We are determined to improve  maritime safety for our industry and we are  working closely with our shipping partners,  industry associations and other mining companies. Customer partnerships In our mission to find better ways to provide the  materials the world needs, we partner with  customers to work towards our shared goal of  enabling the world’s transition to a low-carbon  future. In 2022, some initiatives included:    – Signing a separate memorandum of  understanding (MoU) with both the Ford  Motor Company and Volvo Group, each   of which leverages our advantage as a  one-stop multi-commodity supplier for  sustainable products and solutions in the  low-carbon transition. Ford will also explore  becoming the foundational customer for our  Rincon Lithium Project in Argentina to  support its production of electric vehicles.   – Strengthening our low-carbon product  offering with aluminium produced by ELYSISTM  emissions-free smelting technology, used   by Apple (in their iPhone SE), and Corona  Canada (in Canada’s first specially marked,  low-carbon aluminium cans).   – Leveraging STARTTM, our blockchain  technology, to provide over 110 customers  with 14 key ESG metrics.

Meanwhile, a combination of  price-related and other external factors reduced  overall seaborne supply. These included  small-scale, high-cost producers who  discontinued operations when prices declined  below break-even points; supply disruptions  due to the war in Ukraine; and India’s decision  to impose export tariffs on iron ore. Despite the  introduction of a range of supportive policies  and growth targets, China’s domestic iron ore  production also declined year-on-year in 2022  following a number of safety accidents and the  imposition of operating restrictions. Aluminium  The aluminium price rose in the first quarter   of 2022 to a multi-year high, on expectations   of stronger demand outlook and Russian  aluminium supply cuts, both of which  eventually did not materialise. The price then  fell to its low point in the third quarter as fears   of a global economic slowdown set in, and  Chinese aluminium production rose on restarts  and commissioning of new capacity. Chinese  aluminium domestic demand also weakened  due to COVID-19 restrictions, especially in the  building and construction sector. However, the  aluminium price stabilised in the fourth quarter  as a result of a high level of smelter curtailments  in Europe given high energy costs, and  curtailments in Southern China given drought  conditions and low hydropower levels.  Global aluminium inventories remained low   and the market deficit provided support to the  aluminium price. Elevated carbon raw material  and energy prices resulted in the industry  facing a significant margin squeeze in the  second half of 2022. Copper  After a record quarterly average price was  reached in the first quarter of 2022, copper  prices trended down from late April, as a wave  of uncertainty surrounding the global economy  and China’s COVID-zero policy weighed on  the prospects for copper demand. The average  price in the third quarter was the lowest  quarterly average since the fourth quarter   of 2020. Global visible copper cathode  inventories fell to multi-year lows, providing  support to prices. Mine supply growth, while remaining positive,  stalled in 2022 due to issues such as water  availability, geological and geotechnical  challenges, and slower project ramp-ups  contributing to a higher level of disruptions to  production. Mine supply growth is expected to  return over the 2023 to 2024 period, as  committed projects get underway after  earlier delays. “Commercial is the key interface  between our assets and the markets,  our customers and suppliers. Our  mission is to generate insights and  opportunities to unlock Rio Tinto’s  full commercial potential across our  value chains and future growth  opportunities. We will always strive  to find better ways to serve our  customers and provide the materials  the world needs.”  Alf Barrios Chief Commercial Officer Read the full interview with Alf on our website. Marine and logistics To deliver our climate commitments on  shipping, we are focusing on improving fuel  efficiency, increasing the use of transitional  fuels and partnering to develop end-state fuels.  In 2021, we committed to reduce our CO2  emissions intensity in shipping by 40% by  2025, five years ahead of the International  Maritime Organisation (IMO) deadline. To date,  we have achieved a 30% intensity reduction in  conventional fuel use from an IMO 2008  baseline through operational and technical  measures such as weather routing, schedule  optimisation and vessel modifications.  We have a year-long biofuel trial underway   and we recently received the first of nine  dual-fuelled liquified natural gas-powered  vessels that we are introducing into our fleet.  We continue to support new technologies   and industry collaborations that will contribute  to the industry’s low-carbon transition,  including through our strategic partnerships  with the Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Center for  Zero Carbon Shipping and the Global  Maritime Forum.

Commercial insight  and outlook Economic growth and commodity demand  started positively in 2022 as the world  continued its recovery from the pandemic  downturn. However, the large supply shock  brought about by the war in Ukraine led to  energy security concerns and exacerbated  inflationary pressures, while a resurgence of  COVID-19 lockdowns and outbreak in China  affected business activities and consumer  confidence. High inflation prompted many  countries, led by the US, to aggressively tighten  monetary policy to re-establish price stability.  These risks are carried over to 2023, and the  global economy is expected to slow further.  China’s economic recovery from COVID-19  remains volatile, while the Chinese Government  provides support to stabilise the economy,  especially in the infrastructure and real  estate sectors. Iron ore  Following three consecutive years of growth   to a 2021 all-time high, iron ore demand  simultaneously contracted in China and the  rest of the world for the first time since the  beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The  Chinese property market slump continued to  worsen, while extended COVID-19 restrictions  impacted China’s steel demand, exerting  downward pressure on prices. There were also  headwinds to ex-China iron ore demand,  which was negatively impacted by sharply  higher energy and raw materials costs to steel  producers. Iron ore prices were more resilient  and market fundamentals tighter than  consensus expectations because the demand  weakness was offset, and at times outweighed,  by even lower supply. Minerals There was low demand growth for titanium  dioxide (TiO2) pigment in 2022 as weakness in  China and the EU was only partially offset by  growth in North America. Nevertheless, prices  were supported by tight global high-grade  supply. Inventories remained low in 2022 but  are expected to grow in 2023. Structural  factors relating to orebody depletion remain  favourable for high-grade TiO2 feedstock and  zircon markets.  Lithium prices remained elevated on strong  demand. The electric vehicle market continues  to experience strong growth, supported by  government policies. There was strong buying activity for borates in  2022 due to persistent supply tightness, resulting  in prices closing the year at a decade high.  In diamonds, prices started 2022 with strong  growth but have cooled amid weakening  demand. Global diamond supply remains  stable, which is resulting in some inventory  accumulation through the supply chain.  ===== PAGE 48 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 46 46 Our approach  to sustainability  For 150 years, we have been  entrusted with accessing the  world’s essential materials and  making them available for  society’s use.  These resources are finite, and as temporary  custodians of the land where we operate, we  have a responsibility to extract the full value  from the minerals and materials we produce in  the safest and most sustainable way possible.  Our approach to sustainability is guided by our  purpose: finding better ways to provide the  materials the world needs. Our shareholders,  employees and host governments expect us to  find ways to lower our impact, decarbonise our  operations and increase circularity, while  contributing to a positive legacy for the host  communities and countries where we operate. And we have a big role to play in the world’s  transition to a low-carbon future – the materials  we produce are essential in many low-carbon  technologies. It means we must deliver our own  decarbonisation, alongside investing in  research and development that enables our  customers to decarbonise more quickly.  We know that responsibly managing our  business impacts is fundamental if we want to  continue to grow and deliver on our strategy.  Two of our core objectives in our strategy  relate to strengthening our social licence and  achieving impeccable environmental, social  and governance (ESG) credentials. As part of  these commitments, we align our business  priorities with society’s expectations and  ensure sustainability considerations are at the  core of every decision we make.  To meet our goals, we are focusing on  developing the right mindset and culture,  encouraging our people to work together to  find new solutions and building partnerships  with those who share our ambition for a more  sustainable future.

Our sustainability framework focuses on the two lead goals that we feel  are most relevant to operating our business responsibly and where we  can have the biggest impact: responsible consumption and production  (SDG 12) and decent work and economic growth (SDG 8). Our business operations also contribute to eight supporting SDGs (3, 4,  5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 15), while partnerships for the goals (SDG 17) reflects our  approach to sustainability and is fundamental to the way we run  our business.  For more information about our approach to the UN SDGs, see our website.   ===== PAGE 50 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 48 Materiality to Rio Tinto Materiality to stakeholders Lower materiality Medium materiality Higher materiality Respecting  human rights Climate  change Cultural &  heritage site  management Health, safety &  wellbeing Inclusion, diversity & equality ESG transparency & disclosure Water management Business  Business performance integrity &  governance Local  community  relations Tailings & mineral waste management Biodiversity & ecosystems Closure, post-mining & land rehabilitation Pandemic response & public health  Employment & talent retention Supply chain transparency Impact of technology End-to-end materials management Responsible tax & royalty payments Risk management & cyber security Future-proof assets Industrial environment impacts How we report on sustainability  We want to ensure all our stakeholders benefit from the  success of our business. To do this, our priorities and  performance must align with society’s expectations, which  are constantly evolving. So each year we complete a  sustainability materiality assessment to understand which  issues and topics matter most to, and have the greatest  impact on, our stakeholders and our business. We gather information on sustainability topics and their impact from  internal and external stakeholders and employees via interviews, surveys,  and reviews of publicly available materials. We ask them what is  important now, and what they think will be important in five to ten years.  The insights we gather through this process also guide our approach to  sustainability and how we report externally.  What is important now  Our internal and external stakeholders are broadly aligned on the four  most important sustainability topics. Climate change is the most  important issue and includes concerns about emissions reduction and  how resilient and adaptable our business is to cope with climate-induced  change. Respecting human rights; cultural and heritage site  management; and health, safety and wellbeing are other highly material  topics. For our business, the safety and wellbeing of our people remains  our highest priority (see page 57). Business integrity, governance, and  local community relations are important topics as we continue to build  trusting relationships with our partners, employees and host countries. What will be important in the future  Our internal and external stakeholders feel that climate change will only  continue to increase in importance over the next decade, as will  geopolitical uncertainty, the impact of technology, respecting human  rights, business integrity and governance, supply chain transparency and  end-to-end materials management. Other emerging critical topics  include water management due to the reliance of local communities and  mining operations on an increasingly scarce resource, and biodiversity  due to the increasing impacts of climate change. Managing all these well  will be integral to our social licence to operate. Reporting our performance Our sustainability materiality assessment records the threshold at which  an issue or topic becomes important enough for us to report on  externally. The importance of a topic is based on the significance of its  impact on stakeholders. A sustainability materiality assessment differs  from financial materiality, which may use financial metrics or other  quantitative analyses to determine what would be considered a  significant or material impact. As a member of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM),  we commit to reporting on our sustainability performance against Global  Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards and implementing the ICMM  Performance Expectations (PEs).  The ICMM Mining Principles framework focuses on the implementation  of systems and practices related to a broad range of sustainability areas.  In line with the ICMM’s requirements, all 29 Rio Tinto managed operating  and refining assets completed an ICMM PEs self-assessment before  30 September 2022. A self-assessment was also completed for Rio Tinto  Corporate. These assets met the requirements in the areas of ethical  business practice, decision making and stakeholder engagement.   ===== PAGE 51 ===== 49 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Strategic report How we report Annual  Report Climate Change  reports1 CSP   Report2 Tax   reports3 Human Rights  reports4 Sustainability Fact  Book Linking sustainability to purpose and strategy Materiality and material topics Climate change Economic contribution Human rights Indigenous peoples Memberships and certifications Sustainability data and trends 1.

We take a “site-centric” view of the definition of local, which allows operations to establish their own definition, based on a set of common principles. These principles require that each operation, in  defining “local” takes into consideration its geographic, social and economic area of impact as well as ownership. For example, suppliers located within the Pilbara Region of Western Australia are defined  as “local” for Rio Tinto Iron Ore’s Pilbara Operations. This approach is consistent with international best practice and aligns with the ICMM Social and Economic Reporting Framework guidance.  2. Women % increase is 1.37% rounded to 1.4%.  ===== PAGE 54 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 52 People and society Our operations can have far-reaching impacts on society.  We work hard to avoid or minimise adverse impacts and seek to  understand, and invest in, the diverse knowledge, cultures and  resources that exist in areas where we operate. Our ambition is to  contribute to positive and enduring outcomes for our workforce  and the countries and communities where we operate. In 2022, we continued to progress on our objectives to achieve  impeccable ESG credentials and strengthen our social licence.  Among other initiatives, we focused on becoming a better partner  to our host communities, enhancing our safety maturity model, and  beginning to implement the Everyday Respect recommendations. Simandou community project. Conakry, Guinea.  ===== PAGE 55 ===== 53 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Strategic report Community engagement and social investment  Communities and social performance targets In 2022 we finalised a new suite of CSP targets, following the end of our previous target reporting period (2016-2021). The new targets will help us  monitor progress towards the core objectives of our CSP Group strategy. We have transitioned from having individually set and defined local asset  targets to common global targets, which will allow us to see progress across the Group as well as for individual assets. Our assets will continue to  maintain local targets and metrics, developed in consultation with local communities, in addition to the global targets. Reporting will evolve over the next  12 months. Communities and social performance targets 2022-2026 Reporting status By 2026, all sites to co-manage cultural heritage with communities and  knowledge holders. Progress will be evaluated through a co-management maturity  assessment currently in development for reporting from 2023.

By 2024, 100% of employees in high human rights risk roles to complete yearly  job-specific and general human rights training. By 2026, 100% of employees to complete yearly general human rights training.  Progressive reporting with 2022 focus on training development  and role mapping. Effective communities and social performance  (CSP) is fundamental to our business. Without  the support of the communities where we live  and work, we cannot operate. We aim to  contribute to a shared future and positive  legacy by developing lasting relationships with  people, learning about and supporting their  goals and aspirations, avoiding or mitigating  adverse impacts, and respecting different  cultures and connections to lands and waters.  We are finding better ways to work with  communities and Indigenous peoples,  particularly in how we protect heritage. We are  moving to a model of co-management of land  and waters, and we are updating our  agreements to deliver more enduring  socioeconomic, heritage and environmental  outcomes. This, in turn, delivers greater  certainty for mine development. Our CSP teams span our entire business and  work in partnership with communities to  understand how the work we do affects their  lives, culture and heritage. By doing so,   we can optimise benefits and reduce negative  impacts, both for local communities and   our business. Our teams include people who  have a range of expertise, from archaeologists,  anthropologists, social scientists and economic  development experts to human rights  specialists and operational leaders. While these  teams lead our technical activities, our social  licence is the responsibility of all employees.  Everyone has a role to play in our engagement  with, and contribution to, host communities and  society more broadly. Our CSP and site teams are also starting to  work with Indigenous communities to explore  opportunities for them to participate in   our climate initiatives.  For more information about our climate initiatives, see our  2022 Climate Change Report at   riotinto.com/climatereport.  2022 progress Strengthening social performance  We continue to strengthen our social  performance governance, capacity and  capability. In 2022, we launched our revised  Communities and Social Performance Standard.  It applies to all managed operations globally and  will help us work thoughtfully, responsibly and  transparently. It provides clear direction on what  success looks like and the minimum standard  expected across our global operations.  In 2022, we also launched the 2022 to 2027  Group CSP vision, goal and strategic framework,  which will guide our activities over the next five  years and help improve our performance. Our  CSP vision is to respect and enable communities  to realise their goals and aspirations and create  long-term shared benefits. We continue to build internal capability and  collaboration across our teams working in CSP,  Indigenous Affairs and Cultural Heritage.  In 2022, we held two global conferences in  Brisbane and Montreal for more than 260 CSP  employees to explore complex technical issues  and share good practice and learnings. These  conferences also offered the opportunity to  engage with civil society organisations,  investors and academia on emerging CSP  trends and practice. As we evolve our approach  to co-design and co-management, we continue  to listen to the wealth of knowledge that resides  both inside and outside our business.  QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM) In 2022, QMM worked together with national  and local authorities, representatives of the  communities and Traditional Owners to address  complaints raised by members of the local  communities through a grievance management  process. Throughout the year, the parties  continued to work together to find equitable and  sustainable solutions and we will continue to  work closely with the community on these  issues in 2023. Despite the challenges at QMM,  we are implementing initiatives to strengthen  our collaboration with the community.  One example is our village nursery project,  which generates income for the community that  is supporting the rehabilitation of the area  surrounding the Mandena mine. In 2022, QMM  invested over $550,000 to support rehabilitation  activities, producing 300 tonnes of compost  and providing 1,500,000 seedlings used for  commercial tree planting, ecological restoration,  greening of the area around Mandena and an  offset plantation near the future mining lease in  Ambatoatsinana. Community associations are  the input suppliers, and some community  members are also employed. More than 400  households have benefited from QMM’s  rehabilitation activities. In addition, QMM will  increase its spending on its Corporate Social  Responsibility Policy over the next three years  to implement development projects in full  collaboration with the communities and for the  benefit of all local community members. Resolution Copper project, Arizona, US At our Resolution Copper project in Arizona,   we continue to strengthen relationships with  local communities and Native American   tribes by deepening our engagement and  partnership support.  We recognise the enduring historical  connection Native American tribes have with  the land at, or near, the proposed mine and   we have partnered with the Tonto National  Forest Service and Native American tribes to  develop a programme to train tribal members   in archaeological surveys and to help us   identify sites of special significance to tribes.  For more information, see resolutioncopper.com  The project is going through comprehensive  and independent social and environmental  regulatory reviews. The US Forest Service  (USFS) published the Final Environmental  Impact Statement (FEIS) in January 2021.  In March 2021, the US Department of  Agriculture (USDA) directed the USFS to   retract the FEIS, which allowed the agency to  undertake further review and consultation.  ===== PAGE 56 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 54 Simandou project, Guinea At our Simandou iron ore project in Guinea,  we are working with communities to help them  prepare for construction and future operations  by identifying and managing our impacts, and  designing and delivering local social investment  and regional economic development  programmes. In addition to implementing  environmental and social impact mitigation  measures, our teams are working with local  communities to enhance social infrastructure,  deliver livelihood restoration initiatives and  build community resilience.  Recognising the cumulative impacts that will  occur as a result of the development of  Simandou, we are also working with our  infrastructure and joint venture partners to  ensure the consistent application of  internationally recognised environmental and  social performance standards across the entire  project footprint. We are also working towards  raising local capacities to maximise local content.  Engaging with local entrepreneurs and investing  in training and development of local capacities is  key to optimise benefits to our host communities.  Oyu Tolgoi, Mongolia We focus on long-term sustainable  development in Mongolia, increasing  transparency in our business processes and  building trust with local communities through  community investment and local employment.  In 2022, local employment at Oyu Tolgoi  increased by 25% from January to September  as a result of a comprehensive recruitment  process and local talent development. Since 2015, Oyu Tolgoi has made a yearly  contribution of $5 million to a Development  Support Fund (DSF) – administered jointly by  Oyu Tolgoi and the community – for community  programmes and projects in the Umnugovi  aimag. In 2022, after reaching $38.9 million,  the fund invested in constructing a community  school, a kindergarten, and a health care centre,  increasing accessibility to quality educational  and healthcare services for community members  and creating more than 480 permanent jobs.  The DSF also funded the Gobi History and  Nature Museum, which opened in May 2022.  It has already benefitted tourism in the region  by attracting more than 28,000 people, and it is  playing an important role in protecting and  promoting Mongolian cultural heritage.  We continue to engage with local communities  through the Khanbogd Tripartite Council (TPC).  In 2022, we focused on herder sustainable  livelihood, student scholarships and  pastureland water access.  Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinée SA  (CBG), Guinea CBG is a bauxite operation in Guinea owned   by Halco Mining Inc. (51%) and the Guinean  Government (49%). Halco is a consortium  comprised of Rio Tinto (45%), Alcoa (45%)   and Dadco Investments (10%). Rio Tinto  participates on the boards of Halco and CBG,  with representation on various shareholder  oversight committees. Through our Board   and committee roles, we monitor and support  CBG’s approach to environmental protection,  community issues and human rights. We are  aware of the concerns regarding access to  land and water, and the pace of livelihood  restoration programmes as well as concerns  regarding CBG’s stakeholder engagement.  In 2022, sustainability advisory committees at  Halco and CBG levels met regularly, strengthening  our oversight and providing support to CBG for  the improvement of CBG’s social and  environmental practices, including for the  development of an ongoing human rights due  diligence process. Both the Halco and CBG  advisory committees are closely following CBG’s  response to a complaint made to the International  Finance Corporation’s (IFC) Office of the  Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO).  The mediation process facilitated by the CAO  has conducted seven sessions in 2022 and  through a collaborative approach the parties  made important progress towards an agreement  on the improvement of community access to  water. Halco continues to participate in the  mediation process as an observer, alongside  the IFC. Panguna mine, Bougainville,  Papua New Guinea The Panguna mine was operated by Bougainville  Copper Limited (BCL), majority-owned by Rio  Tinto, for 17 years from 1972 until 1989, when  operations were suspended due to a civil war,  which lasted until 1998. In 2016, Rio Tinto  transferred its 53.83% majority shareholding  in BCL to the Autonomous Bougainville  Government (ABG) and the Papua New Guinea  (PNG) Government for no consideration,  enabling the ABG and PNG to hold an  equal share in BCL of 36.4% each. In September 2020, the Human Rights Law  Centre (HRLC) filed a complaint against Rio Tinto  on behalf of 156 Bougainville residents with the  Australian National Contact Point (AusNCP)  regarding the Panguna site.  In 2021, as an outcome of the AusNCP  engagement, a joint committee of stakeholders,  the Panguna Mine Legacy Impact Assessment  Committee, was formed to oversee a detailed  independent assessment of the Panguna  mine to identify and better understand the  environmental and human rights impacts  of the mine. The Committee is chaired by an  independent facilitator with representatives  from the ABG, the Independent State of PNG,  clan leaders and landowners, local communities,  Rio Tinto, BCL and HRLC. It has met regularly  since its formation. In 2021, the Committee commissioned the  Panguna Mine Preparatory Phase Report  to inform priority areas for the Impact  Assessment. Completed in 2022, the report  identified risks of potential failure of the levee at  the former Main/Pump station, and potential  flooding events along the Kawerong and Jaba  river. On behalf of the ABG, Tetra Tech Coffey  completed on-the-ground investigations in  October 2022 and will present findings to the  ABG who will determine next steps.  In 2022, the Committee selected and endorsed  Tetra Tech Coffey to complete phase 1 of the  independent environmental, social and human  rights Legacy Impact Assessment. The Legacy  Impact Assessment began in December 2022  and will provide all parties with a clearer  understanding of the impacts, so that together  we can consider the best way forward.  Jadar lithium-borates project, Serbia We continue to believe that the Jadar lithium- borates project in Serbia can contribute to  enhancing the electric vehicle supply chain  ecosystem in Serbia. We continue to explore  options with all stakeholders on how to progress  this world-class opportunity to the highest  environmental standards.  Group-wide COVID-19 fund In 2021, we committed $25 million to help the  communities where we live and work respond to  the pandemic. Our assets led the implementation  of the fund, supporting grassroots communities  across three pillars: response, recovery, and  resilience. The remaining funds were allocated in  April 2022 to support communities in Madagascar,  Mongolia, Serbia and South Africa. More  information is available on our website. Social contribution Supporting economic opportunities for our host  communities and regions is a key priority for us  and we strive to employ local people, buy local  products and engage local services. In 2022, our  total voluntary global social investment was  $62.6 million, covering a wide range of social and  economic programmes. In 2022, we spent  $2.7 billion with suppliers local to our operations,  which is 14.5% of our total contestable spend.  88 Indigenous rangers  across 12 Pilbara Traditional Owner groups will be  supported to deliver cultural land management, through  our contribution of A$11.8 million over five years towards  Ranger Programs.  Humanitarian support through $5 million donated to humanitarian efforts in  Ukraine. We also contributed A$271,530 through our  global employee appeal. Residents of 10 towns  in the Shire of Ashburton and City of Karratha in the  Pilbara region of Western Australia will realise improved  social outcomes over the next ten years through our  A$75 million contribution.  Indigenous history will be preserved through a two-year archaeological  partnership with the Cheslatta Carrier Nation in Canada,  to better understand the history of Indigenous  communities and human migrations. 1,000 people  in remote rural communities will have access to mobile  health care for the first time, through our contribution of  $375,000 to Clinic Mobile des Oubliés, a Guinean social  enterprise. 550,000+ students  in elementary and high schools in Quebec will have  access to a free homework helpline and learning website  through our contribution of C$1 million over three years. Culturally safe care for mothers and children will be made available to First  Nations and Inuit patients and families at Sainte-Justine  through our C$500,000 donation. People and society continued  ===== PAGE 57 ===== 55 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Strategic report Update on our  communities and social  performance commitments In October 2022, we released our final standalone  report on our progress on the commitments we  made after the tragic destruction of the rock  shelters at Juukan Gorge. Significant updates  since this report are summarised below under  three areas of interest: relationships, governance  and process, and leadership and inclusion. For more information see our 2022 Communities and   Social Performance Commitments   Disclosure Report on our website. In 2023, we will repeat the feedback process  with Traditional Owners in the Pilbara. This will  provide a three-year longitudinal perspective  on our relationships. In parallel, we will  undertake a project to design and pilot a  community feedback process for host  communities where we operate globally. Relationships We have changed the way we engage with  Indigenous communities. We are progressively  working more closely in partnership with  Indigenous peoples across our operations to  preserve and protect cultural heritage. We are  moving to a model of co-management to  ensure Indigenous voices are heard as part of  our decision making.  Remedy agreement with the Puutu Kunti  Kurrama and Pinikura Aboriginal Corporation In November 2022, we agreed with the Puutu  Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura Aboriginal  Corporation to create the Juukan Gorge Legacy  Foundation as part of a remedy agreement  relating to the destruction of the rock shelters at  Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara region of Western  Australia in May 2020. Financial support will   be provided to the Traditional Owner-led  foundation to progress major cultural and   social projects, including a new keeping place  for storing important cultural materials. The  agreement forms part of our commitment to  remedy and rebuild the relationship with the  Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people.  For more information see our website. Updated agreement with the Yindjibarndi people  As part of our commitment to modernise our  relationships with Traditional Owners, in  November 2022, we signed an updated  agreement with Yindjibarndi Aboriginal  Corporation. The agreement aims to provide  better social and economic outcomes for future  generations and reflects our commitment to  create opportunities for Yindjibarndi people to  participate in our operations. The agreement  also includes support for Yindjibarndi Aboriginal  Corporation to develop community, commercial  and cultural projects and programmes to fulfil its  aspirations of self-determination.  For more information see our website. Pilbara Cultural Land Management project As part of our A$11.8 million investment over five  years into Ranger programs in Western Australia,  we announced a partnership with the Pilbara  Cultural Land Management Project (PCLMP) in  October 2022. The PCLMP will enable 12 Pilbara  Traditional Owner groups to take part in training  programmes to help develop tools that support  cultural, heritage and environmental mapping,  monitoring and management. The project will  provide greater employment opportunities and  ongoing social and cultural benefits. For more  information, see our website. We are also investing in developing and  diversifying individual Ranger Programs across  the Pilbara, partnering with Murujuga  Aboriginal Corporation, Karlka Nyiyaparli  Aboriginal Corporation and Yindjibarndi  Aboriginal Corporation. The Aboriginal-led  Ranger Programs provide connection to  culture, opportunities for healing and  strengthening families, and holistic support  to achieve generational change. Working with Indigenous communities  in Canada We continue to collaborate with Indigenous  groups in Canada to implement agreements.  We have 11 active long-term impact benefits/  participation agreements, and three potential  agreements are in discussion. Our agreements  include areas such as training and employment  procurement, land and water management,  joint environmental monitoring and community  investment. We are also working in partnership  with Indigenous communities to look at how we  protect and preserve cultural heritage.  At our Diavik Diamond Mine in the Northwest  Territories, we are working with Indigenous  partners to develop criteria for water quality to  ensure that water is healthy and safe from a  western science perspective and from a  traditional cultural use perspective. This initiative  values both western science and traditional  knowledge and it will be evaluated equally by  the Wek’èezhìi Land and Water Board and the  regulator. It is part of a co-management  regulatory regime to ensure future traditional  use of the local land and water. In the northern  part of British Columbia, we have announced a  significant archaeological research project  together with the Cheslatta Carrier Nation.  The project will excavate sites of remarkable  cultural and historical significance that could  date back more than 10,000 years.

This agreement – named Kuessilueu,  which means “the wind is turning” in Nelueun – is  the start of a collaborative process that will bring  Pekuakamiulnuatsh and Rio Tinto representatives  together in a co-designed approach to identify  priorities and recommendations on governance,  jobs and training, business opportunities, cultural  heritage, environment, partnerships, and energy  transition. The agreement will involve a large  group of people and aims to create a movement,  with each participant becoming an agent   of change in their respective area. As part of  this agreement, an Indigenous awareness  programme will be launched for our employees  in the region. Governance and process During 2022, we continued to revise our  standards, systems and processes to ensure  we are working responsibly to avoid and  minimise impacts and risks to our operations,  people and communities.  Australian Advisory Group We have established an Australian Advisory  Group (AAG) to provide guidance on current  and emerging issues, and better manage  policies and positions that are important to   both Australian communities and our broader  business. The group continues to refine   its scope and procedures for providing  high-quality advice to the Chief Executive  Australia and the Executive Committee.  Our cultural heritage risks  We have now operationalised the set of  controls that manage our cultural heritage risks,  with an emphasis placed on understanding the  control performance at a local level. Our global  Communities and Social Performance Area of  Expertise continues to provide subject matter  advice and support to our assets to strengthen  the risk assessment processes across  our business. Independent cultural heritage  management audit In 2020, we engaged Environmental Resources  Management (ERM) to undertake an independent  cultural heritage management audit across   all our sites. Phase one of the audit was  completed in mid-2022 and focused  on 20 audits across our Australian assets.  Field work for phase two was completed in  December 2022 and focused on 17 audits  across our non-Australian operations.  Phase one of the audit found that the changes  introduced over the past two years have  improved on-ground management. For example,  a number of assets globally are progressing  projects with community partners to document  intangible cultural heritage values. This includes  methodologies such as constellation mapping  and training on new methods for recording oral  histories. The report identified four areas for  improvement: managing water as a cultural  resource, managing artefacts, integrating data,  and continuing to build our team of experienced  cultural heritage practitioners.  A summary of audit findings from phase   one and two will be released at the end   of the first quarter in 2023. Based on the  recommendations, we will then work on a  response plan in consultation with our cultural  heritage teams and cultural heritage  knowledge and rights holders. Leadership and inclusion We are evolving our culture to encourage a  mindset and behavioural shift at all levels of   our organisation. We have a programme of  work in progress that focuses on advancing  respect for the peoples and cultures on   whose land we live and work, which links  closely to the work we are doing as part of   the Everyday Respect initiative. We continue to increase the number of  Indigenous leaders in our business and  develop our cultural competency. Reducing  the barriers for Indigenous employees in our  business and increasing cultural intelligence  will help us become a better operator and a  more inclusive workplace.  For more information see page 59. In October 2022, we launched an internal  protocol for the use of Indigenous cultural  and intellectual property in Australia to ensure  we follow appropriate processes when  commissioning or reproducing Indigenous  design or artwork within our business and  engaging in Indigenous art and design  projects. This will continue to be rolled out  throughout 2023.  Truth and reconciliation in Canada We continue to create learning opportunities  for our people in Canada to raise awareness  about the history, culture and rights of  Indigenous peoples. During National  Indigenous History Month, we held a series  of events focusing specifically on Indigenous  women. In September, we celebrated National  Truth and Reconciliation Day and hosted  a panel focusing on tangible ways to promote  reconciliation and create a more inclusive and  culturally safe work environment. Addressing employment barriers in Canada In addition to raising awareness, we have been  focusing on identifying and addressing some  of the recruitment opportunities and barriers for  Indigenous peoples, and particularly Innu First  Nations candidates. We prioritised eastern  Canada in 2022 and took a number of actions.  We established employment and training  committees in partnership with Indigenous job  placement agencies and we revised our  recruitment process, including hiring criteria,  pre-employment checks and verification  processes. These changes resulted in 31 new  Indigenous hires. Indigenous participation In 2021, our Iron Ore product group developed  an Indigenous participation strategy to attract  and develop Indigenous employees and  promote a culturally safe working environment.  Throughout 2022, we continued to make  significant progress. We have:   – Enhanced our recruitment processes.   – Updated our employment programme to  remove obstacles to employment and  provide training and development  opportunities for Indigenous peoples.   – Delivered a training programme to   increase the cultural knowledge of   non-Indigenous employees.    – Implemented an Indigenous participation  dashboard to ensure leaders are   enabled to make informed choices on  improvement initiatives.   – Enhanced our Indigenous Talent Review  programme, which in 2022 saw 23  participants from a cohort of 151 promoted  to roles of Supervisor or above.

Nothing is more  important than the safety and wellbeing of our  employees, contractors and communities. 2022 progress We have now exceeded four years without a  fatality. Although this is an important milestone,  it is not one we take for granted. While we  recognise the commitment made by all our  employees and contractors to make us a safer  company, we continue to believe all incidents  and injuries are preventable and focus on  identifying, managing and, where possible,  eliminating risks. Although we had no fatalities on our managed  sites in 2022, we are saddened by the loss of  a mariner on board a non-managed chartered  vessel, and a permanent disabling injury  suffered by another mariner in a separate  incident, also on a non-managed chartered  vessel. We remain determined to improve  maritime safety for our industry through a  multi-year programme to identify, manage and  eliminate risks in the marine supply chain.  We continue to see serious incidents at   our own operations. Our main risks relate to  falling objects, fall from height, and vehicles  and driving.  Our all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) remained  stable at 0.40, compared to 2021. We continue  to see a disparity between the number of  injuries among employees and contractors, so  we remain focused on including contractors in  our safety culture.  Critical risk management (CRM) remains our  primary fatality elimination tool by helping  ensure that critical controls are in place and  working where there is a fatal risk. In the last  year, we continued to simplify our critical risk  content, particularly for risks of rail impact or  collision, mooring and drowning.  To address risks related to vehicles and driving,  in late 2021 we made significant changes to the  Group procedure for mass transportation, a  component of our vehicles and driving Group  standard. These changes included the  mandatory implementation of in-vehicle  monitoring systems, and fatigue and distraction  technology in all buses we operate, as well as  increased safety feature requirements for  vehicles purchased after January 2022. To  tackle risks associated with falling objects, in  the last year we also worked to improve the  asset integrity of overhead cranes across  our operations.  In 2023, we will re-focus our attention on CRM  to address the frequency of potentially fatal  incidents (PFIs) across all critical risks. We will  work to enhance the quality and impact of  verifications – used for checking that the right  critical controls are in place for each task – and  we will use the data we collect to understand  early trends, so that we can intervene before  incidents occur.  Across our business, our commitment remains on  advancing our safety culture. The safety maturity  model (SMM), introduced in 2019, was enhanced  in 2022 to provide our leaders and their teams  with clear guidance on managing health and  environment risks, as well as on integrating  contractors in a way that helps keep them safe.  We also directed our efforts towards better  understanding the felt experience of our  workforce and the effectiveness of safety rituals.  To help leaders understand and apply the SMM  enhancements, we ran a series of “teach-in”  sessions covering the key changes, including  maturity indicators (systems, symbols, behaviours  and felt experience), the importance of mindsets  in supporting behaviour and culture change,  and the critical steps in the assessment  process, including scoring. We also evolved  our assessor training programme to reflect  these enhancements, as well as to improve  assessors’ understanding of the model and  consistency in its application.  As a result of the enhancements we introduced to  the SMM, we also stepped up the requirements  for what defines each level of safety maturity  across our business. With the inclusion of  health, environment and contractors, we have  reset our expectations on how to lead for both  physical and psychological safety, while also  caring for the environment.  Although we know this will be a multi-year  journey, we are encouraged by the results of  the 2022 assessments, which deepened our  understanding of the safety culture at each site.  In addition, feedback received from site teams  confirmed that the assessments provided  actionable insight into where to focus to  become a safer workplace.  Mental health and wellbeing Mental health is a core part of our safety  culture. We have a responsibility to support  the wellbeing of our people, beyond the  traditional areas of health and safety, and we  are committed to creating a work environment  that is free from psychological harm.  We understand that our employees’ mental  health can be impacted by psychosocial risks   at work, so we continue to strengthen our  psychosocial risk management. To support   an environment where everyone feels safe,  respected and included, we are progressing   all 26 recommendations from the Everyday  Respect Report, with a focus on training leaders  in building psychological safety and becoming  upstanders, rectifying any unsafe facilities and  building plans to make our facilities more  inclusive, and providing a more people-centric  response to support those impacted by harmful  behaviours and disrespect.  For more information about the Everyday Respect initiative,  see page 16. We are a member of the Minerals Council of  Australia (MCA) Psychosocial Risk Management  Working Group, chaired by MCA and industry  partners, to improve the understanding and  management of psychosocial risk within  our industry. Our safety maturity model Much of the success of our safety  culture is a result of the implementation  of our SMM, now in its fourth year.  The SMM, as our blueprint for safety,  brings together the best practices from  across our business in leadership and  engagement, learning and improvement,  risk management and work planning.  Together, these practices define how we  can lead for physical and psychological  safety. Since implementing the model,  we have evolved our focus from  verifying systems and rituals to  assessing the impact of the model on  people’s mindsets. We believe all our  employees and contractors should feel  that they can work without injuring  themselves, speak up and make  decisions to keep themselves safe.  We have evolved the SMM accordingly,  including the way we train our assessors  and perform assessments at our sites. In 2022, we continued our work to help leaders  recognise psychosocial hazards; assess the  risks; and implement, evaluate and monitor  effective controls, just as for any other health or  safety risk. We also continued embedding our  mental health framework to raise awareness of  mental wellbeing, reduce stigma and increase  the capacity of our leaders to recognise and  support individuals experiencing mental illness.  Aligned with our commitment to give our  employees the tools and skills they need to  support their mental health, we continue to  provide and promote the Employee Assistance  Programme (EAP), our mental health toolkit and  our global Peer Support Programme, which  includes more than 1,500 peer supporters  worldwide. We also support our people  through our domestic violence support  programmes, which cover 100% of employees. We continued to support global mental health  campaigns such as R U OK? Day and World  Mental Health Day. In October 2022, we held  our mental health week to support mental  wellbeing in the communities where we  operate and encourage our people to look  out for one another. We ran a programme of  activities that included our first-ever global  calls dedicated to mental health. The full  communications programme reached  employees via leader and peer supporter  conversations, Yammer posts, intranet articles  and a combination of four live and recorded  webinars on topics such as resilience and the  connection between mental health and  menopause. We further encouraged  conversations by sharing employees’ stories  and experiences with mental health, and  having senior leaders and members of our  Executive Committee share their personal  reflections and commitment to mental health.  ===== PAGE 60 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 58 Safety and health performance 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 Fatalities at managed operations 0 0 0 0 3 All-injury frequency rate (per 200,000 hours worked) 0.40 0.40 0.37 0.42 0.44 Number of lost-time injuries2 225 216 187 227 223 Lost-time injury frequency rate (per 200,000 hours worked)3 0.25 0.25 0.22 0.27 0.26 Safety maturity model (SMM) score4 4.7 5.7 5.4 4.5 – Rate of new cases of occupational illness (per 10,000 employees)5 14.9 14.5 17.1 20.5 29.1 Number of employees6 54,000 49,000 47,500 46,000 47,500 Fines and prosecutions – safety (US$’000)7  339.0 646.2 25.4 40.7 59.0 Fines and prosecutions – health (US$’000) 0 5 0 1.4 0 2.

Figures in the table represent the Rio Tinto Group average SMM score at the end of each year. Each year, assets are added or removed from the SMM programme based on project and closure  cycles. New assets to the programme are baselined in the first quarter of each year and added to the Group average at the end of the year. In 2022, enhancements made to the SMM assessment  approach significantly raised the bar for assessed maturity. This required a reset of all baseline scores at every operation, which were reduced by 1.5. A revised average maturity of 4.2 served as  baseline for 2022 assessments. 5.

OSHA violations at our Wilmington operations, California US; violation of the Mine Health & Safety Act at Diavik Diamond Mine, Northwest territories Canada and a fine in the Magistrate’s Court of  Western Australia for an incident that occurred at our DSL-Port Hedland operations WA, Australia in 2018. Contributing causes for newly reported illness cases (employees) 2022 Noise induced hearing loss 21 Musculoskeletal disorders 30 Mental stress 4 Others 14 Note: There can be one or more illness reported for each employee/contractor. People and society continued We also updated and simplified our guidance  notes on Occupational Exposure Limits and  Occupational Hygiene Statistics to simplify  these processes. This will help our teams  manage and report hygiene risks.  Recognising the need to improve the  transparency and detail of our health data,  we performed a Group Internal Audit   in 2022. We are now implementing the   audit recommendations by working to   improve the reporting of our data. These  recommendations include reviewing gaps in  guidance, updating our existing guidance to  address these gaps, re-training our health  practitioners and improving the available  consolidated reports to enable further insights.  Re-doubling our efforts on delivering products  that safeguard the environment, health and  safety of our communities and end-consumers,  we brought together colleagues from our  product groups, Health, Environment and  Commercial teams to develop a roadmap  for future-proofing our product stewardship. HSES transformation The Health, Safety, Environment and Security  Transformation Programme, implemented  across five sites, is simplifying the way we work  and increasing the value we get from the  information we collect, ultimately making our  business safer. We are piloting the core  modules at Bell Bay and Dampier Port in  Australia, and Boron in the US. At Saguenay– Lac-St-Jean in Quebec, Canada, we are  piloting three of the environment modules: air,  water and greenhouse gas. Global deployment  of the core modules will start in 2023. COVID-19 In 2022, as we entered the endemic stage   of the COVID-19 outbreak, we saw fewer   cases across our business. We stood down   our COVID-19 global Business Resilience  teams and transitioned our strategy for  managing the disease to a risk-based  approach, in the same way we manage other  infectious diseases. We continue to monitor the  situation and follow safety precautions to  reduce exposure to the virus and protect our  people, contractors, their families and the  communities where we operate. We also  continue to offer support to those impacted by  COVID-19, including long COVID and any  psychological impacts.  Occupational health In 2022, we recorded a higher number of new  occupational health illnesses compared to the  previous year, with 69 (2021: 611), in line with  our increased focus on medical assessments.  These assessments are a key requirement in  ensuring and maintaining our employees’  fitness for work, addressing legislative  requirements and managing risk profiles.   In the last year, we began work to standardise  and simplify such assessments to help improve  our health performance.  We also ran two workshops for our global  health practitioners to share learnings, best  practice and recent technology developments. In 2022, we continued the post-pandemic  return to normal for occupational and industrial  hygiene sampling. This includes analysis of  noise, airborne particulates, gas and other  contaminants that can lead to adverse health  effects for our employees and contractors.  We also reinstated our health surveillance –  audiometry, spirometry and biological  monitoring – to proactively identify potential  occupational illnesses.  The data collected over 2022 allows for  semi-quantitative assessments of risk and  identifies areas where we can implement or  enhance control measures. Each product  group worked on identifying projects within  their assets which, with the support of the  Areas of Expertise, will be designed, developed  and implemented to reduce exposures for our  employees and contractors. 1. Originally reported as 51 in 2021 due to medical diagnosis and/or investigation outcomes finalised after the end of the year, resulting in additional occupational health illnesses reported after the  2021 Annual Report publication.   ===== PAGE 61 ===== 59 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Strategic report Talent, diversity and inclusion Our culture is a key enabler of our purpose.  It will make us a better partner and allow us to  attract and retain the people we need to  unleash the full potential of our business.  We are finding better ways to support and  engage our people, which means creating an  environment where everyone feels comfortable  being themselves, has the courage to speak up  if something is not right and listens to each  other with care and curiosity. 2022 progress At the beginning of the year, we reported   the findings and recommendations from   an independent review of our workplace  culture to better understand, prevent and  respond to harmful behaviours across our  global operations. The Everyday Respect  Report proposed 26 recommendations, all of  which we are implementing. This is just one  way we are evolving our culture to create a  safe, respectful and inclusive workplace. For more information about the immediate actions we have taken in  response to the Everyday Respect Report,  see page 16.  Continuing to listen and learn To help us understand how our people feel  about the company and our direction, we  conduct two annual Group-wide employee  engagement surveys. Close to 36,000  employees participated in our latest survey in  October 2022, and our employee satisfaction  score (eSAT)1 improved from 71 in 2021 to 73.  The feedback shows that the changes we are  making are moving us in the right direction. Evolving a culture takes time and commitment.  Continuing to focus on the evolution of our  culture will remain a key priority for everyone  in 2023. For more information about our work to evolve our culture,  see page 16. Building an inclusive and diverse workforce Having an inclusive and diverse workforce is a  competitive advantage. It will enable us to find  better ways to do things and ensure that we  reflect the communities where we work. In 2022, we extended our family-friendly  policies by updating our global standard for  paid parental leave to meet differing family  needs, ensuring that all new parents are eligible  for 18 weeks minimum paid parental leave.  We have been working on increasing the  representation of Indigenous employees in our  business and ensuring they have a stronger  voice. In 2022, we partnered with the Australian  Graduate School of Management at the  University of New South Wales to deliver the  RioInspire programme (formally known as the  Emerging Indigenous Executive Leaders  programme). The programme has been tailored  to focus on developing executive-ready  Indigenous leaders who will have an influential  role in shaping the future of our business.  The first group of Rio Tinto Indigenous leaders  completed the globally recognised, six-month  programme in April 2022. We continue to focus on the representation   of women across all levels in our business.  In 2022, we increased the representation of  women in our workforce from 21.6% to 22.9%.  We hired 2,982 women in the last 12 months,  an 18% increase on 2021. We continued to evolve our award-winning  graduate programme in 2022 and recruited our  biggest cohort yet with 265 graduate roles.  Of these, 53.2% were women and 36% were  from nationalities where we are building new  businesses2. In Australia, 15% of the graduate  intake (up from 10% in 2021) and 2.2% of our  vacation student programme (down from 15%  in 2021) were Indigenous. Developing our people  We continue to invest in our people. Through  the Safe Production System (SPS), we are  empowering people to develop and share  sustainable, best-practice solutions to define  how to work safely and optimally. In 2022, our  focus has been on upskilling our people with  technical knowledge on best practices and  encouraging the right mindsets and behaviours  to better engage our people. To set us up for a  continued successful and rapid rollout of SPS  in 2023, we have now trained 20 Mindset and  Behaviour Coaches and 218 Change Partners,  and certified 61 leaders in SPS deployments. For more information about SPS, see page 34. We know leaders play a critical role in shaping  our culture. In 2022, we continued to invest in  personal leadership development through the  Voyager programme. And as at 31 December  2022, more than 300 senior leaders have  experienced the Voyager journey. We have also expanded our technical  expertise and now have 130 people formally  recognised as a technical RioExpertTM through  our RioExcelTM programme. And in partnership  with LinkedIn Learning, we launched an online  energy and climate change curriculum for  employees who want to understand more  about how they can contribute to reducing  both Rio Tinto’s and their personal  carbon footprint. Ensuring equality through pay equity Ensuring that employees with similar skills,  knowledge, qualifications, experience and  performance are paid equally for the same or  comparable work is intrinsically linked to our  commitment to inclusion and diversity.  Our equal pay gap, the primary lens we use  when assessing gender pay, measures the  extent to which women and men employed   by our company in the same location and  performing work of equal value receive the  same pay. In 2022, we further reduced our  equal pay gap compared to 2021, which is now  1% in favour of men.  Gender pay gap is a measure of the difference  between the average earnings of women and  men across the Group (excluding incentive  pay), regardless of role, expressed as a  percentage of men’s earnings. In 2022, our  gender pay gap was just over 1% in favour of  women, consistent with previous years.  We are committed to eliminating any residual  pay inequities based on gender or other  non-legitimate dimensions of difference.  For more information about our commitment to pay equity, see our  website riotinto.com/payequity 52,000  workforce of employees and contractors,   an increase of 9.8% since 2021 (47,000),   excludes non-managed operations. 11,062 new hires  of which 4,317 were contractors becoming   permanent employees (2021: 7,895 new hires   of which 3,098 were contractors).  22.9% women  in our workforce, an increase of 1.4%3 since 2021  (21.6%).

Empowering families  with flexibility We have updated our global standard for paid  parental leave to better suit different family  needs. Many parents like Garry, who works in  our finance team in Singapore, have been able  to participate in recent months. With this  programme, Garry could take the full 18 weeks  and split the time into two blocks to allow for  more flexibility.  Learn more about our updated parental leave policy in our  interview with Garry on our website.  ===== PAGE 63 ===== 61 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Strategic report Human rights Respecting human rights relies on good  governance, knowing our potential impacts,  empowering and enabling our people, and  working with others to help avoid adverse  human rights impacts from occurring in the  first place.  Progress in 2022 Governance The Sustainability Committee has overarching  accountability for our approach to human rights.  We are working on improving our human rights  performance, strengthening a range of areas to  help prevent our involvement in adverse human  rights impacts, and providing for, or cooperating  in, remediation when we identify that we have  caused or contributed to harm.  In 2022, we revised our Human Rights Policy to  advance our human rights performance in line  with our business objectives and values and to  meet external commitments and emerging  regulatory requirements. The updated policy  reflects emerging human rights areas including  just transition, human rights defenders and  human rights due diligence. It also reiterates  our commitment to implement the UN Guiding  Principles on Business and Human Rights  (UNGPs), the Organisation for Economic  Co-operation and Development (OECD)  Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the IFC  Performance Standards, the UN Global  Compact’s ten principles, the Maritime Labour  Convention, the ICMM Mining Principles, and  the Voluntary Principles on Security and  Human Rights (Voluntary Principles).  For more information about our security and human rights work  programme, see our annual Voluntary Principles  Initiative Report, published on our website.  Our Group Internal Audit (GIA) team reviewed  the design of our modern slavery controls and  presented summary observations and  opportunities to the Sustainability Committee in  October 2022. The internal audit identified  opportunities to enhance management of  third-party risks across non-financial domains  (including modern slavery); to improve  governance over the management of modern  slavery risk; and to further improve Board  visibility of modern slavery disclosures. This was  part of a three-year phased approach to provide  assurance across our human rights programme.  We will implement the actions from the internal  audit during 2023, and will continue to work with  GIA to provide further assurance over our  human rights governance framework.  Obtaining feedback from stakeholders,  including receiving complaints or registering  grievances, is a vital part of our human rights  approach. Our stakeholders have access to  myVoice, our confidential, anonymous and  independently operated whistleblowing  programme, through which human rights  grievances can be reported. Salient human rights issues Consistent with the UN Declaration on the Rights  of Indigenous Peoples, we acknowledge and  respect Indigenous peoples’ connection to  lands and waters and commit to demonstrate  progress towards, or achievement of, Free,  Prior and Informed Consent of affected  Indigenous communities across all phases of  the asset lifecycle.  Aligned with the UNGPs, we continue to mature  our processes and systems. For example, we  identify the priority human rights issues that  could severely impact people through our  activities or business relationships. These  issues, listed below, consider our operational  footprint, value chain and external contexts  and remain unchanged from 2021:   – Land access and use   – Indigenous peoples’ rights   – Security   – Inclusion and diversity   – Community health, safety and wellbeing   – Workplace health and safety   – Labour rights (including modern slavery)   – Climate change and just transition  (respecting human rights while transitioning  to a low-carbon economy). In 2022, several assets, including Simandou,  Oyu Tolgoi and those in Gladstone, Queensland,  Australia undertook risk assessments to review  their priority human rights issues. These  assessments provide assets with a more  complete understanding of their risk context  and are an important part of our commitment   to implement the UNGPs. This work will  continue into 2023.  Our business relationships It is important that we address our potential  involvement in human rights harm that may  occur through relationships with our suppliers,  customers and joint venture partners. We  engage and collaborate with our business  partners to advance respect for human rights in  line with international standards, the UNGPs  and our values.  Using a risk-based approach, we pre-screen  potential business partners on human rights  and require suppliers (including subcontractors)  to adhere to our Supplier Code of Conduct,  which includes respect for human rights.  More than 17,000 business partners completed  baseline screening in 2022, and over 200 were  escalated for human rights review, which is  approximately a 60% increase compared to  2021. Our Commercial team also held  conversations about human rights with   several strategic suppliers at supplier  relationship meetings. Modern slavery provisions are included in our  standard global supply contract and purchase  order terms and conditions, as well as our  marine chartering contracts. During 2022, we  updated human rights considerations in our  Supplier Code of Conduct and contributed   to updating our Code of Conduct – The Way  We Work, which was launched internally in  February 2023. In 2023, we will perform a more  detailed review of the Supplier Code of  Conduct to further clarify our expectations of  suppliers on human rights and other matters.  For more information about our human rights and modern slavery  approach, see our annual Modern Slavery  Statement on our website.  Capacity building on human rights In 2022, we enhanced our in-house human  rights expertise by establishing a dedicated  human rights team within the Communities  and Social Performance Area of Expertise.  However, we also believe everyone in the  business has a role to play in implementing our  commitment to respect human rights.  Our employees and contractors develop a  better understanding of human rights issues  through general and targeted training. In 2022,  our training objectives were to demystify  human rights and identify ways to integrate   and operationalise human rights. We hosted  39 human rights workshops for our teams in  Ethics and Compliance, the Business Conduct  Office, Marine, Communities and Social  Performance, as well as joint venture partners  and other relevant stakeholders. We also  launched an online learning module to raise  awareness about modern slavery. This module  is compulsory for our Commercial, Legal,  Ethics and Integrity, and Communities and  Social Performance Area of Expertise teams,  but it is available to everyone in the business.  Training feedback results indicated that over  90% of participants now understand what  modern slavery is, how to report a concern and  what we are doing to address risks. Our Marine team continued to develop their  Seafarer Welfare and Safety Programme, which  included dedicated human rights training for  more than 108 marine officers and 77 seafarer  crew members in the Philippines and India. We have summarised our human rights training  records in the 2022 Sustainability Fact Book.  We also participated in a number of  collaborative human rights initiatives in 2022  and continued our external engagement with  peers, civil society organisations, governments  and others to help inform our approach to  human rights management. For more information about how we engaged with our key  stakeholders, including civil society  organisations, see pages 55-56.  ===== PAGE 64 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 62 Planet  We take our role as long-term stewards of the world’s natural  resources, including land, water and the ecosystems they support,  seriously. We know that the way we produce these products is   just as important as the minerals and metals themselves.  In 2022, we continued to progress our objectives to achieve  impeccable ESG credentials and strengthen our social licence.  Among other initiatives, we focused on minimising the risks and  the environmental footprint of our operations and working on our  Climate Action Plan. We rehabilitated 16 square kilometres of land,  and to help us reduce our carbon footprint, we set up a new team  of specialists focusing on nature-based solutions. Our freshwater  consumption increased by 6GL, so reducing our extraction from  water sources of this quality continues to be a priority for us.

Energy Resources Australia Ltd.  ===== PAGE 65 ===== 63 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Strategic report Climate change and our related operational expenditure  increased to approximately $140 million in  2022. As a result, we are better placed to  deliver the complex and large-scale structural  changes to our energy system needed to  achieve our 2030 target. We are progressing work towards 1GW of  renewable power in the Pilbara. In 2022, we  installed the first 34MW at Gudai-Darri and are  planning investments of $600 million for solar,  storage and transmission to deliver a further  230MW solar power and 200MWh storage  from 2023 to 2026. Once fully operational,  this will displace approximately 30% of our   gas usage. In other locations, power purchase  agreements can be a better option for us and   in 2022 we signed a 130MW solar power  purchase agreement for Richards Bay Minerals  in South Africa.  Our Pacific Aluminium Operations are in  coal-based power grids and account for 28%  of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. A formal  market Request for Proposals (RFP) was  undertaken in June 2022 to support the  development of large-scale wind and solar  power to supply power to the Boyne smelter  through the Queensland grid by 2030. This  smelter requires 960MW capacity of reliable  power to operate, which equates to at least  4GW of quality wind and solar power capacity  with firming. We continue to work with the  Queensland Government and energy providers  to design a renewable energy solution for  this smelter. Our Processing Centre of Excellence focuses on  decarbonising our harder-to-abate operations  in alumina, iron ore pelletisation and titanium  dioxide. In 2022, we agreed to partner with the  Government of Canada to invest $537 million  (C$737 million) to reduce emissions by up to  70% at the Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Quebec  Operations. This work supports technological  innovations, including BlueSmeltingTM, a new  ilmenite smelting technology that allows us to  reduce and eventually eliminate the use of coal  in the process. We also continued our studies  with the Australian Renewable Energy Agency  and Sumitomo Corporation on the role of  hydrogen in alumina refining. Our experience with our abatement projects  and progress tracking suggests there will be  delays, and that we will require greater use of  offsets to achieve our 2025 target. We  established one additional programme to  increase our investments in nature-based  solutions projects. If done well, these projects  can play a substantial role in addressing  carbon emissions and biodiversity loss, while  also providing benefits to local communities.  Our people working on these “6+1”  programmes, along with our substantial  investments in technology development,  will drive the innovation and solutions   needed to accelerate our low-carbon   transition and ensure the long-term resilience  of our business. Decarbonising our value chains Our Scope 3 emissions were 584Mt CO2e in  2022 – over 1% of the global total. This is  primarily from our customers in Asia processing  our iron ore into steel and bauxite into aluminium,  so our level of control is limited. Our approach  to Scope 3 emissions balances ambition,  pragmatism and our level of agency: it is  focused on our most significant sources and is  grounded in actions where we can have  impact. While it is clear that we have a key role  to play, we do not set an overall Scope 3  emissions target as we have limited ability to  directly influence the production processes of  our customers or their customers.  In 2022, we increased our engagement with  nearly all our direct iron ore and bauxite  customers and worked with them to optimise  their current operations and to develop the  low-carbon technologies needed to reduce  emissions across our value chains. It is  encouraging that this issue remains very high  on the agenda when we meet our customers. An inevitable structural shift toward green steel  is underway. In the short term, the industry is  predominantly focusing on blast furnace  optimisation and we are working closely with  customers to support their ambitions. In the  medium term, the industry will move towards  cleaner processing routes such as Direct  Reduced Iron – Electric Arc Furnace (DRI- EAF). Steelmakers will increasingly value higher  grade ores with less impurities that are more  energy efficient to process. Therefore, we are  working in partnerships with customers,  technology providers, universities and others to  develop low-carbon technologies to process  our iron ore into steel. This includes exploring  DRI pathways using hydrogen and sustainable  biomass. We are also working on options   to beneficiate and upgrade our Pilbara ores   to be better suited to low-carbon steel  making technologies.  Learn more about these partnerships in our  2022 Climate Change Report at   riotinto.com/climatereport. Our total Scope 3 emissions from shipping and  logistics were 8.8Mt CO2e. Our shipping  emissions intensity was 30% below our 2008  baseline, putting us on track to meet the  International Maritime Organisation (IMO)  decarbonisation goal of a 40% reduction in  shipping emissions intensity by 2025, which is  five years ahead of the IMO deadline.  The low-carbon transition is at the heart of our  business strategy. We are focused on growth   in the materials that enable the transition,  decarbonising our operations and partnering  with our customers to decarbonise our value  chains. Our operational emissions targets are  ambitious: to reduce emissions by 15% by  2025 and 50% by 2030, reaching net zero by  2050. Our targets cover more than 95% of our  reported Scope 1 and 2 emissions and are  aligned with 1.5°C pathways.  The Board approves our overall strategy, our  policy positions and our Climate Change Report.  The Board sets the 2025, 2030 and 2050  emissions targets and monitors performance  against the targets and operational resilience.  The Chair of the Board is responsible for our  overall approach to climate change. The Board  and the Risk Management Committee provide  oversight of our principal risks and the Audit  Committee monitors the overall effectiveness  of our system of risk management and  internal controls.  The Principal Risks and Uncertainties section   in this report considers both physical climate  risks and low-carbon transition risks. The Chief  Executive is responsible for delivering the  Climate Action Plan approved by the Board.  Our approach to climate change and target  execution considerations integrates risk  management, portfolio reviews, capital  investments, annual financial planning and  government engagement.  2022 progress In 2022, we worked towards our Climate Action  Plan that our shareholders approved in a  non-binding resolution at our annual general  meetings. The low-carbon transition is  complex: developing the technologies and  implementing the major projects needed to  decarbonise our business will take time.  In 2022, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions were  30.3Mt CO2e (31.0Mt in 2021). This reduction   of 7% below our 2018 baseline is primarily the  result of switching to renewable power at  Kennecott and Escondida in prior years, as   well as lower than planned production from  Kitimat and Boyne Smelter in 2022. We did   not advance the actual implementation of our  abatement projects as fast as we would have  liked last year, so our capital expenditure on  decarbonisation projects was $94 million,  lower than we anticipated when we set our  targets. Challenges have included late delivery  of equipment, resourcing constraints impacting  study progress, construction and  commissioning delays, and project readiness.  Our “6+1” abatement programmes In response, we established six abatement  programmes, with dedicated people, to focus  on the decarbonisation challenges that cut  across our product groups: repowering our  Pacific Aluminium Operations, renewables,  ELYSISTM, alumina process heat, minerals  processing and diesel transition. We are  building capability and gaining a deeper  understanding of our decarbonisation  challenge (both constraints and opportunities),   ===== PAGE 66 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 64 Planet continued Addressing the Task Force on Climate-related   Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations Climate-related disclosures on governance, strategy and risk management, as well as metrics and targets, are integrated into this report.

Please see GHG Emissions Methodology sheet for details of our approach to reporting Scope 1, 2 & 3 emissions. Note that our 2022  equity emissions and our 2018 baseline do not include the additional equity share of the Oyu Tolgoi mine that was purchased in mid-December 2022.  Queensland Alumina Limited (QAL) is 80% owned by Rio Tinto and 20% owned by Rusal. However, as a result of QAL’s activation of a step-in process  following the Australian Government’s sanction measures, Rio Tinto is currently entitled to utilise 100% of the capacity at QAL, but paying 100% of the  costs for as long as that step-in continues. Our 2022 equity emissions and our 2018 baseline include QAL emissions on the basis of Rio Tinto’s 80%  ownership. In 2022, the additional emissions associated with the step-in were 0.53Mt. Rusal has commenced proceedings challenging the validity of  the step-in and the sanctions regime may change over time, such that the duration of the step-in remains uncertain.

The  programme will improve how we manage our  environmental data, allowing us to use this  information to support our decision making,  meet the growing demand for transparency,  and set meaningful targets for continuous  improvement in environmental performance. We have also worked to ensure that  environmental management is consistent and  embedded across all processes in our  business and through the lifecycle of our  operations. To support our assets in managing  their environmental performance, we  incorporated environmental risk ownership and  performance measurement into the safety  maturity model (SMM), which focuses on  leadership behaviours in the field and critical  risk management.  With our product groups, Health and  Commercial teams, we started developing a  roadmap for future-proofing our product  stewardship to ensure that we continue to  deliver products that safeguard the  environment, health and safety of our  communities and end-consumers. As environmental stewards, we focus on  responsibly managing shared resources to  protect the health, safety and livelihoods of  local communities. We manage risk to minimise  adverse environmental impacts from our  operations and to sustain our shared  ecosystems, planet and natural resources for  future generations. In July 2022, the United  Nations recognised “the right to a clean,  healthy and sustainable environment”   as a human right, further underlining our  responsibilities to people and the planet. 2022 progress As a forum member of the Taskforce on  Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD),  we are preparing to pilot the prototype risk  management and opportunity disclosure  framework at our Simandou site in Guinea.  This framework will help businesses with the  transparency and management of nature- related risks. We continue to provide feedback  on the framework through our membership of  the International Council on Mining and Metals  (ICMM). We are also refreshing our approach  to managing nature-related risk and  developing a pathway to increasing our  disclosures in line with TNFD.  For more information about our nature-related disclosures,   see our 2022 Sustainability Fact Book   at riotinto.com/sustainabilityreporting. Water Water is a shared resource critical to sustaining  biodiversity, people and economic prosperity.  Increasingly disrupted weather patterns and  more extreme weather events due to climate  change, and a growing world population, mean  efficiently managing water is more important  than ever.  The way we think about water and manage  associated risks reflects the diversity of our  operations and geographic locations. A small  proportion of our assets operate in water- scarce regions, while others must remove  excess water to allow safe mining operations.  These are examples of the many potential  risks we manage across the lifecycle of our  diverse operations. We share water with the communities and  nature surrounding our operations, so we aim  to avoid permanent impacts on water  resources by carefully managing the quality  and quantity of the water we use and return to  the environment. This means balancing the  needs of our operations with those of the local  communities and ecosystems. We do this  while considering the impact of climate  change, already felt in the level of rainfall  and water security at some of our operations.  We understand this responsibility extends  beyond the life of our operations.  To address this complexity, we adopt a  catchment-level approach to developing  potential solutions and managing our risks and  impacts within our operations. We use baseline  water stress as determined by the World  Resource Institute to identify operational  catchments of most concern. For more information visit our website www.riotinto.com/water Exploring   nature-based solutions In 2022, we launched a new team of specialists  focused on nature-based solutions, who will  explore and invest in high-quality projects that  implement internationally accepted social and  environmental safeguards and contribute to  reducing our carbon footprint. As part of this  work, we will partner with host communities  and other local stakeholders to learn from them  and jointly find ways to improve the resilience  and protect the biodiversity of land in and  around our operations. For more information see our website.   ===== PAGE 69 ===== 67 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Strategic report 2022 progress Our water balance Our Group water balance outlines where water was withdrawn from,  discharged to, recycled or reused, and consumed at our operations. The reported categories correlate with the requirements of the ICMM,  Minerals Council of Australia and Global Reporting Initiatives. We also report on our aggregated water balance for sites in water- stressed areas. We assess baseline water stress using the World  Resources Institute’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas mapping tool. For more information see the 2022 Sustainability Fact Book at riotinto.com/sustainabilityreporting. Group water risk profile (% of managed operations) The water resource risk at Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia is assessed as  moderate, even though it is located in the Gobi Desert. Oyu Tolgoi  sources its water requirements from a deep water supply, the Gunii  Hooloi aquifer, a 150-metre deep resource holding around 6.8 billion  cubic metres of non-drinkable saline water. Oyu Tolgoi uses this water  source efficiently with water recycling and conservation practices  implemented across the operation. Water resource Is there enough water available for both environment and community  needs, and our operational use? 9% 11% 22% 58% Water quality and quantity Does the way we manage water on site, or discharge excess water,  cause environmental impacts or operational constraints? Our QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM) operation in Madagascar operates  in a highly sensitive area from a water, broader environment and community  perspective. The discharges from our operation have the potential to  impact receiving water quality and, therefore, the water quality risk is  assessed as high. We are working to improve management activities on  site, including our ability to more accurately measure our water discharge  quality, and the deployment of a dedicated water treatment plant to  adjust the discharge pH. 2% 36% 35% 27% Impacts associated with dewatering and water supply activities in the  Pilbara are recognised as a very high risk for our business. Returning  water to the aquifers impacted by our mining activities in a controlled  manner is the focus of a number of studies. We are working with  Traditional Owners on water management. Dewatering Does the removal of water from the operational areas of our sites impact  regional aquifers or our mine plans?  5% 9% 16% 27% 43% Low risk Moderate risk High risk Very high risk Not applicable We may sometimes generate impacts that we are required to manage over  the long term, such as post-closure pit lakes in the Pilbara, or potential  seepage from our waste rock or tailings facilities in our aluminium and  copper sites. Our systems and standards aim to ensure that risks are  identified early and managed appropriately and responsibly throughout  the asset lifecycle.  Long-term obligations Do our operational activities generate long-term or ongoing obligations  related to water? 15% 22% 20% 31% 12% Our water withdrawals Our total operational withdrawals for 2022 were 1,119 GL, a 4% increase  compared with 2021. Freshwater, or category 1 quality, withdrawals  accounted for 432 GL or 39% of this total, which remains consistent with  our 2021 withdrawals. Freshwater is generally suitable for consumption  with minimal treatment required. Where possible, we aim to minimise our  extractions from water sources of this quality. Total discharges for 2022 were 638 GL, a 3% reduction compared with  2021. Total water recycled or reused for 2022 was 328 GL, a 6%  increase over our 2021 performance. To manage our water impacts, we first need  to understand the specific risks at more than  50 operating sites, as well as our overall Group  impacts. To do this, we have developed a water  risk framework that considers:   – Water resource   – Quality and quantity   – Dewatering   – Long-term obligations We use this framework to identify, assess and  manage water risks. This comprehensive  approach extends beyond our mandatory  reporting obligations and allows us to have  relevant conversations about water risks  internally and with stakeholders in the  communities where we operate. In 2022,  we continued to embed the last component   of the framework – the Group water control  library – which describes all controls identified  to manage our water risks. Our Group water risk profile shows the level   of exposure against each of the four risk  categories. Most of our water risks sit in the  “low” to “moderate” range. There are some in  “very high” and “high” categories for each.  Regardless of the level of risk, we apply  rigorous standards and processes to  manage them.  ===== PAGE 70 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 68 Our five-year water targets allow us to be  more transparent about our water usage,  risk profile, management and specific  challenges. These targets, and the data  required to measure progress against them,  are helping us become better water stewards. Our water targets were set in 2019 and consist  of one Group target and six site-based targets,  reflecting our catchment-based approach and  recognising that we manage vastly different  water-related risks across our business. The  site-based targets were chosen based on their  water risk profile, our ICMM commitments, and  local community and environmental  interdependencies. We continued to make progress against our  Group target in 2022. We verified and updated  water allocation volume data and estimated  surface water catchment rainfall-runoff  volumes for all our managed operations.  A disclosure platform has been developed   and is planned for public release in 2023.  In 2023, we will continue embedding our water  risk framework and associated controls across  our product groups and focus on delivering   our site-based targets. We will also begin the  development of our 2024-2029 water targets. Our 2019–2023 water targets Planet continued Progress against our targets Group target Water risk theme Status Commentary Rio Tinto Group (Tier 11) By 2023, we will disclose – for all managed operations –  permitted surface water allocation volumes, annual  allocation usage and the associated surface water  allocation catchment rainfall-runoff volume estimate.

Quantity/quality  (inventory reduction) Not on track In May 2022, ERA commenced a feasibility study update in  connection with a lower technical risk rehabilitation  methodology and to further refine the Ranger Project Area  rehabilitation execution scope, risks, cost and schedule. The  2022 Feasibility Study is forecast to be completed in September  2023 and will ultimately lead to a revised Mine Closure Plan,  incorporating an updated Ranger water model. QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM), Minerals (Tier 23) QMM will develop and implement an improved integrated  site water management approach by 2023. Quantity/quality  (discharge quality) On track In 2022, we completed the development of our long-term water  management strategy and implemented a pilot water treatment  plant that allowed us to discharge water compliant with pH and  aluminium criteria for the second half of the year. We are  working to improve our long-term water management practices  on site, including our ability to more accurately measure our  water discharge quality, and the deployment of a full-scale  dedicated water treatment plant. Queensland Alumina Limited (QAL), Aluminium (non-managed joint venture) (Tier 2) QAL will complete the following four water-related  improvement projects from the QAL five-year environment  strategy by 2023:   – Project L1: integrity of bunds and drains   – Project W3: caustic pipe and wasteline 4 integrity   – Project W6: residue disposal area surface/ground  water impacts   – Project W7: residue disposal area release  to receiving environment Quality/quantity  (discharge quality) Joint venture  performance  improvement On track Progress of nominated water-related improvement projects is  aligned with current project schedules.

As a founding partner of UNEP WCMC’s  19-year-old Proteus Partnership, and aligned  with our drive to build our internal capability,  we continued to deliver biodiversity training to  employees across the business. In 2022, we  prioritised QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM),  Simandou and our Commercial team in China  to receive biodiversity training, which we  delivered in their respective languages. We continue to innovate to help us become  better environmental stewards. At QMM and  Simandou, we have begun assessing the  feasibility of using new environmental DNA  technology to help us understand the full  scope of species in and around our operations,  allowing for more tailored and effective  mitigation measures. In 2023, we are looking to  expand this approach according to our sites’  risk prioritisation. At our Weipa operations in  Australia, we trialled machine learning to help  us with monitoring by replicating human  identification of the endangered Palm  Cockatoo, freeing up resources for increased  conservation work. We also invested C$2.67 million to support the  Saguenay Fjord Ecosystem Research Group   in Quebec, Canada, which brings together  researchers and professionals from INREST1,  Université du Québec à Chicoutimi, and  Université Laval. The group will document and  understand the factors that influence the  Saguenay Fjord ecosystem, which is both a  unique natural ecosystem and a crucial  waterway for the economy of the Saguenay–  Lac-Saint-Jean region and the province of  Quebec. This knowledge will help keep our  shipping operations running in a way that is  safe for the Saguenay ecosystem. In 2022, we completed an independent review  of the monitoring programmes of our high- priority biodiversity sites, which included  ensuring that management plans and actions  adequately address risks to nature. At the Simandou project in Guinea, and  drawing on data collected over the last  decade, in 2022 we continued updating our  baseline assessments. In the second quarter of  2023, we will publish the revised Environmental  and Social Impact Assessment. The interconnected impacts of climate change  and biodiversity loss pose significant risks  to people and the environment. We recognise  our responsibility to effectively mitigate the  impact of our operations on nature, and we are  mindful of our own dependence on healthy  ecosystems to run a successful business. Healthy natural environments with functioning  ecosystems are key to climate resilience.  They also provide important services to the  communities where we operate and our  business. We are committed to protecting  biodiversity and our ambition is to achieve no  net loss. This means striking a balance between  negative impacts on biodiversity and positive  outcomes achieved through mitigation. 2022 progress We continue to assess the sensitivity of our  planned activities using combined global  datasets of threatened species and  conservation and protected areas, developed  by the UN Environment Programme World  Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP  WCMC). This helps inform our risk-prioritisation  of assets in areas of high biodiversity, including  exploration and project sites, and supports our  allocation of resources. In 2022, we enhanced  the resolution of our assessments with  Land We are temporary custodians of the land on  which we operate, and we aim to rehabilitate  the land as soon as it becomes available.  2022 progress In 2022, we rehabilitated 16 square kilometres  of land, mostly at our bauxite mines in Australia,  mineral sands mines in South Africa and  Madagascar, and at our iron ore mines and  exploration areas in the Pilbara, Western  Australia. In the southern Gobi Desert in  Mongolia, following successful rehabilitation of  the Oyu Tolgoi to Khanbogd Soum old dirt  road, we relinquished around 50 hectares of  land, returning the land back to its original use  of grazing by the local herders. Through the development of our environmental  risk control libraries, we are also strengthening  how we plan for and implement progressive  rehabilitation.  In 2022, our land footprint – total disturbed  area – was 3,810 square kilometres, an  increase of 75 square kilometres compared   to 2021. This includes all disturbances to our  operating assets and activities, such as  exploration activities, smelters, mines and  supporting infrastructure. Our rehabilitation teams partner with research  centres and universities to refine rehabilitation  approaches and improve outcomes. In 2022,  as a forum member of the Australian-led  Cooperative Research Centre for  Transformations in Mining Economies (CRC  TiME), we contributed to the coordinated  investment into innovative research that  addresses the complex challenges  underpinning mine closure and relinquishment.  For more information about our closure work, see page 71. We also completed several trials using satellite- derived data to determine if we could measure  rehabilitation performance at a global scale,  while at the same time complementing the  monitoring data collected locally. In addition,  16 of our operations completed rehabilitation  trials to improve seed germination, erosion and  topsoil quality. Waste 2022 progress Waste and residues from our operational  activities are key areas of environmental risk  management. In 2022, we continued to focus  on managing potential contamination from  these sources. This included working to  remove all use of PFAS (perfluoroalkyl and  polyfluoroalkyl substances) in fire-suppression  systems at our sites by the end of 2022.  Although we removed the use of PFAS in the  majority of these systems, in some instances  this transition will not be completed until 2024  at the earliest. This is due to delays in starting  the retrofit or overhaul of major pieces of  infrastructure, as well as challenges in sourcing  alternative fluorine free substances for use in  fire-suppression systems in some jurisdictions. At some of our long-life assets, we continually  evaluate past waste management practices  that have led to a need for remediation in the  present. For example, in 2022, we remained  focused on finding additional ways to transform  waste and by-products from our aluminium  operations into materials for use in the  construction and agricultural sectors. We have assets with chemically reactive  mineral waste risks, which we manage by  conducting independent reviews to assess  the effectiveness of our risk management  programmes and identify areas for  improvement. In 2022, we conducted reviews  at Yarwun in Australia, Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia,  and at Kennecott, Boron, Resolution Copper  and the Ridgeway closed site in the US. For more information about tailings, see page 71. 1. Northern Institute for Research in Environment and Occupational Health and Safety.  ===== PAGE 72 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 70 Air quality Our emphasis is on reducing emissions at  source by upgrading equipment to use the  best available technologies, adding air  pollution control equipment, and using  renewable energy or alternative feed material  where possible. Our air quality management  programmes include monitoring, sampling at  source, incident tracking and risk assessments.  Many of our assets have multi-year air quality  improvement projects in place. For example,  at our Boron operations in California, US we  updated a boiler to reduce the amount of  nitrogen oxides emitted. At our Pilbara Iron Ore  operations, in a region prone to high dust  emissions, we created a working group to  improve our dust management. The group  developed and implemented new controls and  improved the dust management systems.

Significant environmental incident is an incident with an actual consequence rating of major or catastrophic. We measure and rate incidents according to their actual environmental and compliance  impacts using five severity categories: minor, medium, serious, major, or catastrophic. Major and catastrophic environmental incidents are usually reported to the relevant product group head and the  Rio Tinto Chief Executive as soon as possible. 2. In 2022 we paid environmental fines totalling $109,782 resulting from overflow of containment pond during high rainfall events at our Gove Operations, Australia; release of caustic solution to land at  Yarwun, Australia; the death of a goitered gazelle and cutting trees without a permit at Oyu Tolgoi, Mongolia; failing to meet PM10 emission limit at Kennecott Utah Copper, US; non-compliance with  carbonaceous by-products storage at spent pot liner treatment plant, Canada; violation of hazardous materials transportation statute at Kitimat smelter, Canada; operation of gas pipeline without  estimated rehabilitation costing approval at Boyne smelter, Australia; and non-compliance related to storing contaminated soil, residual materials and sludge at Havre-Saint-Pierre and Lac Tio, Canada. 3. Figures in 2019-2021 have been restated from those originally published to ensure comparability over time. 4. The increase of NOx emissions from 2019-2020 is due to change in calculation method from emissions factors to direct measurement using stack sampling data. The figures for 2020 and 2021 have  been restated from those originally published to ensure comparability over time. 5. PM10 emissions increased by 32kt in 2022 with the commencement of production at Gudai-Darri. We are trialing alternative dust suppressants. Planet continued Clean air is critical for the health of our  host communities and the surrounding  ecosystems. We are working to improve air  quality management, focusing on emissions  of particulate matter and gases from our  operational activities, including mining,  materials handling, processing and  transportation. The potentially hazardous  emissions we monitor at operations are:   – sulphur oxides (SOx), mainly at our  aluminium and copper smelters   – nitrogen oxides (NOx), mainly from  burning fossil fuels   – gaseous fluoride emissions from  aluminium smelters   – respirable particulate emissions (PM10 and  PM2.5), very fine particles from mining and  processing operations and from burning  fossil fuels. For example, at the West Angelas mine, we  installed a new dust collector which reduced  respirable dust (PM10) emissions by 59%.  In some instances, we did not comply with  permissible emission limits. For example,  in April, at our Arvida plant in Saguenay–Lac- Saint-Jean, Quebec, Canada our continuous  monitoring system indicated that we exceeded  the monthly emission limit for dust and fluoride  in pot rooms. This had no adverse impact on air  quality, and we remained compliant with our  daily and annual limits. We investigated, made  adjustments to comply with the emission limit  and resumed compliance the following month. With the evolution of climate and our operating  conditions, we are focusing on prevention   to make sure that we understand evolving  conditions and how we can adapt our operations.

These include:   – The Tailings Reduction Roadmap, which  provides strategic direction on how to  accelerate the development and adoption of  technologies to reduce tailings production.   – The Tailings Management Good Practice  Guide, which provides guidance on good  governance and engineering practices to  support continuous improvement in  tailings management.    – The Good Practice Guide training  materials, designed to build awareness  and capability in good governance and  tailings engineering practices. In 2022, we also:    – Conducted multi-disciplinary risk assessments  for all our “very high” and “extreme”  consequence facilities.    – Continued to support the Future Tails  partnership, a collaboration between  Rio Tinto, BHP and the University of Western  Australia (UWA). In 2022, the Graduate  Certificate in Tailings Management at UWA  had 106 enrolled students from 12 countries  in micro-credentialled units. Two PhD  candidates also commenced their research  programmes in 2022.   – Partnered with BHP on tailings filtration  solutions at very high throughputs for copper  operations, which supports our goal of  increasing water recovery and recycling.    – Continued to regularly convene the Tailings  Management Committee with our  designated Accountable Executives, which  provides coordinated governance of tailings  management practices across the Group. Tailings We engage with stakeholders throughout the  lifecycle of our tailings storage facilities, from  design to closure. We also collaborate closely  with external bodies to improve the way tailings  are managed across our industry.  We manage 95 tailings storage facilities (TSFs)  across our global assets. There are a further 43  non-managed TSFs. Altogether, there are 57  active TSFs, 39 are inactive and 42 are closed.  There have been no external wall failures at any  of our TSFs for more than 20 years.  We work through technical committees and joint  venture relationships to support leading practice  in tailings management. Our full tailings  disclosure is available on our website riotinto. com/tailings and we periodically update the list  of TSFs to reflect operational and ownership  changes, including changes due to the  transition to closure or remediation obligations  for legacy assets and reclassification of  facilities. Our list also includes links to TSFs  managed by our joint venture partners.  Our facilities are regulated and permitted and  have been managed for many years to comply  with local laws, regulations, permits, licences  and other requirements. Tailings management  has been included in the Group risk register  since 2010, and our Group safety standard for  tailings and water storage facilities has been in  place since 2015. Our internal assurance  processes verify that our managed TSFs  operate in accordance with this standard,  which we updated in 2020. Our operational TSFs have emergency response  plans – tested through training exercises in  collaboration with stakeholders such as local  emergency services – and follow strict business  resilience and communications protocols. 2022 progress In December 2022, we updated previously  disclosed information on our global TSFs.  All facilities were assigned a consequence  classification in accordance with the regulatory  or industry body that oversees tailings in each  region or jurisdiction. Additional technical  data from updated downstream impact  assessments, required under the Global  Industry Standard on Tailings Management  (GISTM) and our own internal standard for  tailings and water storage facilities, resulted in  a modification to hazard classifications of some  facilities. Consequence classifications are not  ratings of the condition of a facility or the  likelihood of failure; instead, they rate the  potential consequence if the facility were to fail.  Since the launch of GISTM in August 2020,  we have continued work on our implementation  plan. We have completed a gap analysis  against our internal tailings management,  environment, and communities and social  performance standards, and developed  improvement plans to close identified gaps.  We are working towards having all TSFs with a  potential consequence rated “extreme” or  “very high” in conformance with GISTM by  August 2023, with all remaining facilities in  conformance by August 2025.  Closure Through safe and responsible asset closure,  we are working to deliver shared benefits for  host communities, employees and investors;  positive ESG outcomes; and innovative  solutions that minimise long-term liabilities.  We do this in partnership with our stakeholders,  embedding closure considerations throughout  the lifespan of our assets – in the way we  design, build, run, close and transition them. As temporary stewards of the land where we  operate, we partner with our stakeholders to  develop a shared vision for the future of the  lands and host communities. Balancing  environmental, financial and social considerations,  we look for opportunities associated with  progressive closure, remediation and  repurposing, and, where appropriate,  long-term monitoring and maintenance.  At the end of 2022, closure provisions on   our balance sheet totalled $15.8 billion  (2021: $14.5 billion).  2022 progress Argyle diamond mine We continue to close the Argyle diamond mine  in Western Australia. In 2022, we completed  the high-reach demolition of structures and  processing equipment on site and progressed  reprofiling and rehabilitation works. We are  engaging with Miriwoong and Gija Traditional  Owners on how to best support and expand  meaningful participation as we progress  closure activities. Gove refinery and residue disposal areas While mining continues at our Gove bauxite  operations in the Northern Territory in Australia,  we are implementing progressive closure  activities, including the decommissioning and  demolition of the refinery and progressive  capping of the bauxite residue disposal areas.  In 2022, we completed the relocation of  essential services, including electrical and  water, from the refinery footprint to begin   safe demolition. This work supports the security  of services for the town of Nhulunbuy  post closure. Ranger uranium mine Energy Resources of Australia (ERA) is  rehabilitating the Ranger uranium mine in the  Northern Territory, Australia. We are committed  to the successful rehabilitation of Ranger to a  standard that will establish an environment  similar to the adjacent Kakadu National Park,  a World Heritage site. We acknowledge the  Traditional Owners, the Mirarr people’s,  consistent opposition to developing the  Jabiluka uranium deposit and restate our full  support for ERA’s commitment that the deposit  would never be developed without the Mirarr  people’s consent. Our utmost priority and  commitment is to the rehabilitation of the  Ranger Project Area in a way that is consistent  with the wishes of the Mirarr people.  ===== PAGE 74 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 72 We partner with universities, governments and  other organisations to find opportunities to  repurpose and reprocess mineral and industrial  waste, improve treatment and valorisation of  mining-influenced waters, and explore the  social aspects of mine closure.  For example:   – We joined the Mining Microbiome Analytics  Platform project to identify microbes that  could help the industry mine and remediate  sites more sustainably. For more information,  see our website.   – Through our joint venture partnership with  Regeneration Enterprises, we developed  partnership strategies on re-mining and  remediation of two legacy assets. We have  engaged key technology, research and  development, and ecological partners in our  closure work.    – We joined the National Alliance for Water  Innovation, a public-private partnership that  brings together a team of industry and  academic partners. The team examines the  critical technical barriers and research  needed to radically lower the cost and  energy of desalination to secure an  affordable, energy-efficient and resilient  water supply for the US economy.   – We continued engagement in partnership  with the Gove Peninsula Futures Reference  Group (GPRFG) to plan for a sustainable  future for Nhulunbuy and the Gove Peninsula  post-mining for the benefit of Yolngu land  owners, local communities and businesses.  Members include the Gumatj and Rirratjingu  Traditional Owners, the Northern Land  Council, the Northern Territory Government,  Australian Government and Rio Tinto.  Learn how the GPRFG is supporting a  positive transition on their website  govefutures.nt.gov.au For more information about closure provisions and financial  statements, see page 182. Following ERA’s announcement of cost and  schedule overruns in February 2022, we  sought to work constructively with ERA’s  Independent Board Committee (IBC) to find a  funding solution to meet its rehabilitation  obligations. This included engaging for several  months on an interim entitlement offer that was  deferred by the IBC in July 2022 when its  proposed terms failed to obtain major  shareholder support.  In October 2022, ERA’s IBC resigned as  directors of ERA to allow for the introduction   of new perspectives to address the  rehabilitation costs. While a funding solution for the rehabilitation   is being identified and agreed by new ERA  Independent Directors, we agreed to amend   an existing A$100 million credit facility to assist  ERA with its management of immediate  liquidity issues. Together with ERA and other key stakeholders  including the Mirarr people, we supported the  recent amendments to the Atomic Energy Act  1953 (Cth), which will allow rehabilitation  activities at Ranger to extend beyond the  previously legislated timeframe of  January 2026.  Legacy assets We manage over 90 legacy assets in nine  countries. Where appropriate, we rehabilitate  these sites and work with local stakeholders to  transition them to their next use. For example,  at Mount Rosser in Jamaica, an inactive bauxite  reside storage facility, we have covered 95%   of the site with vegetation, seeing a diverse   and sustainable mix of plant species all   using a top-soil-free rehabilitation method.  We progressed rehabilitation at Pohatcong,  a packaging site in New Jersey, US by  completing in-situ thermal remediation to   treat and eliminate contaminates in soil.  In France, we completed our post-mining  obligations at Le Thoronet, a former bauxite  mine, and handed back the site to the French  authorities for monitoring and maintenance.  We continue to work in partnership with the  French Ministry of Ecological Transition to  further restore the site and create a diverse  space with public hiking trails set to open  in 2023. We continued work on our GISTM compliance  plan, and in 2022, we strengthened our  knowledge of legacy sites. Strengthening our approach We completed six asset closure strategies  in 2022, now in place for 38 of our operations.  These strategies create a progressive vision for  future land use after our operations cease and  focus on opportunities to reduce closure costs  and risks over the asset lifecycle. All of our  operating sites have closure plans. We review  these plans regularly to align with stakeholder  expectations and to incorporate lessons learned  from other closure projects. At operations   with joint ownership structures, we work in  partnership with other asset owners to ensure  closure is considered throughout asset design,  planning and operations. Working in partnership Successful closure needs to align with the  expectations of host communities and  governments. We are developing new  approaches to engagement, such as   co-creation of the future use and landform,  co-execution and co-governance. To achieve  this, we are working with host communities,  including Indigenous partners, on rehabilitation,  revegetation and long-term monitoring at  many sites.  We look for opportunities across our portfolio  to contribute to decarbonisation efforts for the  communities where we operate. For example,  at our Gove bauxite operations, we are working  to introduce solar power into the grid to  support sustainable power for the region  beyond mining.  Planet continued The slow journey from red  mud to green plants A once-barren area that for decades was the  collection point for red mud, which is waste  related to bauxite processing, Mount Rosser   in Jamaica is now an area of increasing plant  and animal diversity. It is replete with lessons  about ecology, chemistry, botany, relationships  with local communities, and the importance   of steadfast perseverance. Above all, this  decades-long remediation project demonstrates  that progress is possible even when there is no  easy solution.

They want to  know that we conduct ourselves responsibly and that suppliers  and customers across our value chain do so as well.  To help us continue to run a transparent, values-based   and ethical business, in 2022 we updated our Code of   Conduct – The Way We Work, which we launched internally in  February 2023. We also trained 24,857 of our people in how to  recognise and manage business integrity dilemmas and further  developed our confidential reporting programme myVoice. Team meeting at the Brisbane corporate hub, Australia.  ===== PAGE 76 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 74 Transparent, values-based and ethical business continued We want our people and partners to uphold the  highest standard of integrity, act ethically and  do the right thing. Sometimes this requires  courage, which is one of our three values.  2022 progress Business integrity During 2022, we delivered several compliance  programme improvements to ensure we  continued to be in line with our current  business integrity risks. We are exposed to  reputational, financial and non-financial risk  through the actions of third parties we engage  with. We are updating our Third-Party Risk  Management programme so we can optimise  risk assessments, processes, systems and  tools, and improve integration with other  associated business processes. We are also  managing our risk exposure to economic  sanctions, monitoring new sanctions and  continuing our ongoing assessment of our  supply chains.  In 2022, we focused on how we monitor   key fraud controls. We conducted a fraud  risk assessment and reviewed the current  measures we have in place to prevent and  detect fraud risk. This will help us better  understand the root causes of fraud and   how we can improve our response. We also updated our data privacy standard,  which sets out the minimum requirements for  how to collect and process personal data.  Our monitoring now covers requirements of   the data privacy programme. Annual training We know that our reputation as a business that  acts ethically and with integrity depends on   the actions and decisions we make every day.  We empower our people to seek guidance  when faced with an ethical or business integrity  dilemma – both to prevent incidents from  occurring, and to protect them and others from  harm. To help our workforce navigate grey  areas and spot business integrity red flags, we  have developed an online training course that  challenges them to make ethical decisions  through a number of interactive scenarios.  Our online business integrity induction training  provides all new joiners with an introduction to  ethics and compliance as well as the tools they  need to recognise and understand business  integrity risks. In addition to online training, the  Ethics and Compliance team provides ongoing  targeted face-to-face sessions on key risk  areas including bribery and corruption, data  privacy and competition. 24,857 employees  undertook compliance training in 2022 Code of Conduct In early 2023, we launched our updated Code  of Conduct – The Way We Work, which is  available on our website at www.riotinto.com.  Our Code of Conduct will work as a central tool  in reshaping our culture and it demonstrates  what living our values of care, courage and  curiosity should look like. The code sets out   our commitment to conducting business   with integrity and provides clarity about the  behaviours we expect and why responsible  business conduct matters. The new code is  broader in scope than our previous code and  reflects changes in both internal and societal  expectations regarding business conduct.  It will help our people reflect on the potential  impacts our decisions may have on the  business and others. Updates to our Code of  Conduct will be made available on our website  pursuant to relevant laws and regulations.  myVoice, our confidential reporting programme We have continued to develop our confidential  reporting programme myVoice, which is  designed to help our people voice concerns  about potential misconduct or improper  behaviour. Our care for our people and our  desire to understand contributing factors for  misconduct sit at the core of this programme.  The Business Conduct Office (BCO) is working  to increase transparency and improve how we  capture learnings from the myVoice programme  by expanding the team to include a reporting  and governance function. We continue to   see an increase in reporting and we believe   this means that more people are feeling  comfortable to share their concerns. In 2022,  we received 1,459 reports through the myVoice  programme channels. Of these cases, 63%  were substantiated, including 77 cases which  were reports received in 2021.  The BCO is currently implementing two key  recommendations from the Everyday Respect  Report that was released in February 2022.  We are setting up a discrete unit of experts  who will support and care for our people who  have been impacted by harmful and  disrespectful behaviours. The team will also be  available to support leaders and human  resources professionals in how to respond, and  other people who have been affected by those  behaviours. Separately we are also redesigning  our investigation process to make sure it is  trauma-informed, caring and people-centred.

Being open and transparent about our tax  payments, mineral development contracts,  beneficial ownership and our stance on   a range of other sustainability issues –   such as climate change – allows us to   enter into open, fact-based conversations   with our stakeholders, and provides a   better understanding of everyone’s roles  and responsibilities. We are recognised as a leader in transparent  tax reporting. We are a founding member of the  Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI)  and have actively supported EITI’s principles  and global transparency and accountability  standards since 2003. We are also a signatory  to the B Team Responsible Tax Principles.   Political integrity We do not favour any political party, group   or individual, or involve ourselves in party  political matters. We prohibit the use of funds  to support political candidates or parties. Our  business integrity procedure includes strict  guidelines for dealing with current and former  government officials and politicians, and they  cannot be appointed to senior employee  positions or engaged as consultants, in certain  circumstances, without the approval of  executive management and our Chief Ethics   & Compliance Officer. We regularly engage with governments and  share information and our experiences on  issues that affect our operations and our  industry. We join industry associations where  membership provides value to our business,  investors and other stakeholders. We outline  the principles that guide our participation and  the way we engage, as well as a list of the top  five associations by membership fees paid, on  our website riotinto.com/industryassociations.  We also track and disclose how we engage on  climate policy issues, disclosing when the  policies and advocacy positions adopted by  industry associations differ materially from  ours. We continue to strengthen our approach  and disclosures on industry associations.  Voluntary commitments, accreditations  and memberships We take part in a number of global, national  and regional organisations and initiatives that  inform our sustainability approach and  standards, which in turn allows us to better  manage our risks. These external organisations  and initiatives assess and recognise our  performance, and we participate in industry  accreditation programmes for some  of our products.

Our risk appetite Climate change and the low-carbon transition are at the heart of our strategy to  strengthen our resilience and pursue new growth opportunities and partnerships. Partnering to decarbonise   our assets Develop products and  technologies to support our  customers’ decarbonisation We partner with customers, competitors,  suppliers, technology developers,  governments and universities to find solutions.  We aim to spend $400 million every year  in research and development on the five  components of our technology roadmap:  health and safety, lightening our overall  environmental footprint, supporting growth,  decarbonising our business and our products,  and improving productivity. Grow in materials that meet  demand for energy transition We focus on excelling in development, and  being the best operator in commodities   essential for the drive to net zero. We continue to consider higher-risk jurisdictions  and broadening our target commodities. We aim to spend up to $3 billion on growth capital  every year, while maintaining capital discipline in  pursuit of value-accretive opportunities. Our determination to be the best operator and have impeccable environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials is underpinned  by our zero tolerance for non-compliance with our operational procedures, laws and obligations. These expectations are outlined in our  Group policies, standards and procedures, which are published on our website at riotinto.com/policies. Our targets are to reduce our Scope 1 and 2  emissions by 15% by 2025, and by 50% by  2030 (relative to 2018 levels) and reach net  zero by 2050. We estimate that we will invest $7.5 billion in  capital between 2022 and 2030 to deliver our  decarbonisation strategy. When we evaluate our decarbonisation  projects, we consider five elements: value,  materiality of abatement, maturity of emission  reduction, competitiveness versus internal and  external benchmarks, and alignment with our  net zero 2050 target.

In addition,  the operational management committees of our product groups  and Group functions also oversee risk management in their area  of responsibility, with insights from assurance and compliance activities.  Governance structure supporting our risk management framework At the front-line operational level, all employees are required and  empowered to identify and manage the risks that arise within their  area of responsibility. This governance structure supports our  risk management framework and enables effective management  of material risks. Our risk management process can be  described as a Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle.  We monitor how well we manage material risks  to our objectives by checking and verifying the  implementation of our response plans (actions  and controls) and our actual performance  against objectives. We enhance the check- and-verify step by applying the three lines of  defence approach. Set strategy,  objectives and  risk appetite Risk analysis Identify and evaluate  risks to our strategy  and objectives Risk management Implement controls  and actions to  manage risks within  risk appetite Assurance Check and verify that  controls and actions  are effective in  managing the risks Communication Communicate  current and emerging  risk exposure Improvement Improve controls   and actions  according to  risk appetite  ===== PAGE 80 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 78 Risk management continued Emerging risks  Emerging risks are highly uncertain by nature. As a company, we are  exposed to many complex and sometimes interrelated risks, due to the  number of commodities we produce and our global footprint. We track  leading indicators of emerging risks and their likely impact on us and the  communities where we operate. We proactively analyse the impact of  these risks through plausible scenarios of the interplay of the global  megatrends, as outlined in the Strategy section on page 12. We are impacted by growing geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic  uncertainty that could potentially impact global growth and affect market  volatility and sentiment. Cyber-security attacks have become more destructive. An emerging  area of exposure for the business is the rapid digitalisation and  transformation of operational technology environments.  Climate change and the low-carbon transition continues to provide both  upside and downside uncertainties for us. We address these uncertainties  under our principal risks 2, 3, 4 and 12 detailed in the following pages.  We closely monitor and assess the impact of climate change through  scenarios; see pages 152-153. Our 2022 Climate Change Report outlines  our current and future initiatives and partnerships, and how we aim to  work together to meet our Scope 1 and 2 targets and Scope 3 goals. Longer-term viability statement  Delivering our strategy depends on our four objectives: to be the best  operator; to achieve impeccable environmental, social and governance  (ESG) credentials; to excel in development; and to strengthen our social  licence. Our business model supporting our strategy is underpinned by  the quality of our assets, the capabilities of our people, our operational  and sustainability performance, innovative partnerships, and disciplined  capital allocation. For more information about our strategy and business  model, see pages 13-17. Our business planning processes include modelling a series of  macroeconomic scenarios and using various assumptions that consider  internal and external factors. As part of our robust risk management  framework, we closely track, monitor and mitigate principal risks to our  business plan. Viability assessment process and key assumptions The assumptions underlying our business plan and macroeconomic  forecast have the greatest level of certainty for the first three years. Our  longer-term viability assessment examines the first five years (2023-27)  of the business plan. This allows for a detailed analysis of the potential  impacts of risks materialising in quick succession in the first three years,  and enables us to further stress test the business plan for risk materialising  towards the end of the time period, although with less certainty.  This allows our Directors to assess the Group’s capacity to exercise  financial levers available in both the three-year and five-year time   frames to maintain our viability.  The Principal risks and uncertainties section outlines risks that could  materially affect our performance, future prospects or reputation.   For the viability assessment, we have considered our principal risks   that could severely impact the Group’s liquidity and solvency.  Assessment of viability Our longer-term viability assessment considers the following principal  risks and key assumptions.  Principal risk A – “Remaining competitive through economic cycles  or shocks” Scenario assumptions: Continued elevation of supply-side pressure and  sharp interest rate rises triggers stagflation and liquidity crises in  developing economies. A housing crisis leads to positive but low growth  in China. Commodity prices experience large negative pricing shocks in  2023, sustained through to 2027. Principal risk B – “Preventing fatalities, permanent disablements, and  illness from a major hazard or safety event” or ”Preventing material  business disruption and/or data breaches due to cyber events” Scenario assumptions: Occurrence of a singular catastrophic event  resulting from a major cyber-security breach or operational failure, such  as a tailings and water storage facility failure, extreme weather event or  underground or geotechnical event resulting in multiple fatalities,  cessation of operations and significant financial impacts. We have  assumed two such events occur within the assessment period, in 2023  and 2026.  Principal risk C – “Delivering on our growth projects” Scenario assumptions: Materialisation of a risk impacting our ESG  credentials (such as “building trusted relationships with Indigenous  peoples” and “building trusted relationships with communities”) and   our ability to deliver our growth strategy. We have assumed an impact   on our near-term key projects and considered available alternatives.  The assumed financial impact is in addition to any non-financial impact,  such as reputational damage to the Group or disruption to the culture  and way of life of the communities where we operate.  We quantify the expected financial impact of each risk based on internal  macroeconomic and business analysis, as well as internal and external  benchmarking on similar risks.  The first five years of our business plan have been stress tested for each  risk to assess the impact on the Group’s longer-term viability, including  whether additional financing facilities would be required. In addition to  liquidity and solvency, the assessment also considered other financial  performance metrics, as well as dividend payments. These metrics are  subject to robust stress tests and reverse stress tests. The most severe scenario, albeit unlikely, considers the financial impact  of all three risks materialising at the start of the assessment period,  followed by a second major hazard or cyber event occurring towards the  end of the five-year period. Without management action, this scenario  would create both an immediate and prolonged severe impact, resulting  in the Group’s free cash flow performance over the assessment period  being materially impacted.  We have a suite of management actions available to preserve resilience  through the assessment period, including accessing lines of credit,  reducing organic and inorganic growth capital expenditure, and raising  capital. Our financial flexibility could potentially be limited during the  peak of the crisis. The viability of the Group remained sound under all  tested scenarios.  We have also conducted reverse stress testing by assessing the impact  of reducing price levels, and we have concluded that the Group remains  viable in the very low probability of prolonged price declines across  all commodities.  Four factors underpin the resilience of our business model:    – The competitive position and diversification of our commodities portfolio.    – The disciplined capital allocation framework and commitment to  prudent financial policy.    – The payout shareholder return policy, which is based on earnings  and is, therefore, more sustainable.    – The focus on achieving impeccable ESG performance and  strengthening our social licence, which allows for growth and  maintaining access to debt capital and bank loan markets.  Considering our current position and the robust assessment of our  principal risks, the Directors have assessed the Group’s prospects over  the next five years (until 31 December 2027) and reasonably expect that  we will continue to operate and meet our liabilities as they fall due over  that period. However, in the long term, two principal risks with long-dated  consequences could potentially have a material impact on our viability:   – Growing our iron ore business to meet the demand for green steel.   – Leaving a positive legacy for future generations, by embedding  closure considerations throughout the lifespan of our assets. For more information see pages 81 and 86.  ===== PAGE 81 ===== 79 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Strategic report The principal risks and uncertainties outlined in this section reflect the risks that could materially  affect (negatively or positively) our ability to meet our strategic objectives. Principal risks and uncertainties A principal risk is one or a combination of risks  that emerge due to external or internal factors.  It could be of any nature, and manifest and  escalate from any part of the business as an  opportunity or a threat. Where risks are material  to the Group, they are escalated to the Risk  Management Committee and, as appropriate,  to the Board or its committees. This requires  a strong risk culture, which we continue to  develop and foster. To ensure we can prioritise our efforts and  resources, we regularly assess our principal  risks’ potential impact and likelihood. These  assessments, and the effectiveness of our  associated controls, reflect management’s current expectations, forecasts and assumptions.  By definition, they involve subjective judgments  and depend on changes in our internal and  external environments. While we deploy  preventative and mitigative controls to reduce  the likelihood of risks occurring, and manage  potential impacts, some inherent risks to our  business remain. These include natural  disasters, where there is limited capacity in the  international insurance markets to transfer such  risks. We closely monitor these threats and  develop business resilience plans. We also  seek to bring an equal level of rigour and  discipline to our managed and non-managed  joint ventures as we do to our wholly-owned  assets, through engagement and influence,  in line with applicable laws. The timeframe  of our principal risks is within five years unless  explicitly stated otherwise. The principal risks,  uncertainties and trends outlined in this report  should be considered forward-looking  statements and are subject to the cautionary  statement on page 347. This year, we have reframed our principal risks  in the context of our overarching strategic  objectives: to be the best operator; to achieve  impeccable environmental, social and  governance (ESG) credentials; to excel in  development; and to strengthen our social  licence. These are summarised in the table.

Transforming our culture, enabling us to live  our values Sharing and demonstrating our values unlocks opportunities  in everything we do. We are working on building a workplace  where all our people are trusted and empowered to be their  best selves and help drive change.  Strategic alignment Best operator Opportunities Our values inspire our people to contribute in ways that align with our  purpose and strategic direction, enabling us to build a workplace where  everyone feels safe, respected and included.  Threats As societal expectations are changing, and higher standards are placed  on organisations, we must ensure that we are consistently displaying and  living our values. Without change or action, our ability to attract and retain  partners and talented people will be negatively impacted. The trust from  host communities and countries may also be weakened, limiting our  operating licence and growth opportunities. In February 2022, we released the findings and recommendations from an  independent review of our workplace culture (Everyday Respect Report).  The findings in this report also aligned with the recommended actions  coming from the Parliament of Western Australia’s Inquiry into Sexual  Harassment in the Mining Industry, released in June 2022. Both reports  highlighted the scale of change required in our business and across the  resources sector.  Risk oversight The Group Executive Committee and the Board.  Management’s response We embarked on a culture change programme led by the refresh of our  values in 2021. We have accelerated this work in 2022 through the  Everyday Respect task force. In 2022, we also updated our Code of  Conduct – The Way We Work (launched in early 2023), to be clearer and  more comprehensive. It acts as the blueprint for our key principles, sets  out our commitments to stakeholders and clarifies how we expect our  people to behave.  To help our leaders and teams live our values, we have:   – Launched our updated purpose and values, supported by internal  communications and leadership training.   – Launched several Everyday Respect task force workstreams to  address sexual harassment, bullying and racism in our workplace; built  safe and appropriate facilities; and encouraged caring, human- centred responses to disrespectful and harmful behaviours.   – Improved our internal whistleblowing programme, myVoice, which is  open to employees and external stakeholders to report on behaviour  inconsistent with our values and Code of Conduct.   – Introduced behavioural training for leaders to encourage care  and respect. 2. Achieving our decarbonisation  targets competitively Climate change continues to be at the heart of our strategy,  and our ability to deliver on our objectives hinges on   achieving our Scope 1 and 2 targets between now and 2050.  Finding a balance between our ESG commitments and our  need to invest for growth will support us in leaving a positive  legacy and delivering superior shareholder returns while  remaining competitive. Strategic alignment Impeccable ESG Opportunities Decarbonising our assets can enhance our competitive advantage   and embed a culture of energy efficiency that could benefit our host  communities. Renewable energy projects will likely provide energy in  excess of our needs at certain times, improving the availability of  renewable energy in the communities where we operate. We are also in a strong position to be the leading supplier of green  materials to support the energy transition in North America due to a range  of beneficial factors, such as our government partnerships, deep  technological capability, advanced critical minerals research, competitive  energy access and port infrastructure. Threats Delays in priority initiatives will threaten our Scope 1 and 2 target delivery  and our ability to respond proactively and competitively. Our ability to  successfully engage and partner with governments and other external  parties to achieve grid decarbonisation is a fundamental uncertainty,  particularly for our 2025 targets as we continue to develop our pipeline of  decarbonisation projects. The rate of progress towards our targets could  expose us to reputation and litigation risks. Key exposures Our 2026 to 2030 target delivery relies on abatement from technologies  still in the research and development phase. Risk oversight The Risk Management Committee and the Board. Management’s response We have:   – Committed $7.5 billion in capital expenditure to the delivery of our targets  through six large abatement programmes (including 95% of our Scope 1  and 2 emissions) focused on renewables (including 1GW in the Pilbara,  130MW at Richards Bay Minerals and 4GW at our Pacific Aluminium  Operations), ELYSIS, process heat (Yarwun, Queensland Alumina Limited)  and diesel, supplemented by nature-based solutions and offsets.   – Prioritised carbon abatement projects based on five key elements:  value, materiality of abatement, maturity of emission reduction,  competitiveness versus internal and external benchmarks, and  alignment with the net zero 2050 target.   – Established a dedicated team (Rio Tinto Energy Development) to  support the delivery of large-scale renewable solutions (primarily wind  and solar) that are required across our major energy regions.   – Set up a dedicated Energy and Climate Change Centre of Excellence,  currently focusing on assessing our exposure to physical climate  change risks and capability uplift throughout the organisation.   – Developed several innovations including establishing the Office of the  Chief Scientist; dedicating more than 500 employees to research and  development across Canada, France, Australia and the UK; and  establishing an Innovation and Technology Centre in China to partner   with universities, governments, research laboratories and startups.    – Continued to address our Scope 3 emissions by supporting our  customers in their decarbonisation journey (see our 2022 Climate  Change Report for details), providing low-carbon products (such as  aluminium from ELYSIS) and reducing our CO2 emissions intensity in  shipping by 40% by 2025 (currently over 30% to date).   – Joined partnerships to develop a zero-carbon fleet; for example, we are  piloting battery-powered trucks with Komatsu in 2025 and Caterpillar  in 2026.   ===== PAGE 83 ===== 81 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Strategic report 3. Delivering on our growth projects Our growth strategy relies on the success of our exploration  (greenfield and brownfield) and acquisition activities in  addition to our ability to develop these resources faster and  more competitively than others, while aiming for impeccable  ESG credentials. However, developing these projects  requires complex multi-year study and execution plans,  which carry significant delivery risks.  Strategic alignment Excel in development Opportunities Active and focused exploration and business development efforts can  potentially increase or diversify our commodity resource base. We may  convert a greater proportion of resources to reserves more competitively  through operational efficiencies, deployment of new technologies or  improved understanding of our orebodies. Threats New high-quality deposits are increasingly scarce, and those that are  known require advances in processing technology, significant capital  investment in infrastructure, or would negatively impact our ESG credentials.  Additionally, as studies and projects progress, they are susceptible to  changes in technical requirements, approvals, societal expectations,  or underlying commercial or economic assumptions that could impact  economic viability. Key exposures The Oyu Tolgoi underground expansion, and increasing approval   time frames in the Pilbara and in projects including Simandou,  Resolution Copper, Jadar, Rincon and Winu. Risk oversight The Investment Committee, the Ore Reserves Steering Committee and  the Board. Management’s response We have:   – Focused on excelling in development to deliver inorganic and organic  growth by increasing alignment across the Group. We have leveraged  our in-house capabilities better (including our Exploration teams,  technical Centres of Excellence, Business Development team,  the Battery Materials team, and Specialised Projects and  Studies division).   – Focused on our ambition to invest up to $3 billion per year of growth  capital expenditure, which includes energy transition commodities,  such as copper, battery materials, high-grade iron ore and critical  minerals (rhenium, tellurium, scandium, selenium).   – Broadened our scope to include higher-risk jurisdictions and targets,  and considered minimum viable projects that can grow and create  optionality or are a strategic fit.   – Introduced a stage-gate approval process that included progress  monitoring to ensure capital discipline for projects.   – Ensured robust ESG and human rights due diligence during merger  and acquisition assessments and in new country entries. 4. Growing our iron ore business to   meet demand for green steel Steel decarbonisation will affect the value of iron ore.  We have an opportunity to unlock business value by  optimising our iron ore product strategy, partnering with  technology providers and universities, and innovating with  our customers to meet future demand for green steel. Strategic alignment Best operator Opportunities We are working with our customers, universities and technology  providers to develop and test technologies that will realise value from  our Pilbara Ore. Some examples of current active partnerships include  Baowu, Nippon Steel Corporation, POSCO, BlueScope, Shougang  Group, Australian National University and Nottingham University.  More information about our partnerships is available on our website. Threats The iron and steel process routes required to decarbonise the steel  industry may not favour our Pilbara low- and mid-grade ores, impacting  the competitiveness of the Iron Ore portfolio. The transition of the steel  value chain towards net zero will need new technologies and extensive  industry transformation. Risk oversight The Steel Decarbonisation Steering Committee and the Board. Management’s response We have:   – Adjusted our Iron Ore portfolio to bring high-grade ore to the market  (for example, our Simandou project).   – Established the Steel Decarbonisation team to identify and develop  technical and commercial options through strong partnerships across  the steel value chain with projects focused on:   – Improving existing processes, such as blast furnace optimisation.    – Pilbara ore characterisation and beneficiation through partnerships  with a number of universities.   – Partnerships with customers to develop and test new technologies  suitable for Pilbara ore (such as BioIronTM).  ===== PAGE 84 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 82 Principal risks and uncertainties continued 5. Remaining competitive through economic  cycles or shocks We aim to remain competitive, preserve resilience and  maintain access to debt capital and bank loan markets by  having cost-competitive assets, a diversified commodities  portfolio, a strong balance sheet, prudent financial policies  and strong ESG credentials. Strategic alignment Best operator Opportunities Favourable market conditions and strong internal capital discipline allow  us to leverage our balance sheet strength, enabling us to invest in growth  opportunities, pay down debt and enhance returns to shareholders. We  may convert a greater proportion of our resources to reserves through  operational efficiencies, deployment of new technologies or improved  understanding of our orebodies. An emerging opportunity is the potential  to leverage our strong ESG credentials as the number of ESG-focused  investors grows.  Threats A deteriorating economic and political environment could lead to   cost inflation, falling commodity prices (reduced cash flow, limiting  profitability), trade actions (increased tariffs, retaliations and sanctions),  and governments’ exerting more control over their natural resources by  changing contractual, regulatory or tax measures. This could impact our  key markets, operations or investments. Failure to secure mining approvals, replenish reserves, capture the  benefits of new technologies or a material reduction in commodity price  may reduce the volume of existing reserves and the future conversion of  resources to reserves in the required timeframe. Risk oversight The Financial Risk Management Committee, the Risk Management  Committee and the Board. Management’s response We have:   – Implemented the Safe Production System (SPS), which is helping us  transform how we operate our assets, better manage performance   and empower our people. SPS will help us consistently deliver  outstanding safety and production results, and improve our asset   and equipment reliability and maintenance (for example, at our  Boyne Smelter and Kitimat).   – Maintained and assured compliance with the Group’s Resources   and Reserves Standard through our Orebody Knowledge Centre of  Excellence, which also monitors KPIs to track variation from expected  asset production plans.    – Kept capital discipline in line with a strong investment-grade credit  rating, including investment governance processes, and maintained a  strong balance sheet and a payout Shareholder Returns Policy that  adjusts returns through the cycle. In addition, we are diversifying  funding sources in different capital markets and shelf programmes,  and we continue to maintain and renew the revolving credit facility. 6. Withstanding impacts of geopolitics on our  trade or investments Geopolitics has the potential to increase trade tensions and  undermine rule-based trading systems and possible trade  actions (increased tariffs, retaliation, sanctions) that impact  our key markets, operations or investments. It may limit   any benefits of being a multinational company with a   global footprint and may expose us further to these risks.  Any presence in politically unstable countries exacerbates  this risk.  Strategic alignment Best operator Opportunities By working closely with governments on balanced domestic policy  proposals that bring long-term economic and social benefits for the  country, we can also support growth and investments for our business.  In addition, global geopolitical re-alignments include the creation of new  strategic alliances between countries that could create partnership and  growth opportunities, such as the security of critical minerals supply.  Threats A deteriorating economic and political environment could lead to falling  commodity prices (reduced cash flow, limiting profitability), trade actions  (increased tariffs, retaliations and sanctions), and governments’ exerting  more control over their natural resources by changing contractual,  regulatory or tax measures. This could impact our key markets,  operations or investments. Key exposures A highly uncertain and unstable global macro environment, including  Indo-Pacific tensions and the indirect impacts of the war in Ukraine, can  impact our business. Rising energy costs across Europe could potentially  affect demand in the region, which in turn would impact our aluminium  and minerals markets in Europe.  Risk oversight The Financial Risk Management Committee, the Risk Management  Committee and the Board. Management’s response We have:   – Continued to diversify our portfolio of commodities (focusing on green  alternatives and minerals), markets and jurisdictions to reduce  exposure to specific geopolitical events. Some recent examples  include our acquisition of the Rincon Lithium Project in Argentina and  development of the Simandou high-grade iron ore project in Guinea.   – Established a fully resourced External Affairs function to closely monitor  the political and geopolitical environment to identify possible  opportunities for the Group through engagement with governments, civil  society organisations, industry associations and international bodies.   – Implemented the updated new country entry Group procedure and  focused on cross-functional, real-time engagement.   – Implemented the new sanctions standard and export control  procedure to mitigate against potential breaches of economic  sanctions and trade controls. We monitor the political environments  where we operate and engage with the government in those areas.   – Secured a capability to settle and receive renminbi (RMB), including  management of central bank digital currency (CBDC) transactions to  mitigate the potential impact of trade tensions on key Chinese  customers’ access to credit and USD.  ===== PAGE 85 ===== 83 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Strategic report 7. Attracting, developing and retaining people  with the requisite skills  Our ability to achieve our business strategy depends on  attracting, developing and retaining a wide range of internal  and external skilled and experienced people. Strategic alignment Best operator Opportunities Investing in critical skills and supporting internal career pathways will  result in enhanced productivity, innovation and business resilience.  Increasing investment in local employment will also support our social  licence to operate. And developing partnerships, including with joint  ventures, can also help us access future talent. Threats Lacking the right capability may result in our business experiencing  delays or underperformance. Tight labour markets and entry into new  countries result in heightened competition for critical skills; for example,  in climate change, energy, decarbonisation, technical mining and  processing skills, and community relations. Changing societal expectations  place pressure on our brand as an employer, and require us to become  better at communicating who we are and what we stand for. Key exposures Since the pandemic, talent is less inclined to relocate, and our reliance on  local or national recruitment is therefore increasing, which significantly  reduces the market size for sourcing talent. Risk oversight The Board. Management’s response We have:   – Focused on critical roles and expertise in decarbonisation.   – Continued to monitor the global talent market, and developments and  trends, including talent mobility.   – Focused on talent management and planning across our global assets  and looked for critical technical capabilities.   – Undertaken our bi-annual People Surveys to track engagement, and  updated our engagement strategy and retention modelling.    – Developed Group-wide employee value propositions tailored by  labour market and talent segment to help us retain and attract talent.   – Launched a talent acquisition strategy, targeting multiple labour  markets and a diverse range of skills.   – Continued to focus on local trainee programmes, our global graduate  programme, and strategic partnerships with universities and other  future skills development partnerships. 8. Building trusted relationships with  Indigenous peoples Our partnerships with Indigenous peoples play a material role  in our ability to operate. A breakdown in these relationships  could impact our business and our reputation. By building  respectful and enduring relationships with Indigenous partners  and communities, we remain committed to finding better  ways to move forward with the communities that host us. Strategic alignment Social licence Opportunities We have the opportunity to work closely with Indigenous peoples to  realise long-term socioeconomic, cultural and environmental benefits.  Our capacity to deliver value to host communities and Indigenous  peoples of the lands and waters on which we operate supports our  current and future growth plans; for example, in the Pilbara, in the  Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean region, and with our existing partnerships at  the Iron Ore Company of Canada and at BC Works. Threats Mining activities could strain relationships with Indigenous peoples,  particularly where actual or perceived damage of significant cultural  values (cumulative or acute) occurs without consultation and consent.  This could result in a loss of trust and could impact our social licence  to operate. This was evident after the destruction of two ancient rock  shelters at Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara region in 2020 and the impact it  had on the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people. Key exposures Our Resolution Copper project and the modernisation of agreements in  the Pilbara. Risk oversight The Ethics and Compliance Committee and the Sustainability Committee. Management’s response We have:   – Demonstrated our commitment to building long-term trusted  relationships, such as establishing the Juukan Gorge Legacy  Foundation with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura Aboriginal  Corporation, and co-designing an approach to protect significant  social and cultural heritage values as part of our proposed  development of the Western Range iron ore project in the Pilbara  region of Western Australia.   – Implemented an integrated cultural heritage management system and  embedded social considerations in approvals and decision-making  processes at all levels of the organisation.   – Built cultural responsiveness and competence (including for cultural  heritage) across our leadership teams and workforce.   – Strengthened consultation, meaningful engagement, and free, prior  and informed consent (FPIC) processes.   – Set clear guidance on how we should conduct our business, no matter  where we work or where we are from, through our updated Code of  Conduct – The Way We Work (launched in early 2023), communities  and social performance standard, and Human Rights Policy. Detailed updates on our progress on the commitments we made after the  destruction of the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge are outlined on page 55  and in the 2022 Communities and Social Performance Disclosure Report.  ===== PAGE 86 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 84 Principal risks and uncertainties continued 9. Building trusted relationships  with communities Our relationships with the communities where we operate  and broader society can affect our social licence to operate.  If communities and host countries do not see us as a trusted  partner, it could negatively impact our performance, future  prospects and reputation. We develop long-lasting  relationships with the communities where we operate and  ensure they share in our success. Strategic alignment Social licence Opportunities Strong relationships with the communities in which we operate provide  stable operating environments. Positive engagement with communities,  governments and other stakeholders can support access to new resources,  create predictable investment, strengthen human rights, and help shape  mutually beneficial economic, social and environmental outcomes. Threats Access to land and resources could be impacted if we are not considered  a trusted partner that respects people’s rights, manages adverse social  and environmental impacts, and sustainably improves the social and  economic outcomes in host communities where we operate or plan to  operate. A loss of trust could also result in operational disruption, security  incidents, expropriation, export or foreign investment restrictions,  increased government regulation and delays in approvals, which could  threaten our prospects and reputation. Key exposures Richards Bay Minerals, Resolution Copper, QIT Madagascar Minerals,  Oyu Tolgoi, Jadar and Simandou. Risk oversight The Sustainability Committee. Management’s response  We have:   – Strengthened community engagement through appropriately  resourced and skilled Communities and Social Performance (CSP)  teams, and clear accountability for relationships with host communities  residing with the asset leader.   – Delivered sustainable, long-term outcomes through strategic social  investment for impact, regional economic development and mutually  beneficial partnerships.   – Implemented our revised Human Rights Policy and communities and  social performance standard.   – Set local procurement policies and targets, including local content  commitments for major capital projects.    – Implemented human rights due diligence to improve our understanding  of potential harms and to mitigate their occurrence wherever possible.   – Deployed specialist technical resources, where required, to support  business units in managing more complex issues and risks. 10. Conducting our business with integrity,  while complying with all laws, regulations  and obligations Our determination to be the best operator and have  impeccable ESG credentials is underpinned by our zero  tolerance for non-compliance with our operational  procedures, laws and obligations. These expectations are  outlined in our Group policies, standards and procedures,  published on our website at riotinto.com/policies.  Strategic alignment Impeccable ESG Opportunities Good corporate citizens that operate to high ethical standards are known  to contribute to a healthy workplace culture, outperform peers and  attract better talent, leading to greater success in securing access to  resources and investment opportunities. Threats If our operations or value chain experienced a serious breach in  anti-corruption legislation and sanctions, human rights, anti-trust rules   or inappropriate business conduct, this could cause serious harm to  people and significant reputational and financial damage. Risk oversight The Ethics and Compliance Committee and the Board. Management’s response We have:   – Maintained an effective risk-informed Business Integrity Compliance  Programme across the Group.   – Integrated our commitments to core business and human rights  standards, including the UN Guiding Principles on Business and  Human Rights, into our business plans and actions.   – Dedicated legal and compliance teams to help us identify, understand  and comply with current and emerging regulatory obligations.    – Developed a Litigation and Regulatory team and Areas of Expertise for  anti-bribery, corruption and competition.   – Overseen principal risk areas and assessed cultural indicators via   the Board and the Group Ethics and Compliance Committee,   which includes Executive Committee members and is chaired by   the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer.   – Maintained management oversight and reporting through risk,  assurance and compliance forums with operational and functional  teams, supported by ethics and compliance risk management  review forums.   – Assured compliance with our policies, standards and procedures,  including the business integrity standard and procedure, the third party  due diligence procedure and human rights due diligence in the supply  chain. We have implemented the Voluntary Principles on Security and  Human Rights and a strong security management framework.   – Investigated all concerns raised in a prompt and confidential manner,  and kept reporters safe from any retaliation. Our whistleblowing  programme is managed by our Business Conduct Office.   ===== PAGE 87 ===== 85 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Strategic report 11. Preventing fatalities, permanent disablements,  and illness from a major hazard or safety event Nothing is more important than the safety and wellbeing of  our employees, contractors and communities. The mining  industry is inherently hazardous, with the potential to cause  illness or injury, damage to the environment and disruption   to communities. Our objective is first and foremost to have  zero fatalities. We believe all incidents and injuries are  preventable, so our focus is on identifying, managing and,  where possible, eliminating risks.  Strategic alignment Best operator Opportunities Demonstrating that we can meet or exceed our commitments in safety  and hazard management supports our ability to attract and retain talent  and helps us achieve our objective of impeccable ESG credentials. Threats Major hazards include process safety, underground mining, slope  geotechnical and tailings management. Failure to manage our major  hazards could result in a catastrophic event or other long-term damage.  Loss of technical capability at complex end-of-life underground mines  poses a significant risk. While not considered major hazards, significant risks at our sites are  falling objects, fall from height, and vehicles and driving, the top three  causes of potentially fatal incidents (PFIs), which could result in multiple  fatalities across the Group. Key exposures Our underground operations such as Diavik, Oyu Tolgoi and Kennecott.  Process safety at our refineries, smelters, and tailings and water storage  facilities, where we are currently implementing the Global Industry  Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM). Risk oversight The Major Hazards Steering Committee, the Risk Management Committee  and the Sustainability Committee. Management’s response We have:   – Conducted quarterly Major Hazard Steering Committee meetings at  each product group, overseen by the Sustainability Committee and  supported by the Group’s Risk Management Committee. Regular updates  on Major Hazards are provided to the Sustainability Committee.   – Established the Centre of Excellence for key technical capability in  hazard and asset management and developed (and assured against)  the Group standards and procedures.    – Implemented technical and safety standards and procedures for slope  geotechnical, tailings management, underground mining and process  safety. We revised underground standards in the fourth quarter of 2021  and the first quarter of 2022, and launched an associated control  library in the Risk Management Information System (Archer).    – Focused on fatality elimination through our critical risk management.    – Reported, investigated and shared learnings from Health, Safety,  Environment and Security (HSES) incidents, such as PFIs, across the  Group. We monitor HSES performance at the Group level monthly   and discuss trends and actions at the quarterly Safety and  Operations Committee.   – Included safety targets in personal performance metrics to incentivise  safe behaviours and effective risk management (as outlined in the  Remuneration report on page 121). 12. Minimise our impact on the environments  we work in and build physical resilience to  changes in those environments, including  climate change and natural disasters  By producing the materials the world needs, we have an  effect on the environment. Our operations and projects are  inherently hazardous, requiring proactive management to  minimise potential impact on water resources or biodiversity  in existing operations, new asset developments and closures. Strategic alignment Impeccable ESG Opportunities By understanding specific exposures across our portfolio, our capital  programmes can incorporate measures to minimise environmental  impact and improve resilience in the event of a natural disaster or  extreme climatic event.  Additionally, the development of a carbon-credit business, in collaboration  with governments and host communities, could generate carbon and  biodiversity credits for the Group. This could be achieved while  remediating disturbed lands, protecting existing pristine areas and  supporting the development of associated socioeconomic opportunities  independent of mining (and therefore addressing dependencies). Threats A number of our operations and future development opportunities exist  within, or close to, sensitive biodiverse regions. To strengthen our licence  to operate, we must demonstrate our capability to protect ecosystems  through improved practices and technological solutions. Natural disasters  or extreme weather events can also endanger our employees and  communities, damage our assets or cause significant operational  interruption. Given the inherent uncertainty in future climate projections,  longer-term exposures to chronic changes in climate are not yet  well understood.  Key exposures Our operations in the Pilbara and the Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean region,  QIT Madagascar Minerals, Simandou and Richards Bay Minerals. Risk oversight The Sustainability Committee. Management’s response We have:   – Mapped our exposure at each asset through initiatives such as   our critical risk assessment (CRA) programme, asset integrity  assurance, and climate change physical impact assessments.  These programmes have helped us identify vulnerabilities across   our portfolio, as disclosed in our Task Force on Climate-related  Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reporting.   – Engaged with international civil society organisations, governments  and environment departments to support protective legislation.   – Applied protective principles at all our operations rather than adopting  a compliance-driven approach.   – Actively supported and reported our practices against the  commitments outlined in the International Council on Mining and  Metals’ position statement on water stewardship, being to apply strong  and transparent water governance; manage water at operations  effectively; and collaborate to achieve responsible and sustainable  water use.   – Developed business resilience plans, emergency response plans,  training and annual exercises to prepare for a natural disaster  and developed plans to communicate and coordinate with local,  regional and state agencies.   – Developed key natural disaster resilience projects in the Pilbara,  including the Cape Lambert Jetty and Wharf upgrades.  ===== PAGE 88 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 86 Principal risks and uncertainties continued 13. Leaving a positive legacy for future  generations, by embedding closure  considerations throughout the lifespan   of our assets We aspire to leave a positive legacy for future generations.  We do this in partnership with our stakeholders, by embedding  closure considerations throughout the entire lifespan of   our assets – in the way we design, build, run, close and  transition them.  Strategic alignment Social licence Opportunities Together with our stakeholders, we actively assess opportunities   to repurpose and reuse sites for future economic or social benefit.  For existing operations, where possible, we have early engagement   with our stakeholders and communities and aim to rehabilitate land  progressively throughout the life of the operations.  Threats Plans and financial obligations for closure, reclamation and rehabilitation  may be insufficient due to changes in stakeholders’ and communities’  sentiments and expectations, legislation, standards, technical understanding  and techniques. In addition to significant health, safety and environmental  consequences, the manifestation of a major closure risk could impact   the Group’s reputation and our licence to operate globally. The legacy  portfolio continues to retain a level of uncertainty due to the lack of  historical information and ongoing studies to determine options for  future management.  Key exposures Our Pilbara near-term closures (including Channar), Argyle, Gove and  Energy Resources of Australia, as well as other legacy sites. Risk oversight The Closure Steering Committee and the Sustainability Committee. Management’s response We have:   – Continued to develop asset closure strategies (ACS) for each  operating asset to identify the key closure risks and opportunities and  ensure alignment between business, operational and closure-planning  processes. Our aim is to mitigate liabilities and deliver efficient and  effective outcomes. We are required to update the ACS, closure plan  and closure cost estimate at least every five years over the life of  the asset.   – Established the Iron Ore Rehabilitation and Closure Committee,   which focuses on prioritising resources and ensuring a holistic  approach to closures in the Pilbara.   – Formed a dedicated Communities and Social Performance team within  our Closure division to proactively support stakeholder engagement.  14. Preventing material business disruption   and data breaches due to cyber events Cyber-security events could disrupt our operations by  interrupting our employees’ work, breaching our data privacy  or jeopardising sensitive information relating to our  customers, contractors or suppliers. Therefore, we take  cyber security seriously and continuously manage risks to  safeguard our business. Strategic alignment Best operator Opportunities Demonstrating robust cyber security supports our commitment towards  impeccable ESG credentials, amid an increasing number of publicised  cyber-security events and privacy breaches. Threats Cyber breaches can arise from malicious external or internal attacks,  but also inadvertently through human error or inconsistently applying  controls that are not managed by our Information Systems and Technology  (IS&T) team. Although the extent and frequency of cyber-security threats  remain in line with growth expectations, new attacks are often more  destructive in nature. An emerging area of exposure is the ongoing  digitalisation and transformation of operational technology environments,  which require data integration and could impact our control mechanism,  such as segregation of our technology environments. Key exposures While internal and external factors pose risks, our greatest exposures  continue to be through third parties.  Risk oversight The Cyber Security Steering Committee and the Board. Management’s response We have:   – Continued to operate a persistent cyber security function and  programme of work to ensure our controls remain relevant in a threat  environment that is constantly evolving and adapting. This informs the  Group business resilience and recovery plans for cyber breaches  across critical sites and assets.    – Established a Cyber Security Steering Committee to increase IS&T  capability in line with best practices in digital transformation. We have  developed and enhanced our industrial and operational technology  environments and asset management, and reduced easily compromised  hardware across more than 1.5 million technology assets.    – Continued to focus on managing third-party risk through contractual  inclusions, proactive compliance assessments and supporting our  first-line cyber-security defence by helping our suppliers to manage  their own cyber-security risk.    – Continued ongoing inspection and assurance capabilities in line with  the three lines of defence model. Our ability to inspect and test the  security of our environment, and to an extent the environment of our  suppliers, is key to addressing control weaknesses before they  are exploited.   – Strengthened our core cyber-security capabilities, specifically our  threat-intelligence team that maintains relationships with government,  industry, professional bodies and educational institutions to ensure we  remain aware and vigilant of the threat landscape. As the pace of  change increases, this control becomes more critical.   ===== PAGE 89 ===== 87 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Strategic report Selected financial data The selected consolidated financial information below has been derived from the historical audited consolidated financial statements of the Rio Tinto  Group.

Weipa Operations, Australia.  ===== PAGE 91 ===== 89 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Directors’ report Chair’s introduction I am excited at joining a company  with great people, world-class  assets, emerging technologies   and new partnerships, but also a  company that is emerging from   a challenging period in its near   150-year history. Our ambition is to deliver superior returns for  our shareholders by becoming a leader in the  global energy transition and finding better  ways to provide the materials the world needs. To achieve this, the management team   had identified four key strategic objectives:  becoming the best operator, having impeccable  ESG credentials, excelling in development,   and strengthening the Group’s social licence.  Culture transformation had also been identified  as a critical enabler of the Group’s future success.  Meanwhile, externally, the global geopolitical  and macroeconomic environments continue to  become more volatile and complex. With this backdrop, the Board carried out a  comprehensive evaluation in 2022, focused on  two key corporate governance priorities we  had identified, ensuring that: (i) we have the  right mix of skills and experience on the Board  for the newly emerging set of opportunities and  risks; and (ii) we organise ourselves as a Board  and across our committees to focus our time  on the right things, at the right time and in the  right way so as best to deliver on the purpose,  strategy and objectives that we have set for  Rio Tinto, all in the context of greater external  uncertainty and volatility. In terms of Board composition, we concluded  that we needed to refresh the Board, with a  particular focus on deepening our mining,  operations and projects experience and our  renewable energy and sustainability capabilities.  We also identified the need to add further  accounting and audit expertise while ensuring  that, overall, we maintained the right balance  of diversity.  As a first stage in this process, I was delighted  in December of 2022 to welcome Kaisa Hietala  as a Non-Executive Director. Kaisa will be  joining the Board on 1 March 2023 and brings  a deep understanding of renewables and  sustainability through her experience in the  resources industry, as well as commercial  capabilities, all of which will be invaluable  as we work to ensure Rio Tinto thrives in a  decarbonising world. Further details are set  out in our Nominations Committee report  on page 102. The wider governance review included  external benchmarking analysis of governance  structures in peer and other long-cycle  companies, interviews with a range of investors  and significant Board interaction and  discussion on how to improve our overall  effectiveness. This included an evaluation  questionnaire that was more forward looking  than the usual in-year annual evaluation. Given  the timing of the strategic governance review,  we decided it would be more beneficial to  defer the independent third-party evaluation   of the Board so that it could take place once  these governance enhancements were fully  embedded in 2023. The third-party Board  evaluation will therefore now take place this  year with 2022’s forward-looking evaluation   as the new baseline.  After several dedicated Board sessions on the  revised governance proposals, we agreed to  implement a number of enhancements from  July 2022.  We have refreshed the Board’s forward  programme to ensure we are primarily focused  on the four strategic objectives and on the  Group’s culture transformation. For example,  we have expanded the scope of our Remuneration  Committee (now our People & Remuneration  Committee) to place greater focus on people  and culture. We have dedicated more Board  and committee time to the assessment of our  top emerging risks, with the Audit Committee  (now renamed the Audit & Risk Committee)  ensuring that our overall approach to risk  management at Board level is robust and  effective. We also reframed the scope of   work of our Sustainability Committee. The  Committee will split its time between the critical  task of closely monitoring our shorter-term  environmental, social and governance (ESG)  performance (including safety and tailings),  while at the same time considering longer-term  strategic issues on sustainability. Finally, in  support of the objective to strengthen our  social licence, we have stepped up our plans  as a Board for stakeholder engagement in  2023 and beyond. Separately, we are also  considering how we can bring additional and  dedicated focus to enhancing the Group’s  social licence in key strategic countries. The following pages set out in more detail   the corporate governance arrangements we  have in Rio Tinto. I am satisfied that these  arrangements are robust and effective but,   as set out above, we will continue to explore  how we can find better ways for the Board and  its committees to ensure the success of the  business, for the benefit of shareholders and   all of our other stakeholders.

For details on the  outcomes on these audits, see page 56.   – The Australian Advisory Group brings together a group of  independent advisers to provide guidance on current and  emerging issues, and better manage policies and positions that  are important to Australian communities and our broader  business. This is one of the 11 commitments we made as part of  our action to strengthen our processes and approach to cultural  heritage, following the destruction of the rock shelters at Juukan  Gorge in May 2020.   – More information is available on page 56. Civil society organisations  Civil society organisations (CSOs) play an important role in society. They hold us to account and help us understand societal expectations across ESG issues, detect risks  and identify opportunities to collaborate. How we engage   – We engage regularly with CSOs to understand and respond   to areas of interest and concern, communicate progress,  share challenges and advance common goals.   – We engage both locally on specific issues related to an operation  and nationally on matters such as policy reform, company  standards and industry leadership.   – We attend CSO forums to understand the latest trends and  expectations on ESG issues and engage regularly at CEO   level to address concerns or discuss strategy.    – Since 2018, we have held annual roundtables with CSO  leaders, and members of the Board and Executive Committee.  The roundtables provide a dedicated forum for our most  senior leaders to engage directly with CSOs and discuss  strategic issues.   – In 2022, we commenced issue-specific dialogues focused on  particular themes, starting with decarbonisation and the Everyday  Respect Report. These sessions enabled us to explore issues in  depth and gain detailed insights from CSOs to inform our  approach to each topic. What was important  to our CSOs in 2022   – Climate change and decarbonisation.   – Water management, biodiversity protection and   nature-based solutions.   – Mine rehabilitation.   – Circular economy.   – Just transition.   – Cultural heritage protection, Indigenous economic advancement,  and community consultation and consent.    – Human rights and modern slavery.   – The Everyday Respect Report and workplace culture.    – Transparency and political advocacy.

Set out below are some of the  matters that the Board has considered during  the year. At every Board meeting, the Chief Executive  and Chief Financial Officer report on the safety,  operating and business performance of the  Group against our key performance indicators,  as well as how certain material stakeholder  issues are being managed. The Board also  receives detailed reports from the management  team relating to progress on major growth  projects and updates on operations. In addition,  the Board invites external subject matter  experts to present on issues relevant to major  strategic or operational matters. Examples in  2022 included: Growth and sustaining projects    – In February, the Board reviewed an update  on the Resolution Copper project in the US  and approved $598 million in funding  (100% basis).   – In April, the Board considered a paper  providing an update on the Simandou iron  ore project in Guinea.    – In May, the Board reviewed a paper and a  presentation providing an update on the  Rhodes Ridge joint venture in Australia.    – In May, the Board considered and approved  a request for $118 million of early works  funding to accelerate first ore and de-risk  the Western Range Sustaining project in  Australia, taking total early works funding  to $174 million.   – In July, the Board approved funding for  Rincon of $194 million for early works to  develop an accelerated starter plant with  planned expansion.

People The Board receives regular updates on   our people-related initiatives to attract,  develop and retain the best people, which   are crucial to our success and to supporting  our strategic objectives.  Some of the topics covered in 2022 included:   – In July, the Board reviewed and noted   a paper regarding the May 2022   employee engagement survey, which  showed improvement.    – In July, the Board considered the progress  on the Everyday Respect Report  recommendations and early signs of positive  impact. The Board noted the importance of  creating a safe workplace that supports  intervention. Everyday Respect training was  to be organised for the Board.   – In December, the Board reviewed an update  in relation to Executive Committee  succession planning.  Strategy and risk Climate change and the low-carbon transition  are at the heart of our strategy. The Board  considers our strategy twice yearly, receiving  updates from the management team in May  and September. (See pages 13-14 for details   of our strategy.)  The topics discussed included: May   – Industry trends and applications of the new  scenario framework.   – Opportunities from the circular economy  and the role of recycling to address carbon  and environmental challenges across our  value chains.   – Challenges and implications for the business  of the energy transition.   – Progress across key elements of the integrated  Group strategy: culture, decarbonisation,  growth and the four objectives. September   – Scenarios and our strategic context.   – Technological challenges of decarbonisation.   – New approach to evolving customer needs  in the West.   – The Group’s 2035 Vision.   – Culture and product group strategies. Matters discussed in 2022   – In April, the Board considered a paper and a  presentation outlining the key priorities and  vision for the future of Rio Tinto Commercial,  and its role in supporting the delivery of  Group strategy.   – In October, the Board reviewed a paper  regarding existential risk scenarios which,  if they were to occur, could substantially  threaten the viability of the Group. It was  noted that the identification and management  of these risks was an important component  of the Group’s risk management framework,  testing the Group’s resilience to very low  likelihood risks, with extremely high impacts.  ESG The Board has ultimate oversight of  environmental, social and governance matters,  but has delegated responsibility for certain  matters to the Sustainability Committee.  During the year, the Board reviewed its forward  agenda of matters to be discussed, considered  its constitution, composition and performance,  and reviewed any new or amended Group  policies. In addition, it considered the following  governance matters:   – In February, the Board approved the 2021  Climate Change Report and approach to  industry associations.    – In February, the Board approved the advisory  Say on Climate resolution, which was voted  on at the 2022 annual general meetings.   – In April, the Board reviewed and noted the  findings of the annual Perceptions Study  to the period ending March 2022.

We have structured the way the Board works to support that objective,  to strengthen our strategic focus, and to improve both the challenge and the support that  the Board provides to the executive team. Here is a summary of the framework. Governance framework Board of Directors We are finding better ways to provide the materials the world needs. By doing so efficiently, effectively and sustainably, we aim to create long-term value for all stakeholders. Our purpose is supported  by three core values – care, courage and curiosity. The Board is collectively responsible for pursuing this purpose and approves  the strategy, budget and plans proposed by the Chief Executive to achieve this objective. Board Charter See the Board Charter for more information on the role of the Board and the delegation to management. Available at riotinto.com Executive Committee The Executive Committee supports the  Chief Executive in the delivery of strategy,  annual plans and commercial objectives,  and managing the financial and operational  performance of the Group. The following management committees  support the Chief Executive in the performance  of his duties. Investment Committee Reviews proposals on investments,  acquisitions and disposals. Approves capital  decisions within delegated authority limits,  and otherwise recommends matters for  approval to the Board, where appropriate. Risk Management Committee Oversees the management and mitigation of  the principal risks that could materially impact  the Group’s business objectives and exceed  its risk tolerances. Ore Reserves Steering Committee Responsible for standards and control  procedures in the Ore Reserves estimation  and disclosure process. Ensures that they  are effective in meeting internal objectives  and regulatory requirements. Closure Steering Committee Oversees the process and controls designed  to manage the material risks related to  rehabilitation, closure and legacy operations. Disclosure Committee Reviews and approves the release of all  significant public disclosures on behalf of the  Group. Oversees the Group’s compliance with  its disclosure obligations in accordance with  all relevant legal and regulatory requirements,  including processes to ensure such disclosures  are accurate and timely. Audit & Risk  Committee Helps the Board to  monitor decisions and  processes designed to  ensure the integrity of  financial reporting, the  independence and  effectiveness of the  external auditors,   and robust systems   of internal control   and risk management. Nominations  Committee Helps the Board determine  its composition, and that  of its committees. They  are regularly reviewed  and refreshed, so they are  able to operate effectively  and have the right mixture  of skills, experience  and background. People &  Remuneration  Committee Helps the Board ensure  that Remuneration Policy  and practices reward  employees and executives  fairly and responsibly, with a  clear link to corporate and  individual performance,  and a focus on people  and culture. Sustainability  Committee Helps the Board oversee  the Group’s integrated  approach to sustainability  and strategies designed  to manage health and  safety, and social and  environmental risks,  including management  processes and standards. Chair’s Committee Supports the functioning  of the Board and will  consider urgent matters  between Board meetings. Chief Executive Has delegated  responsibility for the  executive management of  Rio Tinto, consistent with  the Group’s purpose and  strategy, and subject to  matters reserved for the  Board, as set out in the  Schedule of Matters  Reserved for the Board  (available at riotinto.com),  and in accordance with  the Group’s delegation of  authority framework. See pages 104-107 See pages 102-103 See pages 110-111 See pages 108-109 Australia Forum Advises the Board and the Executive Committee on political, economic and social  developments in Australia and how they could affect the business. China Advisory Panel Provides context and analysis to the Board and the Executive Committee on  political, commercial and policy developments relevant to our operations in China  and with Chinese partners.  ===== PAGE 103 ===== 101 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Directors’ report Evaluating our performance In line with the UK Governance Code and   ASX Corporate Governance Principles and  Recommendations (4th edition) (the ASX  Principles), we undertake a formal annual  evaluation of the Board and, every third year,  we engage a professional external adviser to  carry out an independent evaluation.  In practice, the Chair and the Non-Executive  Directors schedule time at the end of each  Board meeting, often with the Executive  Directors, to reflect on the effectiveness of the  suite of Board and committee meetings as part  of a process of continuous improvement to the  governance arrangements of the Board.  As set out in the Chair’s introduction on  page 89, we carried out a comprehensive  governance review in 2022, based upon two  key corporate governance priorities for 2022:  a review of our composition as a Board to  ensure that we have the right balance of skills  and experience for the implementation of  Rio Tinto’s strategy; and a review of how to  best spend our time in support of that new  strategy in the context of greater uncertainty  and potential risk. The review comprised external benchmarking  analysis of governance structures in peer and  other long-cycle companies, including private  equity firms, together with a questionnaire for  directors on the Board’s current effectiveness.  This evaluation questionnaire was more  forward looking than the usual in-year annual  evaluations. Given the timing of the strategic  governance review, we decided it would be  more beneficial to defer the independent  third-party evaluation of the Board so that it  could take place once these governance  enhancements were fully embedded.  Therefore, the third-party Board evaluation   will now take place in 2023 with this   year’s forward-looking evaluation as the  new baseline.  In July 2022, the Board discussed the findings  of the governance review and agreed on a  number of enhancements. To optimise the  investment of our time, we have refreshed the  Board’s forward programme to ensure we are  primarily focused on supporting the four  strategic objectives. We have expanded the  scope of our Remuneration Committee (now  our People & Remuneration Committee) to  place greater focus on people and culture, and  we will dedicate more Board and committee  time to the assessment of our top emerging  risks, with oversight from the Audit Committee  (renamed the Audit & Risk Committee). In support  of the objective to strengthen our social  licence, we have also stepped up our plans for  stakeholder engagement in 2023 and beyond.

Board committee membership key  Committee Chair   Audit & Risk Committee  People & Remuneration Committee  Nominations Committee  Sustainability Committee In terms of Board composition, we concluded  that we should refresh the Board, with a  particular focus on deepening mining,  sustainability and renewables experience.  We were therefore pleased to welcome Kaisa  Hietala as a Non-Executive Director, joining the  Board on 1 March 2023. She brings a deep  understanding of the resources industry,  sustainability and renewables that will be  invaluable as we work to ensure Rio Tinto  thrives in a decarbonising world. Further details  are set out in our Nominations Committee  report on pages 102-103.  ===== PAGE 104 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 102 Nominations Committee report As part of our ongoing Board succession planning, we have been working  intensely during the course of the year, and I am pleased to report on the  progress we have made in the first eight months of my tenure as Chair.  Our main priority as a Committee this year has  been on ensuring the right balance of skills and  experience in the boardroom to help deliver  implementation of the Group’s future strategy  and objectives. This will enable us as a Board to  anticipate and capture new opportunities as  they emerge over the longer term, while also  managing any shorter-term risks that may arise  from a new global societal and industry context. We currently have ten Board members, eight  Non-Executive Directors and two Executive  Directors. I believe that the optimal size for a  board responsible for overseeing a group of the  scale, complexity and international reach as  Rio Tinto should be around 12 for the longer  term. As we continue to refresh the Board over  this next period, it is likely that we will need to  accommodate some variance above and below  this optimal size, as we seek to bring in  additional capability while maintaining the  appropriate experience and expertise of our  longer-serving Directors. Through this period of  transition, our commitment to achieving the right  diversity on the Board, including female and  ethnic representation, will remain resolute, even  if we find ourselves short on the relevant metrics  in the immediate term.  We are planning to complete the refreshment of  the Board by the time I report to you next year,  and I look forward to updating you during the  course of 2023 on the progress we are making. Separately, we have introduced a number of  other important enhancements regarding the  Board’s responsibility to monitor the health of  our people and talent.  The Nominations Committee has ceded  responsibility for the monitoring of succession  planning of the Executive Committee to the full  Board. The Board has launched a longer-term  succession planning process for the Executive  Committee. In December 2022, we had our first  dedicated and extensive session and will now  receive regular updates. In 2023, for example,  the full Board will systematically monitor the  progression of internal candidates as well as  the external landscape, to ensure that we have  robust plans for the long term, while also being  prepared for any shorter-term eventualities.  Separately, we have expanded the remit of our  Remuneration Committee, now renamed our  People & Remuneration Committee, to include  a deeper and more regular focus on people  and talent within the wider organisation, as well  as on how effective we are in embedding the  cultural and leadership changes that have been  introduced. Further details can be found on  page 111 in the Remuneration report.  Dominic Barton Nominations Committee Chair 22 February 2023 Board refreshment Criteria After a review of Board composition, led by the  new Chair Dominic Barton, a number of areas  were identified to strengthen Board  composition, with a view to ensuring that the  Board benefits from differing perspectives,  experiences and skillsets in providing effective  oversight and promoting the sustainable  success of the business over the long term.  The Committee initiated the search for   four new Non-Executive Directors and   agreed to appoint the executive search firm,  Spencer Stuart, to assist. The following areas   of expertise were identified when searching  for candidates:    – mining, operations and projects, preferably  a former or current Chief Executive,  Chief Operating Officer or Chief Technical  Officer providing options for future  Committee Chair succession;   – renewables and the energy transition;    – financial/accounting, strengthening the  composition of the Audit & Risk Committee  and providing options for future Committee  Chair succession; and   – knowledge of key countries or regions of  operational or strategic relevance to the  Group, reflecting our geographic diversity,  for example China and Africa. In addition to the above criteria, the continued  diversity of our Board composition, including  with regard to gender and ethnicity, was  identified as a key priority and all searches  included a diverse pool of candidates in terms  of gender, ethnicity, nationality, life experience  and skillset. Over half of the candidates  considered were women, and of all candidates,  we had representation from six continents and  32 nationalities.  Across the four specifications, Spencer Stuart  considered around 400 candidates before  compiling long-lists of candidates in line with  the criteria. These were presented to the  Committee in July 2022. Prioritised candidates  were endorsed by the Committee, and  interested individuals were shortlisted. In total,  five candidates have been interviewed by the  Chair and other Board members.  Technology expertise was also identified as   a potential additional skillset for the Board.  After careful consideration, it was agreed to  establish an Innovation Advisory Council to  drive the critical consideration of research and  development, science and technology projects  for the Group rather than make this a further  category of experience for the Board itself. Candidate selection On 19 December 2022, we announced that  Kaisa Hietala had been appointed as a  Non-Executive Director, with effect from  1 March 2023. Kaisa is an experienced  executive with a strong track record of helping  companies transform the challenges of  environmental megatrends into business  opportunities and growth. She is also an  experienced Non-Executive Director and  brings a deep understanding of renewables  and sustainability from her knowledge of the  resources industry, as well as commercial  capability, all of which will be invaluable to our  success in a decarbonising world. As part of the continuing refresh of Board  capabilities, the Committee is progressing well  with the other categories, and we expect to  announce further appointments in due course. For more information about our new Non-Executive Director,  see the Board biographies on pages 90-91. Nominations Committee members Dominic Barton (Chair)1 Simon McKeon Megan Clark  Jennifer Nason Hinda Gharbi2 Simon Thompson3 Simon Henry  Ngaire Woods Sam Laidlaw Ben Wyatt 1. From 5 May 2022. 2. Until retirement from the Board on 8 April 2022. 3. Until retirement from the Board on 5 May 2022.  ===== PAGE 105 ===== 103 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Directors’ report 0–3 years +3–6 years +6–9 years 5 3 2 Appointments to the Board – our policy We base our appointments to the Board on merit,  and on objective selection criteria, with the aim  of bringing a range of skills, knowledge and  experience to Rio Tinto. This involves a formal  and rigorous process to source strong candidates  from diverse backgrounds and conducting  appropriate background and reference checks  on the shortlisted candidates. We aim to appoint  people who will help us address the operational  and strategic challenges and opportunities  facing the company and ensure that our Board   is diverse in terms of gender, nationality, social  background and cognitive style. As such, we  engage only recruitment agencies that are  signed up to the Voluntary Code of Conduct   on diversity best practice.  When recruiting government or former government  officials to join the Rio Tinto Board, we comply  with any restrictions and obligations existing  pursuant to relevant laws and regulations, including  with respect to confidentiality, lobbying and conflicts  of interest. The timing and terms of the appointment  of Dominic Barton during 2022 complied with   all relevant restrictions and obligations. We believe that an effective Board combines   a range of perspectives with strong oversight,  combining the experience of Directors who   have developed a deep understanding of our  business over several years with the fresh  insights of newer appointees. We aim for our  Board composition to reflect the global nature   of our business. With the announcement of   Kaisa Hietala’s appointment, we will have   seven different nationalities (including dual  nationalities) on a Board of 11.  Megan Clark has agreed to remain a   Non-Executive Director for a further year and   will stand for re-election at our 2023 annual  general meetings. Megan is Chair of the  Sustainability Committee and one of the longest  serving Directors on our Board with significant  mining industry experience. In this period of  Board renewal, it is critically important that the  Board continues to benefit from Megan’s  knowledge and experience. The Committee   is of the view that Megan continues to make a  significant and valuable contribution in the  boardroom, and is satisfied that Megan  continues to be independent. The Committee engaged Spencer Stuart to  support the search for four new Non-Executive  Directors, including Kaisa Hietala. The Committee  is satisfied that Spencer Stuart does not have  any connections with the company or individual  Directors that may impair their independence. The key skills and experience of our Board are  set out on this page of the report.  Our Diversity and Inclusion Policy sets out our  expectations around the behaviours needed for  an inclusive and diverse workplace. The policy is  co-owned and supported by the Board and  Executive Committee. At a Group level, we report  against gender diversity targets (see page 24) and  achievement of these targets contributes to the  variable remuneration of senior executives. In  addition, each of our operations has locally set  employment targets. Their performance against  these targets can be found in our 2022  Sustainability Fact Book.  For more information read our full policy on our website   www.riotinto.com/sustainability/policies Our key responsibilities The purpose of the Nominations Committee   is to review the composition of the Board.  The Committee leads the process for  appointments, making recommendations   to the Board as part of succession planning   for both Non-Executive and Executive  Directors. It also approves proposals for  appointments to the Executive Committee.  Membership of the Committee All Non-Executive Directors are members of  the Nominations Committee. The Chief Executive and the Chief People Officer  are invited to attend all or part of meetings, as  appropriate. The Committee is chaired by the  Chair of the Board, unless the matter under  consideration relates to the role of the Chair.  During 2022, the former Chairman did not attend  meetings where his succession was discussed. The Committee had three formal meetings in  2022 and received regular and detailed updates,  including over Board dinners, on the status of  the various searches at each scheduled Board  meeting. Attendance at the formal meetings is  included in the table on page 101. Diversity The Board recognises that it has a critical role  to play in creating an environment in which all  contributions are valued, different perspectives  are embraced, and biases are acknowledged  and overcome. The Board shares ownership  with the Executive Committee of the Group’s  Inclusion and Diversity Policy, which can be  found at riotinto.com/sustainability/policies.  We also discuss diversity and inclusion in the  Sustainability section of this Annual Report on  page 59.  The proportion of women on the Board is  currently 30% (three women and seven men).  However, this will increase to 36.3% upon the  appointment of our new Non-Executive Director,  Kaisa Hietala, with effect from 1 March 2023.  Gender diversity remains a key focus area as we  continue to progress further new appointments  to the Board with a view to regaining appropriate  gender balance as we move forward. The Group  has continued to set measurable gender diversity  objectives for the composition of senior  leadership and graduate intake. Progress on  diversity is shown in the Sustainability section  on pages 59-60, where we show a breakdown  by seniority.  The number of Directors who identify themselves  as being from a minority ethnic background is one  (Ben Wyatt). Ensuring continued ethnic diversity  on our Board has been a key consideration in our  search for new Non-Executive Directors, as we  have outlined on page 102.  Progress on diversity is shown  in the Sustainability section on pages 59-60.

In addition to  the normal cycle of reporting and reviews, the Committee’s time was impacted by  external developments in corporate governance and climate change issues. The Committee has, as always, spent a  considerable proportion of its time discussing  the significant issues of judgment relating to  the financial statements. In 2022, these  included potential triggers for impairment  charges and reversals, exclusions, closure  provisions, and in particular the impact of  climate change on our accounting and  financial reporting. In each case, our work is  focused on ensuring issues are identified early,  the correct accounting judgments are made,  and that these matters are appropriately  disclosed in our financial reporting. Further  detail on these issues is provided on page 105.  In all cases, our deliberations included input  and challenge from our external auditors, and  together we review the effectiveness of the  reporting processes annually to identify issues  and improvements, including the performance  of the external auditors. In addition, the Committee considered reviews  of our Group Internal Audit (GIA) function,  and risk management and internal control  processes, as part of its annual programme of  work. I am pleased to confirm that both areas  operated effectively in 2022. As part of our  drive for continuous improvement and  development of these key functions, some  enhancements to their operations were  identified as part of the review. The Committee  fully supports these improvements to further  strengthen GIA, risk management and our  overall internal controls framework.  We also received a teach-in on the Group’s  performance management framework.  The framework includes the processes and  routines by which performance information   is shared with senior management, the scope  and content of this information, and the tools  and systems used to capture, store and  report it. We also had an overview of future  developments in the context of planned  finance strategy enhancements. We were  impressed with the Management Information  System (MIS), and the rigour and discipline it  has brought to information management. We  see this as critical to future development of  both financial performance and the effective  risk management and control in the company.  The Committee continued to monitor the  developing regulatory environment and to  consider any potential changes to the Audit &  Risk Committee’s responsibilities. This monitoring  will continue in 2023, when we expect the pace  of regulatory developments, particularly in the  UK, to quicken.  In April 2022, we said farewell to Hinda Gharbi  who had served on the Committee since 2020.  I would like to express my thanks to Hinda   for her considerable contribution to our  deliberations. In June 2022, we welcomed  Ben Wyatt to the Committee, who has already  become a valuable member.  Lastly, I would like to thank my fellow  Committee members and those who support  the work of the Committee. I hope that readers  will find the information set out on the following  pages interesting and informative.

Membership The members of the Committee are all  independent Non-Executive Directors,  and their biographies can be found on  pages 90-91. The Chair of the Board is not  a member of the Committee.  As Rio Tinto’s securities are listed in Australia,  the UK and the US, we follow the regulatory  requirements and best practice governance  recommendations for audit committees in each  of these markets.  Australian listing requirements In Australia, the members, and the Committee  as a whole, meet the independence  requirements of the Australian Stock Exchange  (ASX) Principles. Specifically, the Committee  members between them have the accounting  and financial expertise and a sufficient  understanding of the industry in which the  company operates to be able to discharge the  Committee’s mandate effectively.  UK listing requirements In the UK, the members meet the requirements  of the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA)  Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules,  and the provisions of the UK Corporate  Governance Code relating to audit committee  composition. Simon Henry, the Chair of the  Committee, is considered by the Board to have  recent and relevant financial experience.  Simon Henry has extensive experience of the  natural resources sector. Simon McKeon and  Ben Wyatt have gained experience of the  mining sector by serving on the Board and on  the Committee, and through regular site visits,  reports and presentations. The Committee as a  whole has competence relevant to the sector in  which the company operates.  US listing requirements In the US, the requirements for the Committee’s  composition and role are set out in Securities  and Exchange Commission (SEC) and New  York Stock Exchange (NYSE) rules. The Board  has designated Simon Henry as an “audit  committee financial expert”. The Board also  believes that the other members of the  Committee are financially literate by virtue of  their wide business experience.  Committee remit The Committee’s objectives and responsibilities  are set out in our Terms of Reference  (see riotinto.com/corporategovernance).  These follow the relevant best practice  recommendations in Australia, the UK and  the US.  ===== PAGE 107 ===== 105 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Directors’ report Our main duties Financial reporting – we review the key  judgments needed to apply accounting  standards and to prepare the Group’s financial  statements. We also review the narrative  reporting that goes with them, with the aim  of maintaining integrity in the Group’s financial  reporting. We also monitor exclusions made in  deriving alternative (non-GAAP) (Generally  Accepted Accounting Principles) performance  measures such as underlying earnings.  External audit – we oversee the relationship  with the external auditors and review all the  non-audit services they provide and their fees,  to safeguard the auditors’ independence and  objectivity. We also assess the effectiveness   of the external audit and, when necessary,  carry out a formal tender process to select  new auditors.  Framework for internal control and risk  management – we monitor the effectiveness  of the Group’s internal controls, including those  over financial reporting. We also oversee the  Group’s risk management framework.  Group Internal Audit (GIA) – we oversee the  work of GIA, and its head, who reports  functionally to our Committee Chair. Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves – we  oversee the reporting and assurance of   mineral resources, and consider the impact   on financial reporting.  Distributable reserves – we provide assurance  to the Board that distributable reserves are  sufficient, and in the correct corporate entities,  to support any dividend proposals.  These duties feed into an annual work plan that  ensures we consider issues on a timely basis.  The Committee has authority to investigate any  matters within its remit. We have the power to  use any Group resources we may reasonably  require, and we have direct access to the  external auditors. We can also obtain  independent professional advice at the  Group’s expense, where we deem necessary.  No such advice was required during 2022.  The Committee Chair reports to the Board after  each meeting on the main items discussed, and  the minutes of Committee meetings are  circulated to the Board.  We had seven Committee meetings in 2022.  Attendance at these meetings is included in the  table on page 101. The Committee has met  twice to date in 2023.  The Chair of the Board, the Chief Financial  Officer, the Group Financial Controller and the  heads of GIA and Risk regularly attend our  meetings, as do the Chief Legal Officer,  Governance & Corporate Affairs, and the  Group Company Secretary. Other senior  executives and subject-matter experts are  invited as needed.  The external auditors were present at all  of the Committee meetings during the year.  The auditors review all materials on accounting  or tax matters in advance of each meeting, and  their comments are included in the papers  circulated to Committee members. The audit  partners also meet with our Committee Chair  ahead of each meeting to discuss key issues  and raise any concerns.  The Committee meets regularly in private  sessions. We also hold regular private  discussions with the external auditors.  Management does not attend these sessions.  The Committee Chair also has regular contact  and discussions with these stakeholders  outside the formal meetings. Use of Committee meeting time   in 2022 Financial reporting External audit Internal control and risk management Governance Internal audit 5% 15% 40% 25% 15% Significant issues relating to financial statements There were four significant issues considered by the Committee in relation to the financial statements. Matters considered Conclusion Review of carrying value of   cash-generating units and  impairment charges/reversals The Committee assessed management’s determination of cash-generating units, review of impairment triggers, and consideration  of potential impairment charges and reversals over the course of the year. An impairment trigger was identified at the Boyne Smelter  cash-generating unit. The Committee considered the key judgments made by management, in particular the climate change  sensitivity and alignment of operating assumptions to the Paris Agreement. The Committee monitored the transaction with  Turquoise Hill Resources minority shareholders and considered the relevance of the transaction price and associated valuation  information with respect to the Oyu Tolgoi cash-generating unit. Application of the policy   for items excluded from   underlying earnings The Committee reviewed the Group’s policy for exclusion of certain items from underlying earnings and confirmed the consistent  application of this policy year on year. The items excluded from underlying earnings comprised charges of $1.5 billion and income  of $0.7 billion. A reconciliation of underlying earnings to net earnings is presented in the Alternative Performance Measures section. Estimate of provision for   closure, restoration and  environmental obligations The Committee reviewed the significant changes in the estimated provision for closure, restoration and environmental obligations  by product group and legacy management. The Committee received updates on closure studies completed in the period and  discussed with management the accounting policy for legacy sites. The impact of inflation in the period on the forecast underlying  cashflows for future closure costs was significant. The Committee reviewed the economic assumptions assessed by management  and confirmed the consistent application of the accounting policy. At 31 December 2022, the Group’s balance sheet included a  provision for close-down, restoration and environmental obligations of $15.8 billion. Climate change The Committee received an overview of the work that management is undertaking in relation to climate change and the potential  financial reporting implications thereof. The Committee reviewed the climate change summary provided on pages 152-155 and  discussed with management the strategy and approach to climate change, the economic scenarios and the impact on our portfolio,  and the linkage to accounting judgments. The Committee was pleased to see the enhanced disclosure financial reporting  considerations of climate change throughout the financial statements and the emphasis given. Other focus areas in 2022 In addition to our scheduled workload, the  Committee also:   – Received a teach-in on the Group’s  performance management framework,  including a live demonstration of the MIS   and an overview of future developments in  the context of the finance strategy  improvement work. The implementation of  the MIS has transformed the way in which  the Group stores and reports performance  information. This has been accompanied by  a redesign of our performance reporting  rituals and routines, centred on the Monthly  Performance Reviews, to provide a  consistent and transparent understanding of  operating and financial performance and  support decision making.    – Considered an update on the OECD Pillar  One and Two proposals to implement a new  global tax framework involving a reallocation  of taxing rights to market jurisdictions and  application of a 15% global minimum tax.    – After a robust process, in early 2022 the  Committee recommended to the Board that  the draft 2021 Annual Report should be taken  as whole, fair, balanced and understandable.    – Reviewed the quality and effectiveness of the  Group’s internal control and risk  management systems. The findings of the  review were shared with the Sustainability  Committee, which oversees a number of key  corporate risks. This review included the  effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls  over financial reporting, and the Group’s  disclosure controls and procedures in  accordance with sections 404 and 302 of  the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002. The  Committee also considered reports from  GIA, PwC and KPMG on their work in reviewing  and auditing the control environment.  ===== PAGE 108 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 106 Contact with regulators during 2022 During the year, the Company received a letter  from the Financial Reporting Council (FRC)’s  Corporate Reporting Review team advising  their intention to include extracts from the  Company’s 2021 Annual Report and accounts  as examples of best practice in their thematic  reviews of “TCFD disclosures and climate in  the financial statements” and “Judgments and  estimates”. Without entering into substantive  dialogue, they also made recommendations for  improvements to our disclosures, which we  have incorporated in this report. The SEC wrote  to us regarding questions they had around our  use of multiple performance metrics in our  segmental reporting and our disclosure of  share of profit after tax of equity-accounted  units. At their request, we have reduced some  of this voluntary information, including the  removal of certain subtotals in the Financial  Information by Business Unit. The scope of the  review by the FRC was limited to reviewing the  2021 Annual Report and correspondence with  management and does not provide assurance  that the report and accounts are correct in all  material respects. External auditors Engagement of the external auditors  For the 2022 financial year, KPMG are serving  as our auditors. The UK entity of KPMG audits  Rio Tinto plc, and the Australian entity audits  Rio Tinto Limited. The UK audit engagement  partner, Jonathan Downer, was appointed  in March 2021 and the Australian partner,  Trevor Hart, was appointed in 2020.  We agreed on the scope of the auditors’ review  of the half-year accounts, and of their audit  of the full-year accounts, taking into  consideration the key risks and areas of  material judgment for the Group. We also  approved the fees for this work and the  engagement letters for the auditors. Safeguarding independence and objectivity,  and maintaining effectiveness  In our relationship with the external auditors,  we need to ensure that they retain their  independence and objectivity, and are  effective in performing the statutory audit.  Use of the external auditors for  non-audit services  The external auditors have significant  knowledge of our business and of how we  apply our accounting policies. That means  it is sometimes cost-efficient for them to  provide non-audit services. There may also  be confidentiality reasons that make the  external auditors the preferred choice  for a particular task.  However, safeguarding the external auditors’  objectivity and independence is an overriding  priority. For this reason, and in line with the  FRC’s Ethical Standard, the Committee ensures  that the external auditors do not perform any  functions of management, undertake any work  that they may later need to audit or rely  upon in the audit, or serve in an advocacy  role for the Group. We have a policy governing the use of the  auditors to provide non-audit services.  The cap on the total fees that may be paid  to the external auditors for non-audit services  in any given year is 70% of the average of   the audit fees for the preceding three years.  This is in line with the FRC’s Ethical Standard.  Non-audit assignments fall into two  broad categories:    – Audit, audit-related or other “pre-approved”  services where we believe there is no threat  to auditors’ independence and objectivity,  other than through the fees payable.    – Other services approved under  delegated authority.  We apply different approval regimes to these  areas of work. Approval of “pre-approved”  services is as follows:    – Up to $50,000: subject to prior notification to  management, this work can be awarded.    – From $50,001 to $100,000: requires the  Chief Financial Officer’s approval.    – Over $100,000 and with a tender process: if  the external auditors are successful in the  tender, the appointment requires the Chief  Financial Officer’s approval.    – From $100,001 to $250,000 without a tender  process: requires the Chief Financial  Officer’s approval.    – Over $250,000 without a tender process:  requires the Committee’s or Committee  Chair’s approval.  In each case, the nature of the assignment  and the fees payable are reported to  the Committee.  The Chief Financial Officer can approve other  services up to the value of $50,000 and an  aggregate value of no more than $100,000.  Fees exceeding $100,000 in aggregate   require approval from the Committee or the  Committee Chair. At the half-year and year-ends, the Chief  Financial Officer and the external auditors  report to the Committee on non-audit services  performed and the fees payable. Individual  services are also reported to the Committee  at each meeting that have either been  approved since the previous meeting,  or that require approval for commencement  following the meeting.  Non-audit services provided by KPMG in 2022  were either within the predetermined approval  levels or approved by the Committee and   were compatible with the general standard   of independence for auditors and the other  requirements of the relevant Australian, UK   and US regulations with the exception of the  following matter: certain KPMG member firms  provided local financial statement preparation  and translation services, which are prohibited  by UK ethical rules, to certain group entities  over the period 2020 to 2022. The Committee  has considered the administrative nature of the  services, and noted that the services were  provided after the group audit opinion was  issued to entities that are not material to the  Group. The Committee concluded that the  provision of these services did not impair the  independence of KPMG. Audit & Risk Committee report continued Climate change-related  financial reporting The Directors have considered the relevance  of the risks of climate change and transition  risks associated with achieving the goals of the  Paris Agreement when preparing and signing  off the Company’s accounts. The narrative  reporting on climate-related matters is  consistent with the accounting assumptions  and judgments made in this report. The Audit &  Risk Committee reviews and approves all  material accounting estimates and judgments  relating to financial reporting, including those  where climate issues are relevant. The Group’s  approach to climate change is supported by  strong governance, processes and capabilities. In developing our commodity price forecasts,  as part of our annual process, we updated our  scenarios and now focus on two core  scenarios. They are used to generate a central  reference case for commodity forecasts and  valuations, used pervasively in our financial  processes, including impairment testing,  estimating remaining economic life, and  discounting closure and rehabilitation  provisions, as was the case in the prior year.  At the UN Climate Summit in late 2022  (COP27), there was broad recognition that the  pace of decarbonisation across the global  economy is too slow to limit warming to 1.5°C  and that current climate policies in many  countries are not yet aligned with their stated  ambitions. Consequently, neither of our two  core scenarios, Fragmented Leadership and  Competitive Leadership, is consistent with the  expectation of climate policies required to  accelerate the global transition to meet the  stretch goal of the Paris Agreement. Although  our operational emissions reduction targets  align with the goals of the Paris Agreement, our  two core scenarios do not. Given this, we also  assess our sensitivity, and test the economic  performance of our business against a  scenario we have developed that reflects our  view of the global actions required to meet the  stretch goal of the Paris Agreement of limiting  warming to 1.5°C. Overall, based on our internally developed  pricing outlooks, we do not envisage an  adverse impact of the 1.5°C Paris Agreement- aligned sensitivity on asset carrying values,  remaining useful life, closure and rehabilitation  provisions for our Group. During the year, the assessment performed  under the new Physical Resilience Programme,  together with our ongoing review processes,  including impairment assessments, did not  identify any material accounting impacts as a  consequence of the physical risks associated  with climate change. For more information on climate change impact  on our Group, see our 2022 Climate Change  Report and page 63 in this report.  ===== PAGE 109 ===== 107 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Directors’ report Fees for audit and non-audit services The amounts payable to the external auditors,  in each of the past two years, were:  2022  $m 2021  $m Audit fees  25.7  21.2 Non-audit service fees:  Assurance services  3.3 3.7 Taxation services  0.0 0.0 All other fees  0.3 0.2 Total non-audit service fees  3.6 3.9 Non-audit: audit fees (in-year)  14%  18%  For further analysis of these fees, please see  note 38 on page 222. None of the individual non-audit assignments  was significant, in terms of either the work done  or the fees payable. We have reviewed the  non-audit work in aggregate. We are satisfied  that neither the work done, nor the fees  payable, compromised the independence or  objectivity of KPMG as our external auditors. Independence of the external auditors  KPMG are required to provide a declaration  to the Directors in relation to their compliance  with the independence requirements of the  Australian Corporations Act 2001 and the  professional code of conduct for external  auditors. A copy of this is on page 251.  No person who served as an officer of Rio Tinto  during 2022 was a Director or partner of KPMG  at a time when they conducted an audit  of the Group.  Effectiveness of the external auditors  We review the effectiveness of the external  auditors annually. We consider the results of  a survey containing questions on the auditors’  objectivity, quality and efficiency. The survey,  conducted in June 2022, was completed by   a range of operational and corporate  executives across the business, and by  Committee members. We are satisfied with the quality and objectivity  of KPMG’s 2021 audit. Appointment of the auditors  The Committee has reviewed the independence,  objectivity and effectiveness of KPMG as  external auditors in 2022 and in the year to  date. We have recommended to the Board that  KPMG should be retained in this role for 2023,  which the Board supports.  KPMG have indicated that they are willing to  continue as auditors of Rio Tinto. A resolution  to reappoint them as auditors of Rio Tinto plc  will therefore be proposed as a joint resolution  at the 2023 AGMs, together with a separate  resolution seeking authority for the Committee  to determine the external auditors’ remuneration.  Subject to the approval of the above resolution,  KPMG will continue in office as auditors of  Rio Tinto Limited.  Risk management and internal controls  We review Rio Tinto’s internal control systems  and the risk management framework. We also  monitor risks falling within our remit, especially  those relating to the integrity of financial  reporting. A summary of the business’s internal  control and risk management systems, and   of the principal risks and uncertainties we   face, is available in the Strategic report on  pages 79-86.  Importantly, responsibility for operating and  maintaining the internal control environment  and risk management systems sits at asset  level. Leaders of our businesses and functions  are required to confirm annually: that adequate  internal controls are in place; that these are  operating effectively and are designed to  identify any failings and weaknesses that may  exist; and that any required actions are  taken promptly.  The Audit & Risk Committee also regularly  monitors our risk management and internal  control systems (including internal financial  controls). We aim to have appropriate policies,  standards and procedures in place, and ensure  that they operate effectively. As part of considering the risk management  framework, the Committee receives regular  reports from the Group Financial Controller, the  Chief Legal Officer, Governance & Corporate  Affairs, and the Head of Tax on material  developments in the legal, regulatory and fiscal  landscape in which the Group operates.  The Board, supported by the Audit & Risk  Committee, has completed its annual review   of the effectiveness of our risk management  and internal control systems. This review  included consideration of our material financial,  operational and compliance controls. The Board  concluded that the Group has an effective  system of risk management and internal  control. To further strengthen the Group’s risk  management and internal control systems, in  2023 the Board and Audit & Risk Committee  will focus on ensuring the timely closure of  audit and assurance findings.  Internal control over financial reporting  The main features of our internal control  and risk management systems in relation  to financial reporting are explained on  page 141.  Internal audit programme structure  GIA provides independent and objective  assurance of the adequacy and effectiveness of  risk management and internal control systems.  It may also recommend improvements.  While the head of GIA reports administratively  to the Chief Financial Officer, appointment to,  or removal from, this role requires the consent  of the Audit & Risk Committee Chair. The head  of GIA is accountable to the Chairs of the Audit  & Risk and the Sustainability Committees,  and communicates regularly with both.  Our GIA team therefore operates independently  of management. Its mandate is set out in a  written charter, approved by the Audit & Risk  Committee. GIA uses a formal internal audit  methodology that is consistent with the  Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA)’s  internationally recognised standards.  When needed, the team brings in external  partners to help achieve its goals. There is a  clear policy to address any conflicts of interest,  which complies with the IIA’s standards on  independence. This policy identifies a list of  services that need prior approval from the   head of GIA.  Governance of the annual plan  Each year’s internal audit plan is approved  by the Audit & Risk Committee and the  Sustainability Committee. The plan is focused  on higher-risk areas and any specific areas or  processes chosen by the committees. It is also  aligned with any risks identified by the external  auditors. Both committees are given regular  updates on progress, including any material  findings, and can refine the plans as needed. Effectiveness of the internal audit programme  The Audit & Risk Committee monitors the  effectiveness of the GIA function throughout  the year, with updates on performance  at every meeting. In addition, this year PwC  conducted an independent quality assessment  of GIA, the results of which were reported to  the Committee. The assessment concluded  that GIA provides strong assurance to the  Group, using a comprehensive methodology  and thorough process guidance, with good  practice evident. The assessment also  provided some useful suggestions for further  improvement to mature GIA to “trusted adviser”  level, which will be actioned. The last such  assessment was completed in 2018. We are satisfied that the quality, experience  and expertise of GIA are appropriate for the  business and that GIA was objective and  performed its role effectively. We also  monitored management’s response to internal  audits during the year. We are satisfied that  improvements are being implemented  promptly in response to GIA findings, and  believe that management supports the  effective working of the GIA function.   ===== PAGE 110 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 108 Sustainability Committee report Caring for our people, being best operator of our assets, working respectfully with  our communities, contributing solutions to the world’s environmental challenges,  and finding better ways to provide the materials that the world needs – all underpin  Rio Tinto’s approach to sustainable development.  The Sustainability Committee supports our  sustainable development objectives by  overseeing the policies, frameworks, and  management systems for ensuring the health  and safety of our employees and contractors;  managing our key social and environmental  risks; and supporting the communities in which  we operate. This, in turn, enhances our social  licence to operate in the communities and  countries in which we work. This year, we recorded our fourth straight year  of zero fatalities at our managed operations.  We review and learn from every incident that  has the potential to result in a fatality. Despite  our best efforts, our people continue to be  injured at work, and we did not achieve our  desired improvement in the number of injuries  from the previous year. At the Sustainability  Committee, we track our progress in analysing  and learning from incidents to prevent them  from happening again. Although we had no  fatalities at our managed operations in 2022,  tragically, there was a fatality at one of our  non-managed marine operations. In a separate  incident, another mariner suffered a permanent  disabling injury. We continue to work with our  partners in these operations to align their safety  performance with our own. In 2022, the Committee reviewed the progress  with our safety maturity model (SMM), a key  tool to develop and enhance our safety culture.  We integrated contractor partners’ safety  maturity into our model and included leadership  on health and environment. This year, we  shifted the focus from our processes and rituals  to the felt experience of our workforce. Our  critical risk management (CRM) system, which  is embedded in our SMM, enables us to verify  that the appropriate controls are in place to  prevent fatalities, and over 1.498 million  verifications were completed this year to  ensure controls were in place.  We are increasing our focus on psychosocial  health and wellbeing in our business. During  2022, the Committee requested a report on the  incidence of suicide amongst our workforce,  which examined the unique risk factors for  mental health associated with mining  operations such as ours and what we can do  better to support our people. In addition, the  Committee is overseeing the implementation   of recommendations and actions outlined in  the deeply confronting Everyday Respect  Report, which was commissioned to better  understand and improve our workplace culture.  The independent study by experts Elizabeth  Broderick & Co. was released in February 2022,  and included a recommendation to embed the  principles of Everyday Respect into our SMM.  The Group’s Internal Audit (GIA) function  undertakes reviews and reports to the  Sustainability Committee on matters within the  Committee’s scope. In addition, the Group’s  auditors, KPMG, report to the Sustainability  Committee on their assurance procedures over  our 2021 sustainable development reporting. Other key areas of focus for the Committee in  2022 included deep dives into the major  hazards and risks, including:   – Water: Reviewing our approach to water  management and monitoring our progress  against our water stewardship targets.   –  Environment and Health: Reviewing our  strategic objectives to advance our  approach to our environmental and  health performance.    – Health, Safety, Environment and Security  (HSES) workplan: Receiving regular   updates on environment, health, safety   and security activities and reviewing the  2023-2024 workplan.   – Major hazards: Receiving updates from  management on the implementation of the  GISTM and implementation of the Group’s  underground safety standard, as well as  updates on controls relating to Process  Safety and Occupied Buildings, and Major  Slope Geotechnical Events.   – Potentially fatal incidents (PFIs): Reviewing   at each meeting PFIs occurring across  the Group.  Site visits are an important element of the   work of the Committee, and this year our  Committee members made individual visits to  our Iron Ore operations at Brockman, West  Angelas, Yandicoogina and Gudai-Darri in the  Pilbara, Western Australia; our operations at  Saguenay – Lac-Saint-Jean and Sorel-Tracy  in Quebec, Canada; and in the US, our  operations at Boron in California, Resolution  Copper in Arizona, and our Kennecott copper  operations in Salt Lake City, Utah. I would like to thank my fellow Committee  members for their commitment and dedication,  and thank all the executive leaders and  specialists for their genuine effort and disciplined  preparation for our Committee meetings. Megan Clark Sustainability Committee Chair 22 February 2023 The Committee received updates on our  progress towards implementation of the Global  Industry Standard on Tailings Management  (GISTM), and personally met with each of the  executives nominated in accordance with  GISTM requirements as having accountability  for the safety of tailings facilities within each of  the Copper, Minerals, Aluminium and Iron Ore  product groups, and across the Closure function.  Sustainability is an integral part of our business.  To improve our governance and oversight of  integrated risk, the Committee hears annually  from our product group Chief Executives on  their integrated strategies for management   of sustainability risks and opportunities. This  includes effectiveness of controls associated  with these risks and how the risks and  associated controls will change over time. The Committee oversaw the implementation   of all recommendations arising from the 2020  Rio Tinto Board review of cultural heritage  management and the Inquiry into Juukan  Gorge by the Australian Government’s Joint  Standing Committee on Northern Australia.  The Committee continues to oversee actions   to strengthen our approach and processes   for managing cultural heritage – both within   our Australian operations and across our  operations globally – and the rebuilding of  respectful relationships with the Indigenous  peoples on the lands on which we operate. The Committee oversaw the rebuilding of a  constructive relationship with the Puutu Kunti  Kurrama and Pinikura people, the ongoing  rehabilitation works at Juukan Gorge, the  progress on an agreement for a co-management  of Country approach, and a comprehensive  remedy agreement. The Committee also  reviewed the progress made towards reaching  modernised agreements with the Yinhawangka,  Yindjibarndi and Puutu Kunti Kurrama and  Pinikura peoples in the Pilbara and the  Pekuakamiulnuatsh First Nation in Canada.  The Sustainability Committee has overseen the  design of a new Communities and Social  Performance (CSP) vision and strategic  framework; the development of the Group’s  CSP targets for 2022-2026; improved  transparency in reporting on CSP; and  improvements to our CSP control framework.  This includes improvements in capability and  assurance, enhancements to our second- and  third-line assurance activities, and revisions of  Group documents, including the CSP standard  and the cultural heritage management Group  procedure for Australian businesses, as well as  the codification of the core principles of the  integrated heritage management process into  Group-level frameworks.  ===== PAGE 111 ===== 109 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Directors’ report Sustainability Committee members Megan Clark (Chair) Jennifer Nason3 Dominic Barton1 Simon Thompson4 Hinda Gharbi2 Ngaire Woods Simon Henry3 Ben Wyatt3 Sam Laidlaw 1.

Dear shareholders, On behalf of the Board, I present our 2022  Directors’ Remuneration report. I am pleased to write that Rio Tinto’s  performance in 2022 has been underpinned  by another fatality-free year, combined  with dependable operations and continued  demand for our commodities in an  uncertain world.  This operational performance has been  accompanied by progress in delivering on  our strategy through the advancement  against our objectives: becoming the   best operator, having impeccable ESG  credentials, excelling in development, and  strengthening the Group’s social licence. Rio Tinto’s ambition is to be the best  operator, a business with people at the  centre and where we create a lasting,  competitive advantage that will allow us to  invest through market cycles and build  long-term value. The deployment of the  Safe Production System (SPS) continues at  pace to build on our progress in improving  efficiencies and effectiveness. The organisation has made meaningful  headway in its culture transformation and  has taken considerable actions to rebuild  trust. The recommendations of the  Everyday Respect Report are being  implemented and our second progress  report on our Communities and Social  Performance has been published with  greater participation and increased  feedback from Traditional Owner groups.  Rio Tinto continues to deliver its strategy  with low carbon transition at its centre.  In 2022, we announced a partnership with  the Government of Canada to invest up   to $537 million (C$737 million) over eight  years to decarbonise our Rio Tinto Iron   and Titanium Quebec Operations and   to position the business as a centre of  excellence for critical minerals processing.  We joined low-carbon partnerships,  including with Ford, Volvo, Nano One and  Corona Canada. In Australia, we installed a  34MW solar farm at Gudai-Darri and are  planning to invest $600 million in a further  230MW of solar power in the Pilbara. Rio Tinto progressed its excel in  development agenda to underpin growth.  This has included commissioning major  projects and advancing the next tranche   of Pilbara mines with the Western Range  and Rhodes Ridge developments. Beyond  the Pilbara, Rio Tinto has also advanced  the Simandou development in Guinea, an  underground mining project at Kennecott,  early works funding of the Rincon Lithium  Project and continued progress at Oyu Tolgoi.  The company acquired the remaining  shares in Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd  (TRQ) thereby increasing our direct interest  in the Oyu Tolgoi project to 66%. These 2022 results were achieved despite  a challenging and volatile landscape,  particularly in the areas of labour and supply  chain constraints, further exacerbated by  exceptional levels of global inflation. Incentives review to  accelerate strategy and  culture change Our current incentive plans have served   us well and we believe that the general  plan structure remains appropriate.  However, as our strategy has evolved,  so has the need for the incentive framework  to support it. A thorough review of our  incentives was undertaken in 2022 to  ensure they reinforce our strategy and   the culture change necessary to build  sustainable performance.  For 2023, we have prioritised changes to  the Group short-term incentive plan (STIP)  and our performance framework. At its  core is collective Rio Tinto success – doing  things that deliver our four objectives in the  right way. The design maintains the  existing weighting on financial metrics with  no changes to our current financial  measures of underlying earnings and STIP  free cash flow. The focus on best operator  will be through the flexed component, as  well as elements focused on safety, carbon  reduction, diversity and inclusion. For 2023,  we are also introducing measures to  capture progress on excel in development  and strengthen our licence to operate.  The design is simplified, based upon one  Group scorecard that will apply consistently  to approximately 24,000 employees  including the Executive Committee.  While the changes to our STIP design are  accommodated within the parameters of  our existing Policy, I have engaged with  shareholders and proxy advisers to explain  the rationale for the design decisions made.  The final design was adapted to reflect  points raised during the consultation  process. I would like to thank our  shareholders and proxy advisers for  making the time and providing valuable  input to our discussions. More details of  our new STIP design can be found on  page 112. 43%  Group STIP business outcome out of 100% 100% Vesting for 2018 PSA in February 2023  ===== PAGE 113 ===== 111 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Directors’ report With regards to the long-term incentive plan  (LTIP), the current measure of relative total  shareholder return (TSR) has been unchanged  for many years. TSR is an important measure of  success that aligns executives to the shareholder  experience and against which we continue to  track well. We will not be making any changes  to the 2023 LTIP awards due to be granted in  March but intend to return to it as part of the  triennial policy review. Overview of performance and  strategic progress in 2022 Short-term incentive plan (STIP) The STIP rewards employees for the   past year’s performance. In 2022, the STIP  scorecard included ESG (including safety)   and financial measures. ESG (including safety) performance The ESG component of STIP includes  ambitious targets relating to safety, climate   and decarbonisation, improving female  representation, implementation of actions from  the Everyday Respect Report, the Juukan  Gorge Senate Inquiry Report, the 2020 Board  Report, as well as the critical elements of the  Global Industry Standard on Tailings  Management (GISTM). Safety is our number one priority, and we  achieved our fourth consecutive fatality-free  year in 2022. We have also maintained our  all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) performance  and enhanced our safety maturity model  (SMM) assessment approach as our safety  culture has evolved and matured.  There are elements of the ESG component  where we delivered above-target outcomes,  whereas in others, while results were  encouraging, we fell short of target. The overall  performance outcome of this component is  63.4% of maximum. More information about our  ESG performance can be found on page 122. Financial performance In 2022, we saw significant movement in  commodity prices amidst growing recession  fears and a decline in consumer confidence.  We remained focused on cost control  throughout the year, but experienced cost  pressures over and above general inflation  from higher market-linked prices for raw  materials, along with the impact of the Russia  and Ukraine war causing energy market  disruptions that resulted in higher energy  prices. Operationally, we achieved slightly  lower than expected production, mainly in the  first half of 2022 including disruptions  associated with COVID-19, resulting in labour  supply constraints and delays in replacement  projects in the Pilbara.  As a result, our reported 2022 financial results  of underlying earnings of $13.3 billion and   free cash flow of $9.0 billion were below plan.  Free cash flow reflected underspend on  development capital by $0.9 billion that is  excluded from the free cash flow STIP  measure. The under performance against  financial targets is reflected in the outcome of  Group financial performance at 29% of  maximum. Further details on our financial  performance can be found on page 121. Long-term incentive plan (LTIP) The performance period of the 2018  Performance Share Award (PSA) concluded in  December 2022 and vests on 23 February  2023. The vesting outcome of the 2018 PSA is  100%. The Committee considered the vesting  outcome in the round of underlying business  performance as well as within the context of  the consequence management framework  which was introduced in 2021, and was  satisfied that the outcome was fair and  representative of the shareholder experience  and that no discretion should be applied. 2023 remuneration decisions Against the backdrop of ongoing high inflation  and macroeconomic uncertainty, the  Committee is more cognisant than ever of the  need to strike an appropriate and careful  balance between fairness and competitiveness  when making decisions about pay.  In recognition of the extraordinary inflationary  pressures experienced globally in 2022, we  provided a one-off mid-year salary adjustment  to approximately 30,000 employees which  ranged from 2% to 5% in our major countries.  The Executive Committee did not receive this  adjustment. Effective 1 March 2023, the  Executive Committee will receive salary  increases in line with the broader employee  populations in their jurisdictions. In addition,  Bold Baatar and Simon Trott will receive an  additional increase in recognition of market  positioning within the limits of the Policy.  People & Remuneration  Committee Since 1 January 2023, the Committee is known  as the People & Remuneration Committee. With  the increasing importance of developing the  talent, capability and diversity of the  organisation in support of the culture change,  the Board unanimously agreed that this  Committee’s scope will now formally include  these areas in addition to remuneration. The  expanded scope of the Committee reinforces  the Board and organisation’s commitment  towards an inclusive and people-centred  culture, a key enabler of our strategic  ambitions. Further details of the Committee are  set out on page 119. Broader employee context The Board continued to engage with  employees throughout the year, as detailed   on page 95. These engagements enable the  Board to hear directly our people’s views on  pay. The disruptive impact brought about by  increased living costs was a regular topic of  engagement in 2022 and we responded by  making meaningful and significant investments  to ease the strain on employees via the one-off  mid-year salary adjustment.  The median Chief Executive pay ratio of 52:1   is higher than in 2021, primarily due to the  vesting of the first LTIP award granted to Jakob  Stausholm when he joined the company in 2018. Our focus on pay equity is evident in our  gender pay metrics, in which we continue to  make progress. Pay equity is a key pillar of   our annual remuneration approach. Gender  diversity in senior management roles also  remains a key aspect of our broader agenda on  diversity and inclusion. Further details on equal  pay and gender pay gap, together with a wider  discussion on diversity and inclusion, are  provided in the Sustainability section of this  report on page 59. Looking ahead As I have mentioned earlier, I met with several  shareholders and institutions in 2022 in relation  to the redesign of our STIP. In preparation for  our upcoming triennial Remuneration Policy  review, I also took this opportunity to explore  initial views on what role alternative measures,  for example decarbonisation and culture,   might play in our LTIP moving forward. The  Committee is mindful of the need to ensure  there is focus on the Group’s key strategic  priorities, balanced against ongoing focus on  shareholder returns, when measuring the  outcomes of our long-term incentives for our  executive team. These initial discussions were  both positive and constructive, and I look  forward to continuing this dialogue in  preparation for our updated Policy that will be  put forward for approval at the 2024 AGMs. As always, I welcome shareholder feedback on  our 2022 Directors’ Remuneration report. Yours sincerely,   Sam Laidlaw People & Remuneration Committee Chair 22 February 2023  ===== PAGE 114 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 112 2023 short-term incentive plan redesign In 2022, we undertook a review of our incentives and performance management framework grounded in a  belief that to deliver our ambitious strategy, we need to change the way we work. We believe there is an  opportunity for incentives to be aligned to our strategic priorities that focuses as much on “how” we deliver  as well as “what” we deliver, and to be more engaging so that they are better understood by participants. We are moving to a much simpler design, where the STIP for approximately 24,000 employees will be based  upon one Group scorecard rather than the diversified scorecards previously operated across the business  – this aligns the goals of all STIP participants which will aid the business in its pursuit of financial success  driven by our four objectives. The new STIP design maintains the existing weighting and measures on our Group financials while aligning  with our four objectives – achieving impeccable ESG, excel in development, best operator and social  licence – as well as people and culture. The STIP redesign is underpinned  by the following core principles:   – Alignment with strategy   – Reinforcing our values   – Simplification   – Collective achievement   – Transparency of targets,  progress and outcomes Group scorecard Our Group scorecard will be the  same for all eligible employees  and will track our progress against  achieving our four objectives, our  Group financial performance and  acceleration of our culture change.  It is weighted equally between   our financial performance and  strategic priorities. People and culture 10% Excel in development 10% Impeccable ESG (including safety) 20% Social licence 10% Unflexed financials 25% Best operator – Flexed financials 25% 50% Strategic 50% Financial Fatality deduction Safety is our number one priority and in the event of a fatality there  will be deductions applied to the scorecard outcome.

Strategic priority Reflection in scorecard People and culture Focuses on “how” we do things as well as “what” we achieve as a critical lever of accelerating our culture change and building an inclusive  workplace environment. Excel in development Measures progress in relation to exploration, studies and project execution. Impeccable ESG Safety in all its aspects remains a key priority alongside progressing the work on our decarbonisation pathways towards achieving our 2030 ambition. Social licence Measures our progress in building trust and meaningful relationships with our community of stakeholders. Best operator –  Flexed financials  Focuses on achievement of financial plan commitments. Unflexed financials Aligned to market conditions for our commodities. Group STIP outcome Our Group STIP is based on one scorecard for all eligible employees, focused on working together and how we deliver on our strategic priorities.  Individual performance will be assessed based on both the achievement of individual objectives (“what”) and living our values and behaviours (“how”).  The individual performance assessment may result in the Group STIP outcome being adjusted by +/- 25%. The multiplier is intended to be used  sparingly to address clear cases of out and under performance.  We have evolved our STIP to a model that focuses every employee’s efforts on delivering and executing on our strategic priorities and rewards  behaviours that uphold our values. The design is simple and intended to remove barriers to collaboration and encourages longer-term thinking.   It also places new emphasis on “how” we achieve – which is as important as “what” we achieve. If we are focused on the right things and working together to achieve them, Rio Tinto will perform better, benefiting all our stakeholders.  ===== PAGE 115 ===== 113 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Directors’ report Rationale for change The table below sets out the key areas of change and the rationale for the change. Component Old New Rationale Performance  metrics Executive Committee and  Managing Directors   – Financial = 50%    – ESG (safety) = 12%    – ESG (fatality) = 8%   – ESG (other) = 15%   – Individual = 15%  General Managers and below    – Financial = 25%    – Safety (fatality) = 6%    – Safety (other) = 9%    – Individual = 60%  All participants Financial = 50% Strategic = 50% (including 10%  on safety index)   – Individual modifier = +/-25% of  scorecard based on values,  behaviours and delivery of  results   – 10% deduction is applied to the  total scorecard in the event of  fatalities  Simplified and collective structure  for approximately 24,000  employees including executives.  Fatality modifier – Making sure  everyone goes home safe every  day is at the heart of who we are  and our operating philosophy.  Therefore if we fall short,  consequence will be applied. The majority of current STIP  participants have 6% of their STIP  subject to the binary fatality  measure and 9% subject to our  other safety metrics. The new  structure with a 10% safety index  and a 10% fatality deduction has a  larger weighting to safety for the  vast majority of participants. Positioning   of business  performance Metrics based on a mix of Group,  product group, regional or  asset-level performance  depending on each individual’s  role, business unit, function or site  of operation. Group scorecard applies to  approximately 24,000 employees  including executives.  The focus on collective outcomes  removes barriers to collaboration  and encourages win-win  outcomes across the Group. Positioning   of individual  performance Embedded in the scorecard   on an additive basis to the  business performance. Applied as an overlay on the  business scorecard multiplier   – +25% for values/behaviours  and impact   – -25% for failure to meet values  or to deliver on objectives For the Executive Committee, the  overall STIP outcome remains  capped at 200% of base salary.    – Rewarding collective success  while maintaining focus on  individual performance and  behaviours that uphold our  values and drive the outcomes  required to execute our strategy.   – Recognise the true stand-out  performers and applying  consequences to those not  meeting our standards  and values. The implementation of the new STIP design in 2023 firmly aligns our short-term incentive to our strategic agenda and culture ambition with collective  success and the “how” alongside the “what” at the heart. It is a reset and beginning of a journey during which we anticipate our incentives to continue  to evolve as we progress collectively and individually. The performance measures included in the scorecard are a mix of existing measures, new measures  which require baselining, and existing measures that are being collectively incorporated into a STIP scorecard for the first time. As demonstrated over  the past two years in relation to our ESG scorecard targets and outcomes within our previous STIP design, we remain fully committed to transparency,  fair and rigorous target setting and assessment of outcomes. With that said, as we embed this significant change across 24,000 employees, it is  important that we retain flexibility and are open to the exercise of judgment as provided for under our Remuneration Policy to address unintended and  unforeseen factors as we track and assess progress during the year and at year-end. To this end, we will provide transparent disclosure of the strategic  scorecard targets and outcomes in February 2024 as part of our 2023 remuneration-related disclosures.   ===== PAGE 116 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 114 Remuneration at a glance Our Remuneration Policy applies to our Executive and Non-Executive Directors and to the Chair. In accordance with Australian law, it also sets out the  Policy principles that apply to key management personnel who are not directors. Our Remuneration Policy, as approved at our 2021 annual general  meetings can be found at: riotinto.com/annualreport. The Remuneration Policy applicable to our executives is summarised in the table below. Element Purpose Operation and opportunity Changes Base salary To hire, motivate and  retain high-calibre  global talent.   – Base salaries are set to reflect broad alignment with comparable roles in the  global external market and the executive’s qualifications, responsibilities  and experience.   – Base salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee, and any increase is  normally aligned with the wider workforce, with a maximum individual annual  increase of 5% plus Consumer Price Index (CPI).    – An individual increase may be higher in specific circumstances, such as  promotion, increased responsibilities or market competitiveness.  Executives were not eligible for the  mid-year adjustment which applied  to the wider workforce in July 2022.  Executive Director salary increases  in March 2023 are below the  average increase in aggregate  applicable to the wider employee  population. 2023 base salary:   – CEO: £1,235,400   – CFO: £731,500 Pension or  superannuation Competitive benefits  are provided in order   to hire and retain.   – Rio Tinto may choose to offer participation in a pension plan, superannuation  fund, or a cash allowance in lieu.   – The maximum annual benefit is set to reflect the pension arrangements for the  wider employee population and is currently capped at 14% of base salary.  No change Other benefits   – Executives are eligible to receive benefits which may include private healthcare  cover, life and accident insurances, professional advice, and other minor benefits.   – Secondment, relocation and localisation benefits may also be made to and on  behalf of executives living outside their home country. No change Short-term  incentive plan  (STIP)  Focus participants on  achieving demanding  annual performance  goals in pursuit of  creating sustainable  value for our  stakeholders.   – Measures and weightings for the scorecard are selected by the Committee for  each financial year. At least 50% of the measures will relate to financial  performance, and a significant component will relate to safety. Other strategic,  ESG and individual business outcomes may be included.   – For financial performance, threshold performance results in a nil award (25% for  threshold performance against non-financial measures) and outstanding  performance results in 100%. The award is normally pro-rated on a straight-line  basis between threshold and outstanding.   – Maximum opportunity is capped at 200% of base salary for each executive.   – Normally, 50% of the STIP is delivered in cash and the balance is delivered in  shares that are deferred for three years as a Bonus Deferral Award (BDA).   – Dividends (or equivalents) may accrue in respect of any BDA that vest.   – The Committee retains the right to exercise discretion to ensure that the level  of award payable is appropriate.    – Malus, clawback and suspension provisions apply to the STIP and BDA. Move to one simplified Group  scorecard including:   – Financials (50%)   – Impeccable ESG (20%)   – Excel in development (10%)   – Social licence (10%)   – People and culture (10%) Individual performance modifier to  scorecard outcome (+/-25%). 10% fatality deduction applied to  the Group STIP outcome. Long-term  incentive plan  (LTIP) Performance Share  Awards (PSA) under   the LTIP are designed   to align executives’  rewards with successful  execution of Rio Tinto’s  long-term strategy and  ambitions which delivers  superior long-term  shareholder returns.   – Performance is measured against TSR relative to the EMIX Global Mining Index  and to the MSCI World Index.   – The Committee will set performance conditions aligned with the Group’s  long-term strategic objectives for each PSA grant. Relative TSR has been  chosen as the predominant measure of long-term performance. The Committee  retains the discretion to adjust the performance measures and weightings  as appropriate.   – Awards have a maximum face value of 400% of base salary. Threshold vesting is  22.5% of face value. Target is 50% of face value.   – Dividends (or equivalents) may accrue in respect of any PSA that vest.   – The Committee retains the right to exercise discretion and seeks to ensure that  outcomes are fair and reflective of the overall performance of the company  during the performance period.   – Malus, clawback and suspension provisions apply to LTIP awards. No change Shareholding  requirements Aligning executives’  interests with  shareholders through  the requirement to build  up and maintain a  material shareholding in  the company.   – Over a five-year period, executives should reach a share ownership in Rio Tinto  shares equivalent in value to:   – Chief Executive: four times base salary.   – Other executives: three times base salary.   – Longer periods may be accepted for new appointments.   – Executive Directors are required to retain a holding for two years after leaving the  Group in line with the shareholding requirements. No change  ===== PAGE 117 ===== 115 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Directors’ report Element Purpose Operation and opportunity Recruitment  policy Recruit  high-calibre  global talent.   – No form of “golden hello” will be provided upon recruitment. In the case of internal appointments, existing commitments will be honoured.   – Our approach concerning “buy-outs” is to determine a reasonable level of award, on a like-for-like basis, consisting primarily of  share-based awards, but also potentially cash, taking into consideration the quantum of forfeited awards, their performance  conditions and vesting schedules.   – Other elements of remuneration are to be consistent with the Policy applicable to other executives. Termination  policy Appropriately  reward eligible  and ineligible  leavers.   – An Executive Director’s notice period is normally 12 months, during which they will receive their base salary and other benefits.   – Ineligible leavers forfeit their unvested LTIP and STIP entitlement.   – An eligible leaver may receive the following:   – A discretionary STIP award on a pro-rata basis, payable on the normal STIP payment date in cash.   – Any unvested BDA from prior year awards will normally vest on the scheduled vesting date.   – Unvested LTIPs will normally be retained and vest on the scheduled vesting date, subject to performance conditions  where applicable.   – PSA and Management Share Awards (MSA), where applicable, will be reduced if the executive leaves within 36 months of grant.   – STIP and LTIP awards are subject to malus, clawback and suspension following termination. Malus,  clawback and  suspension Enables the  Committee   to use its  discretion   to reduce  incentive  awards in   the event of  exceptional  circumstances.   – Under both the malus and clawback provisions, where the Committee determines that an exceptional circumstance has occurred,  it may, at its discretion, reduce the STIP award or the number of shares to be received on vesting of an award, or, for a period of two  years after the vesting of an award, the Committee can clawback value from a participant.    – The Committee will apply the consequence management framework and the circumstances under which the Committee exercises  such discretion may include, inter alia:   – fraud, misconduct or an exceptional event which has had, or may have, a material effect on the value, or reputation or social  licence of any member of the Group;   – an error in the Group’s financial statements which requires a material downward restatement;   – personal performance and leadership behaviour of a participant, of their product group or of the Group which does not justify  vesting or where the participant’s conduct or performance has been in breach of their employment contract, any laws, rules or  codes of conduct applicable to them or the standards or demeanour reasonably expected of a person in their position;   – misstatement or misrepresentation of performance;   – where any team, business area, member of the Group or profit centre in which the participant works or worked has been found  guilty in connection with any regulatory investigation or has been in breach of any laws, rules or codes of conduct applicable to it  or the standards, leadership behaviour or demeanour reasonably expected of it;    – where the Committee determines that there has been material damage to the Group’s social licence to operate; or   – a catastrophic safety or environmental event.   – Under the suspension provisions, the Committee may suspend the vesting of an award for up to five years until the outcome of any  internal or external investigation is concluded and may then reduce or lapse the participant’s award based on the outcome of that  investigation. Where suspension applies, the 24-month clawback period will not extend beyond the period commencing from the  original vesting date. Discretion Ensures pay  outcomes  reflect the  Group’s overall  performance  and risk appetite.   – The Committee reserves the right to review all remuneration outcomes arising from mechanistic application of performance  conditions and to exercise discretion to make adjustments where such outcomes do not properly reflect underlying performance or  the experience of shareholders or other stakeholders.   – The Committee may at its discretion adjust and/or set different performance measures if events occur which cause the Committee  to determine that the measures are no longer appropriate or in the best interests of shareholders or other stakeholders, and that  amendment is required so that the measures, as far as possible, achieve their original purpose. Such discretion will be exercised  judiciously and clearly disclosed and explained in the Implementation report. When developing the Remuneration Policy, the Committee considered the pay arrangements from the perspective of clarity, simplicity, risk,  predictability, proportionality and alignment to culture. Further detail is set out on page 151 of the 2020 Annual Report. When remuneration is delivered The following chart provides a timeline of when remuneration is delivered, using 2022 as an example.

The remuneration standard applied to the  wider employee population is inspired by and  consistent with the Policy applicable to the  executives. This allows the total reward offering  to employees to be competitive and strongly  linked to performance while maintaining  alignment with the company culture. Remuneration principles Competitive  reward Reward  performance Recognise  potential Focus on  wellbeing Retain   talent Fairness Providing equal pay for equivalent roles, contribution and performance. Pay equity is  reviewed and monitored through different lenses:   – In-depth pay equity analysis as part of the remuneration review process through which  we manage pay equity from multiple perspectives including gender.   – Minimum global standards implemented across all countries to ensure the foundations  of our total reward offerings meet levels determined by the Group irrespective of   local market practices. Examples include global standards for parental leave and  life assurance. Ownership   – Promoting material participation in our all-employee share plan (myShare) to create  stewardship and provide employees with access to building longer-term financial  security.   – As at 31 December 2022, approximately 30,000 (2021: 25,000) of our employees  across more than 30 countries are shareholders in the company.   – Employees invest approximately $19m (2021: $16m) in Rio Tinto shares every quarter  through the myShare plan.   – Employees eligible for LTIP awards receive these as either MSA, vesting over  three years and not subject to performance conditions, and/or PSA, which are  performance-tested over five years. Consistency   – Consistency in implementation of the Remuneration Policy is an enabler for  transparency and fairness.   – The introduction of the new STIP design using one scorecard for around 24,000  employees, including executives, to support delivery of the strategy and a mindset shift  in how we win going forward. Wellbeing   – A one-off mid-year salary adjustment to support our employees in an unprecedented  inflationary period of economic strain for many households globally.   – Industry and market-leading benefits programmes focused on holistic and integrated  support for physical, mental and financial wellbeing.    – Benefits that can be tailored to suit different needs and life stages, including employee  assistance, minimum standard for life, accident and disability insurances, medical   plans and virtual care, health screening and prevention, and subsidised health and  wellbeing services. Security   – Reward principles that protect employee purchasing power globally.   – Accurate and timely payment of remuneration.   – Appropriate balance between fixed and variable pay at all levels.

About our reporting As our shares are listed on both the Australian  and London Stock Exchanges, the information  provided within our Remuneration report  must comply with the reporting requirements  of both countries. Our regulatory responsibilities impact the  volume of information we provide, as well as  the complexity. In Australia, we need to report  on a wider group of executives, as described in  the following paragraph. In addition, as set out  in the summary table below, the two reporting  regimes follow different methodologies for  calculating remuneration. In the UK, disclosure is required for the  Board, including the Executive Directors.  The Australian legislation requires disclosures  in respect of “key management personnel”  (KMP), being those persons having authority  and responsibility for planning, directing   and controlling the activities of the Group.  Accordingly, our KMP comprise the Board,  all product group Chief Executives, and the  Chief Commercial Officer. Throughout this Remuneration report, KMP  are collectively referred to as “executives”.  They are listed on page 127, with details of the  positions held during the year and dates of  appointment to those roles. The single total figure of remuneration table  on page 120 shows remuneration for our  Executive Directors, gross of tax and in the  relevant currency of award or payment. In table 1a on page 131, we report information  regarding executives in accordance with  Australian statutory disclosure requirements.  The information is shown gross of tax and in  US dollars. The remuneration details in table 1a  include accounting values relating to various  parts of the remuneration package, most  notably LTIP awards, and require a different  methodology for calculating the pension value.  The figures in the single total figure of  remuneration table are therefore not directly  comparable with those in table 1a. Where  applicable, amounts have been converted  using the relevant average exchange rates  included in the notes to table 1a. In table 1b on page 132, we report the  remuneration of the Chair and the Non- Executive Directors. Certain information  contained within the Remuneration report is  audited, as outlined on page 135. UK   – For reporting purposes, remuneration is  divided into fixed and variable elements.   – We report remuneration in the currency  it is paid, for example, where a UK executive  is paid in pounds sterling, remuneration  is reported in pounds sterling. Australia   – For reporting purposes, remuneration is  divided into short- and long-term elements.   – All remuneration is reported in US dollars,  so using the previous example, the UK  executives’ remuneration would be  converted to US dollars using the average  exchange rate for the financial year (except  STIP, which is converted at the year-end  exchange rate). The table below summarises the elements of  each component of remuneration, as well as  the significant differences in the approaches  to measurement. Shareholder voting The Implementation report, together with  the annual statement by the People &  Remuneration Committee Chair, is subject to  an advisory vote each year as required by UK  legislation. Under Australian legislation, the  Remuneration report as a whole is subject to an  advisory vote. All remuneration-related  resolutions will be voted on at the AGMs as  Joint Decision Matters by Rio Tinto plc and  Rio Tinto Limited shareholders.  The differing approaches explained As well as the difference in methodology for  measuring remuneration, there are also key  differences in how remuneration is reported  in the UK and Australia. UK Australia Fixed Base salary Short-term Base salary Benefits STIP – cash element  Pension The value of the pension contribution  and payment in lieu of pension paid during  the year.

Total remuneration  ===== PAGE 121 ===== 119 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Directors’ report People & Remuneration Committee  responsibilities Effective 1 January 2023, the Committee   will be renamed to the People & Remuneration  Committee to reflect its additional responsibilities  to include people and culture matters in  addition to remuneration. The Committee’s  responsibilities have been updated within our  terms of reference to reflect the revised scope  of responsibilities, which is reviewed annually.  The terms of reference are published in the  corporate governance section of riotinto.com. Our responsibilities include: People   – Strategic workforce planning including  talent, succession and development  planning within the Group.   – Leadership development.   – Oversight of the Board’s workforce  engagement plan and implementation. Culture   – Strategies to implement the Group’s values  and to progress implementation of the  Everyday Respect Report recommendations.   – Strategies, initiatives and performance  measures around organisational culture   and desired behaviours.   – Diversity and inclusion. Remuneration   – Determining the Group’s remuneration  strategy, policy and framework.   – Determining the remuneration of the Chair,  Executive Directors and other members of  the Executive Committee.   – Determining the mix and operation of the  Group’s short- and long-term incentive  plans and ensuring alignment with the  company’s strategic objectives.   – Overseeing the operation of the Group’s  short- and long-term incentive plans for  executives, including approving awards,  setting performance criteria, and  determining any vesting, and where  necessary applying the consequence  management framework to current and  prior awards.   – Determining contractual notice periods and  termination commitments, and setting  retention and termination arrangements  for executives.   – Determining awards under the Group’s  all-employee share plan.   – Responsible for the Annual Remuneration  report and shareholder engagement on  Remuneration Policy and implementation, and  other related matters including gender pay.   – Reviewing workforce remuneration and  related policies and the alignment of  incentives and rewards with culture, taking  these into account when setting the Policy  for Executive Director remuneration.   – Engagement and independence of external  remuneration advisers. We consider the level of pay and conditions  for all employees across the Group when  determining executive remuneration. Committee membership The members of the Committee during the year  and to the date of this report were: Sam Laidlaw   (Committee Chair) Dominic Barton (from  4 April 2022) Megan Clark Simon McKeon Jennifer Nason Simon Thompson  (to 5 May 2022) Ngaire Woods How we work The Group Company Secretary (or their  delegate) attends meetings as secretary to the  Committee. The Chief Executive, Chief People  Officer and Head of Reward attend appropriate  parts of the meetings at the invitation of the  Committee Chair. No individual is in attendance  during discussions about their own remuneration.  Independent advisers The Committee has a protocol for engaging   and working with remuneration consultants to  ensure that “remuneration recommendations”  (being advice relating to the elements of  remuneration for KMP, as defined under the  Australian Corporations Act) are made free from  undue influence by key management personnel  to whom they may relate. We monitored  compliance with these requirements throughout  2022. Deloitte, the appointed advisers to the  Committee, gave declarations to the effect that  any remuneration recommendations were made  free from undue influence by KMP to whom they  related, and the Board has received assurance  from the Committee and is satisfied that this was  the case. Deloitte are members of the Remuneration  Consultants’ Group, and voluntarily operate  under its Code of Conduct (the Code) in  relation to executive remuneration consulting  in the UK. The Code is based upon principles  of transparency, integrity, objectivity,  competence, due care and confidentiality.  Deloitte has confirmed that they adhered  to the Code throughout 2022 for all  remuneration services provided to   Rio Tinto. The Code is available online  at remunerationconsultantsgroup.com. The Committee is satisfied that the Deloitte team  is independent. During 2022, Deloitte’s services  also included attending Committee meetings,  providing support on the new incentive design  and giving advice in relation to management  proposals and shareholder consultations.  Deloitte was paid $545,620 (2021: $365, 777)   for these services. Fees were charged on the  basis of time and expenses incurred. We received other services and publications  relating to remuneration data from a range of  sources. During the year, Deloitte also provided  internal audit, tax compliance and other  non-audit advisory services. These services  were provided under separate engagement  terms and the Committee is satisfied that there  were no conflicts of interest. How the Committee spent its time  in 2022 During 2022, the Committee met ten times.  We fulfilled our responsibilities as set out in   our terms of reference. Our work in 2022 included:   – Determining any base salary adjustments  and LTIP grants for executives.   – Determining the targets for the 2022 STIP.   – Reviewed performance of the accountable  executives for GISTM implementation.   – Reviewing performance against the 2021  STIP and 2017 PSA targets, including  assessing applicable adjustments.   – Considering shareholder feedback on the  remuneration-related resolutions for the  2022 AGMs.   – Determining the terms of appointment for   the new Chair.   – Development of the STIP redesign,   including consultation with shareholders   and proxy advisers.   – Further refinement of the consequence  management framework.   – Reviewing executives’ progress towards the  Group’s share ownership requirements.   – Reviewing the strategy and annual reports  on the Group’s global benefit plans.   – Consideration of the 2022 mid-year salary  adjustment for the broader employee  workforce, noting that executives would not  receive any adjustment. Performance review process   for executives We conduct annual performance reviews for   all executives. Our key objectives for the  performance review process are to:   – Improve organisational effectiveness by  creating alignment between the executive’s  objectives, Rio Tinto’s strategy, the  individual’s leadership behaviours and  the company’s values.   – Provide a consistent, transparent and  balanced approach to measure, recognise  and reward executive performance. The Chief Executive conducts the review for  members of the Executive Committee and  recommends the performance outcomes to the  Committee. The Chief Executive’s performance  is assessed by the Chair of the Board and it is  discussed and considered with the Committee  and the full Board. Performance reviews for all  executives took place in 2022 and early 2023.  ===== PAGE 122 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 120 Implementation report continued Executive Directors Single total figure of remuneration (£’000) Bonus –   STIP payment Value of  LTIP awards vesting1 Executive Director (£’000) Year Base  salary Benefits Pension Total   fixed Cash Deferred  shares Face  value Share price  appreciation Total  variable Single   total figure Jakob Stausholm (Chief Executive) 2022 1,177 130 165 1,472 575 576 1,418 767 3,336 4,808 Jakob Stausholm (Chief Executive) 2021 1,150 67 161 1,378 705 705 – – 1,410 2,788 Peter Cunningham (Chief Financial Officer)2 2022 700 39 98 837 320 320 348 188 1,176 2,013 Peter Cunningham (Chief Financial Officer)2 2021 377 33 53 463 216 217 421 583 1,437 1,900 1.

At the end of the performance period, LTIP values are based on estimates of both the number of shares that will ultimately vest and the share price.  These estimates are restated in the following year, once actual values are known. Refer to page 125 for further detail. Fixed remuneration Base salary  Consistent with prior practice, Executive Director base salary increases are in line with that awarded to the wider employee population. Base salaries  are reviewed with a 1 March effective date. During 2022, we provided a mid-year salary adjustment in order to recognise unprecedented inflation  levels, which resulted in salary increases between 2% to 5% for eligible employees in our major jurisdictions. The Executive Directors did not  participate in this mid-year salary adjustment.

On cessation of employment, any unvested deferred shares will lapse unless the Committee decides the executive is an eligible leaver.  2022 STIP measures Performance categories Weighting Commentary Financial 50% Our current financial measures are based on two KPIs that are used in managing the business.  The first, underlying earnings, gives insight to cost management, production and performance efficiency.   A reconciliation of underlying earnings to net earnings is provided on pages 274-275. STIP free cash flow demonstrates how we convert underlying earnings to cash and provides further insight into how we are  managing costs, efficiency and productivity. STIP free cash flow comprises free cash flow (as reported on page 277), adjusted to  exclude dividends paid to holders of non-controlling interests in subsidiaries ($0.4billion) and development capital expenditure  ($2.8 billion). This adjusted metric excludes the impact of those components of free cash flow which are not directly related to  performance in the year and therefore better represents underlying business performance.  ESG 35% A strong focus on ESG is critical to the success of our strategy. ESG measures make up 15% for all executives and include  Environmental measures (one-third), Social measures (one-third) and Governance measures (one-third).  Safety measures make up 20% and include a standalone binary fatality measure (40%), with the remainder split between all-injury  frequency rate (AIFR) (20%) and measures relating to our safety maturity model (SMM) (40%). Individual 15% An assessment of individual performance against key priorities and objectives for the year. The STIP measures for product group Chief Executives (PGCEs) include product group financial and safety measures in addition to Group  financial measures. Calculation of 2022 STIP award The following tables summarise the calculation of STIP award for the Executive Directors. Below threshold payout is nil on the Group safety and  financial measures.

In line with our standard STIP principles, the Committee considered whether any adjustments were warranted to ensure the outcome was a fair reflection  of underlying performance. Three adjustments were approved which were associated with circumstances which were deemed not to reflect performance  during the year. These relate to the settlement paid to the Australian Tax Office for all tax matters in dispute; the effect of higher than expected inflation  on our closure liabilities which resulted in higher non-cash charges to underlying earnings; and the settlement of foreign exchange derivatives  associated with the Group’s dividends which significantly impacted the Group’s free cash flow.   ===== PAGE 124 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 122 Group ESG measures Weighting  (out of 100%) Threshold Target Outstanding Result Result (% of  maximum) Weighted result  (out of 100%) Safety Fatality prevention 8% n/a n/a No fatality 100% 8.0% AIFR 4% 0.44 0.38 0.30 0.40 42.5% 1.7% SMM1 (sites with < 5.5 baseline) 8% Rebased  2021 score Improvement of   0.7 or achieve a   total score of 6.0,  whichever is less  Improvement of   1.5 or achieve a   total score of 7.3,  whichever is less 4.3 55% 4.4% SMM1 (the sites with >= 5.5  baseline) Rebased  2021 score Improvement of 0.5  6.1 Environment Progress Scope 1 and 2 abatement  projects reducing 2025 emissions2,5 2.5% 0.8Mt CO2e 1.65Mt CO2e 0.287Mt CO2e 0% 0% Delivery of goals to progress  Scope 3 partnership strategy5 2.5% 3 out of 4 4 out of 4 4 of 4 100% 2.5% Social Improve representation of women  in workforce5 2.5% 2% 3% 1.4% 0% 0% Implement actions from Everyday  Respect Report3,5 2.5% 80% actions  complete 100% actions  complete 85.5% actions  completed 63.8% 1.6% Governance Actions from Senate Inquiry Interim  & 2020 Board Report5 2.5% 90% actions  complete 100% actions  complete 95% actions  completed 75% 1.9% Critical elements of 2022 plan to  implement GISTM4,5 2.5% See footnote See footnote 56% asset  work plan  completion 85% 2.1% Total Group ESG 35% 63.4% 22.2% 1. The Group SMM STIP result is the average of the SMM STIP scores achieved by the individual assets included in the programme. The 2021 SMM scores formed the baseline which was adjusted to  reflect the enhancements to SMM described below as well as the removal of assets moving into closure and the transition of projects into assets that are now included within the scope of SMM.  2. Projects that individually reduce 2025 emissions by over 5kt CO2, which may include approved renewable energy, abatement and energy efficiency projects. 3. There are two equal components to measure the implementation of actions from the Everyday Respect Report. The first component is to have all leaders (approximately 6,000 individuals) trained on  responsibilities, prevention and response management of harmful behaviours in the workplace. The target and outstanding achievement is to have 80% and 100% of leaders complete the training  respectively. The second component is to have safe and inclusive facilities at our workplaces. The target achievement is to complete a facilities review through inclusive on the ground engagement  and implement safety critical upgrades of all facilities. The outstanding achievement is to implement all improvements of facilities that address inclusion and respect for all employees and contractors. 4. Target is to have all asset gap analyses complete and no tailings incidents with off-lease impacts. Outstanding is to achieve 80% completion of asset work plans to close gaps for “very high” and  ”extreme” consequence facilities. 5. No payout below target. With the exception of the binary approach to fatality prevention, payout of 50% of maximum for achieving target, going up in a straight line to outstanding. Commentary on ESG measures In 2022, the STIP was simplified to combine all ESG measures (including safety) into a single ESG scorecard. The weighting for safety and other ESG  metrics remained consistent with 2021. On safety, for a fourth consecutive year in 2022, we achieved zero fatalities. The all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) of 0.40 in 2022 was at the same level as the previous year. The SMM was introduced to the business in 2019 and is now in the fourth consecutive year of implementation. As the SMM progressed in its evolution  and maturity, a series of enhancements were made in 2022 to the SMM assessment approach after comprehensive review and engagement with  stakeholders. The enhancements included shifting the focus from verifying systems and rituals to assessing the quality and impact of the model on our  people’s mindsets to drive safer decision making; integration of contractor partners in the application of the model ensuring safety and inclusion for  both employees and contractors at Rio Tinto; adding an element to the model focused on operational ownership of environment and health risks to  support our goal of impeccable ESG credentials; and elevating focus on quality pre-shift meetings, first party assurance, management of change and  systemic factors in incident investigations. The SMM enhancements reset our target expectations around safety maturity which necessitated a reset of  the baseline scores. In order to reset, we sample tested sites against the updated criteria in Q4 2021. Following which, it was determined to reduce  baseline scores by 1.5 which formed the basis of the 2022 targets. On environment, we took important foundational steps to advance towards our ambitious climate change targets by approving abatement projects  and progressing our Scope 3 partnership strategy. The delivery of goals to progress our Scope 3 partnerships included commencement of phase 2 of  a green hydrogen production study in Eastern Canada; completed laboratory test work on low carbon research project and approval to move to pilot  phase; developed a work plan for lower carbon production process and a technology deployment plan across RTA smelters; and implemented  tracking processes to enhance visibility and oversight of shipping related emissions. We fell short of target for the Scope 1 and 2 abatement projects but exceeded our delivery of goals to progress Scope 3 partnerships. The main drivers  for the shortfall to threshold on the Scope 1 and 2 abatement projects are our Iron Ore project commissioning and approval delays, and Minerals delays.  On social, our aspiration is to foster an environment where all aspects of diversity are represented, included, and respected. The target related to  improving representation of women in the workforce by at least 2% and implementation of actions from Everyday Respect Report. For representation  of women in the workforce, we achieved 1.4% which fell short of target but it is noted that representation of women has increased from 17.7% in 2018 to  22.9% in 2022. In implementing the recommendations of the Everyday Respect Report during the year, we trained 91% of our leaders and completed  our facilities review and rectified the urgent safety risks. On governance, our efforts in 2022 were focused on the actions from the Senate Inquiry Interim and 2020 Board Report alongside critical elements of  the 2022 plan to implement the GISTM. We achieved outcomes between target and outstanding for both components. In the implementation of the  actions from the Senate Inquiry Interim and 2020 Board Report, we focused on the completion of an Independent Cultural Heritage Management  Audit, our 2022 communities and social performance (CSP) standard and implementation of cultural heritage controls. With regards to the critical  elements of the 2022 plan for GISTM implementation, the teams completed all asset gap analyses and had no tailings incidents with off-lease impacts,  and partially completed the asset work plans to close gaps for “very high” and “extreme” consequence facilities.

There are several promising initiatives on  renewable energy development (eg, ELYSISTM, Nuton and the various green steel projects) that will need to be progressed in 2023. Social licence   – Government relationships and initiatives in key countries and regions have improved significantly.   – The co-management agreement with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people, signed in November 2022, was an important moment to mark a  change from the past.   – Led civil society organisation (CSO) roundtables which has driven better understanding of community needs and deepening relationships with  key stakeholders. Best operator   – While operating performance versus plan was disappointing, the essential elements to drive improvement in operational consistency are being put in  place, such as the Group-wide roll-out of the SPS programme and the sustained focus on asset integrity.   – Second half performance was encouraging (particularly in Iron Ore), and we achieved first ore at Gudai-Darri.  Excel in  development   – Significant progress in the last 12 months. This includes a substantive turnaround across the Iron Ore portfolio (Pilbara and Simandou). In the Pilbara,  the short- and long-term health of the business has markedly improved. The first of the mid-term new mines to secure the Pilbara has been approved  with the Notice to Proceed for Western Range in partnership with Baowu. The agreement at Rhodes Ridge with the Bennett family provides a long-term  pathway back to industry leadership in the Pilbara.   – In the development of Simandou, Rio Tinto has re-established itself as a pivotal partner amongst the Guinean government, our Chinese partners and  infrastructure providers. The project’s development will be an essential building block for our future.   – In Copper, the successful buy-out of the minority shareholders in TRQ, in a very challenging environment, has provided an essential building block to  our copper growth and relationship with the Mongolian Government.   – While development of the Jadar lithium mine in Serbia has been delayed, significant progress has been made on our Battery Materials expansion,  with the acceleration of the Rincon project in Argentina. Leadership   and culture   – There has been a deep and continued focus on improving the culture of Rio Tinto. The Everyday Respect Report was published with bold transparency.    – Progress to implement the 26 recommendations of the Everyday Respect Report is on track.   – There has been a substantial investment in leadership development, which has been well received in the business.   – The most recent People Survey saw significantly increased engagement with a higher participation rate (+9%) and an eSAT and Recommend increase  (+2 and +3 respectively).

These will be disclosed alongside the outturn retrospectively  in the 2023 Implementation report. Implementation report continued LTIP PSAs granted in 2018 were based on two performance conditions,  all measured over a five-year performance period:   – TSR relative to the EMIX Global Mining Index – 50%.   – TSR relative to the MSCI World Index – 50%. The TSR performance condition against both indices has been   met in full. The value of the shares vesting included in the single   total figure of remuneration table for 2022 is an estimate, with   the actuals determined when share price on vesting is known.   The disclosed value is based on:   – The approved TSR outcome relative to the EMIX Global Mining Index  and MSCI World Index (with associated dividend equivalent shares).   – The average share prices for Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited over  the last quarter of the five-year performance period (Q4 2022).   – The actual value associated with the 2018 PSA vesting will be  disclosed in the 2023 Remuneration report.  ===== PAGE 127 ===== 125 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Directors’ report Calculation of 2018 PSA vesting Our remuneration consultants, Deloitte, calculated performance against the TSR measures.

The value of the shares vesting included in the single total figure of remuneration table for 2022 is an estimate the average share prices for Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited over the last quarter of  the relevant year. The TSR component of the 2017 PSA vested in full on 24 February 2022 with Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited share prices of £55.68 and A$119.87  respectively (closing share price on the day prior to vesting). Final rank for the EBIT margin component was 6th, which resulted in vesting of nil. Overall  vesting outcome for the 2017 PSA was therefore 66.7%. Dividend equivalents were equal to 31.8% of the vested awards. LTIP awards granted in 2022 These awards are subject to TSR performance relative to the EMIX Global Mining Index and MSCI World Index (equal weighting).

In line with Policy, the grant price for PSA is determined by reference to the average share price for the calendar year prior to year of grant. Performance measures The Committee intends to grant 2023 PSAs with performance metrics, weightings and targets in line with the approach taken in previous years.  The Committee is aware that IHS Markit, the provider of the EMIX Global Mining Index, is conducting a consultation on the cessation of the EMIX indices,  including the EMIX Global Mining Index. In the event that the EMIX Global Mining Index is discontinued, the Committee will review and determine an  appropriate approach to measuring TSR performance relative to sector peers for the 2023 PSAs as well as in-flight awards. In line with best practice  principles, the Committee will seek to ensure that any changes result in a fair outcome for both shareholders and participants with performance targets  being of a commensurate stretch as the existing targets. Further disclosure will be provided in due course.

All outstanding but unvested LTIP awards earned in previous years lapsed and were forfeited when Tom Albanese left the Group. 2. STIP award and PSA vesting percentages restated following release from the deed of deferral.  3. Jakob Stausholm joined Rio Tinto in September 2018 and became Chief Executive on 1 January 2021. He therefore did not participate in the 2017 LTIP which vested at 66.7% of maximum. TSR We use relative TSR against the EMIX Global Mining Index and the  MSCI World Index as our performance measures when we determine the  vesting of PSA granted in 2018.  The graph below shows Rio Tinto’s TSR performance for the 2018 PSA.  It uses the same methodology as that used to calculate the vesting for  the PSA granted in 2018 with a performance period that ended on  31 December 2022. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 2017 2022 2018 2019 2020 2021 Rio Tinto Group EMIX Global Mining Index MSCI World Index Total shareholder return 1.

The Remuneration Policy applicable to the Executive Directors is also  applicable to the other executive KMP with variances specified  in this section. The remuneration mix for other executive KMP under this Policy is set   out in the chart below. Remuneration mix Assumptions The value of benefits is estimated at 11% of base salary. Performance-related (At risk) Target STIP and LTIP  performance   – STIP award of 50% of the maximum award   (equates to 100% of base salary)   – PSA expected value of 50% of face value, calculated  as 200% of base salary Maximum STIP and  LTIP performance   – A maximum STIP award of 200% of base salary   – Maximum PSA face value of 400% of base salary No assumption has been made for growth in share price and payment  of dividend equivalents.

Variations may occur in instances in which an individual has changed position, or the position’s duties and  responsibilities have been enlarged for example as a result of a reorganisation or acquisition, or where an individual’s remuneration has fallen below  comparable positions’ market remuneration.  In recognition of the extraordinary inflationary pressures experienced globally in 2022, we provided a one-off mid-year salary adjustment to  approximately 30,000 employees which ranged from 2% to 5% in our major countries. The Executive Committee did not receive this adjustment.  Effective 1 March 2023, the Executive Committee will receive salary increases in line with the broader employee population in their jurisdictions.  In addition, Bold Baatar and Simon Trott will receive an additional increase in recognition of market positioning within the limits of the Policy.

Service contracts All executives have service contracts which can be terminated by the  company with 12 months’ notice in writing, or by the employee with six  months’ notice in writing, or immediately by the company by paying base  salary only in lieu of any unexpired notice. Other KMP appointments All newly appointed executives have received a remuneration package  that is aligned with our Remuneration Policy and is comprised of base  salary in line with market benchmarks; target STIP opportunities of 100%  of base salary (with maximum opportunities of 200% of base salary); LTIP  awards of up to 400% of base salary; company pension contributions of  14% of base salary; and other benefits such as company-provided  healthcare coverage, and continued eligibility to participate in the  all-employee share plans. A minimum shareholding requirement of 300%  of base salary applies on appointment to be built up over subsequent years. Executive departures No executives ceased employment in 2022.  Broader employee disclosures Chief Executive pay ratio The ratio of the single total figure of remuneration for the Chief Executive  to the lower quartile, median and upper quartile Rio Tinto Australian  employee population for 2022 is set out in the table below. Lower quartile Median Upper quartile 2022 76 52 42 20211 49 32 26 1. 2021 pay ratio data has been restated based on actual pay outcomes for the CEO in 2021. The median CEO pay ratio of 52:1 is higher than last year, primarily due to  the first vesting of Jakob’s LTIP award from 2018 which vested at the end  of the 2022 performance year. The Committee continues to be mindful of  the relationship between executive remuneration and that of our broader  workforce. The Committee’s decision making will continue to be  supported by regular and detailed reporting on these matters.  As the company employs fewer than 250 employees in the UK, this analysis  has been provided on a voluntary basis.

No prior year data as appointed as a Non-Executive Director in 2022. 5. Ceased as a Non-Executive Director in 2022. 6. Fees compared on an annualised basis. 7. Since Rio Tinto plc, the statutory entity for which this disclosure is required, does not have any employees, we have included voluntary disclosure of the change in employee pay for our Australian  employees who make up more than 40% of our employee population. “–” in the table signifies no reported change as a result of the absence of comparable data. Annual fees payable The table below shows the annual fees paid in 2022 and payable in 2023  to the Chair and Non-Executive Directors. 2023 2022 Director fees Chair’s fee £730,000 £730,000 Non-Executive Director base fee £95,000 £95,000 Non-Executive Director base fee  for Australian residents £105,000 £105,000 Senior Independent Director £45,000 £45,000 Committee fees Audit & Risk Committee Chair £40,000 £40,000 Audit & Risk Committee member £25,000 £25,000 People & Remuneration Committee Chair £35,000 £35,000 People & Remuneration Committee member £20,000 £20,000 Sustainability Committee Chair £35,000 £35,000 Sustainability Committee member £20,000 £20,000 Nominations Committee member £7,500 £7,500 Meeting allowances Long distance (flights over 10 hours per journey) £10,000 £10,000 Medium distance (flights of 5-10 hours per journey) £5,000 £5,000 The Chair’s fee is determined by the Committee and was last increased  on 1 July 2013. All other fees are subject to review by the Board on the  recommendation of the Chair’s Committee. The Chair’s Committee conducted a review of Non-Executive Director  fees in November 2022. Following this review, it was determined that all  fees and travel allowances should remain unchanged. The additional £10,000 allowance for eligible Australian Directors is to  compensate them for additional UK National Insurance contributions  which, unlike Directors based in other jurisdictions, they are not able to  offset against their local tax payments.  Non-Executive Directors What we paid our Chair and Non-Executive Directors Positions held We list the Non-Executive Directors who held office during 2022 below.  Each held office for the whole of 2022 unless otherwise indicated.  Their years of appointment are reported in “Board of Directors”  on pages 90-91. Name Title Simon Thompson Chair (to 5 May 2022) Dominic Barton Chair (from 6 May 2022) Non-Executive Director (from 4 April 2022  to 5 May 2022) Megan Clark Non-Executive Director Hinda Gharbi Non-Executive Director (to 8 April 2022) Simon Henry Non-Executive Director Sam Laidlaw Non-Executive Director Simon McKeon Non-Executive Director Jennifer Nason Non-Executive Director Ngaire Woods  Non-Executive Director Ben Wyatt  Non-Executive Director Service contracts The Chair and Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment from the  company stipulate their terms of appointment, including their duties and  responsibilities as Directors. Each Non-Executive Director is appointed  subject to their election and annual re-election by shareholders. The  Chair’s appointment may be terminated by either party giving 12 months’  notice and Non-Executive Directors’ appointments may be terminated  by either party giving three months’ notice.  ===== PAGE 132 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 130 Other statutory disclosures Other share plans All-employee share plans The Committee believes that all employees should be given the  opportunity to become shareholders in our business, and that share  plans help engage, retain and motivate employees over the long term.  Rio Tinto’s share plans are therefore part of its standard remuneration  practice, to encourage employee share ownership and create alignment  with the shareholder experience. Executives may participate in broad- based share plans that are available to Group employees generally and  to which performance conditions do not apply. A global employee share purchase plan is normally offered to all   eligible employees unless there are local jurisdictional restrictions.  Under the plan, employees may acquire shares up to the value of $5,250  (or equivalent in other currencies) per year or capped at 15% of their  base salary if lower. Each share purchased will be matched by the  company, providing the participant holds the shares, and is still  employed, at the end of the three-year vesting period. Approximately 30,000 (59%) of our employees are shareholders as a  result of participating in these plans. In the UK, these arrangements are  partially delivered through the UK Share Plan which is a UK tax approved  arrangement. Under this plan, eligible participants may also receive an  annual award of Free Shares up to the limits prescribed under UK  tax legislation. Management Share Awards (MSA) The MSA are designed to help the Group attract the best staff in a  competitive labour market, and to retain key individuals as we deliver  our long-term strategy. MSA are conditional awards that are not subject  to a performance condition. They vest at the end of three years subject  to continued employment. Shares to satisfy the awards are bought in the  market or re-issued from treasury. Executive Committee members are  not eligible for the MSA after appointment. Shareholder voting In the table below, we set out the results of the remuneration-related  resolutions voted on at the Group’s 2022 AGMs.  Resolution Votes for Votes   against Votes withheld1 Approval of the Directors’  Remuneration report:   Implementation report 96% 4% 11,499,374 Approval of the   Remuneration Policy (2021) 97% 3% 22,272,424 Approval of the Directors’  Remuneration report 96% 4% 12,359,627 1. A vote “withheld” is not a vote in law and is not counted in the calculation of the proportion  of votes for and against the resolution. We set out details of each element of remuneration, and the single   total figure of remuneration, paid to the Chair and Non-Executive  Directors during 2022 and 2021 in US dollars in table 1b on page 132. No  post-employment, termination or share-based payments were made.  Statutory minimum superannuation contributions for Non-Executive  Directors are deducted from the Director’s overall fee entitlements when  these are required by Australian superannuation law. The total fee and allowance payments made to the Chair and   Non-Executive Directors in 2022 are within the maximum aggregate  annual amount of £3 million set out in the Group’s constitutional  documents, approved by shareholders at the 2009 AGMs. Share ownership policy for Non-Executive Directors Rio Tinto has a policy that encourages Non-Executive Directors to build  up a shareholding equal in value to one year’s base fee within three years  of their appointment. Details of Non-Executive Directors’ share interests  in the Group, including total holdings, are set out in table 2 on page 132.

The details for 2021 reflect remuneration for the period 1 January to 31 December 2021 which includes both KMP roles as Acting Chief Financial Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 7. The value of share-based awards has been determined in accordance with the recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment”. The fair value of awards granted as  MSA, BDA and PSA have been calculated at their dates of grant using valuation models provided by external consultants, Lane Clark and Peacock LLP, including an independent lattice-based  option valuation model and a Monte Carlo valuation model which take into account the constraints on vesting attached to these awards. Further details of the valuation methods and assumptions  used for these awards are included in note 41 (Share-based Payments) in the financial statements. The fair value of other share-based awards is measured at the purchase cost of the shares from the  market. The share-based values disclosed in this table do not reflect amounts actually paid in 2022 or the value of shares that will ultimately vest. 8. “BDA” represents the portion of the 2019–2022 STIP awards deferred into Rio Tinto shares. 9. “Others” includes the Global Employee Share Plan (myShare) and the UK Share Plan. 10. The costs shown for defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical benefits are the service costs attributable to the individual, calculated in accordance with IAS 19. The cost for defined  contribution plans is the amount contributed in the year by the company. 11. “Total remuneration” represents the disclosure of total emoluments and compensation required under the Australian Corporations Act 2001 and applicable accounting standards.

The  payment of statutory minimum superannuation contributions  for Australian Non-Executive Directors is required by  Australian superannuation law. These contributions are  included in the “Fees and allowances” amount disclosed for  Australian Non-Executive Directors. 3. “Non-monetary benefits” include, as in previous years,  amounts which are deemed by the UK tax authorities  to be benefits in kind relating largely to the costs of  Non-Executive Directors’ expenses in attending Board  meetings held at the company’s UK registered office  (including associated hotel and subsistence expenses) and  professional tax compliance services/advice. Given these  expenses are incurred by directors in the fulfilment of their  duties, the company pays the tax on them. 4.

Government regulations Our operations around the world are subject   to extensive laws and regulations imposed by  local, state, provincial and federal governments.  In addition to these laws, several of our operations  are governed by specific agreements made  with governments, some of which are  enshrined in legislation. The geographic and product diversity of our  operations reduces the likelihood of any single  law or government regulation having a material  effect on the Group’s business as a whole.  Environmental regulations Rio Tinto is subject to various environmental  laws and regulations in the countries where   it has operations. Rio Tinto measures its  performance against environmental regulation  by tracking and rating incidents according to  their actual environmental and compliance  impacts using five severity categories (minor,  medium, serious, major or catastrophic).  Incidents with a consequence rating of major  or catastrophic are of a severity that requires  notification to the relevant product group Chief  Executive and the Rio Tinto Chief Executive  immediately after the incident occurring. In 2022,  there were no environmental incidents at  managed operations with a major or  catastrophic impact.  During 2022, eight managed operations incurred  fines amounting to $109,782 (2021: $7,414).  Details of these fines are reported in the  Sustainability section of this report on page 70.  Australian corporations that exceed specific  greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or energy  use thresholds have obligations under the  Australian National Greenhouse and Energy  Reporting Act 2007 (NGER). All Rio Tinto  entities covered under this Act have submitted  their annual NGER reports by the required  31 October 2022 deadline. Further information on the Group’s  environmental performance is included in the  Sustainability section of this Annual Report,  on pages 46-75, and at riotinto.com.

Dealing in Rio Tinto securities Rio Tinto securities dealing policy restricts  dealing in Rio Tinto securities by Directors  and employees who may be in possession  of inside information. These individuals must  seek clearance before any proposed dealing  takes place. Our policy also prohibits such persons from  engaging in hedging or other arrangements  that limit the economic risk in connection to  Rio Tinto securities issued, or otherwise  allocated, as remuneration that are either  unvested, or that have vested but remain  subject to a holding period. We also impose  restrictions on a broader group of employees,  requiring them to seek clearance before  engaging in similar arrangements over any  Rio Tinto securities. Financial reporting Financial statements The Directors are required to prepare financial  statements for each financial period that give  a true and fair view of the state of the Group  at the end of the financial period, together with  profit or loss and cash flows for that period.  This includes preparing financial statements  in accordance with UK-adopted international  accounting standards, applicable UK law  (Companies Act 2006), Australian law  (Australian Corporations Act 2001) as  amended by the ASIC class order and  preparing a Remuneration report that includes  the information required by Regulation 11,  Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized  Companies and Groups (Accounts and  Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended)  and the Australian Corporations Act 2001. In addition, the UK Corporate Governance  Code recommends that the Board provides  a fair, balanced and understandable  assessment of the company’s position  and prospects in its external reporting. Rio Tinto’s management conducts extensive  review and challenge in support of the Board’s  obligations, aiming to strike a balance between  positive and negative statements and provide  good linkages throughout the Annual Report.  Additional statutory disclosure continued  ===== PAGE 143 ===== 141 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Directors’ report The Directors were responsible for the  preparation and approval of the Annual Report  for the year ended 31 December 2022. They  consider the Annual Report, taken as a whole,  to be fair, balanced and understandable, and  that it provides the information necessary for  shareholders to assess the Group’s position,  performance, business model and strategy. The Directors are responsible for maintaining  proper accounting records, in accordance  with UK and Australian legislation. They have  a general responsibility to safeguard the assets  of the Group, and to prevent and detect fraud  and other irregularities. The Directors are also  responsible for ensuring that appropriate  systems are in place to maintain and preserve  the integrity of the Group’s website.  Legislation in the UK governing the preparation  and dissemination of financial statements may  differ from current and future legislation in  other jurisdictions. The work carried out by the  Group’s external auditors does not take into  account such legislation and, accordingly,  the external auditors accept no responsibility  for any changes to the financial statements  after they are made available on the  Group’s website. The Directors, senior executives, senior  financial managers and other members of staff  who are required to exercise judgment while  preparing the Group’s financial statements,  are required to conduct themselves with  integrity and honesty and in accordance  with the highest ethical standards, as are  all Group employees. The Directors consider that the 2022 Annual  Report presents a true and fair view and has  been prepared in accordance with applicable  accounting standards, using the most  appropriate accounting policies for Rio Tinto’s  business, and supported by reasonable  judgments and estimates. The accounting  policies have been consistently applied as  described on pages 148-155, and Directors  have received a written statement from the  Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer  to this effect. In accordance with the internal  control requirements of the Code and the ASX  Principles, this written statement confirms that  the declarations in the statement are founded  on a sound system of risk management and  internal controls, and that the system is  operating effectively in all material respects  in relation to financial reporting risks.  Further information on Directors’  responsibilities is included on page 250. Disclosure controls and procedures The Group maintains disclosure controls and  procedures, as defined in US Exchange Act  Rule 13a-15(e). Management, with the  participation of the Chief Executive and  Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the  effectiveness of the Group’s disclosure  controls and procedures in relation to US  Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), as of the end  of the period covered by this report, and has  concluded that the Group’s disclosure controls  and procedures were effective at a reasonable  assurance level. Management’s report on internal control over  financial reporting Management is responsible for establishing  and maintaining adequate internal controls  over financial reporting. These controls,  designed under the supervision of the Chief  Executive and Chief Financial Officer, provide  reasonable assurance regarding the reliability  of the Group’s financial reporting and the  preparation and presentation of financial  statements for external reporting purposes,  in accordance with International Financial  Reporting Standards (IFRS) as defined  on page 148. The Group’s internal controls over financial  reporting include policies and procedures  designed to ensure the maintenance  of records that:   – Accurately and fairly reflect transactions  and dispositions of assets.   – Provide reasonable assurances that  transactions are recorded as necessary,  enabling the preparation of financial  statements in accordance with IFRS, and  that receipts and expenditures are made  with the authorisation of management and  Directors of each of the companies.   – Provide reasonable assurance regarding the  prevention or timely detection of  unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition  of the Group’s assets that could have a  material effect on its financial statements. Due to inherent limitations, internal controls  over financial reporting cannot provide  absolute assurance. Similarly, these controls  may not prevent or detect all misstatements,  whether caused by error or fraud, within each  of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited. There were no changes to internal controls  over financial reporting during the relevant  period that have materially affected, or were  reasonably likely to materially affect, the  internal control over financial reporting of  Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited. Management’s evaluation of the effectiveness  of the company’s internal controls over  financial reporting was based on criteria  established in the Internal Control-Integrated  Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of  Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway  Commission. Following this evaluation,  management concluded that our internal  controls over financial reporting were effective  as at 31 December 2022. Directors’ declaration The Directors’ statement of responsibilities  in relation to the Group’s financial statements  is set out on page 250. Non-audit services and auditor independence Details of the non-audit services and a  statement of independence regarding the  provision of non-audit services undertaken  by our external auditor, including the amounts  paid for non-audit services, are set out on  pages 106-107 of the Directors’ report. A copy of the Auditor’s Independence  Declaration as required under section 307C   of the Corporations Act 2001 is set out on  page 269. Going concern The Directors, having made appropriate  enquiries, have satisfied themselves that it is  appropriate to adopt the going concern basis  of accounting in preparing the financial  statements. Additionally, the Directors have  considered longer-term viability, as described  in their statement on page 78. 2023 AGMs The 2023 AGMs will be held on 6 April in  London, UK and 4 May in Perth, Australia.  Separate notices of the 2023 AGMs will   be produced for the shareholders of  each company. Directors’ approval statement The Directors’ report is delivered in  accordance with a resolution of the Board. Dominic Barton Chair 22 February 2023  ===== PAGE 144 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 142 Compliance with governance codes   and standards Application of and compliance with  governance codes and standards This section sets out our compliance with the  applicable governance codes and standards.  As our shares are listed on both the Australian  Securities Exchange (ASX) and the London  Stock Exchange (LSE), we set out how we have  complied with the codes and standards of  those bodies on the following pages: London Stock Exchange – UK Corporate  Governance Code (2018 version) (the UK  Code), see pages 142-144.  Australian Securities Exchange –  ASX Corporate Governance Council’s  Corporate Governance Principles and  Recommendations (4th edition) (the ASX  Principles), see pages 144-146. In addition, as explained below, as a foreign  private issuer (FPI) with American Depositary  Receipts (ADRs) listed on the New York Stock  Exchange (NYSE), we need to report any  significant corporate governance differences  from the NYSE listing standards (NYSE  Standards) followed by US companies.  Statement of compliance with the UK  Code and ASX Principles Throughout 2022 and as at the date of this  report, the Group has applied the Principles of  the UK Code and the ASX Principles. The UK  Code is available at www.frc.org.uk, and the  ASX Principles at www.asx.com/au. For the  purposes of ASX Listing Rule 4.10.3 and the  ASX Principles, pages 89-109 of this report  form our “Corporate Governance Statement”.  This statement is current as at 22 February  2023, unless otherwise indicated, and has been  approved by the Board. Corporate governance  documents and policies referenced can be found  at riotinto.com/invest/corporate-governance. We have complied with all relevant   provisions of the UK Code and ASX Principles  throughout 2022, with the exception only of the  independent third-party evaluation element of  Code Provision 21. As set out in the Chair’s  introduction on page 89, having undertaken a  comprehensive strategic governance review  in 2022, it was decided it would be more  beneficial to defer the independent third-party  evaluation of the Board so that it could take  place once these governance enhancements  were fully embedded in 2023.  Difference from NYSE Standards We have reviewed the NYSE Standards and  consider that our practices are broadly  consistent with them, with the following  exceptions where the literal requirements  of the NYSE Standards are not met due  to differences in corporate governance  between the US, UK and Australia:   – The NYSE Standards state that US  companies must have a nominating/ corporate governance committee which,  in addition to identifying individuals qualified  to become board members, develops and  recommends to the Board a set of corporate  governance principles applicable to the  company. Our Nominations Committee  does not develop corporate governance  principles for the Board’s approval.  The Board itself develops such principles.   – Under US securities law and the NYSE  Standards, the company is required to have  an audit committee that is directly  responsible for the appointment,  compensation, retention and oversight of the  work of external auditors. While our Audit &  Risk Committee makes recommendations to  the Board on these matters, and is subject to  legal and regulatory requirements on  oversight of audit tenders, the ultimate  responsibility for the appointment and  retention of the external auditors of Rio Tinto  rests with the shareholders.   – Under US securities law and the NYSE  Standards, an audit committee is required  to establish procedures for the receipt,  retention and treatment of complaints  regarding accounting, internal  accounting controls and audit matters.  The whistleblowing programme (myVoice)  enables employees to raise any concerns  confidentially or anonymously. The Board  has responsibility to ensure that the  programme is in place and to review the  reports arising from its operations. The UK Code Board leadership and company purpose A. Making the Board effective Our Board provides effective and  entrepreneurial leadership. It is collectively  responsible for the stewardship and long-term  success of the Group. There is a framework of  prudent and effective controls that enable risk  to be assessed and managed. The Sustainability  section on pages 46-75 sets out how we  assess our impact on wider society. See  page 99 for the key activities undertaken by  the Board during the year and the factors that  were considered when making decisions.  In 2022, the Board undertook a governance  review of the composition of the Board, as well  as a strategic governance review. Further  details can be found on page 101.  B. The company’s purpose, values and  strategy and alignment with culture Through our Code of Conduct – The Way We  Work, the Board sets the company’s purpose,  values, and standards for the Group’s employees.  Our values are set out on page 16. The Board is  committed to acting in accordance with these  values, championing and embedding these in  the organisation. The Board also seeks to  ensure that the culture of the company is  aligned with these values and standards. C. Company performance and  risk management The Board leads the development of long-term  investment plans for the company. It aims to  make good quality decisions at the right time,  to achieve the company’s objectives, in  alignment with our purpose, values and  strategy. The role of the Board in establishing  and monitoring the internal control environment  is set out in the Audit & Risk Committee report  on pages 104-107. The way in which the  company manages risk is set out on pages 76- 86. For information on the delegation of  business to management, please refer to  pages 92-93. The formal schedule of matters reserved for the  Board’s decision, available at riotinto.com, covers  areas including: setting the Group’s purpose and  strategic vision; monitoring performance of the  delivery of the approved strategy; approving  major investments, acquisitions and divestments;  the oversight of risk and the setting of the  Group’s risk appetite; and reviewing the  Group’s governance framework. D. Stakeholder engagement The Chair undertakes regular engagement with  our major shareholders, in addition to that carried  out by the Chief Executive, the Chief Financial  Officer and the investor relations team. The  committee Chairs also engage with their relevant  stakeholders; details of this engagement are  provided in each of the committee reports.  We have mapped our key stakeholders and  continually work to understand their views, and  we take account of our responsibilities to our  stakeholders when making business decisions.  We explain more about this in our section 172(1)  statement, set out on pages 95-98. We also  discuss stakeholders in the Strategic report on  pages 18-19 and in the Sustainability section. Simon McKeon is the designated Non-Executive  Director for workforce engagement. An overview  of workforce engagement during 2022 is set  out on page 95. At Rio Tinto plc’s AGM on 8 April 2022,  Resolution 20 (”Authority to purchase Rio Tinto  plc shares”) was passed with less than 80%   of votes in favour, and Shining Prospect  (a subsidiary of the Aluminium Corporation of  China (Chinalco)) voted against. Chinalco has  not sold any Rio Tinto plc shares and now has a  holding of over 14%, given its non-participation  in Rio Tinto’s significant share buy-back  programmes over the last four years. This  places Chinalco close to the 14.99% threshold  agreed with the Australian Government at the  time of Chinalco’s original investment in 2008.  E. Our workforce policies and practices Group workforce policies are approved by the  Board. All the policies relating to our workforce  take account of the global nature of our  company. Our whistleblowing process is  overseen by the Board. Every member of the  workforce has access to the whistleblower  programme (myVoice); details of this  programme are on page 74.   ===== PAGE 145 ===== 143 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Directors’ report Division of responsibilities F. The role of the Chair The Chair leads the Board and is responsible  for its overall effectiveness. He was  independent on the date of his appointment  and we consider he remains independent for  the purposes of the Code. This was also the  case for our former Chairman, Simon  Thompson, who stepped down on 5 May 2022.  The Chair recognises the importance of  creating a boardroom culture that encourages  openness and debate and ensures  constructive relations between executive  and Non-Executive Directors. The Chair is responsible for: the management  of the Board and its committees; Director  performance; induction; training and  development; succession planning; engagement  with external stakeholders; and attendance by  the Board at shareholder meetings.  The Chair is supported by the Senior  Independent Directors, the Group Company  Secretary and the Chief Executive. In line with  the UK Code, the Senior Independent Director,  Rio Tinto plc is responsible for acting as a  sounding board for the Chair and engages with  shareholders to develop a balanced  understanding of their interests and concerns.  For further details, please see our Board  Charter on riotinto.com, which sets out the role,  responsibilities, structure, compositions and  conduct of the Board, as well as the role of the  Chair, the Senior Independent Director,  Rio Tinto plc and the Senior Independent  Director, Rio Tinto Limited. G. Composition of the Board As at the date of this report, the Board  comprises ten members: seven independent  Non-Executive Directors, the Chair, the Chief  Executive, and the Chief Financial Officer. As detailed in the Nominations Committee  report, we engaged Spencer Stuart to support  the search for four new Non-Executive  Directors, including Kaisa Hietala who will join  the Board on 1 March 2023. The Committee is  satisfied that Spencer Stuart does not have any  connections with the company or individual  Directors that may impair their independence.  The Board is satisfied that it has the appropriate  balance of skills, experience, independence,  and knowledge of the company to enable its  members to discharge their respective duties  and responsibilities effectively, and that no  individual or group can dominate the Board’s  decision making. There is a clear division of  responsibilities between the leadership of the  Board and the executive leadership of our  business. The Chief Executive is responsible  for the day-to-day management of the  business and, under a Group delegation of  authority framework, delegates to other  members of the Executive Committee. Megan Clark has agreed to remain a Non- Executive Director for a further year and will  stand for re-election at our 2023 AGMs. On  20 November 2024, Megan will have served for  over nine years as a Non-Executive Director on  the Board. Megan is Chair of the Sustainability  Committee and one of the longest serving  Directors on our Board, with significant mining  industry experience. In this period of Board  renewal, it is critically important that the Board  continues to benefit from Megan’s knowledge  and experience. The Board is of the view that  Megan continues to make a significant and  valuable contribution in the boardroom. In  accordance with Code Provision 10, the Board  has considered Megan’s continuing  independence and is satisfied that Megan  remains independent. Details of the Board  renewal can be found in the Nominations  Committee report on page 102. H. Role of Non-Executive Directors We list all of the Non-Executive Directors   that we consider to be independent on  pages 90-91 of this report. Over 50% of the  Board (excluding the Chair) are Non-Executive  Directors. The Non-Executive Directors  constructively challenge and help develop  proposals on strategy. They are also  responsible for scrutinising management  performance and ensuring that financial  information, risks and controls, and systems of  risk management are robust. In order to  enhance Board engagement in Australia, the  role of Senior Independent Director Rio Tinto  Limited was established in 2021. Simon McKeon  was appointed to this position and the terms of  this appointment were agreed on by the Board. Each Director has undertaken to allocate  sufficient time to the Group in order to  discharge their responsibilities effectively, and  this is kept under review by the Nominations  Committee. The Directors’ other appointments  are listed on pages 90-91. I. Board processes and role of the  Company Secretary The governance framework on page 100  explains the governance structure of the Board  and sets out the relationship with the Chief  Executive. The roles and responsibilities of  each committee are explained. The Board  insights section provides some examples of the  decision-making process of the Board and the  steps it takes to function effectively, including  how it considers stakeholders in this process.  The Group Company Secretary is the trusted  interlocutor within the Board and its  committees, and between senior leadership  and the Non-Executive Directors. He is  responsible for advising the Board, through the  Chair, on all governance matters. He supports  the Chair in ensuring that the information  provided to the Board is of sufficient quality  and appropriate detail in order for the Board  to function effectively and efficiently.  Composition, succession and evaluation  J. Appointments to the Board The Nominations Committee ensures a formal,  rigorous and transparent procedure for the  appointment of new Directors. It is also  responsible for Board succession planning,  regularly assessing the balance of skills,  experience, diversity and capacity required to  oversee the delivery of Rio Tinto’s strategy.  This year, the Nominations Committee oversaw  the appointment of our new Non-Executive  Director, Kaisa Hietala, effective 1 March 2023,  and the ongoing search for more Non-Executive  Directors. Details of this process are provided  in the Nominations Committee report on  page 103. The Nominations Committee also reviews  proposed appointments to the Executive  Committee but has ceded responsibility to the  full Board for the process and monitoring of  Executive Committee succession planning. As  a result, the Board has launched a longer-term  succession planning process for the Executive  Committee, including the roles of the Chief  Executive and the Chief Financial Officer.  Further details can be found on page 102. All Non-Executive Directors are members of  the Nominations Committee. The Committee is  chaired by the Chair, apart from when the  Committee is dealing with the appointment of  his or her successor. Only the Chair and  Committee members have the right to attend  the meetings of the Nominations Committee;  attendance by all other individuals is by  invitation only. The Nominations Committee  report sets out the Board’s approach to  succession planning and how this supports the  development of a diverse pipeline, at all levels.  All Directors are subject to annual re-election  at the AGMs.  Details of external search consultancies used  for Board appointments can be found in the  Nominations Committee report on page 103.  K. Skills, experience and knowledge of the  Board and its committees In our succession planning, we aim to bring a  diverse and complementary range of skills,  knowledge and experience to the Board, so  that we are equipped to navigate the  operational, social, regulatory and geopolitical  complexity in which our business operates.  Achieving the right blend of skills and diversity  to support effective decision making is a  continuing process. Further details of tenure  and experience of the Board are set out in the  Nominations Committee report on page 103.  The Board biographies set out the specific  skills and experience that each Director brings  to the Board (pages 90-91). L. Board evaluation The performance of the Board, its committees  and individual Directors is evaluated annually.  In accordance with Code Provision 21, every  third year, an external adviser is engaged to  carry out a formal independent evaluation of  the Board and its committees. An independent  evaluation by an external adviser was due to be  undertaken in 2022. However, following the  appointment of our new Chair in 2022, a  comprehensive strategic governance review of  the Board and committees was carried out.  This review focused on the composition of the  Board, the balance of skills and experience and  how Directors should best spend their time  supporting the new Group strategy in the  context of greater uncertainty and potential  risk. Given the timing of this review, a decision  was made to defer the external Board  evaluation to 2023.  For more information see page 101.  ===== PAGE 146 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 144 Audit, risk and internal control M. Internal and external audit The Audit & Risk Committee monitors the  independence and effectiveness of the Internal  Audit function and external auditors. The  Committee is responsible for reviewing key  judgments within the Group’s financial  statements and narrative reporting, with the  aim of maintaining the integrity of the Group’s  financial reporting. For further detail, please  refer to the Audit & Risk Committee report on  pages 104-107. The appointment of KPMG as external auditor  for the 2022 financial year was approved by  shareholders at our AGMs in 2022.  N. Fair, balanced and  understandable assessment The Board is responsible for the presentation  of a fair, balanced and understandable  assessment of the company’s position and  prospects, not only in the Annual Report.  We have a robust process in place, including  through the Disclosure Committee, to ensure  that this is the case.  O. Risk management and internal  control framework The Board is ultimately responsible for aligning  our long-term strategic objectives with the risk  appetite of the company, taking into account  the principal and emerging risks faced by the  company. Please refer to pages 76-86 for  further details of our business planning cycle  and risk management framework and how  these support our longer-term viability  statement. For further details of our approach  to risk, please refer to the Risk section  on page 77. Remuneration P. Remuneration policies and practices The People & Remuneration Committee  supports the Board by setting our  Remuneration Policy. Through long-term and  short-term incentives, our Remuneration Policy  is designed to help drive a performance culture  that incentivises executives to deliver the  Group’s long-term strategy and create superior  shareholder value over the short, medium and  long term. The overarching aim is to ensure our  remuneration structure and policies reward  fairly and responsibly with a clear link to  corporate and individual performance, and to  the company’s long-term strategy and values.  We have worked to ensure that we have a clear  policy that can be understood by shareholders  and stakeholders. Q. Procedure for developing  remuneration policy We have a formal and transparent procedure  for developing our Remuneration Policy, and  no Director is involved in deciding their own  remuneration. Executive remuneration is set  with regard to the wider workforce and through  market benchmarking. For further detail, please  refer to the People & Remuneration Committee  report on pages 110-135. The Committee is  supported by remuneration consultant Deloitte.  The Board received assurance from the  Committee and from Deloitte that Deloitte   did not have any connections with Rio Tinto   or the Board that would have impaired its  independence. Please refer to page 119  of this Annual Report for further detail. R. Exercising independent judgment The People & Remuneration Committee  comprises six Non-Executive Directors to  ensure independent judgment with regard   to remuneration outcomes. The Committee  considers remuneration on an annual basis and  determines outcomes by assessing executive  performance against performance criteria,  details of which can be found in the People &  Remuneration Committee report on pages 110- 135 of this Annual Report. This states how our  Remuneration Policy has been applied and  sets out details of any adjustments made or  discretions exercised. ASX Principles Principle 1: Lay solid foundations for  management and oversight Recommendation 1.1 Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited have a  common Board of Directors. The principal role  of the Board is to set the Group’s strategy and  to review its strategic direction regularly.  The Board also has responsibility for corporate  governance. A Board Charter setting out  the role of the Board and management and  matters reserved for the Board is available  at riotinto.com. The Board delegates responsibility for  day-to-day management of the business  to the Chief Executive and other members  of the Executive Committee. A number of  management committees support the Chief  Executive and the Executive Committee.  The structure of these committees is set  out on page 100. Recommendation 1.2 The Nominations Committee, on behalf  of the Board, ensures a formal, rigorous  and transparent procedure for the appointment  of new Directors. A similar process is followed  with the Executive Committee and senior  executive appointments, including a formal and  rigorous process to source strong candidates  from diverse backgrounds and conducting  appropriate background and reference checks  on the shortlisted candidates. This year, the  Nominations Committee oversaw the  appointment of our new Non-Executive  Director, Kaisa Hietala effective 1 March 2023,  and the ongoing search for three more  Non-Executive Directors. Details of this  process are provided in the Nominations  Committee report on page 103. The notice of AGM provides all material  information in Rio Tinto’s possession relevant to  decisions on election and re-election of  Directors, including a statement from the Board  that it considers all Directors continue to  perform effectively and demonstrate  appropriate levels of commitment. It also  provides reasons why each Director is  recommended for re-election, highlighting  their relevant skills and experience. Further  information on the skills and experience of  each Director is set out on pages 90-91  of the Annual Report. Recommendation 1.3 The company has written agreements setting  out the terms of appointment for each Director  and senior executive. Non-Executive Directors  are appointed by letters of appointment.  Executive Directors and other senior executives  are employed through employment service  contracts. Further information is set out on  pages 128-129 in the Remuneration report. Recommendation 1.4 The Group Company Secretary is accountable  to the Board and advises the Chair, and,  through the Chair, the Board on all governance  matters. The appointment and removal of the  Group Company Secretary is a matter reserved  for the Board. Recommendation 1.5 Rio Tinto has a Group-wide, Board-endorsed  Inclusion and Diversity Policy. The policy is  available at riotinto.com. The Board sets  objectives for achieving diversity for the Board,  senior executives and the workforce, and  annually reviews the Group’s performance  against them. Page 51 of the Annual Report  sets out the measurable objectives and our  performance against them. The respective  proportions of men and women on the Board,  in senior executive positions and across the  whole organisation, are reported on pages 51  and 103 of the Annual Report. Compliance with governance codes and standards continued  ===== PAGE 147 ===== 145 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Directors’ report Recommendation 1.6 The performance of the Board, its committees  and individual Directors is evaluated annually.  Every third year, an external adviser is engaged  to carry out a formal independent evaluation of  the Board and its committees. An independent  evaluation by an external adviser was due to be  undertaken in 2022. However, following the  appointment of our new Chair in 2022, a  comprehensive strategic governance review of  the Board and committees was carried out.  This review focused on the composition of the  Board, the balance of skills and experience and  how Directors should best spend their time  supporting the new Group strategy in the  context of greater uncertainty and potential  risk. Given the timing of this review, a decision  was made to defer the external Board  evaluation to 2023.  For further information, please refer to page 101  of this Annual Report. Recommendation 1.7 The performance of Executive Committee  members, including Directors, is continually  evaluated as part of the Group’s performance  evaluation cycle. Further details are set out in  the Remuneration report on pages 110-135. Principle 2: Structure the Board to be  effective and add value Recommendation 2.1 The Nominations Committee includes all  Non-Executive Directors and is chaired by the  Chair of the Board. The Board is satisfied that  all Non-Executive Directors, including the  Chair, continue to meet the test for  independence under the ASX Principles. The Nominations Committee’s terms of  reference are available at riotinto.com.  The Nominations Committee report on pages  102-103 provides further details on its role  and responsibilities. Details on membership,  the number of times the Committee met,  and the attendance of members are set  out on page 101. Recommendation 2.2 A Board skills matrix showing key attributes  in terms of skills, experience and diversity  that are relevant to the Board is set out on  page 103 of the Annual Report. Recommendations 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 The Nominations Committee is responsible  for assessing the independence of each  Non-Executive Director against an independence  framework that combines the requirements of  the UK Code, the ASX Principles and the NYSE  Standards. The Committee reviews and  approves this framework each year. The Board is satisfied that all of its Non-Executive  Directors are independent in character and  judgment, and are free from any relationships  (material or otherwise) or circumstances that  could create a conflict of interest. The Chair was considered independent upon  his appointment and, in the Board’s view, he  continues to satisfy the tests for independence  under the ASX Principles and the NYSE  Standards. This was also the case for our  former Chairman, Simon Thompson, who  stepped down on 5 May 2022. The name, skills and experience of each  Director, together with their terms in office,  are shown in the biographical details on  pages 90-91. Recommendation 2.6 On joining Rio Tinto, all Directors receive a full,  formal induction programme. It is delivered  over a number of months, and tailored to their  specific requirements, taking into account their  respective committee responsibilities.  All Directors are expected to commit to  continuing their development during their  tenure. This is supported through a  combination of site visits, teach-ins, deep  dives, and internal business and operational  briefings provided in or around scheduled  Board and committee meetings.  In addition, the Group Company Secretary  provides regular updates on corporate  governance developments in the UK,  Australia and the US. Further details are set  out on pages 101 of the Annual Report. Principle 3: Instil a culture of acting  lawfully, ethically and responsibly Recommendations 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 Through our Code of Conduct – The Way We  Work, the Board sets the company’s purpose,  values, and standards for the Group’s employees.  Our values are set out on page 16. The Board is  committed to acting in accordance with these  values, championing, and embedding them in  the organisation. Our Code of Conduct is  available at riotinto.com/ethics.  Rio Tinto’s confidential and independently  operated whistleblowing programme  (myVoice) offers an avenue through which  our employees, contractors, suppliers and  customers can report concerns anonymously,  subject to local law. These may include  concerns about the business, or behaviour of  individuals, including suspicion of violations of  financial reporting, safety or environmental  procedures or other business integrity issues.  The programme features telephone and web  submissions, a case management tool,  and a reporting tool to allow for better analysis  of case statistics. The myVoice procedure explains how concerns  regarding matters relating to Rio Tinto, its  business and its people can be raised, in  confidence and without fear of retaliation. The  procedure also sets out who can make a report  and what they can expect from Rio Tinto if they  do report a concern. The procedure is available  at riotinto.com. Further details on myVoice are  set out on page 74. Rio Tinto’s business integrity  standard sets out the Group’s position on  issues relating to bribery and corruption. This is  available at riotinto.com. Further information is  set out on page 74. Oversight of the Group’s ethics, integrity and  compliance programme now falls within the  remit of the Board.

Recommendation 4.2 Details on compliance with the financial  reporting requirements contemplated   under this recommendation are set out on  pages 140-141 of the Annual Report. Recommendation 4.3 We have a thorough and rigorous review  process in place to ensure integrity of the  periodic reports we release to the market.  Rio Tinto communicates with the market  through accurate, clear, concise and effective  reporting, and contents of periodic reports  are verified by the subject matter experts and  reviewed by the relevant Group functions.  Such reports are then reviewed and  considered by the Group Disclosure  Committee for release to the market.  Principle 5: Make timely and  balanced disclosure Recommendation 5.1 Rio Tinto recognises the importance of effective  and timely communication with shareholders  and the wider investment community. It is our policy to make sure that all information  disclosed or released by the Group is accurate,  complete and timely, and complies with all  continuous and other disclosure obligations  under applicable listing rules and other  relevant legislation. To ensure that trading in our securities takes  place in an informed and orderly market, we  have established a Disclosure Committee to  oversee compliance with our continuous  disclosure obligations. The Group Disclosure  and Communications Policy, and the terms of  reference of our Disclosure Committee,  together with our adopted procedures in  relation to disclosure and management of  relevant information, support compliance with  our disclosure obligations. A copy of the Group  Disclosure and Communications Policy is  available at riotinto.com. The Disclosure Committee is responsible for  determining whether information relating to  Rio Tinto may require disclosure to the markets  under the continuous disclosure requirements  in the jurisdictions in which Rio Tinto is listed.  In accordance with its terms of reference, the  specific focus of the Committee is to consider  and determine on a timely basis whether  information would, to the extent that the  information is not public and relates directly   or indirectly to Rio Tinto, be likely to have a  material effect on the price of Rio Tinto securities  if that information was generally available.  ===== PAGE 148 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 146 The members of the Committee are the Chief  Executive; the Chief Financial Officer; the  Group Company Secretary; the Chief Legal  Officer, Governance & Corporate Affairs; the  Head of Strategy & Investor Relations; and the  Chief Executive Australia. Recommendation 5.2 Consistent with the Group’s disclosure  protocols, the Board is provided with copies  of all material market announcements promptly  after they are released to the market.  Recommendation 5.3 As a matter of practice, all our new or  substantive investor presentations are  released to the market via ASX and LSE  market announcement platforms.

The Senior  Independent Director, Rio Tinto plc, and the  Senior Independent Director, Rio Tinto Limited,  have a specific responsibility under the UK  Code and the Board Charter to be available to  shareholders who have concerns that have not  been resolved through contact with the Chair,  Chief Executive or Chief Financial Officer, or  for whom such contact is inappropriate. We  have a number of processes and initiatives to  ensure that members of the Board understand  the views of major shareholders. The Chief  Financial Officer reports to the Board at each  meeting, and provides regular investor  updates. In addition, the Head of Strategy &  Investor Relations reports regularly to the  Board, and an annual survey of major  shareholders’ opinions is presented to the  Board by the Group’s investor relations  advisers. Further information on engagement  with shareholders and investors during 2022 is  set out on page 97 of the Annual Report. Recommendations 6.3, 6.4 The AGMs present an opportunity to provide  a summary business presentation, to inform  shareholders of recent developments, and to  give them the opportunity to ask questions.  Generally, the Chairs of all Board committees  are available to answer questions raised by  shareholders, and all Directors are expected to  attend where possible. The AGMs are generally  webcast and transcripts of the Chair’s and  Chief Executive’s speeches are made available  at riotinto.com. A summary of the proceedings  at the meetings, and the results of voting on  resolutions, are made available as soon as  practicable after the meetings. At Rio Tinto  AGMs, all resolutions are decided by poll and  not by show of hands. In 2022, the Rio Tinto Limited AGM was held in  Melbourne as a hybrid meeting. With the use of  technology, shareholders who could not attend  in person were offered the opportunity to  virtually participate at the AGM, ask questions  and vote on the resolutions.

The above accounting standards and interpretations are collectively  referred to as “IFRS” in this report and contain the principles we use to  create our accounting policies. Where necessary, adjustments are made  to the locally reported assets, liabilities, and results of subsidiaries, joint  arrangements and associates to bring their accounting policies in line  with ours for consistent reporting. b. The basis of consolidation The financial statements consolidate the accounts of Rio Tinto plc and  Rio Tinto Limited (together “the Companies”) and their respective  subsidiaries (together “the Group”, “we”, “our”) and include the Group’s  share of joint arrangements and associates. We consolidate subsidiaries where  either of the companies controls the  entity. Control exists where either of the companies has: power over the  entities, that is, existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the  relevant activities of the entities (those that significantly affect the  companies’ returns); exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its  involvement with the entities; and the ability to use its power to affect  those returns. A list of principal subsidiaries is shown in note 30.  A joint arrangement is an arrangement in which two or more parties have  joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control  such that decisions about the relevant activities of the arrangement  (those that significantly affect the companies’ returns) require the  unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. We have two types of  joint arrangements - joint operations (JOs) and joint ventures (JVs). A JO  is a joint arrangement in which the parties that share joint control have  rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the  arrangement. This includes situations where the parties benefit from the  joint activity through a share of the output, rather than by receiving a  share of the results of trading. For our JOs, shown in note 31, we  recognise: our share of assets and liabilities; revenue from the sale of our  share of the output and our share of any revenue generated from the  sale of the output by the JO; and its share of expenses. All such amounts  are measured in accordance with the terms of the arrangement, which is  usually in proportion to our interest in the JO. These amounts are  recorded in our financial statements on the appropriate lines. A JV is a  joint arrangement in which the parties that share joint control have rights  to the net assets of the arrangement. JVs are accounted for using the  equity accounting method. An associate is an entity over which we have significant influence.  Significant influence is presumed to exist where there is neither control  nor joint control and the Group has over 20% of the voting rights, unless  it can be clearly demonstrated that this is not the case. Significant  influence can arise where we hold less than 20% of the voting rights if  we have the power to participate in the financial and operating policy  decisions affecting the entity. It also includes situations of collective  control.  We use the term “equity accounted units” (EAUs) to refer to associates  and JVs collectively. Under the equity accounting method, the  investment is recorded initially at cost to the Group, including any  goodwill on acquisition. In subsequent periods the carrying amount of  the investment is adjusted to reflect the Group’s share of the EAUs’  retained post-acquisition profit or loss and other comprehensive  income. Our principal JVs and associates are shown in note 32.  In some cases, we participate in unincorporated arrangements and have  rights to our share of the assets and obligations for our share of the  liabilities of the arrangement rather than a right to a net return, but do not  share joint control. In such cases, we account for these arrangements in  the same way as our joint operations with all such amounts measured in  accordance with the terms of the arrangement, which is usually in  proportion to our interest in the arrangement.  All intragroup transactions and balances are eliminated  on consolidation.  Financial statements  Corporate information About Rio Tinto  In 1995, Rio Tinto plc, incorporated in the UK and listed on the London  and New York Stock Exchanges, and Rio Tinto Limited, incorporated in  Australia and listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, formed a dual  listed companies structure (“DLC”). Under the DLC, Rio Tinto plc and Rio  Tinto Limited are viewed as a single economic enterprise, with common  boards of directors, and the shareholders of both companies have a  common economic interest in the DLC. For further information on the  DLC structure see page 338 in the additional information section of the  annual report. IFRS-compliant consolidated financial statements of the  Rio Tinto Group are prepared on this basis, with interests of  shareholders of both companies presented as the equity interests of  shareholders in the Rio Tinto Group. This is in accordance with the  principles and requirements of International Financial Reporting  Standards and in accordance with an order, under section 340 of the  Australian Corporations Act 2001, issued by the Australian Securities  and Investments Commission (ASIC) on 16 July 2021 (‘ASIC order’).  For further details of the ASIC Class Order relief see page 249. Rio Tinto’s business is finding, mining, and processing mineral  resources. Major products are iron ore, aluminium, copper, industrial  minerals (borates, titanium dioxide and salt) and diamonds. Activities  span the world and are strongly represented in Australia and North  America, with significant businesses in Asia, Europe, Africa and South  America. Rio Tinto plc’s registered office is at 6 St James’s Square, London SW1Y  4AD, UK. Rio Tinto Limited’s registered office is at Level 43, 120 Collins  Street, Melbourne VIC 3000, Australia. About the presentation of our financial statements  In the current year we have reviewed our notes to the financial  statements taking into account materiality (as described below). We  have also re-organised the notes into logical groupings to help users  find and understand relevant information. Where possible, related  information, such as accounting policies, has been provided in the same  section as the relevant note.  All financial statement values are presented in US dollars and rounded to  the nearest million (US$m) unless otherwise stated. Where applicable,  comparatives have been adjusted to measure or present them on the  same basis as current period figures. Our financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022 were  authorised for issue in accordance with a directors’ resolution on  22 February 2023. a. The basis of preparation The financial information included in the financial statements for the year  ended 31 December 2022, and for the related comparative periods, has  been prepared: Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 148  ===== PAGE 151 ===== c. Materiality Our directors consider information to be material if correcting a  misstatement, omission or obscuring could, in the light of surrounding  circumstances, reasonably be expected to change the judgment of a  reasonable person relying on the financial statements. The Group  considers both quantitative and qualitative factors in determining  whether information is material; the concept of materiality is therefore  not driven purely by numerical values.  When considering the potential materiality of information, management  makes an initial quantitative assessment using thresholds based on  estimates of profit before taxation; for the years ended 31 December  2022 and 31 December 2021 the quantitative threshold was US$700  million. However, other considerations can result in a determination that  lower values are material or, occasionally, that higher values are  immaterial. These considerations include whether a misstatement,  omission or obscuring: masks a change or trend in key performance  indicators; causes reported key metrics to change from a positive to a  negative values or vice-versa; affects compliance with regulatory  requirements or other contractual requirements; could result in an  increase to management’s compensation; or might conceal an unlawful  transaction.  In assessing materiality, management also applies judgment based on  its understanding of the business and its internal and external financial  statement users. The assessment will consider user expectations of  numerical and narrative reporting. Sources used in making this  assessment would include, for example: published analyst consensus  measures, experience gained in formal and informal dialogue with users  (including regulatory correspondence), and peer group benchmarking. d. Summary of key judgments or other relevant judgments made in applying the accounting policies  The preparation of the financial statements requires management to use  judgment in applying accounting policies and in making critical  accounting estimates.  These judgments and estimates are based on management’s best  knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, having regard to  previous experience, but actual results may differ materially from the  amounts included in the financial statements. Areas of judgment in the  application of accounting policies that have the most significant effect  on the amounts recognised in the financial statements and key sources  of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing a material  adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the  next financial year are noted below and further information is contained  in the accounting policies and/or the notes to the financial statements. Summarised below are the key judgments which we have taken in the  application of the Group’s accounting policies for 2022 and how they  compare to the prior year. Taking a different judgment over these  matters would lead to a material impact on the 2022 financial  statements. More detail on the judgment can be found in the  respective notes.  Key judgments 2022 2021 Reason for change Indicators of impairment and impairment reversals  (note 4) a a No change to the judgment Uncertain tax positions (note 10) 0 a The settlement in 2022 with the Australian Taxation Office  (ATO) has reduced the balance over which judgment is  exercised. There have been no material changes in the  Group's remaining uncertain tax positions. Therefore  uncertain tax positions are not a key judgment in  2022. Deferral of stripping costs (note 13) a a No change to the judgment Estimation of asset lives (note 13) a a No change to the judgment Close-down, restoration and environmental obligations  (note 14) a a No change to the judgment Recoverability of potential deferred tax assets (note 15) 0 a In 2021 the key judgment related to the recoverability of  significant deferred tax asset balances in the United States,  Mongolia and Australia. Given the progress towards  sustainable underground production at Oyu Tolgoi reducing  the risk of tax losses expiring prior to utilisation, and the write  down of Federal deferred tax assets in the United States due  to the introduction of the Corporate Alternative Minimum  Tax under the Inflation Reduction Act, the recoverability of  deferred tax assets is not a key judgment in 2022. 149 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Financial statements  ===== PAGE 152 ===== Information on other relevant judgments to help understand the financial statements has been incorporated into the relevant accounting policy  sections of each note. We have summarised how these judgments have changed since prior year below: Other relevant judgments 2022 2021 Reason for change Identification of functional currencies (f below) a a No change to the judgment Exclusions from underlying EBITDA (note 1) a a No change to the judgment Determination of cash-generating units (CGUs) (note 4)  a a No change to the judgment Uncertain tax positions (note 10) a 0 In 2022 the judgment we have taken on our uncertain tax  positions is less significant than in the prior year given the  settlement with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).  Where the amount of tax payable or recoverable is  uncertain, judgment is required in evaluating the most likely  amount of liability or recovery. Where there is a wide range  of possible outcomes, judgment is required in evaluating a  provision using the probability weighted average  approach. See note 10 for further details. Assessment of indefinite-lived water rights in Quebec (note 12) a a No change to the judgment Recoverability of potential deferred tax assets (note 15) a 0 Given the progress towards sustainable underground  production at Oyu Tolgoi and the write down of Federal  deferred tax assets in the United States due to the  introduction of the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax  regime the recoverability of deferred tax assets is not a key  judgment in 2022. Judgment is required regarding the  extent to which certain risk factors are likely to affect the  recovery of deferred tax assets. These risk factors include  the risk of expiry of losses prior to utilisation,  the impact of  other legislation or tax regimes, such as minimum taxes,  and consideration of factors that lead to the generation of  losses or other deferred tax assets. Accounting for the funding amounts relating to Oyu Tolgoi non- controlling interest (note 30) 0 a The funding balances arising from a carry account loan  with Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi were forgiven in 2022. This means  the judgment over the accounting for these amounts is no  longer applicable. Accounting for the Pilbara Iron Arrangements (note 31) a a No change to the judgment Basis of consolidation of Queensland Alumina Limited  (note 31) a a The judgment taken on how we consolidate Queensland  Alumina Limited (‘QAL’) was reassessed and confirmed in  the current year. Following the Australian governments’s  imposition of Trade Sanctions against Russia, QAL  considered that they were no longer able to process  bauxite on behalf of RUSAL and therefore enacted the  “step-in” clause of the shareholders agreement that  enabled Rio Tinto to contribute additional bauxite tonnes to  ensure that 100% of production capacity was maintained.  We continue to account for QAL as a joint operation. Accounting for Minera Escondida Ltda (note 32) a a No change to the judgment Provisions for onerous contracts (note 36) 0 a We reviewed our onerous contract population and noted  the significance of this judgment had diminished.   Recognition of contingencies (note 37) a a No change to the judgment Financial statements continued Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 150  ===== PAGE 153 ===== e. Key sources of estimation uncertainty We define key sources of estimation uncertainty as accounting estimates that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying  amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Summarised below are what we consider to be the key accounting estimates in 2022  compared to those of 2021 and the reason for any changes. Relevant sensitivities are disclosed within the relevant financial statement notes. Key accounting estimates 2022 2021 Reason for change Estimation of the close-down, restoration and environmental  cost obligations (note 14) a a No change Estimation of the cash flow forecasts to support the  recognition of deferred tax assets 0 a In 2021 the cash flow forecast used to support the  recognition of deferred tax assets in the United States,  Mongolia and Australia was considered to be a key estimate.  Given the write down of deferred tax assets in the United  States as a result of the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax  under the Inflation Reduction Act 2022, and the progress  towards sustainable underground production at Oyu Tolgoi  reducing the risk of losses expiring prior to utilisation, cash  flow forecasts used to support deferred tax recoverability  are no longer considered a key estimate in 2022. Estimation of obligations for post-employment costs  (note 28) a a No change f. Currency Other relevant judgments - Identification of functional currency We present our financial statements in US dollars, as that presentation currency most reliably reflects the global business performance of the  Group as a whole.   The functional currency for each subsidiary, unincorporated arrangement, joint operation and equity accounted unit is the currency of the  primary economic environment in which it operates. For businesses that reside in developed economies the functional currency is generally   the currency of the country in which it operates because of the dominance of locally incurred costs. If the business resides in an emerging  economy, the US dollar is generally identified to be the functional currency as a higher proportion of costs, particularly imported goods and  services, are agreed and paid in US dollars, in common with other international investors. Determination of functional currency involves  judgment, and other companies may make different judgments based on similar facts.  The determination of functional currency affects the measurement of non-current assets included in the balance sheet and, as a  consequence, the depreciation and amortisation of those assets included in the income statement. It also impacts exchange gains and losses  included in the income statement and in equity. We also apply judgment in determining whether settlement of certain intragroup loans is  neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future and therefore whether the associated exchange gains and losses can be taken to equity.  During 2022, A$15 billion of intragroup loans continued to meet these criteria; associated exchange gains and losses are taken to equity. On consolidation, income statement items for each entity are translated from the functional currency into US dollars at the full-year average rate of  exchange, except for material one-off transactions, which are translated at the rate prevailing on the transaction date. Balance sheet items are  translated into US dollars at period-end exchange rates. Exchange differences arising on the translation of the net assets of entities with functional currencies other than the US dollar are recognised directly  in the currency translation reserve. These translation differences are shown in the statement of comprehensive income, with the exception of the  translation adjustment relating to Rio Tinto Limited’s share capital, which is shown in the statement of changes in equity.  Where an intragroup balance is, in substance, part of the Group’s net investment in an entity, exchange gains and losses on that balance are taken to  the currency translation reserve.   Except as noted above, or where exchange differences are deferred as part of a cash flow hedge, all other differences are charged or credited to the  income statement in the year in which they arise.  The principal exchange rates used in the preparation of the financial statements were:  Full-year average Year-end One unit of local currency buys the following number of US dollars 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Pound sterling 1.24  1.38  1.28  1.21  1.35  1.36  Australian dollar 0.69  0.75  0.69  0.68  0.73  0.77  Canadian dollar 0.77  0.80  0.75  0.74  0.78  0.78  Euro 1.05  1.18  1.14  1.07  1.13  1.23  South African rand 0.061  0.068  0.061  0.059  0.063  0.068  151 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Financial statements  ===== PAGE 154 ===== g. Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources  A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of  economic interest in or on the Earth’s crust in such form, grade (or  quality), and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual  economic extraction. An Ore Reserve is the economically mineable part  of a measured or indicated Mineral Resource.  The estimation of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources requires  judgment to interpret available geological data and subsequently to  select an appropriate mining method and then to establish an extraction  schedule. At least annually, the Competent Persons of the Group  (according to the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration  Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (the JORC Code)),  estimate Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources using assumptions such  as: – Available geological data; – Expected future commodity price and demand; – Exchange rates; – Production costs; – Transport costs; – Close-down and restoration costs; – Recovery rates; – Discount rates; and – Renewal of mining licences. With regard to our future commodity price assumptions, to calculate our  Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources for our filing on the Australian  Securities Exchange and London Stock Exchange, we use prices  generated by our Strategy and Economics team (refer to the Climate  change section for further details about our pricing methodology). For  our Annual Report on Form 20-F, filed with the Securities Exchange  Commission (‘SEC’), we use consensus price or historical pricing and  comply with subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K (Regulation S-K), instead of  with the JORC code. We use judgment as to when to include Mineral Resources in  accounting estimates, for example, the use of Mineral Resources in our  depreciation policy as described in note 13 and in the determination of  the date of closure as described in note 14.  There are many uncertainties in the estimation process and assumptions  that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when  new information becomes available. New geological or economic data,  or unforeseen operational issues may change estimates of Ore Reserves  and Mineral Resources. This could cause material adjustments in our  financial statements to: – Depreciation and amortisation rates; – Carrying values of intangible assets and property, plant and  equipment; – Deferred stripping costs; – Provisions for close-down and restoration costs; and – Recovery of deferred tax assets.  To deliver our climate targets, we expect to make capital investment of  US$7.5 billion in decarbonisation projects over the period to 2030,  including around US$1.5 billion in the next three years, mainly relating to  the repowering of the Pilbara. Progress towards our Scope 1 and 2  emissions targets is reflected within executive remuneration. In 2022, we delivered the first 34MW of renewable power at Gudai-Darri  and announced our plan to invest US$600 million in 200MWh of solar  power facilities and 200MWh of battery storage in the Pilbara by 2026.  We agreed to test at least four battery-powered locomotives, and pilot  battery-powered trucks in the Pilbara in 2024. By 2030, we aim to phase  out the purchase of diesel haulage trucks and locomotives across our  operations. At the Queensland Alumina refinery we are working to  develop an energy efficient digestion process at an estimated cost of  US$240 million. In 2022, we continued to work with the Queensland  Government and energy providers to design a renewable energy  solution for Boyne Smelter. Similarly, in 2022, Tomago Aluminium  Company released an expression of interest to work towards a green  repowering solution for the Tomago smelter. In addition, we have signed  a 130MW solar power purchase agreement for Richards Bay Minerals  (RBM) in South Africa. We also intend to decarbonise our shipping fleet  and aim to have net zero vessels in our portfolio by 2030. To achieve  this, in 2022 we successfully completed a trial of fuel blend with biofuels  and in 2023-2024 we plan to incorporate nine LNG dual-fuel chartered  vessels into our fleet. Decarbonisation projects are expected to  accelerate beyond 2025, which we expect to include further  decarbonisation of the Pilbara electricity system (estimated at US$3  billion out of the US$7.5 billion total spend by 2030) and other  abatement projects. We are also stepping up our focus on Scope 3 goals, which are explicitly  linked to executive remuneration. Over 90% of our Scope 3 emissions  are from the downstream processing of iron ore, bauxite and other  products by our customers. We have not set an overall quantitative  Scope 3 emissions target, but instead engage with our customers to  optimise their current operations toward low-emitting, higher efficiency  processes; and foster partnerships with them, which we believe are  more effective ways to advance actions. The shift toward green steel is  underway and we are working on options to beneficiate our Pilbara ores  to be better suited to green steel technologies and are exploring DRI  pathways using sustainable resources such as hydrogen and biomass.  We expect that our annual incremental operating expenditure on  building new teams and energy efficiency initiatives will be around  US$200 million, in addition to R&D investment.       Our ambition is to increase our growth capital expenditure to around  US$2 billion in 2023 and up to US$3 billion per year in 2024-2025 to  capture new growth opportunities with a focus on materials that are  expected to see strong demand growth from the low carbon transition.  This includes investment in future production of lithium at Rincon,  copper at Oyu Tolgoi and Winu and high-grade iron ore from Simandou.  Our budget for central greenfield exploration remains at approximately  US$250 million annually, mainly focused on copper with a growing  battery minerals programme. For internal capital allocation purposes for major projects, a notional  carbon price of US$75/t CO2e is used to incentivise investment in low  carbon abatement options. The US$75/t CO2e price is derived from our  analysis of the carbon mitigation options across our assets that are  needed to achieve our emissions targets. This is unrelated to the  different carbon prices we use in our core scenarios which are based on  our assessment of climate policy ambition.  The impact of climate change and the execution of our climate change  strategy on our financial statements is discussed below:  Climate change scenarios Our strategy and approach to climate change are informed by an  analysis of the interplay of global megatrends, explored through the lens  of plausible global scenarios. These set the context for our industry and  underpin our commodity price outlooks, portfolio and capital allocation  choices and how we operate as a business.  There are many plausible  scenarios for global energy transition, all with different impacts on future  Financial statements continued The unaudited statement of ore reserves is included on page 284 and of  mineral resources on page 296. h. Impact of climate change on the Group Strategy and approach to climate change Over a year ago, we put the low-carbon transition at the heart of our new  strategy, setting a clear pathway to deliver long-term value as well as  ambitious targets to decarbonise our business. In 2022, our  shareholders supported our Climate Action Plan in a non-binding  advisory vote on the Group’s ambitions, emissions targets and actions to  achieve them. Further detail of our approach is provided in the front half  of our Annual Report and in our 2022 Climate Change Report.   Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction targets of 15% by 2025, 50% by  2030 (both relative to our 2018 equity baseline) and the aim to achieve  net zero emissions by 2050 are aligned with 1.5°C – the stretch goal of  the Paris Agreement. We have set up six large abatement programmes  focused on renewables, Pacific aluminium operations, ELYSISTM  technology, process heat, minerals processing and diesel alternatives.  Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 152  ===== PAGE 155 ===== commodity price outcomes. As part of our 2022 strategy process, we  replaced our three scenarios described in the 2021 Annual Report and  now focus on two core scenarios. These are used to generate a single  central Reference Case for use in commodity pricing forecasts,  valuation models and reserves and resources determination, as was the  case in the prior year. These changes in scenarios represent an  evolution of our interpretation and estimations in the current year, not a  change in accounting policy, and as such we have not restated  comparative information. Our two core scenarios are:  – Competitive Leadership scenario, limiting global warming to  approximately 2°C by 2100, reflects a rapidly developing world of  high growth and strong climate action post-2030 with change  driven by policy and competitive innovation. As a result, we expect  that countries achieve their Glasgow Climate Pact commitments.  Global weighted average carbon prices are forecast to rise rapidly  at an average of 8% per year over the next three decades, reaching  US$42/tCO2e in 2030, and rising rapidly post-2030 to incentivise significant mitigation in industrial sectors post-2030.  – Fragmented Leadership scenario, with global warming exceeding  2.5°C by 2100, is characterised by limited progress on policy reform  with volatile low growth. We expect that nations eventually achieve  their 2030 Nationally Determined Contributions as agreed in Paris in  2015 but fail to progress towards long term carbon goals agreed at  the UN Climate Summit COP26 Glasgow. Global weighted average  carbon prices are forecast to rise slowly, at an average of 2.9% per  year over the period to 2050, reaching US$42 in 2030; but remain  too low post-2030 to incentivise significant mitigation in industrial  sectors resulting in flat global emissions post-2030. At the UN Climate Summit in late 2022 (COP27), there was broad  recognition that the pace of decarbonisation across the global economy  is too slow to limit warming to 1.5°C and that current climate policies in  many countries are not yet aligned with their stated ambitions.  Consequently, neither of our two core scenarios is consistent with the  expectation of climate policies required to accelerate the global  transition to meet the stretch goal of the Paris Agreement. Although our  operational emissions reduction targets align with the goals of the Paris  Agreement, our two core scenarios do not. Consequently, we also  assess our sensitivity and test the economic performance of our  business against a scenario we have developed to reflect our view of the  global actions required to meet the stretch goal of the Paris Agreement.  We refer to this Paris-aligned scenario as the Aspirational Leadership  scenario.  Importantly none of our three scenarios are considered a definitive  representation for our assessment of the future impact of climate  change on the Group. Scenario modelling has inherent limitations and  by its nature allows a range of possible outcomes to be considered  where it is impossible to predict which outcome is likely.      The Aspirational Leadership scenario reflects a world of high growth,  significant social change and accelerated climate action. Global  weighted average carbon prices rise rapidly – at an average of 9.3% per  year over the next three decades – reaching $59/tCO2e in 2030 and  incentivise rapid and deep reductions in industrial emissions post-2030.  Despite geopolitical differences, major economies work together  through multilateral frameworks and proactively work towards limiting  temperature change to 1.5°C by 2050. The Aspirational Leadership  scenario is a commodity sales price and carbon tax sensitivity, with all  other inputs remaining equal to our Reference Case; and is built by  design to reach net-zero emissions globally by 2050 and help us better  understand the pathways to meet the Paris Agreement goal, and what  this could mean for our business. It is used for strategy and risk  discussions, including analysis of sensitivity to our view of a Paris- aligned pathway and comparison of relative economic performance to  our core scenarios.   We do not publish the commodity price forecasts  associated with these  scenarios as to do so would weaken our position in commercial  negotiations and might give rise to concerns from other market  participants.  Impacts of climate change pricing scenarios on our portfolio,  low-carbon transition risks and opportunities  Through our strategy process we compare the economic performance  of our portfolio under our two core scenarios and the Aspirational  Leadership scenario and this indicates that overall the economic  performance of our portfolio would be stronger in scenarios with  proactive climate action, particularly in relation to aluminium, copper  and higher-grade iron ore.  We anticipate that all our commodities are needed in the low-carbon  transition, but estimate that the demand varies significantly between our  scenarios. We expect that copper demand will rise from a 2020 base  by  65-150% by 2050 across the three scenarios to support a rapid rise in  renewable generation while lithium is expected to be a fundamental  ingredient in electric vehicle batteries and grid-firming energy storage  solutions. Demand for aluminium is expected to grow for use in energy- efficient lightweight vehicles with demand for aluminium semi- fabricated products more than doubling in the period 2021-50 in  Aspirational Leadership and Competitive Leadership scenarios, with  moderate demand growth in Fragmented Leadership. Our access to  self-generated hydro power is a source of competitive advantage for  our aluminium business in Canada.  We forecast that global iron ore demand will remain strong with a  premium on higher grade ore needed for the production of green steel,  such as that from our IOC products and the planned investment in  Simandou, which increases in our Aspirational Leadership and  Competitive Leadership scenarios. In our Aspirational Leadership  scenario, accelerated switching to green steel and increasing scrap use  reduces the relative value of low-grade iron ore in the Pilbara.     We will need to carefully monitor and manage transition risks linked to  our operational Scope 1 and 2 emissions and value-chain Scope 3  emissions.  In particular, we expect the decarbonisation of our assets to  benefit from the implementation of new technologies. The pace of  technological development is uncertain, which could delay or increase  the cost of our decarbonisation efforts.  Our Aspirational Leadership scenario predicts the Group's overall  economic performance would fall between the Fragmented Leadership  and Competitive Leadership scenarios. This reflects higher estimated  economic performance for our copper and aluminium businesses in the  Aspirational Leadership scenario, based on their higher price profiles,  offset by higher expected carbon penalties across our operating  jurisdictions, and lower prices for lower grade iron ore products. Refer  below for our assessment of the accounting implications of forecast  commodity pricing in the Aspirational Leadership scenario. Physical risk In 2022, we launched the Physical Resilience Programme across the  Group. During the year we commenced a physical risk and resilience  assessment across prioritised risk areas: the entire Pilbara iron ore  operation and the Saguenay aluminium operations focused on Lac  Saint-Jean. Our ongoing review processes, including impairment  assessments, have not identified any material accounting impacts to  date. For example, in 2022, no write-offs are necessary in the Pilbara,  where certain infrastructure assets, such as transmission lines, that have  reached the end of their natural lives are being replaced with climate  resilient infrastructure. In addition, we do not foresee the renewal of our  contractual water rights in Canada that have been classified as  indefinite-lived intangible assets to be at risk from climate change (note  12). Further, closure planning considers future climate change  projections at each step of the process to support safe and appropriate  final landform design. In 2023, we will progress a Group-wide top-down   assessment to further understand the risks and opportunities associated  with physical climate change and to quantify any financial impacts, in  addition to the site-specific bottom-up assessments, which will continue  in the foreseeable future.  153 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Financial statements  ===== PAGE 156 ===== Accounting judgments and estimates Global decarbonisation and the world’s energy transition continues to  evolve, with the potential to materially impact our future financial results  as our significant accounting judgments and key estimates  are updated  to reflect prevailing circumstances.  In response, carrying values of  assets and liabilities could be materially affected in future periods. Our  current strategy and approach to decarbonise our operations and  achieve our scope 1 and 2 emissions targets is considered in our  significant judgments and key estimates reflected in these financial  results. Impacts from executing our climate change strategy - accounting for  capital expenditure and operating costs underpinning our Climate  Action Plan Given the significant investment we are making to abate our carbon  emissions, we have considered the potential for asset obsolescence,  with a particular focus on our Pilbara operations where we are  prioritising investment in renewables to switch away from natural gas  power generation. No material changes to accounting estimates to  useful economic lives have been necessary due to the anticipated use  of these assets for firming support in the transition (note 13). As the  renewable projects progress, it is possible that such adjustments may  be identified in the future. The renewable assets in the Pilbara are our  own built and operated arrangements and follow normal rules on  capitalisation of directly attributable costs. The solar power purchase  agreement for RBM is accounted for on an accrual basis as energy is  produced.  There are no accounting impacts to date from the programme to  develop renewable energy solutions for our Queensland aluminium  assets as the work has not been completed and commercial terms have  not been agreed. Large scale renewable power off-take arrangements  may, in the future, require complex derivative measurement or lease  accounting depending on contractual terms. No adjustments to useful lives of the existing fleet have been identified  to date as a result of planned fleet electrification in the Pilbara and the  purchase of battery-powered locomotives. The solutions are still in  development or pilot stages and the gradual fleet replacement is  intended to be part of the normal lifecycle renewal of trucks. Depending  on technological development,  which is highly uncertain, this could lead  to accelerated depreciation in the future. Similarly, our target to have net  zero vessels in our portfolio by 2030 has not given rise to accounting  adjustments to date, as the replacement is planned as part of the  lifecycle renewal. The energy efficiency digestion project at  Queensland Alumina refinery does not reduce the economic lives of the  underlying alumina assets but could lower operating costs and improve  margins. The expenditure on our own carbon abatement projects and  technology advancements follows existing accounting policies on cost  capitalisation, research and development costs. Use of sensitivities to Paris aligned accounting The forecast commodity prices (including carbon prices) informed by a  blend of our two scenarios are used pervasively in our financial  processes from budgeting, forecasting, capital allocation and project  evaluation to the determination of ore reserves. In turn, these prices are  used to derive critical accounting estimates included as inputs to  impairment testing, estimation of remaining economic life for units of  production depreciation and discounting closure and rehabilitation  provisions.  These prices represent our best estimate of actual market  outcomes based on the range of future economic conditions regarding  matters largely outside our control, as required by IFRS. As neither of our  core scenarios represents the Group’s view of the goals of the Paris  Agreement, our commodity price assumptions used in accounting  estimates are not consistent with the expectation of climate policies  required to accelerate the global transition to meet the goals of the Paris  Agreement. As described above, we use our Aspirational Leadership  scenario to understand the sensitivity of these estimates to Paris aligned  assumptions. Under the Aspirational Leadership scenario, which is not used in the  preparation of these financial statements, nor for budgeting purposes,  the economic performance of copper and aluminium is expected to be  stronger under supply and demand forward pricing curves which we  believe will be consistent with the Paris Agreement. It is possible  therefore, under the right conditions, that historical impairments  associated with these assets could reverse. We recognised an  impairment of US$202 million during the year for the Boyne smelter  cash-generating unit, triggered by economic and operating  performance of the smelter (note 4). When measuring the recoverable  amount for this cash-generating unit we utilised net present value of  cash flows to the end of the existing joint venture agreements in 2029,  which also coincides with the Group’s targeted carbon emission  reductions by 2030. The Group continues to evaluate lower emission  power solutions for the smelter that could extend its life to at least 2040.  In such circumstances, the net present value of forecast future cash  flows could support the reversal of past impairments. Both the recorded  outcome and the sensitivity represent a reduction in emissions that we  considered to be Paris-aligned. In the Aspirational Leadership scenario the prices for lower-grade iron  ore are supported in the medium term by an assumed underlying  increase in GDP-driven demand. However, in the longer term we assume  the pricing for lower grade iron ore to be weaker than in our core  scenarios. This will depend on the development of low-emissions steel  technology, the pace of which is uncertain, but is expected to be offset  by higher prices for higher-grade iron ore. This is unlikely to give rise to  impairment triggers for 2022 or in the foreseeable future due to the high  returns on capital employed in the Pilbara.         We completed the divestments of our coal businesses in 2018 and no  longer mine coal, but retained a contingent royalty from these  divestments. Recent favourable coal prices exceeded contractual  benchmark levels and resulted in the cash royalty receipt of US$36  million during 2022. We also carry royalty receivables of US$209 million  on our balance sheet at 31 December 2022, measured at fair value (note  24). The fair value of this balance may be adversely impacted in the  future by a faster pace of transition to a low carbon economy, but this  impact is not expected to be material. Closure dates and cost of closure are also sensitive to climate  assumptions, but no material changes have been identified in the year  specific to climate change that would require a material revision to the  provisions in 2022. For those commodities with higher forward price  curves under the Aspirational Leadership scenario, it may be  economical to mine lower mineral grades, which could result in the  conversion of additional Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves and  therefore longer dated closure. Overall, based on the Aspirational Leadership scenario pricing  outcomes, and with all other assumptions remaining consistent with  those applied to our 2022 financial statements, we do not currently  envisage a material adverse impact of the 1.5°C Paris-aligned sensitivity  on asset carrying values, remaining useful life, or closure and  rehabilitation provisions for the Group. It is possible that other factors  may arise in the future, which are not known today, that may impact this  assessment.

New standards issued and effective in the current year Our financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting  policies consistent with those applied in the financial statements for the  year ended 31 December 2021, except for the accounting requirements  set out below, effective as at 1 January 2022. These did not have a  significant impact on our financial statements. Proceeds before Intended Use (Amendments to IAS 16  “Property, Plant and Equipment”) We adopted Proceeds before Intended Use (Amendments to IAS 16  “Property, Plant and Equipment”) at 1 January 2022. The amendment  prohibits the deduction, from the cost of major project construction  work in progress, of proceeds (net of additional processing costs) from  selling items before the related item of property, plant and equipment is  available for use. Under the amendment, proceeds from selling items  before the related item of property, plant and equipment is available for  use are recognised within “Consolidated sales revenue” in the income  statement along with the costs of producing those items within “Net  operating costs (excluding items disclosed separately)”. We apportion  development expenditure in the period to derive the cost associated  with pre-production revenue, based on the tonnes produced in the  period as a percentage of the total expected production (estimated total  ore reserve). During 2021 we completed a review of the impact of these  amendments and concluded that adjustments to retained earnings as at  1 January 2020, and restatement of the 2020 and 2021 Group Income  Statement and Balance Sheet upon adoption of the amendments, were  insignificant and as a result no restatements were made to comparative  periods. During the year ended 31 December 2022 we recognised in the  income statement pre-production revenue of  US$511 million and  related costs of US$30 million in relation to Gudai Darri and Oyu Tolgoi. Onerous Contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract  (Amendments to IAS 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and  Contingent Assets”) We adopted Onerous Contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract  (Amendments to IAS 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and  Contingent Assets”) at 1 January 2022. The amendments specify that  the costs an entity includes in determining whether a contract is onerous  are made up of all directly related costs, including both incremental  amounts and an allocation of other directly related expenditure.  Previously, we made provision for onerous contracts when the assets  dedicated to the contract were fully impaired or the contract became  stranded as a result of a business decision. From 2022, we record a  provision if a contract is found to be loss-making on a stand-alone basis  following allocation of all directly related costs as required by the  amendments to IAS 37.    We have applied the amendments without revision to comparative  amounts. We have increased other provisions and reduced our retained  earnings as at 1 January 2022 by US$17 million. j. Reconciliation with Australian Accounting Standards  Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS,  as defined in the ‘Basis of preparation’ on page 148, which differs in  certain respects from the version of International Financial Reporting  Standards that is applicable in Australia, referred to as Australian  Accounting Standards (AAS). We are required to disclose the effect of  the adjustments to our consolidated income statement, consolidated  total comprehensive income/(loss) and consolidated shareholders’  funds if our accounts were prepared under the version of IFRS that is  applicable in Australia. This is in order to satisfy the obligations of Rio  Tinto Limited to prepare consolidated accounts under Australian  company law, as amended by an order issued by the Australian  Securities and Investments Commission on 16 July 2021. Prior to 1 January 2004, our financial statements were prepared in  accordance with UK GAAP. Under IFRS, goodwill on acquisitions prior to  1998, which was eliminated directly against equity in the Group’s UK  GAAP financial statements, has not been reinstated. This was permitted  under the rules governing the transition to IFRS set out in IFRS 1. The  equivalent Australian Standard, AASB 1, does not provide for the netting  of goodwill against equity. As a consequence, shareholders’ funds  under AAS include the residue of such goodwill, which amounted to  US$380 million at 31 December 2022 (2021: US$377 million).  Save for the exception described above, the Group’s financial  statements prepared in accordance with IFRS are consistent with the  requirements of AAS.  155 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Financial statements  ===== PAGE 158 ===== Note 2022  US$m 2021 US$m 2020 US$m Consolidated operations Consolidated sales revenue 1, 6 55,554  63,495  44,611  Net operating costs (excluding items disclosed separately) 7 (34,770)  (32,690)  (26,254)  Impairment reversals/(charges net of reversals) 4 150  (269)  (904)  Loss on disposal of interest in subsidiary 5 (105)  —    —  Exploration and evaluation expenditure (net of profit relating to interests in undeveloped projects) 8 (896)  (719)  (624)  Operating profit 19,933  29,817  16,829  Share of profit after tax of equity accounted units 777  1,042  652  Impairment of investments in equity accounted units 4 (202)  —  (339)  Profit before finance items and taxation 20,508  30,859  17,142  Finance items Net exchange gains/(losses) on external and intragroup net (debt)/cash balances 253  802  (1,124)  Net losses on derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting (424)  (231)  (123)  Finance income 9 179  64    141  Finance costs 9 (335)  (243)  (268)  Amortisation of discount on provisions 14, 36 (1,519)  (418)  (377)  (1,846)  (26)  (1,751)  Profit before taxation 18,662  30,833  15,391  Taxation 10 (5,586)  (8,258)  (4,991)  Profit after tax for the year 13,076  22,575  10,400  – attributable to owners of Rio Tinto (net earnings) 12,420  21,094  9,769  – attributable to non-controlling interests 656  1,481  631  Basic earnings per share 2 766.8 c 1,303.4 c 604.0 c Diluted earnings per share 2 762.1 c 1,295.0 c 599.8 c The notes on pages 148 to 155 and pages 161 to 242 are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.

Financial statements continued Group Statement of Changes in Equity Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 160  ===== PAGE 163 ===== Our financial performance We use a number of measures, including segmental revenue, underlying EBITDA, and capital expenditure to provide us with a greater understanding  of our operations’ underlying business performance including revenue generation, productivity and cost management, on a comparable basis  between reporting years. 1  Our financial performance by segment  Our management structure is based on principal product groups (PG) together with global support functions whose leaders make up the Executive  Committee. The Executive Committee members each report directly to our Chief Executive who is the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and is  responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments. The CODM’s primary measure of profit is underlying  EBITDA. Finance costs and net debt are managed on a Group-wide basis and are therefore excluded from the segmental results. Our reportable segments are as follows: Reportable segment Principal activities Iron Ore Iron ore mining and salt and gypsum production in Western Australia. Aluminium Bauxite mining; alumina refining; aluminium smelting. Copper Mining and refining of copper, gold, silver, molybdenum and other by-products; exploration activities together with the Simandou iron  ore project, which was the responsibility of the Copper product group chief executive during 2022. Minerals Includes businesses with products such as borates, titanium dioxide feedstock together with the Iron Ore Company of Canada (iron  ore mining and iron concentrate/pellet production). Also includes diamond mining, sorting and marketing.

The details provided include 100% of subsidiaries’ capital expenditure and Rio Tinto’s share of the capital expenditure of joint operations. In 2022, we have  excluded capitalised expenditure relating to equity accounted units and have adjusted prior year comparatives for this change in definition. (b) Consolidated sales revenue includes subsidiary sales of US$50 million (2021: US$44 million; 2020: US$34 million) to equity accounted units which are not included in segmental revenue.  Segmental revenue includes the Group’s proportionate share of product sales by equity accounted units (after adjusting for sales to subsidiaries) of US$2,900 million (2021: US$3,117 million;  2020: US$2,441 million) which are not included in consolidated sales revenue.  Segmental revenue  Segmental revenue includes consolidated sales revenue plus the equivalent sales revenue of equity accounted units in proportion to our equity  interest (after adjusting for sales to/from subsidiaries). Segmental revenue measures revenue on a basis that is comparable to our underlying EBITDA metric.

Other relevant judgments - Exclusions from underlying EBITDA Items excluded from profit after tax are those gains and losses that, individually or in aggregate with similar items, are of a nature and size to  require exclusion in order to provide additional insight into the underlying business performance. The following items are excluded from profit after tax in arriving at underlying EBITDA in each year irrespective of materiality:  – Depreciation and amortisation in subsidiaries and equity accounted units; – Taxation and finance items in equity accounted units; – Taxation and finance items relating to subsidiaries; – Unrealised gains/(losses) on embedded derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting; – Net gains/(losses) on disposal of interests in subsidiaries;  – Impairment charges net of reversals;  – The underlying EBITDA of discontinued operations; – Adjustments to closure provisions where the adjustment is associated with an impairment charge and for legacy sites where the  disturbance or environmental contamination relates to the pre-acquisition period. In addition, there is a final judgmental category which includes, where applicable, other credits and charges that, individually or in aggregate if  of a similar type, are of a nature or size to require exclusion in order to provide additional insight into underlying business performance. In  2022 this category included the gain recognised by Kitimat relating to LNG Canada's project and the gain recognised upon sale of the Cortez  royalty. In 2021 the category included the changes in closure estimates at Energy Resources of Australia and Gove Refinery. 2022 US$m 2021  US$m 2020 US$m Profit after tax for the year   13,076   22,575   10,400  Taxation    5,586   8,258   4,991  Profit before taxation 18,662 30,833 15,391 Depreciation and amortisation in subsidiaries excluding capitalised depreciation(a)   4,871   4,525   4,074  Depreciation and amortisation in equity accounted units   470   497   576  Finance items in subsidiaries   1,846   26   1,751  Taxation and finance items in equity accounted units   640   759   443  (Gains)/Losses on embedded commodity derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting (including foreign exchange)   (6)   51   (6)  Impairment charges net of reversals(b)   52   269   1,272  Gain recognised by Kitimat relating to LNG Canada's project(c)   (116)   (336)   —  Change in closure estimates (non-operating and fully impaired sites)(d)   180   1,096   401  Loss on disposal of interests in subsidiary(b)   105   —   —  Gain on sale of the Cortez Royalty(e)   (432)   —   —  Underlying EBITDA   26,272   37,720   23,902  (a) Depreciation and amortisation in subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2022 is net of capitalised depreciation of US$139 million (31 December 2021: US$172 million; 31 December 2020:  US$205 million). (b) Refer to note 4 (c) During the first half of 2022, LNG Canada elected to terminate their option to purchase additional land and facilities for expansion of their operations at Kitimat, Canada. The resulting gain has  been excluded from underlying EBITDA consistent with prior years as it is part of a series of transactions that together were material. On 3 December 2021 we gained control over a new wharf at  Kitimat, Canada that was built and paid for by LNG Canada. The gain on recognition was excluded from underlying EBITDA on the grounds of individual magnitude and consistency with the  associated impairment charge in 2021, refer to note 4. (d) In 2022 the charge relates to re-estimates of underlying closure cash flows for legacy sites where the environmental damage preceded ownership by Rio Tinto. On 2 February 2022, Energy  Resources of Australia released preliminary findings from its reforecast of the total undiscounted cost schedule for the Ranger rehabilitation project. Information available from this study resulted  in the Group recording an increase to the closure provision of US$510 million at 31 December 2021. Other increases to closure estimates charged to the income statement in 2021 relate to  Diavik, Gove refinery, and a number of the Group's legacy sites where the environmental damage preceded ownership by Rio Tinto. The adjustments at Energy Resources Australia and Gove  refinery were recognised in the income statement as these are non-operating sites, and excluded from underlying earnings due to the magnitude of the individual updates and materiality when  aggregated. In 2020 we recognised an increase in the Diavik closure provision based on preliminary Pre-Feasibility Study findings. On completion of the study in 2021 a true-up was recorded in  the income statement and excluded from underlying earnings in line with the treatment of the initial increase in 2020, which was excluded from underlying EBITDA as Diavik was fully impaired  during the year. Other closure costs excluded in 2020 were the increase in the Gove refinery closure provision offset by a decrease in the Argyle mine closure provision on completion of Pre- Feasibility Studies at each site. The 2020 comparative also included the underlying EBITDA impact (US$138 million loss) in respect of increases to Closure provisions in legacy and non- operating sites following a reduction to the closure discount rate to 1.5%. (e) On 2 August 2022, we completed the sale of a gross production royalty which was retained following the disposal of the Cortez Complex in 2008. The gain recognised on sale of the royalty has  been excluded from underlying EBITDA on the grounds of individual magnitude. 163 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Financial statements  ===== PAGE 166 ===== 2  Earnings per ordinary share Basic earnings per share 2022 2021 2020 Net earnings attributable to owners of Rio Tinto (US$ million) 12,420 21,094 9,769 Weighted average number of shares (millions)(a) 1,619.8 1,618.4 1,617.4 Basic earnings per ordinary share (cents) 766.8 1,303.4 604.0 (a) The weighted average number of shares is calculated as the average number of Rio Tinto plc shares outstanding not held as treasury shares of 1,248.9 million (2021: 1,247.4 million; 2020: 1,246.5  million) plus the average number of Rio Tinto Limited shares outstanding of 370.9 million (2021: 371.0 million; 2020: 370.9 million) over the relevant period.

The realised impact of  these hedges is shown within ‘Other items’ in the Cash flows from consolidated operations and is not included in the above. 4  Impairment charges net of reversals  Recognition and measurement Impairment charges and reversals are assessed at the level of cash-generating units which, in accordance with IAS 36, are identified as the smallest  identifiable asset or group of assets that generate cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets. Separate cash- generating units are identified where an active market exists for intermediate products, even if the majority of those products are further processed  internally.   In some cases, individual business units consist of several operations with independent cash-generating streams which constitute separate cash-  generating units.  Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to the cash-generating unit or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to  benefit from the related business combination, and tested for impairment at the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for  internal management purposes. All cash-generating units containing goodwill (note 11), indefinite-lived intangible assets and intangible assets that  are not ready for use (note 12) are tested annually for impairment as at 30 September, regardless of whether there has been an impairment trigger, or  more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Other relevant judgments - determination of CGUs Judgment is applied to identify the Group’s CGUs, particularly when assets belong to integrated operations, and changes in CGUs could  impact impairment charges and reversals. The most significant judgment continues to relate to the continued grouping of Rio Tinto Iron and  Titanium Quebec Operations, Canada and QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM), Madagascar as a single CGU on the basis that they are  vertically integrated operations and there is no active market for ilmenite. During the year we have separated the Gladstone Power Station  from the Boyne Smelter cash-generating unit; refer to page 168 for more information. The carrying values for undeveloped properties are reviewed at each reporting date in accordance with IFRS 6. The indicators of impairment differ  from the tests in accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets” in recognition of the subjectivity of estimating future cash flows for mineral interests  under evaluation. Potential indicators of impairment include: expiry of the right to explore, substantive expenditure is no longer planned, commercially  viable quantities of mineral resources have not been discovered and exploration activities will be discontinued, or sufficient data exists to indicate a  future development would be unlikely to recover the carrying amount in full. When such impairment indicators have been identified, the recoverable  amount and impairment charge are measured under IAS 36. Impairment reversals for undeveloped properties are not subject to special conditions  within IFRS 6 and are therefore subject to the same monitoring for indicators of impairment reversal as other cash-generating units.  Property, plant and equipment, including right of use assets and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment if there is an indication  that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. This review starts with an appraisal of the perimeter of cash-generating units to consider changes  in the business or strategic direction. Following this, an assessment of internal and external indicators is performed. Internal sources of information  considered includes assessment of the financial performance of the CGU and changes in mine plans. External sources of information, include  changes in forecast commodity prices, costs and other market factors. Non-current assets (excluding goodwill) that have suffered impairment are reviewed using the same basis for valuation as explained above whenever  events or changes in circumstances indicate that the impairment loss may no longer exist, or may have decreased. If appropriate, an impairment  reversal will be recognised. The carrying amount of the cash-generating unit after reversal must be the lower of (a) the recoverable amount, as  calculated above, and (b) the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment loss been  recognised for the cash-generating unit in prior periods.  If events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment or impairment reversal, assessments are performed more frequently than just  annually. In 2022, we identified indicators of impairment at the Boyne Smelter in the aluminium segment and indicators of impairment reversal at the  Roughrider uranium undeveloped project. 165 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Financial statements  ===== PAGE 168 ===== 4  Impairment charges net of reversals continued Key judgment - Indicators of impairment and impairment reversals at Oyu Tolgoi and Kitimat The Oyu Tolgoi and Kitimat cash-generating units have both been impaired in previous years and are therefore monitored closely for  indicators of further impairment or impairment reversal as such adjustments would likely be material to our results.  At the time of their  impairment, the carrying value and fair value for these cash-generating units were equal, making the cash-generating units sensitive to  changes in economic assumptions, albeit headroom may have subsequently arisen due to inflation and the passage of time.  Oyu Tolgoi We assessed the Oyu Tolgoi cash-generating unit for internal sources of information that could indicate impairment by reference to the  operational performance of the mine and development progress for the underground operation. For external sources of information that could  indicate impairment, we considered current and projected commodity prices and noted the transaction with Turquoise Hill minority  shareholders. Whilst the value imputed by extrapolating that transaction price is less than the carrying value of the cash-generating unit, we  noted this reflected funding and liquidity risks associated with minority shareholdings rather than information relevant to the underlying assets.   Accordingly we concluded that there were no indicators of impairment or impairment reversal.  Kitimat The Kitimat smelter was impaired in 2013 and 2014 during the construction phase as cost overruns were not expected to be recovered  through economic performance.  The plant was further impaired in 2021 (refer to the section below) as operational performance was adversely  impacted by a workforce strike in June 2021 that has reduced the capacity over a prolonged period. The ramp-up of operations continuing  into 2022 following the strike was anticipated in the determination of the 2021 recoverable amount. In 2022 the operational performance of the plant was considered as part of the assessment of internal sources of information for evidence of  impairment. As highlighted in the climate change section, the economic performance of assets in the aluminium segment has the potential to  perform more strongly as the world transitions to a lower carbon future; however, our assessment of external sources of information did not  indicate that this had yet been priced into asset valuations. We concluded that there were no indicators of impairment or impairment reversal. Where indication of impairment or impairment reversal exists then an  impairment review is undertaken; the recoverable amount is assessed  by reference to the higher of value in use (being the net present value of  expected future cash flows of the relevant cash-generating unit in its  current condition) and fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD). When  the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is measured by  reference to FVLCD, this amount is further classified in accordance with  the fair value hierarchy for observable market data that is consistent with  the unit of account for the cash-generating unit being tested. The Group  considers that the best evidence of FVLCD is the value obtained from an  active market or binding sale agreement and, in this case, the  recoverable amount is classified in the fair value hierarchy as level 1.  When FVLCD is based on quoted prices for equity instruments but  adjusted to reflect factors such as a lack of liquidity in the market, the  recoverable amount is classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. No  cash-generating units are currently assessed for impairment by  reference to a recoverable amount based on FVLCD classified as level 1  or level 2.  Where unobservable inputs are material to the measurement of the  recoverable amount, FVLCD is based on the best information available  to reflect the amount the Group could receive for the cash-generating  unit in an orderly transaction between market participants at the  measurement date. This is often estimated using discounted cash flow  techniques and is classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.  Where the recoverable amount is assessed using FVLCD based on  discounted cash flow techniques, the resulting estimates are based on  detailed life-of-mine and long-term production plans. These may  include anticipated expansions which are at the evaluation stage of  study.  The cash flow forecasts for FVLCD purposes are based on  management’s best estimates of expected future revenues and costs,  including the future cash costs of production, capital expenditure, and  closure, restoration and environmental costs. For the purposes of  determining FVLCD from a market participant’s perspective, the cash  flows incorporate management’s price and cost assumptions in the  short and medium term. In the longer term, operating margins are  assumed to remain constant where appropriate, as it is considered  unlikely that a market participant would prepare detailed forecasts over  a longer term. The cash flow forecasts may include net cash flows  expected to be realised from the extraction, processing and sale of  material that does not currently qualify for inclusion in ore reserves. Such  non-reserve material is only included when there is a high degree of  confidence in its economic extraction. This expectation is usually based  on preliminary drilling and sampling of areas of mineralisation that are  contiguous with existing ore reserves. Typically, the additional  evaluation required to achieve reserves status for such material has not  yet been done because this would involve incurring evaluation costs  earlier than is required for the efficient planning and operation of  the mine.  As noted above, cost levels incorporated in the cash flow forecasts for  FVLCD purposes are based on the current life-of-mine plan or long- term production plan for the cash-generating unit. This differs from  value in use which requires future cash flows to be estimated for the  asset in its current condition and therefore does not include future cash  flows associated with improving or enhancing an asset’s performance.  Anticipated enhancements to assets may be included in FVLCD  calculations and, therefore, generally result in a higher value.  Where the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is dependent  on the life of its associated orebody, expected future cash flows reflect  the current life of mine and long-term production plans, which are based  on detailed research, analysis and iterative modelling to optimise the  level of return from investment, output and sequence of extraction. The  mine plan takes account of all relevant characteristics of the orebody,  including waste-to-ore ratios, ore grades, haul distances, chemical and  metallurgical properties of the ore impacting process recoveries and  capacities of processing equipment that can be used. The life-of-mine  plan and long-term production plans are, therefore, the basis for  forecasting production output and production costs in each future year.  Forecast cash flows for ore reserve estimation for JORC purposes are  generally based on Rio Tinto’s commodity price forecasts, which  assume short-term market prices will revert to the Group’s assessment  of the long-term price, generally over a period of three to five years. For  most commodities, these forecast commodity prices are derived from a  combination of analyses of the marginal costs of the producers and the  incentive price of these commodities. These assessments often differ  from current price levels and are updated periodically. The Group does  not believe that published medium- and long-term forward prices  necessarily provide a good indication of future levels because they tend  to be strongly influenced by spot prices. The price forecasts used for  ore reserve estimation are generally consistent with those used for  Financial statements continued Notes to the 2022 financial statements Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 166  ===== PAGE 169 ===== impairment testing unless management deems that in certain economic  environments a market participant would not assume Rio Tinto’s view on  prices, in which case in preparing FVLCD impairment calculations  management estimates the assumptions that a market participant would  be expected to use.  Forecast future cash flows of a cash-generating unit take into account  the sales prices under existing sales contracts.  The discount rates applied to the future cash flow forecasts represent an  estimate of the rate the market participant would apply having regard to  the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the  future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted. The Group’s  weighted average cost of capital is generally used as a starting point for  determining the discount rates, with appropriate adjustments for the risk  profile of the countries in which the individual cash-generating units  operate. For final feasibility studies and ore reserve estimation, internal  hurdle rates, which are generally higher than the Group’s weighted  average cost of capital, are used. For developments funded with project  finance, the debt component of the weighted average cost of capital  may be calculated by reference to the specific interest rate of the  project finance and anticipated leverage of the project.  For operations with a functional currency other than the US dollar, the  impairment review is undertaken in the relevant functional currency. In  estimating FVLCD, internal forecasts of exchange rates take into  account spot exchange rates, historical data and external forecasts, and  are kept constant in real terms after five years. The great majority of the  Group’s sales are based on prices denominated in US dollars. To the  extent that the currencies of countries in which the Group produces  commodities strengthen against the US dollar without an increase in  commodity prices, cash flows and, therefore, net present values are  reduced. Management considers that, over the long term, there is a  tendency for movements in commodity prices to compensate to some  extent for movements in the value of the US dollar, particularly against  the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, and vice versa. However, such  compensating changes are not synchronised and do not fully offset  each other. In estimating value in use, the present value of future cash  flows in foreign currencies is translated at the spot exchange rate on the  testing date.  Generally, discounted cash flow models are used to determine the  recoverable amount of CGUs. In this case, significant judgment is  required to determine the appropriate estimates and assumptions used  and there is significant estimation uncertainty. In particular, for fair value  less costs of disposal valuations, judgment is required to determine the  estimates a market participant would use. The discounted cash flow  models are most sensitive to the following estimates: the timing of  project expansions; the cost to complete assets under construction;  long-term commodity prices; production timing and recovery rates;  exchange rates; operating costs; reserve and resource estimates;  closure costs; discount rates; allocation of long-term contract revenues  between CGUs; and, in some instances, the renewal of mining licences.  Some of these variables are unique to an individual CGU. Future  changes in these variables may differ from management’s expectations  and may materially alter the recoverable amounts of the CGUs.

The project was fully impaired during the  year ended 31 December 2017 due to significant uncertainty over whether commercially viable quantities of mineral resources could be identified at  a future date. The sale therefore led to an impairment reversal in the current year. It also led to a loss on disposal being recognised of US$105 million  arising from the recycling of the currency translation reserve to the income statement. 167 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Financial statements  ===== PAGE 170 ===== 4  Impairment charges net of reversals continued Aluminium - Pacific Aluminium, Australia and New Zealand The operating and economic performance of the Boyne Smelter in Queensland, Australia was below our expectations in 2022.  The plant operated  with reduced capacity and the economic performance suffered due to the high cost of energy from the coal-fired Gladstone Power Station. These  conditions have been identified as an impairment trigger.  We have calculated a recoverable amount for the cash-generating unit based on post-tax  cash flows, expressed in real terms and discounted using a post-tax rate of 6.6% over the period to 2029.  This date was chosen as it coincides with  both the remaining term of the Boyne Smelter joint venture agreements and the Group’s Paris-aligned commitment to reduce carbon emissions by  50% by 2030 relative to the 2018 baseline. Despite the recent implementation of temporary energy price caps by the Australian Government, this  resulted in an impairment charge of US$202 million, representing a full impairment of the carrying value of the Boyne Smelter investment in equity  accounted unit. Impact of climate change on our business - Boyne Smelter We are committed to the repowering of our aluminium smelter in Queensland with firmed renewable energy by 2030. For this reason, along  with the coal price cap noted above, we have separated the Gladstone Power Station from the Boyne Smelter cash-generating unit.  As a  sensitivity we have considered the impact of a potential repowering of the smelter using commodity and energy price assumptions from our  Aspirational Leadership scenario, with all other assumptions being unchanged. This would result in improved cash flows, including an  extension of operations at the Boyne Smelter beyond current joint venture agreements through to 2040. The potential value uplift under this  sensitivity is not part of our base valuation as it is dependent upon commercial agreements that are not currently in place,  but could support  the reversal of past impairments. Both the recorded outcome and the sensitivity, as described in “Impact of climate change on the Group”  section on pages 152 to 155, are considered to be Paris-aligned. 2021 Aluminium – Kitimat, Canada On 3 December 2021, we announced completion of the newly- constructed wharf at Kitimat. Construction spend was incurred by LNG  Canada and therefore a gain of US$336 million representing the  estimated fair value of the cost of construction was recorded and the  carrying value of the Kitimat cash-generating unit (CGU) increased  accordingly. Output from the smelter was reduced to 25% as a result of  a workforce strike in mid-2021 and ramp-up to full capacity was  expected to extend through into 2022. As a previously impaired CGU,  and therefore carrying limited headroom, these factors were identified  as conditions that could indicate that the uplifted carrying value may not  be supportable and therefore the CGU was tested for impairment. Using the fair value less cost of disposal methodology and discounting  real-terms post-tax cash flows at 6.6%, we recognised a post-tax  impairment charge of US$197 million (pre-tax US$269 million)  representing the difference between the recoverable amount (US$3,126  million) and the carrying value (US$3,323 million). 2020 Aluminium – Pacific Aluminium, Australia and New Zealand On 9 July 2020, we announced the conclusion of the NZAS strategic  review and gave Meridian Energy 14 months' notice for the termination  of the power contract. As a result of the decision to wind down  operations, an impairment trigger was identified. The net present value  of post-tax cash flows over the remaining life for this CGU was negative  and therefore the non-current assets of the smelter were fully impaired. High operating costs and challenging outlook for the aluminium industry  also resulted in impairment triggers being identified at the Bell Bay  aluminium smelter in Tasmania, Australia and at Boyne Smelter in  Queensland, Australia at 30 June 2020. The forecast net present value  of cash flows over the period to anticipated expiry in 2025 of a power  contract with Hydro Tasmania was negative taking into account market  conditions at the time. The property, plant and equipment of the Bell Bay  smelter was therefore fully impaired. We determined the recoverable  amount for our share of the Boyne Smelter CGU, which also included the  Gladstone Power Station, as US$273 million based on post-tax cash  flows expressed in real terms and discounted at 6.6%. Accordingly, our  share of impairment after tax in the equity accounted unit was US$119  million (US$148 million pre-tax) related to the smelter and US$26 million  (US$36 million pre-tax) related to the power station. Aluminium – Sohar, Oman In 2020, the challenging outlook for the Middle Eastern aluminium  industry was identified as an impairment trigger at the Sohar aluminium  smelter in Oman, an equity accounted unit of the Group. At 30 September 2020, we determined the recoverable amount for our  share of the Sohar CGU to be US$258 million based on post-tax cash  flows expressed in real terms and discounted at 7.6%. Accordingly, our  share of impairment after tax in the equity accounted unit was US$220  million. Aluminium – ISAL smelter, Iceland Our announcement in February 2020 of a strategic review of the ISAL  smelter in Iceland, combined with challenging market conditions, was  identified as an impairment trigger at 30 June 2020. Subsequent  restoration of smelter competitiveness resulting from improved power  delivery terms represented an indicator of partial impairment reversal at  31 December 2020. We calculated a post-tax recoverable amount for  the CGU of US$139 million at 31 December 2020 based on FVLCD,  discounted using a post-tax rate of 6.6%. As a consequence, with full  impairment of the CGU and a pre-tax impairment charge of US$204  million in the first half of 2020, followed by reversal of US$111 million to  previously recorded pre-tax impairment in the second half of 2020, the  full-year results for the year ended 31 December 2020 included a net  pre-tax impairment charge of US$93 million. Minerals  – Diavik, Canada The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted global demand for  diamonds, and in April 2020 our then joint venture partner in the Diavik  Diamond Mine filed for creditor protection and defaulted on cash calls.  These circumstances were identified as an impairment trigger. The net  present value of post-tax cash flows projected over the remaining life of  the Diavik ‘Diamond Mine’ to 2025 did not support retaining any carrying  value. This resulted in the Group's 60% interest in plant and equipment  and intangible assets of the CGU being fully impaired at 30 June 2020.

Where an acquisition does not meet the definition of a business as  defined by IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” each asset is recognised on  the balance sheet at fair value. In the Group cash flow statement we  assess, based on the substance of the transaction, whether to allocate  the cash consideration for these transactions either to “Purchases of  property, plant and equipment and intangible assets” or to “Acquisitions  of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates” depending on the type of  assets purchased. For undeveloped mining projects which have arisen through acquisition,  the allocation of the purchase price consideration may result in  undeveloped properties being recognised at an earlier stage of project  evaluation compared with projects arising from the Group’s exploration  and evaluation programme. Subsequent expenditure on acquired  undeveloped projects is only capitalised if it meets the high degree of  confidence threshold discussed in note 12.  Where we increase our ownership interest in a subsidiary, the difference  between the purchase price and the carrying value of the share of net  assets acquired is recorded in equity. The cash cost of such purchases  is included within “financing activities” in the cash flow statement. 2022 Following approval from Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board  (FIRB), on 29 March 2022 we completed the acquisition of Rincon  Mining Pty Limited, the owner of a lithium project in Argentina. Total  cash consideration was US$825 million. In determining whether  Rincon’s set of activities is a business, we have assessed whether it has  inputs and substantive processes which together significantly  contribute to the ability to create outputs. Based on this assessment, we  have concluded that Rincon does not meet the definition of a business  as defined by IFRS 3 ''Business Combinations'' and therefore no  goodwill has been recorded. The transaction has therefore been treated  as an asset purchase with US$822 million of capitalised exploration and  evaluation recorded for the principal economic resource. The balance of  total consideration has been allocated to property, plant & equipment  and other assets/liabilities. For the Group cash flow statement we  determined that, since Rincon constitutes a group of companies, it is  appropriate to present the cash outflow as “Acquisitions of subsidiaries,  joint ventures and associates” rather than as separate asset purchases  even though it did not meet the definition of a business combination. On 31 August 2022 we made a US$25 million investment in McEwen  Copper Inc. through our copper leaching technology venture, Nuton.  We accounted for our holding in McEwen Copper Inc as an investment  in associate, given our representation on the board. On 16 December 2022 we acquired the remaining 49% share of  Turquoise Hill Resources for expected consideration of US$3.2 billion,  inclusive of transaction costs. This transaction was not classified as a  business combination as it related to the purchase of non-controlling  interests in an entity already consolidated as a subsidiary. Accordingly  the transaction did not result in the remeasurement of assets or liabilities  and has been accounted for in the statement of equity as an adjustment  to non-controlling interests and retained earnings. At 31 December 2022 consideration paid amounted to US$2,961 million  (including US$33 million of transaction costs, with further transaction  costs of US$41 million expected to be paid in 2023). Certain  shareholders exercised their right to dissent to the transaction. In  accordance with the terms of the circular, those dissenting shareholders  have received initial consideration of C$34.4 per share, with final  consideration depending on the outcome and timing of dissent  proceedings. We have included within other provisions (note 36) US$211  million for additional consideration to be paid to the dissenting  shareholders representing the difference between their initial  consideration and C$43 per share paid to all other shareholders.  2021 On 18 November 2021, we announced that we had completed the  acquisition of the 40% share in the Diavik Diamond Mine in the  Northwest Territories of Canada held by Dominion Diamond Mines,  becoming the sole owner as a result. The transaction did not meet the  definition of a business combination and therefore the incremental  assets and liabilities were treated as an asset purchase. Prior to  purchase, we recognised our existing 60% share of assets, revenues  and expenses, with liabilities recognised according to its contractual  obligations, and a corresponding 40% receivable or contingent asset  representing the co-owner’s share where applicable. Receivables  relating to the co-owner’s share were de-recognised and treated as part  of the net purchase consideration on completion. Disposals Recognition and measurement If a group of assets and liabilities (“Disposal group”) is sold the carrying  value of the disposal group is de-recognised with the difference  between the carrying amount and the consideration received  recognised in the income statement. Certain amounts previously  recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of the entity  disposed of may be recycled to the income statement. The cash  proceeds of disposals are included within “Investing activities” in the  cash flow statement.  As summarised in note 4, we sold our Roughrider uranium undeveloped  project on 17 October 2022 for consideration of US$150 million (US$80  million in cash and US$70 million in shares of Uranium Energy Corp).  There were no other material disposals in 2022, 2021 or 2020.   6  Revenue by destination and product Recognition and measurement  We recognise sales revenue related to the transfer of promised goods or  services when control of the goods or services passes to the customer.   The amount of revenue recognised reflects the consideration to which  the Group is or expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods  or services. Sales revenue is recognised on individual sales when control transfers to  the customer. In most instances, control passes and sales revenue is  recognised when the product is delivered to the vessel or vehicle on  which it will be transported once loaded, the destination port or the  customer’s premises. There may be circumstances when judgment is  required based on the five indicators of control below:  – The customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership and  has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the  remaining benefits from, the good or service.  – The customer has a present obligation to pay in accordance with the  terms of the sales contract. For shipments under the Incoterms Cost,  Insurance and Freight (CIF)/Carriage Paid to (CPT)/Cost and Freight  (CFR) this is generally when the ship is loaded, at which time the  obligation for payment is for both product and freight.  – The customer has accepted the asset. Sales revenue may be  subject to adjustment if the product specification does not conform  to the terms specified in the sales contract but this does not impact  the passing of control. Assay and specification adjustments have  been immaterial historically.  – The customer has legal title to the asset. The Group usually retains  legal title until payment is received for credit risk purposes only. – The customer has physical possession of the asset. This indicator  may be less important as the customer may obtain control of an  asset prior to obtaining physical possession, which may be the case  for goods in transit.  169 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Financial statements  ===== PAGE 172 ===== 6  Revenue by destination and product continued Revenue is principally derived from sale of commodities. We sell the  majority of our products on CFR or CIF Incoterms. This means that the  Group is responsible (acts as principal) for providing shipping services  and, in some instances, insurance after the date at which control of  goods passes to the customer at the loading port. The Group, therefore,  has separate performance obligations for freight and insurance services  that are provided solely to facilitate sale of the products it produces.   Other Incoterms commonly used by the Group are Free on Board (FOB),  where the Group has no responsibility for freight or insurance once  control of the goods has passed at the loading port, and Delivered at  Place (DAP), where control of the goods passes when the product is  delivered to the agreed destination. For these Incoterms there is only  one performance obligation, being the provision of product at the point  where control passes.  Within each sales contract, each unit of product shipped is a separate  performance obligation. Revenue is generally recognised at the  contracted price as this reflects the stand-alone selling price. Sales  revenue excludes any applicable sales taxes. Sales of copper  concentrate are stated net of the treatment and refining charges which  will be required to convert it to an end product.  The Group’s products are sold to customers under contracts which vary  in tenure and pricing mechanisms, including some volumes sold on the  spot market. Pricing for iron ore is on a range of terms, the majority being  either monthly or quarterly average pricing mechanisms, with a smaller  proportion of iron ore volumes being sold on the spot market. Certain of the Group’s products may be provisionally priced at the date  revenue is recognised and a provisional invoice issued; however,  substantially all iron ore and aluminium sales are reflected at final prices  in the results for the period. Provisionally priced receivables are  subsequently measured at fair value through the income statement  under IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” as described in note 24. The final  selling price for all provisionally priced products is based on the price for  the quotational period stipulated in the contract. Final prices for copper  concentrate are normally determined between 30 and 120 days after  delivery to the customer. The change in value of the provisionally priced  receivable is based on relevant forward market prices and is included in  sales revenue; refer to “Other revenue” within the sales by product  disclosure below. Revenues from the sale of significant by-products, such as gold, are  included in sales revenue. Third-party commodity swap arrangements  principally for delivery and receipt of smelter-grade alumina are offset  within operating costs. Sundry revenue incidental to the main revenue- generating activities of the operations is treated as a credit to operating  costs.  Typically, the Group has a right to payment before or at the point that  control of the goods passes including a right, where applicable, to  payment for provisionally priced products and unperformed freight and  insurance services. Cash received before control passes is recognised  as a contract liability. The amount of consideration does not contain a  significant financing component as payment terms are less than one  year. We have a number of long-term contracts to supply products to  customers in future periods. Generally, revenue is recognised on an  invoice basis, as each unit sold is a separate performance obligation and  therefore the right to consideration from a customer corresponds  directly with our performance completed to date.  We do not disclose sales revenue from freight and insurance services  separately as we do not consider that this is necessary in order to  understand the impact of economic factors on the Group. Our Chief  Executive, the chief operating decision maker as defined under IFRS 8  “Operating Segments”, does not review information specifically relating  to these sources of revenue in order to evaluate the performance of  business segments and Group information on these sources of revenue  is not provided externally. We do provide information on freight revenue  for the iron ore and bauxite businesses on pages 37 and 39 to help  stakeholders understand FOB operating margins for those products. We apply the practical expedient in paragraph 121 of IFRS 15 and do not  include information on the transaction price allocated to performance  obligations that are unsatisfied.

Exploration expenditure relates to the initial search for deposits with economic potential. Expenditure on exploration activity undertaken by the  Group is not capitalised. Evaluation expenditure relates to a detailed assessment of deposits or other projects (including smelter and refinery projects) that have been  identified as having economic potential. These costs are also expensed until the business case for the project is sufficiently advanced. For greenfield  projects, expensing typically continues to a later phase of study compared with brownfield expansions.

(b) We capitalise interest based on the Group or relevant subsidiary’s cost of borrowing, refer to note 13,  or at the rate of project-specific debt (where applicable). 10  Taxation  Recognition and measurement  The taxation charge contains both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the tax expected to be payable on the taxable income for the year calculated using rates applicable during the year. It includes  adjustments for tax expected to be payable or recoverable in respect of previous periods. Where the amount of tax payable or recoverable is  uncertain, we establish provisions based on either: the Group’s judgment of the most likely amount of the liability or recovery; or, when there is a wide  range of possible outcomes, a probability weighted average approach. Deferred tax is calculated in accordance with IAS 12 using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Where  the recognition of an asset and liability from a single transaction gives rise to equal and off-setting temporary differences, we apply the Initial  Recognition Exemption allowed by IAS 12, and consequently recognise neither a deferred tax asset nor a deferred tax liability in respect of these  temporary differences. Primarily this occurs with new lease arrangements and changes in closure cost estimates for assets in operation. Under the  amendment to IAS 12, deferred tax assets and liabilities will be required to be recognised in respect of such temporary differences (Refer to note 40  on page 222). Financial statements continued Notes to the 2022 financial statements Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 172  ===== PAGE 175 ===== Other relevant judgments - Uncertain tax positions The Group operates across a large number of jurisdictions and is subject to review and challenge by local tax authorities on a range of tax  matters.  Where the amount of tax payable or recoverable is uncertain, whether due to the local tax authority challenge or due to uncertainty  regarding the appropriate treatment, judgment is required to assess the probability that the adopted treatment will be accepted.  In  accordance with IFRIC 23, if it is not probable that the treatment will be accepted, the Group accounts for uncertain tax provisions for all  matters worldwide based on the Group’s judgment of the most likely amount of the liability or recovery, or where there is a wide range of  possible outcomes, using a probability weighted average approach. Uncertain tax provisions include any related interest and penalties. In July 2022 we reached agreement with the Australian Tax Office (ATO) on all tax matters in dispute. We also reached agreement with the  Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore in relation to transfer pricing for the same historical years (2010 to 2021).

Consequently, the tax effect on the profit from equity accounted units is included as a separate reconciling item in  this prima facie tax reconciliation.  (b) As a UK headquartered and listed Group, the reconciliation of expected tax on accounting profit to tax charge uses the UK corporation tax rate to calculate the prima facie tax payable. Rio Tinto  is also listed in Australia, and the reconciliation includes the impact of the higher tax rate in Australia where a significant proportion of the Group's profits are currently earned. The impact of other  tax rates applicable outside the UK and Australia is also included. The weighted average statutory corporate tax rate on profit before tax is approximately 29% (2021: 29% 2020: 30%).  (c) The recognition of previously unrecognised deferred tax assets relates primarily to Oyu Tolgoi where ongoing progress towards sustainable underground production in the current and  comparative periods reduces the risk of tax losses that expire if not recovered against taxable profits within eight years. In the comparative period to 31 December 2021 the recognition of  previously unrecognised deferred tax assets also included the recognition of prior year deferred tax assets in our Australian Aluminium business. (d) The write-down of previously recognised deferred tax assets relates to deferred tax assets of our US businesses. The enactment of the US Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 in August included a  new Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) regime which applies a minimum tax rate of 15% on accounting profits. As a result of the new legislation, which does not give relief for some  Federal deferred tax assets, the deferred tax assets previously recognised have been written down. In the comparative period to 31 December 2020 the write-down of previously recognised  deferred tax assets relates primarily to the partial de-recognition of deferred tax assets in our Australian Aluminium business. (e) In 2021, the utilisation of previously unrecognised deferred tax assets arose due to higher than forecast profits in the year at Oyu Tolgoi.  (f) Unrecognised current year operating losses include tax losses around the Group for which no tax benefit is currently recognised due to uncertainty regarding whether suitable taxable profits will  be earned in future to obtain value for the tax losses.  In 2020, unrecognised current year operating losses included allowable foreign exchange losses in the UK for which no tax benefit was  recognised.  (g) In the year to 31 December 2022, adjustments in respect of prior periods includes amounts related to the settlement of all tax disputes with the Australian Tax Office for the years 2010 to 2021. (h) Other items include non-deductible costs and withholding taxes, and various adjustments to provisions for taxation, the most significant of which relate to transfer pricing matters, including  issues previously under discussion with the Australian Tax Office.  (i) The presentation of the prima facie tax reconciliation comparatives has been revised. We have allocated the tax relating to exclusions (historically shown separately in the financial statements) to  the appropriate tax line items above. The presentation of the impact of including profit after tax from equity accounted units within the Group profit before tax has also been revised as described  in note (a) above. 173 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Financial statements  ===== PAGE 176 ===== 10  Taxation continued 2022  US$m 2021 US$m 2020 US$m Tax on fair value movements: – Cash flow hedge fair value gains 21  62  3  Tax (charge)/credit on re-measurement gains/(losses) on pension and post-retirement healthcare plans (123)  (305)  112 Deferred tax relating to components of other comprehensive income for the year (note 15) (102)  (243)  115 Future tax developments We continue to monitor the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Two Pillar Solution to address the Tax Challenges  Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy.

The recoverable amount  has been assessed by reference to FVLCD, in line with the policy set out in note 4 and classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. FVLCD was  determined by estimating cash flows until the end of the life-of-mine plan including anticipated expansions. In arriving at FVLCD, a post-tax discount  rate of 8.6% (2021: 8.6%) has been applied to the post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms.  The key assumptions to which the calculation of FVLCD for Richards Bay Minerals is most sensitive and the corresponding change in FVLCD are set  out below: 2022  US$m 5% increase in the titanium slag price 207 1% increase in the discount rate applied to post-tax cash flows (140)  10% strengthening of the South African rand 263  Other assumptions include the long-term pig iron and zircon prices and operating costs. Future selling prices and operating costs have been  estimated in line with the policy set out in note 4. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds the carrying value when  each of these sensitivities is applied while keeping all other assumptions constant.  12  Intangible assets  Recognition and measurement - Intangible assets Purchased intangible assets are initially recorded at cost. Finite-life intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight line  or units of production basis, as appropriate. Intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite lives and intangible assets that are not yet ready for  use are not amortised; they are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential  impairment. The majority of our intangible assets relate to capitalised exploration and evaluation spend and contract-based water rights. The water rights were  acquired with Alcan in Canada. Exploration and evaluation Evaluation expenditure relates to a detailed assessment of deposits or other projects (including smelter and refinery projects) that have been  identified as having economic potential. Capitalisation of evaluation expenditure commences when there is a high degree of confidence that the  Group will determine that a project is commercially viable; that is, the project will provide a satisfactory return relative to its perceived risks, and  therefore it is considered probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group. The Group’s view is that a high degree of confidence is  greater than “more likely than not” (that is, greater than 50% certainty) and less than “virtually certain” (that is, less than 90% certainty). Assessing whether there is a high degree of confidence that the Group will ultimately determine that an evaluation project is commercially viable  requires judgment and consideration of all relevant factors such as the nature and objective of the project; the project’s current stage; project  timeline; current estimates of the project’s net present value, including sensitivity analyses for the key assumptions; and the main risks of the project.  Development expenditure incurred prior to the decision to proceed is subject to the same criteria for capitalisation, being a high degree of  confidence that the Group will ultimately determine that a project is commercially viable.  In some cases, undeveloped projects are regarded as successors to orebodies, smelters or refineries currently in production. Where this is the case,  it is intended that these will be developed and go into production when the current source of ore is exhausted or when existing smelters or refineries  are closed. Ore reserves may be declared for an undeveloped mining project before its commercial viability has been fully determined. Evaluation  costs may continue to be capitalised in between declaration of ore reserves and approval to mine as further work is undertaken in order to refine the  development case to maximise the project’s returns. Contract-based intangible assets  The majority of the carrying value of our contract-based intangible assets relate to water rights in the Quebec region. These contribute to the  efficiency and cost effectiveness of our aluminium operations as they enable us to generate electricity from hydropower stations.  Other relevant judgments - Assessment of indefinite-lived water rights in Quebec, Canada We continue to judge the water rights in Quebec to have an indefinite life because we expect the contractual rights to contribute to the  efficiency and cost effectiveness of our operations for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the rights are not subject to amortisation but are  tested annually for impairment. We have no other indefinite-lived assets. The remaining carrying value of the water rights of US$1,693 million (included in contract based assets) as at 31 December 2022  (31 December 2021: US$1,796 million) relates wholly to the Quebec smelters cash-generating unit (CGU). The Quebec smelters CGU was  tested for impairment by reference to FVLCD using discounted cash flows. The recoverable amount of the Quebec smelters is classified as  level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. In arriving at FVLCD, post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms have been estimated over the  expected useful economic lives of the underlying smelting assets and discounted using a real post-tax discount rate of 6.6% (2021: 6.6%). The recoverable amounts were determined to be significantly in excess of carrying value, and there are no reasonably possible changes in  key assumptions that would cause the remaining water rights to be impaired.

The cost of  property, plant and equipment includes, where applicable, the estimated close-down and restoration costs associated with the asset.  Property, plant and equipment includes right of use assets arising from leasing arrangements, shown separately from owned and leasehold assets.  Once an undeveloped mining project has been determined as commercially viable and approval to mine has been given, expenditure other than that  on land, buildings, plant, equipment and capital work in progress is capitalised under “Mining properties and leases” together with any amount  transferred from “Exploration and evaluation”.  Costs incurred while commissioning new assets, in the period before they are capable of operating in the manner intended by management, are  capitalised unless associated with pre-production revenue (refer to page 155). Development costs incurred after the commencement of production  are capitalised to the extent they are expected to give rise to a future economic benefit. Interest on borrowings related to construction or  development projects is capitalised, at the rate payable on project-specific debt if applicable or at the Group or subsidiary’s cost of borrowing if not. This is performed until the point when substantially all the activities that are necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use are complete. It  may be appropriate to use a subsidiary’s cost of borrowing when the debt was negotiated based on the financing requirements of that subsidiary.  Depreciation of non-current assets  Property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life, or over the remaining life of the mine, smelter or refinery if that is shorter and there is  no reasonable alternative use for the asset by the Group. Depreciation commences when an asset is available for use. Assets within operations for  which production is not expected to fluctuate significantly from one year to another or which have a physical life shorter than the related mine are  depreciated on a straight line basis as follows:  Type of Property, plant and  equipment Land and Buildings Plant and equipment Capital work in progress Land Buildings Power assets Other plant and equipment Depreciation profile Not depreciated 5 to 50 years See Power note below 3 to 50 years Not depreciated The useful lives and residual values for material assets and categories of assets are reviewed annually and changes are reflected prospectively.  Units of production basis  For mining properties and leases and certain mining equipment, consumption of the economic benefits of the asset is linked to production. Except as  noted below, these assets are depreciated on the units of production basis.  In applying the units of production method, depreciation is normally calculated based on production in the period as a percentage of total expected  production in current and future periods based on ore reserves and, for some mines, other mineral resources. Other mineral resources may be  included in the calculations of total expected production in limited circumstances where there are very large areas of contiguous mineralisation, for  which the economic viability is not sensitive to likely variations in grade, as may be the case for certain iron ore, bauxite and industrial mineral  deposits, and where there is a high degree of confidence that the other mineral resources can be extracted economically. This would be the case  when the other mineral resources do not yet have the status of ore reserves merely because the necessary detailed evaluation work has not yet been  performed and the responsible technical personnel agree that inclusion of a proportion of measured and indicated resources in the calculation of  total expected production is appropriate based on historical reserve conversion rates.   The required level of confidence is unlikely to exist for minerals that are typically found in low-grade ore (as compared with the above), such as  copper or gold. In these cases, specific areas of mineralisation have to be evaluated in detail before their economic status can be predicted with  confidence.  Sometimes the calculation of depreciation for infrastructure assets, primarily rail and port, considers measured and indicated resources. This is  because the asset can benefit current and future mines. The measured and indicated resource may relate to mines which are currently in production  or to mines where there is a high degree of confidence that they will be brought into production in the future. The quantum of mineral resources is  determined taking into account future capital costs as required by the JORC code. The depreciation calculation, however, applies to current mines  only and does not take into account future development costs for mines which are not yet in production. Measured and indicated resources are  currently incorporated into depreciation calculations in the Group’s Australian iron ore business.  Key judgment - Estimation of asset lives The useful lives of the major assets of a cash-generating unit are often dependent on the life of the orebody to which they relate. Where this is  the case, the lives of mining properties, and their associated refineries, concentrators and other long-lived processing equipment are  generally limited to the expected life of the orebody. The life of the orebody, in turn, is estimated on the basis of the life-of-mine plan. Where  the major assets of a cash-generating unit are not dependent on the life of a related orebody, management applies judgment in estimating the  remaining service potential of long-lived assets. Factors affecting the remaining service potential of smelters include, for example, smelter  technology and electricity purchase contracts when power is not sourced from the Group, or in some cases from local governments  permitting electricity generation from hydro-power stations.  Financial statements continued Notes to the 2022 financial statements Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 178  ===== PAGE 181 ===== Impact of climate change on our business - Estimation of asset lives We expect there to be a higher demand for copper, aluminium, lithium and high grade iron ore in order to meet demand for the minerals  required to transition to a low carbon economic environment, consistent with the climate change commitments of the Paris Agreement. We  expect this to exceed new supply to the market and therefore increase prices.  Under the Aspirational Leadership scenario, the economic cut- off grade for our Ore Reserves is expected to be lower; in effect we would mine a greater volume of material before the mines are depleted.   We cannot quantify the difference this would make without undue cost as it would require revised mine plans, but for property, plant and  equipment this increased volume of material would reduce the depreciation charge for assets that use the ‘Units of production’ depreciation  method. Straight line basis  Assets within operations for which production is not expected to fluctuate significantly from one year to another or which have a physical life shorter  than the related mine are depreciated on a straight line basis. Deferred stripping  In open pit mining operations, overburden and other waste materials must be removed to access ore from which minerals can be extracted  economically. The process of removing overburden and waste materials is referred to as stripping. During the development of a mine (or, in some  instances, pit; see below), before production commences, stripping costs related to a component of an orebody are capitalised as part of the cost of  construction of the mine (or pit). These are then amortised over the life of the mine (or pit) on a units of production basis.  Where a mine operates several open pits that are regarded as separate operations for the purpose of mine planning, initial stripping costs are  accounted for separately by reference to the ore from each separate pit. If, however, the pits are highly integrated for the purpose of mine planning,  the second and subsequent pits are regarded as extensions of the first pit in accounting for stripping costs. In such cases, the initial stripping (such as  overburden and other waste removal) of the second and subsequent pits is considered to be production phase stripping (see below).  Key judgment - Deferral of stripping costs We apply judgment as to whether multiple pits at a mine are considered separate or integrated operations. This determines whether the  stripping activities of a pit are classified as pre-production or production phase stripping and, therefore, the amortisation base for those costs.  The analysis depends on each mine’s specific circumstances and requires judgment: another mining company could make a different  judgment even when the fact pattern appears to be similar.  The following factors would point towards the initial stripping costs for the individual pits being accounted for separately:  – If mining of the second and subsequent pits is conducted consecutively following that of the first pit, rather than concurrently;  – If separate investment decisions are made to develop each pit, rather than a single investment decision being made at the outset;  – If the pits are operated as separate units in terms of mine planning and the sequencing of overburden removal and ore mining, rather than  as an integrated unit;  – If expenditures for additional infrastructure to support the second and subsequent pits are relatively large; and  – If the pits extract ore from separate and distinct orebodies, rather than from a single orebody.  If the designs of the second and subsequent pits are significantly influenced by opportunities to optimise output from several pits combined,  including the co-treatment or blending of the output from the pits, then this would point to treatment as an integrated operation for the  purposes of accounting for initial stripping costs. The relative importance of each of the above factors is considered in each case.  In order for production phase stripping costs to qualify for capitalisation as a stripping activity asset, three criteria must be met:  – It must be probable that there will be an economic benefit in a future accounting period because the stripping activity has improved access  to the orebody;  – It must be possible to identify the “component” of the orebody for which access has been improved; and  – It must be possible to reliably measure the costs that relate to the stripping activity.  A “component” is a specific section of the orebody that is made more accessible by the stripping activity. It will typically be a subset of the  larger orebody that is distinguished by a separate useful economic life (for example, a pushback).  179 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Financial statements  ===== PAGE 182 ===== 13  Property, plant and equipment continued Recognition and measurement Phase Development Phase Production Phase Stripping activity  Overburden and other waste removal during  the development of a mine before production  commences. Production phase stripping can give access to two benefits: the extraction of ore in the  current period and improved access to ore which will be extracted in future periods. Period of benefit After commissioning of the mine. Future periods after first phase is complete. Current and future benefit are  indistinguishable. Capitalised to mining  properties and leases in  property, plant and  equipment During the development of a mine, stripping  costs relating to a component of an orebody  are capitalised as part of the cost of  construction of the mine. It may be the case that subsequent phases of  stripping will access additional ore and that  these subsequent phases are only possible  after the first phase has taken place. Where  applicable, the Group considers this on a  mine-by-mine basis. Generally, the only ore  attributed to the stripping activity asset for  the purposes of calculating the life-of- component ratio is the ore to be extracted  from the originally identified component. Stripping costs for the component are  deferred to the extent that the current period  ratio exceeds the life-of-component ratio. Allocation to inventory Not applicable Not applicable The stripping cost is allocated to inventory  based on a relevant production measure  using a life-of-component strip ratio.  The  ratio divides the tonnage of waste mined for  the component for the period either by the  quantity of ore mined for the component or  by the quantity of minerals contained in the  ore mined for the component. In some  operations, the quantity of ore is a more  appropriate basis for allocating costs,  particularly when there are significant by- products. Component A “component” is a specific section of the orebody that is made more accessible by the stripping activity.  It will typically be a subset of the  larger orebody that is distinguished by a separate useful economic life (for example, a pushback). Life-of-component ratio The life-of-component ratios are based on the ore reserves of the mine (and for some mines, other mineral resources) and the annual mine  plan; they are a function of the mine design and, therefore, changes to that design will generally result in changes to the ratios. Changes in  other technical or economic parameters that impact the ore reserves (and for some mines, other mineral resources) may also have an impact  on the life-of-component ratios even if they do not affect the mine design.

Impact of climate change on our business - Useful economic lives of our power generating assets The Group has committed to reducing scope 1 and scope 2 carbon emissions by 50% relative to our 2018 baseline by 2030 and achieving net  zero emission across our operations by 2050. We expect to spend US$7.5 billion between 2022 and 2030. Transitioning electricity from  principally fossil fuel-based power generating assets to principally renewables is critical to achieving that goal. The carrying value of power  generating assets is set out in the table below. The weighted average remaining useful economic life of plant and equipment for fossil fuel- based power generating assets is 13 years (2021:14 years). Given the technical limitations of intermittent renewable energy generation and  energy storage systems, and our need for reliable baseload electricity, we expect our current generation assets will be integral to those needs  for the foreseeable future. We are investing in research and development and evaluating new market options that may overcome these  technical challenges. Should pathways for eliminating fossil fuel power generating assets be identified we may need to accelerate  depreciation or impair the assets; however, at this present moment the requirement for fossil fuel powered back-up means that early  retirement of the assets is not expected. 2022 2021 Net book value Land and buildings US$m Plant and equipment US$m Land and buildings US$m Plant and equipment US$m Fossil fuels   25   882   26   952  Renewables(a)   198   2,352   195   1,541  (a) The increase of US$0.8 billion in renewable plant & equipment, is attributable to the Kemano T2 hydropower project, following the completion of a second tunnel to supply water to the  Kemano hydropower facility in 2022.

Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of terms and conditions. Right of use assets are depreciated on a straight  line basis over the life of the lease, taking into account any extensions that are likely to be enacted.  14  Close-down and restoration provisions Recognition and measurement The Group has provisions for close-down and restoration costs which  include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, the removal of  residual materials and the remediation of disturbed areas for mines and  certain refineries and smelters. The obligation may occur during  development or during the production phase of a facility. These  provisions are based on all regulatory requirements and any other  commitments made to stakeholders. The provision excludes the impact  of future disturbance which is planned to occur during the life of mine,  so that it represents only incurred disturbance as at the balance sheet  date.  Closure provisions are not made for those operations that have no  known restrictions on their lives as the closure dates cannot be reliably  estimated, instead a contingent liability is disclosed, refer to note 37.  This applies primarily to certain Canadian smelters which have  indefinite-lived water rights from local governments permitting  electricity generation from hydro-power stations.  Close-down and restoration costs are a normal consequence of mining  or production, and the majority of close-down and restoration  expenditure is incurred in the years following closure of the mine,  refinery or smelter. Although the ultimate cost to be incurred is  uncertain, the Group’s businesses estimate their costs using current  restoration standards, techniques and expected climate conditions. The  costs are estimated on the basis of a closure plan, and are reviewed at  each reporting period during the life of the operation to reflect known  developments. The estimates are also subject to formal review, with  appropriate external support, at regular intervals.   The timing of closure and the rehabilitation plans for the site can be  uncertain and dependent upon future capital allocation decisions which  involve estimation of future economic circumstances and business  cases. In such circumstances, the closure provision is estimated using  probability weighting of the different remediation and closure scenarios.  The initial close-down and restoration provision is capitalised within  “Property, plant and equipment”. Subsequent movements in the close- down and restoration provisions for ongoing operations are treated as  an adjustment to cost within “Property, plant and equipment”. This  includes those resulting from new disturbance related to expansions or  other activities qualifying for capitalisation; updated cost estimates;  changes to the estimated lives of operations; changes to the timing of  closure activities; and revisions to discount rates.  Changes in closure provisions relating to closed operations are  charged/credited to “Net operating costs” in the income statement.  Where rehabilitation is conducted systematically over the life of the  operation, rather than at the time of closure, provision is made for the  estimated outstanding continuous rehabilitation work at each balance  sheet date and the cost is charged to the income statement.  The closure provision is represented by forecast future underlying cash  flows expressed in real terms at the balance sheet date. These are  discounted for the time value of money based on a long-term view of  low-risk market yields which includes a review of historic trends plus  risks and opportunities for which future cash flows have not been  adjusted, namely potential improvements in closure practices between  the reporting date and the point at which rehabilitation spend takes  place. The real-terms discount rate used is 1.5% (2021: 1.5%) which is  applied to all locations since we expect to meet closure cash flows  principally from US dollar revenues and financing, with activities co- ordinated by the Group's central closure team. To roll forward those real-terms cash flows between periods, we identify  local rates of inflation based on Producer Price Inflation (PPI) indices and  together with the real-terms discount rate unwind the discount through  the line “amortisation of discount”, shown within “Finance items” in the  income statement.  This nominal rate for cost escalation in the current  financial year is estimated at the start of each half-year and applied  systematically for six months.  At the end of each half-year we update  the underlying cash flows for the latest estimate of experienced inflation  for the current financial year and record this as “changes to existing  provisions”.  For operating sites this adjustment usually results in a  corresponding adjustment to Property, Plant and Equipment and for  closed and fully impaired sites the adjustment is charged or credited to  the income statement. In some cases, our subsidiaries make a contribution to trust funds in  order to meet or reimburse future environmental and decommissioning  costs. Amounts due for reimbursement from trust funds are not offset  against the corresponding closure provision unless payments into the  fund have the effect of passing the closure obligation to the trust.  Environmental costs result from environmental damage that was not a  necessary consequence of operations, and may include remediation,  compensation and penalties. Provision is made for the estimated  present value of such costs at the balance sheet date. These costs are  charged to “Net operating costs”, except for the unwinding of the  discount which is shown within “Finance items”.  Remediation procedures may commence soon after the time the  disturbance, remediation process and estimated remediation costs  become known, but can continue for many years depending on the  nature of the disturbance and the remediation techniques used.

These are included within “Receivables and other assets” on the balance sheet. Key judgment - Close-down, restoration and environmental obligations We use our judgment and experience to determine the potential scope of closure rehabilitation work required to meet the Group’s legal,  statutory and constructive obligations, and any other commitments made to stakeholders, and the options and techniques available to meet  those obligations and estimate the associated costs and the likely timing of those costs. Significant judgment is also required to determine  both the costs associated with that work and the other assumptions used to calculate the provision. External experts support the cost  estimation process where appropriate but there remains significant estimation uncertainty.  The key judgment in applying this accounting policy is determining when an estimate is sufficiently reliable to make or adjust a closure  provision. Adjustments are made to provisions when the range of possible outcomes becomes sufficiently narrow to permit reliable estimation.  Depending on the materiality of the change, adjustments may require review and endorsement by the Group’s Closure Steering Committee  before the provision is updated. Cost estimates are updated throughout the life of the operation; generally cost estimates must comply with the Group’s Capital Project  Framework once the operation is ten years from expected closure. This means, for example, that where an Order of Magnitude (OoM) study is  required for closure it must be of the same standard as an OoM study for a new mine, smelter or refinery. As at 31 December 2022, there are 16  operations with remaining lives of under 10 years before taking into account unapproved extensions. The largest closure study finalised during  2022 related to the Ranger Uranium mine operated by Energy Resources of Australia.  In 2021 the preliminary information from this study  resulted in an increase to closure liabilities of US$510 million; the finalisation of the study in 2022 did not result in a further significant change. In some cases, the closure study may indicate that monitoring and, potentially, remediation will be required indefinitely - for example, ground  water treatment. In these cases the underlying cash flows for the provision may be restricted to a period for which the costs can be reliably  estimated, which on average is around 30 years. Where an alternative commercial arrangement to meet our obligations can be predicted with  confidence, this period may be shorter. Closure provisions are not made for those operations that have no known restrictions on their lives as the closure dates cannot be reliably  estimated. This applies primarily to certain Canadian smelters which have indefinite-lived water rights or power agreements for renewable  power sources with local governments, refer to note 37. 183 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Financial statements  ===== PAGE 186 ===== 2022  US$m 2021 US$m Undiscounted close-down and environmental restoration obligations 20,433  18,775  Impact of discounting (4,674)  (4,233)  Present closure obligation 15,759  14,542  Attributable to: Operating sites 11,598  10,727  Non-operating sites 4,161  3,815  Total 15,759  14,542  Projected cash spend for the undiscounted close-down and restoration/environmental clean-up provision Undiscounted close-down and environmental restoration cash flows <1 year US$m 1-3 years US$m 3-5 years US$m > 5 years US$m Total US$m At 31 December 2022 1,142  1,986  1,426  15,879  20,433  At 31 December 2021 1,023  1,652  1,680  14,420  18,775  Remaining lives of operations and infrastructure range from one to over 50 years with an average for all sites, weighted by present closure obligation,  of around 15 years. Although the ultimate cost to be incurred is uncertain, the Group’s businesses estimate their respective costs based on current  restoration standards, techniques and expected climate conditions.  Key estimate - Close-down, restoration and environmental obligations The most significant assumptions and estimates used in calculating the provision are: – Closure timeframes. The weighted average remaining lives of operations is shown below. Some expenditure may be incurred before  closure while the operation as a whole is in production. – The length of any post-closure monitoring period. This will depend on the specific site requirements and the availability of alternative  commercial arrangements; some expenditure can continue into perpetuity. The Rio Tinto Kennecott closure and environmental  remediation provision includes an allowance for ongoing monitoring and remediation costs, including ground water treatment, of  approximately US$0.7 billion. – The probability weighting of possible closure scenarios. The most significant impact of probability weighting is at the Pilbara operations  (Iron Ore) relating to infrastructure and incorporates the expectation that some infrastructure will be retained by the relevant State  authorities post closure. The assignment of probabilities to this scenario reduces the closure provision by US$0.7 billion. – Appropriate sources on which to base the calculation of the discount rate. The discount rate by nature is subjective and therefore  sensitivities are shown below for how the provision balance, which at 31 December 2022 was US$15.8 billion, would change if discounted  at alternative discount rates.  There is significant estimation uncertainty in the calculation of the provision and cost estimates can vary in response to many factors including: – Changes to the relevant legal or local/national government requirements and any other commitments made to stakeholders; – Review of remediation and relinquishment options; – Additional remediation requirements identified during the rehabilitation; – The emergence of new restoration techniques; – Precipitation rates and climate change; – Change in the expected closure date; and – Change in the discount rate. Experience gained at other mine or production sites may also change expected methods or costs of closure, although elements of the  restoration and rehabilitation can be unique to each site. Generally, there is relatively limited restoration and rehabilitation activity and  historical precedent elsewhere in the Group, or in the industry as a whole, against which to benchmark cost estimates. The expected timing of expenditure can also change for other reasons, for example because of changes to expectations relating to ore  reserves and mineral resources, production rates, renewal of operating licences or economic conditions.  Changes in closure estimates at the Group’s ongoing operations could result in a material adjustment to assets and liabilities in the next 12  months and would also impact the depreciation and the unwind of discount in future years. Changes to closure cost estimates for closed operations, and changes to environmental cost estimates at any operation, could cause a  material adjustment to the income statement and closure liability. We do not consider that there is significant risk of a change in estimates for  these liabilities causing a material adjustment to the income statement in the next 12 months.  Any new environmental incidents may require a  material provision but cannot be predicted.  Project specific risks are embedded within the cash flows which are based on a central case estimate of closure activities assuming that the  obligation is fulfilled by the Group. These cash flows are then discounted using a discount rate specific to the class of obligations.  Financial statements continued Notes to the 2022 financial statements 14  Close-down and restoration provisions continued Analysis of close-down and restoration/environmental clean-up provisions As at 31 December Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 184  ===== PAGE 187 ===== Provisions of US$15,759 million (2021: US$14,542 million) for close-down and restoration costs and environmental clean-up obligations are based on  risk-adjusted cash flows. We re-assessed the closure discount rate in the current year and continue to consider that real rate of 1.5%, applied  prospectively since 30 September 2020, is the most appropriate rate to use. This assumption is based on the currency in which we plan to fund the  closures and our expectation of long-term interest rate and exchange rate parity in the locations of our operations. Prior to 30 September 2020 and  in recent years, the close-down and restoration costs and environmental clean-up obligations were discounted at a real rate of 2.0%. To illustrate the  sensitivity of the provision to discounting, if the discount rate at 31 December 2022 were decreased to 1.0% then the provision would be US$1.5  billion higher, of which approximately US$1.4 billion would be capitalised within “Property, plant and equipment” at operating sites and US$0.1 billion  would be charged to the income statement for non-operating and fully impaired sites. If the discount rate were increased to 3.0% then the provision  would be US$3.0 billion lower, of which approximately US$2.7 billion would result in a decrease within “Property, plant and equipment” at operating  sites and US$0.3 billion would be credited to the income statement for non-operating and fully impaired sites.  Impact of climate change on our business - Close-down, restoration and environmental cost The underlying costs for closure have been estimated with varying degrees of precision based on a function of the age of the underlying asset  and proximity to closure. For assets within ten years of closure, closure plans and cost estimates are supported by detailed studies which are  refined as the closure date approaches. These closure studies consider climate change and plan for resilience to expected climate conditions  with a particular focus on precipitation rates. For new developments, consideration of climate change and ultimate closure conditions are an  important part of the approval process. For longer-lived assets, closure provisions are typically based on conceptual level studies that are  refreshed at least every five years; these are evolving to incorporate greater consideration of forecast climate conditions at closure.

In developing low-carbon  solutions for our mobile fleet, this may include electrification of the vehicles during the mine life. The forecast cash flows for the heavy mobile equipment in the closure cost estimate are based on  existing fuel sources. The cost incurred during closure could reduce if these activities are powered by renewable energy. (b) Long-term water management relates to the post-closure treatment of water due to acid rock drainage and other environmental commitments and is an area of research and development focus  for our Closure team. The cost of this water processing can continue for many years after the bulk earthworks and demolition activities have completed and are therefore exposed to long-term  climate change. This could materially affect rates of precipitation and therefore change the volume of water requiring processing. It is not currently possible to forecast accurately the impact this  could have on the closure provision as some of our locations could experience drier conditions whereas others could experience greater rainfall. A further consideration relates to the alternative  commercial use for the processed water, which could support ultimate transfer of these costs to a third party. (c) Indirect costs, owners' costs and contingency include adjustments to the underlying cash flows to align the closure provision with a central-case estimate. This excludes allowances for  quantitative estimation uncertainties, which are allocated to the underlying cost driver and presented within the respective cost categories above.

These risk factors include the risk of expiry of losses prior to utilisation, the impact of other legislation or tax  regimes, such as minimum taxes, and consideration of factors that lead to the generation of losses or other deferred tax assets. IAS 12 requires us to consider whether taxable profits will be available against which deferred tax assets may be utilised. The enactment in the  US of the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) in the Inflation Reduction Act 2022 has resulted in a position where, whilst the utilisation  of Federal deferred tax assets will reduce our Federal corporate tax liabilities, the CAMT legislation will result in the application of the minimum  tax on the adjusted financial statement income. Accordingly, whilst our latest projections demonstrate that sufficient taxable profits will be  earned in future periods to utilise the existing Federal deferred tax assets, the utilisation of those Federal deferred tax assets is not expected to  yield any significant economic benefit due to the application of the minimum tax and the deferred tax assets have been written down. 2022  US$m 2021 US$m At 1 January – deferred tax (liabilities)/assets (128)  146  Adjustment on currency translation 124  61  (Charged)/credited to the income statement (735)  (114)  (Charged)/credited to statement of comprehensive income(a) (102)  (243)  Other movements(b) 6  22  At 31 December – deferred tax liabilities (835)  (128)  Comprising: – deferred tax assets(c)(d) 2,766  3,375  – deferred tax liabilities(e) (3,601)  (3,503)  Financial statements continued Notes to the 2022 financial statements Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 186  ===== PAGE 189 ===== Deferred tax balances for which there is a right of offset within the same tax jurisdiction are presented net on the face of the balance sheet as  permitted by IAS 12.

(b) “Other movements” include deferred tax relating to tax payable recognised by subsidiary holding companies on the profits of the equity accounted units to which it relates.  (c) US$868 million (2021: US$1,152 million) of recognised deferred tax assets are subject to expiry if not recovered within certain time limits as specified in local tax legislation and investment  agreements. US$nil (2021: US$nil) of those recognised assets would expire within one year if not used, US$105 million (2021: US$71 million) would expire within one to five years, and US$763  million (2021: US$1,081 million) would expire in more than five years. (d) Recognised and unrecognised deferred tax assets are shown in the table below and totalled US$7,850 million at 31 December 2022 (2021: US$7,024 million). Of this total, US$2,766 million has  been recognised as deferred tax assets (2021: US$3,375 million), leaving US$5,084 million (2021: US$3,649 million) unrecognised, as recovery is not considered probable.  (e) Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and joint ventures totalling US$2,730 million (2021: US$2,081 million) where the Group is able to control the  timing of the remittance and it is probable that there will be no remittance in the foreseeable future. If these earnings were remitted, tax of US$140 million (2021: US$103 million) would be payable.  The recognised amounts in the table below do not include deferred tax assets that have been netted off against deferred tax liabilities.

(b) Deferred tax assets in Mongolia include US$73 million (2021: US$108 million) from tax losses that expire if not recovered against taxable profits within eight years. Tax losses have been  calculated in accordance with the tax stability provisions of the Oyu Tolgoi Investment Agreement and Mongolian laws. The interpretation of the stabilised tax laws by the Mongolian Tax  Authority has been, and is expected to continue to be, subject to dispute. Changes to agreements or their interpretation could have a material impact on the amount and period of recovery of  deferred tax assets.  (c) US$1,490 million (2021: US$705 million) of the unrecognised assets relate to realised or unrealised capital losses, the recovery of which depends on the existence of capital gains in future years.  There are time limits, the shortest of which is one year, for the recovery of US$473 million of the unrecognised assets (2021: US$356 million). 187 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Financial statements  ===== PAGE 190 ===== 16  Inventories  Recognition and measurement  Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value, primarily on a weighted average cost basis. Third-party production purchased  for our own use that is ordinarily interchangeable in accordance with IAS 2 is valued on the same basis, jointly with our own production. Average  costs are calculated by reference to the cost levels experienced in the relevant month together with those in opening inventory.  The cost of raw materials and consumable stores is the purchase price. The cost of partly-processed and saleable products is generally the cost of  production, including directly attributable labour costs, materials and contractor expenses, the depreciation of assets used in production and  production overheads.   Work in progress includes ore stockpiles and other partly processed material. Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted and is available for  further processing. If there is significant uncertainty as to if and when the stockpiled ore will be processed, the cost of such ore is expensed as mined.  If the ore will not be processed within 12 months after the balance sheet date, it is included within non-current assets and net realisable value is  calculated on a discounted cash flow basis. Quantities of stockpiled ore are assessed primarily through surveys and assays. Certain estimates,  including expected metal recoveries, are calculated using available industry, engineering and scientific data, and are periodically reassessed, taking  into account technical analysis and historical performance.  2022  US$m 2021 US$m Raw materials and purchased components   1,235   870  Consumable stores   1,327   1,142  Work in progress   2,086   1,736  Finished goods and goods for resale   1,768   1,884  Total inventories   6,416   5,632  Comprising: Expected to be used within one year   6,213   5,436  Expected to be used after more than one year   203   196  Total inventories   6,416   5,632  During 2022, the Group recognised a net inventory write-off of US$55 million (2021:US$7 million write-back.) This included inventory write-offs of  US$75 million (2021: US$18 million) offset by a write-back of previously written down inventory due to an increase in realisable values amounting to  US$20 million (2021: US$25 million).  At 31 December 2022, US$850 million (2021: US$754 million) of inventories were pledged as security for liabilities. 17  Receivables and other assets  Recognition and measurement  The business model for our receivables is primarily “hold to collect” (where assets are held in order to collect contractual cash flows) except those  subject to our factoring programme.  For our financial instruments, including receivables, held under a hold to collect business model and which have  cash flows that meet the solely payments of principal and interest (‘SPPI’) criteria these are recognised at amortised cost. Where our receivables do  not meet the SPPI criteria, for example our provisionally priced receivables, these are measured at fair value through profit or loss with subsequent  fair value gains or losses are taken to the income statement.  A portion of our receivables participate in receivable factoring and letter of credit discounting programmes. We take advantage of these programmes  to balance  the impact of extended payment terms requested by our customers with our own working capital objectives or where the acceleration of  cash receipts is financially beneficial compared with the cost of borrowing at the operation. We have applied our judgment when considering the  business model test as defined in IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and conclude that the business model for receivables under the letter of credit  discounting programme has not changed. We continue to hold these receivables at amortised cost because the sale of the letter of credit is made  close to maturity of receivables and the discounting costs are immaterial. The business model for receivables subject to the global factoring  programme does not meet the “hold to collect” model and therefore are classified as “held for sale”. This means the receivables are held at fair value  each reporting period with the remeasurements being recorded in the income statement. Where a portion of our factored receivable is subject to  recourse, that part of the receivable is not derecognised from the balance sheet and the cash received in advance is classified as a borrowing. The  cash flows relating to the borrowing are shown in financing cash flows.  At 31 December 2022 US$457 million (2021: US$504 million) of receivables  participated in the global factoring programme and US$430 million (2021: US$418 million) participated in the letter of credit discounting programme.

We apply the “simplified approach” to  trade receivables and receivables relating to net investment in finance leases and a “general approach” to all other financial assets.  (b) At 31 December 2022, other receivables include US$329 million (2021: US$388 million) related to Energy Resources of Australia Ltd (ERA's) deposit held in a trust fund which is controlled by the  Government of Australia. ERA are entitled to reimbursement from the fund once specific phases of rehabilitation relating to the Ranger Project are completed. The fund is outside of the scope of  IFRS 9  “Financial Instruments”. (c) These prepayments will be charged to Group operating costs as tolling services are rendered and product processing occurs.  (d) There is no material element of receivables and other assets that is interest-bearing or financing in nature. The fair value of current trade and other receivables and the majority of amounts  classified as non-current trade and other receivables approximates to their carrying value.

The team establishes credit  limits for all of our customers. Where customers are rated by an independent credit rating agency, these ratings are used as a guide to set credit  limits. Where there are no independent credit ratings available, we assess the credit quality of the customer through a credit rating model and  assign appropriate credit limits. The Commercial team monitors outstanding customer receivables regularly and highlights any credit concerns  to senior management. Receivables to high risk customers are often secured by letters of credit or other forms of credit enhancement. The expected credit loss on our trade receivable portfolio is insignificant. 18  Trade and other payables  Non-current 2022  US$m Current 2022  US$m Total 2022  US$m Non-current 2021 US$m Adjusted(b) Current 2021 US$m Adjusted(b) Total 2021 US$m Adjusted(b) Trade payables   3   3,269   3,272   —   3,410   3,410  Other financial payables   225   1,083   1,308   254   909   1,163  Other payables   63   131   194   82   110   192  Deferred income(a)(b)   114   333   447   205   404   609  Accruals   —   1,611   1,611   42   1,488   1,530  Employee entitlements   —   878   878   —   798   798  Royalties and mining taxes   3   644   647   2   574   576  Amounts owed to equity accounted units   196   98   294   213   40   253  Total   604   8,047   8,651   798   7,733   8,531  (a) Deferred income includes contract liabilities of US$345 million (2021: US$383 million).  (b) Deferred income includes government grants deferred. This was previously disclosed separately; however, it is no longer material.  The fair value of trade payables and financial instruments within other financial payables approximates their carrying value.  The Group participates in supply chain finance arrangements whereby vendors may elect to receive early payment of their invoice from a third-party  bank by factoring their receivable from Rio Tinto. These arrangements do not modify the terms of the original liability with respect to either  counterparty terms, settlement date or amount due. Utilisation of the early settlement facility is voluntary and at the vendors' discretion on an invoice- by-invoice basis. Financial liabilities subject to supply chain finance therefore continue to be classified as trade payables with the cash outflows  showing in operating cash flows. At 31 December 2022, trade payables included US$819 million (2021: US$782 million) subject to early settlement  election by vendors.  189 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Financial statements  ===== PAGE 192 ===== Our capital and liquidity Our overriding objective when managing capital and liquidity is to safeguard the business as a going concern. Capital is allocated in a consistent and  disciplined manner. Essential capital remains our priority for capital allocation. It includes sustaining capital to ensure the integrity of our assets, high- returning replacement projects and decarbonisation investment. This is followed by ordinary dividends within our well-established returns policy. We  then test investment in compelling growth projects against debt management and additional cash returns to shareholders.  Our Board and senior management regularly review the capital structure and liquidity of the Group. They take into account our strategic priorities, the  economic and business conditions, and any identified investment opportunities, along with the expected returns to shareholders. We expect total  cash returns to shareholders over the longer term to be in a range of 40–60% of underlying earnings in aggregate through the commodity cycle.  We consider various financial metrics when managing our risk, including net debt, gearing, the overall level of borrowings and their maturity profile,  liquidity levels, total capital, future cash flows, underlying EBITDA and interest cover ratios.  Our total capital as at 31 December was: Total capital Note 2022  US$m 2021 US$m Equity attributable to owners of Rio Tinto (see Group balance sheet)   50,175   51,432  Equity attributable to non-controlling interests (see Group balance sheet)   2,099   5,158  Net debt/(cash) 19   4,188   (1,576)  Total capital   56,462   55,014  We have access to various forms of financing including our US Shelf Programme, European Debt Issuance Programme, Commercial Paper and credit  facilities.  In 2022, we exercised one of our options to extend the maturity of our US$7.5 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility. The facility now matures  in November 2027. The facility remained undrawn throughout the year. Our credit ratings, as provided by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s investor services, as at 31 December were:  2022 2021 Long-term rating A/A2 A/A2 Short-term rating A-1/P-1 A-1/P-1 Outlook Stable/Stable Stable/Stable Our unified credit status is maintained through cross guarantees, which mean the contractual obligations of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited are  automatically guaranteed by the other.  In the table below, we summarise the maturity profile of our financial liabilities on our balance sheet based on contractual undiscounted payments.  When the amount payable is not fixed, the amount disclosed is determined by reference to the conditions existing at the end of the reporting period.  This will therefore not necessarily agree with the amounts disclosed as the carrying value. 2022 2021 Financial liability analysis At 31 December  (Outflows)/Inflows Within 1 year or on demand US$m Between 1 and 2 years US$m Between  2 and 5  years US$m After 5 years US$m Total US$m Within 1 year or on demand US$m Between 1 and 2 years US$m Between  2 and 5  years US$m After 5 years US$m Total US$m Non-derivative financial liabilities Trade and other financial payables(a)   (5,971)   (37)   (57)   (329)  (6,394)   (5,766)   (31)   (72)   (406)   (6,275)  Expected lease liability payments   (329)   (235)   (344)   (606)   (1,514)   (361)   (266)   (400)   (704)   (1,731)  Borrowings before swaps   (937)   (1,425)   (1,839)  (7,389)  (11,590)   (827)   (746)   (2,519)   (8,112)  (12,204)  Expected future interest payments(a)   (668)   (603)   (1,468)   (3,141)  (5,880)   (511)   (486)   (1,313)   (3,485)   (5,795)  Other financial liabilities   —   —   —   —   —   (20)   —   —   —   (20)  Derivative financial liabilities(b) Derivatives related to net debt – net settled   (92)   (106)   (47)   (8)   (253)   —   —   —   —   —  Derivatives related to net debt – gross settled(a) – gross inflows   37   481   72   651   1,241   41   41   560   756   1,398  – gross outflows   (69)   (615)   (102)   (875)   (1,661)   (44)   (44)   (658)   (909)   (1,655)  Derivatives not related to net debt – net settled   (78)   (60)   (129)   (77)   (344)   (186)   (77)   (53)   (37)   (353)  Derivatives not related to net debt – gross settled: – gross inflows   71   —   —   —   71   1,302   —   —   —   1,302  – gross outflows   (71)   —   —   —   (71)   (1,340)   —   —   —   (1,340)  Total   (8,107)  (2,600)   (3,914)  (11,774)  (26,395)   (7,712)   (1,609)   (4,455)  (12,897)  (26,673)  (a) The interest payable at year end was removed from trade and other financial payables and is shown within expected future interest payments and derivatives related to net debt.

Our policy is to  predominantly borrow in US dollars at floating interest rates, either directly or through the use of derivatives, as:  – the majority of our sales are in US dollars,  – historically a lower cost of borrowing has been observed from maintaining a floating rate exposure  – historically there is a correlation between interest rates and commodity prices.  For bonds with fixed interest rates, we generally enter into interest rate swaps to convert them to floating rates. The tenor of the interest rate swaps is  sometimes shorter than the tenor of the bond which means we remain exposed to long-term fixed-rate funding. As interest rate swaps mature, new  medium dated swaps are generally transacted to maintain this floating rate exposure; however, we may elect to maintain fixed interest rates in certain  circumstances. We have designated the swaps to be in fair value hedge relationships with the corresponding period of future interest payments of the respective  debt. Where we borrow non-US denominated debt, we enter into cross currency interest rate swaps to convert the principal and fixed interest coupon to a  US dollar notional with a US dollar interest coupon.  The characteristics and carrying value of the Group’s borrowings are summarised below: Borrowings at 31 December  Carrying  value 2022 US$m Carrying  value 2021 US$m Nominal  value of  hedged item 2022 US$m Nominal  value of  hedged item 2021 US$m Weighted average  interest rate  after swaps (where  applicable) Swap  maturity  (where  applicable) Rio Tinto Finance plc Euro Bonds 2.875% due 2024(a)(c)   429   497  546 546 3 month LIBOR +1.64% 2024 Rio Tinto Finance (USA) Limited Bonds 7.125% 2028(a)   807   934  750 750 3 month LIBOR +3.27% 2028 Alcan Inc.

(b) In 2022, we transitioned the swaps associated to this bond from LIBOR + 5.43% to SOFR + 5.69%.  (c) Rio Tinto has a US$10 billion (2021: US$10 billion) European Debt Issuance Programme against which the cumulative amount utilised was US$1.0 billion equivalent at 31 December 2022 (2021:  US$1.1 billion). The carrying value of these bonds after hedge accounting adjustments amounted to US$1.0 billion (2021: US$1.2 billion) in aggregate.  (d) We applied cash flow hedge accounting to this bond and the corresponding cross currency interest rate swap. The hedge is fully effective as the notional amount, maturity, payment and reset  dates match. Since 2019, we swapped the resulting fixed US dollar annual interest coupon payments to floating rates. Fair value hedge accounting has been applied to this relationship in  addition to the pre-existing cash flow hedge. (e) On 2 November 2022 our interest rate swap, which converted our fixed coupon interest payments on this bond to 3 month LIBOR +3.79%, matured. Given market conditions, further interest rate  swaps were not transacted. (f) These borrowings relate to the Oyu Tolgoi LLC project finance facility. The project finance facility provides for interest-only payments for the first five years from 2016 followed by minimum  repayments according to a stepped amortisation schedule for the remaining life of the facility. The due dates stated represent the final repayment date. The interest rates stated are pre- completion and will increase by 1% post-completion.  (g) The Group’s borrowings of US$11.1 billion (2021: US$12.2 billion) include US$4.0 billion (2021: US$4.4 billion) of subsidiary entity borrowings that are subject to various financial and general  covenants with which the respective borrowers were in compliance as at 31 December 2022.  Financial statements continued Notes to the 2022 financial statements Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 192  ===== PAGE 195 ===== Update on interest rate benchmark reform We adopted, in prior periods, Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), IFRS 7 Financial Instruments:  Disclosures (IFRS 7), IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (IFRS 4) and IFRS 16 Leases (IFRS 16). The amendments address the financial reporting impact from  reform of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other benchmark interest rates (collectively “IBOR reform”). We have taken relevant  practical reliefs from certain requirements relating to changes in the basis for determining contractual cash flows of financial assets, financial  liabilities and hedge accounting, described below.   Our hedging arrangements impacted by the reform of USD LIBOR are part of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Fallbacks  Protocol, which provides a global standardised mechanism for replacement of the current benchmark. During the year we transitioned the swaps,  which hedge the Alcan Inc. Debentures, from the LIBOR to SOFR interest benchmark rates (refer to the table above) and applied the relief that  preserved the existing hedge accounting.  At 31 December 2022, we have interest rate risk exposure including US$4.8 billion nominal values of  fixed-rate borrowings swapped to US dollar rates in fair value hedge relationships impacted by the reform. We expect the application of the reliefs to  result in continuation of our pre-existing hedge accounting upon amendment of designated arrangements in response to the replacement of USD  LIBOR which will occur immediately after 30 June 2023. In October 2022, as part of the extension of the term loan facility of Richards Bay Minerals, we transitioned from the LIBOR benchmark to an interest  rate based on the SOFR reference rate. Our other arrangements which reference IBOR benchmarks and extend beyond 2022 include: third-party  borrowings relating to the Oyu Tolgoi LLC project finance, shareholder loan facilities and certain commercial contracts. The amendments to IFRS 9  require that we account for a change in the basis for determining the cash flows of a financial asset or a financial liability measured at amortised cost,  by updating their respective effective interest rates as required by the IBOR reform. As a result of the applicable IFRS 9 reliefs, we expect that no  material gain or loss will arise from these updates. The accessible revolving lines of credit, which have been extended for a further one year in 2022,  now refer to the SOFR and SONIA benchmark rates. 21  Leases  Recognition and measurement IFRS 16 “Leases” applies to the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. Certain leases are exempt from the standard,  including leases to explore for or use minerals, oil, natural gas and similar non-regenerative resources. We apply the scope exemptions in paragraphs  3(e) and 4 of IFRS 16 and do not apply IFRS 16 to leases of any assets which would otherwise fall within the scope of IAS 38 “Intangible Assets”.  A significant proportion by value of our lease arrangements relate to dry bulk vessels and office properties. Other leases include land and non-mining  rights, warehouses, ports, equipment and vehicles.   We recognise all lease liabilities and corresponding right of use assets on balance sheet, with the exception of short-term (12 months or fewer) and  low value leases, where payments are expensed as incurred. Lease liabilities are recorded at the present value of: fixed payments; variable lease  payments that depend on an index or rate; amounts payable under residual value guarantees; and extension options expected to be exercised.  Where a lease contains an extension option which we can exercise without negotiation, lease payments for the extension period are included in the  liability if we are reasonably certain that we will exercise the option. Variable lease payments not dependent on an index or rate are excluded from the  calculation of lease liabilities at initial recognition. Payments are discounted at the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee, unless the interest rate  implicit in the lease can be readily determined. For lease agreements relating to vessels, ports and properties, non-lease components are excluded  from the projection of future lease payments and recorded separately within operating costs as services are being provided. The lease liability is  measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The right of use asset arising from a lease arrangement at initial recognition reflects  the lease liability, initial direct costs, lease payments made before the commencement date of the lease, and capitalised provision for dismantling and  restoration, less any lease incentives.  We recognise depreciation on right of use assets and interest on lease liabilities in the income statement over the lease term. Repayments of lease  liabilities are separated into a principal portion (presented within financing activities) and an interest portion (which the Group presents in operating  activities) in the cash flow statement. Payments made before the commencement date are included within financing activities unless they in  substance represent investing cash flows, for example where pre-commencement cash flows are significant relative to aggregate cash flows of the  leasing arrangement. Lessee arrangements  We have made the following payments associated with leases: Description of payment 2022 US$m 2021 US$m Included within Principal lease payments   374  358 Cash flows from financing activities Interest payments on leases   47  48 Cash flows from operating activities Payments for short-term leases   465  502 Net operating costs Payments for variable lease components   50  34 Net operating costs Payments for low value leases (>12 months in duration)   1  2 Net operating costs Total lease payments   937   944  193 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Financial statements  ===== PAGE 196 ===== 21  Leases continued Lease liabilities  The maturity profile of lease liabilities recognised at the balance sheet date is: 2022  US$m 2021 US$m Lease liabilities Due within 1 year 329  361  Between 1 and 3 years 388  440  Between 3 and 5 years 191  226  More than 5 years 606  704  Total undiscounted cash payments expected to be made 1,514  1,731  Effect of discounting (314)  (368)  Present value of minimum lease payments 1,200  1,363  Current lease liability per the balance sheet 292  324  Non-current lease liability per the balance sheet 908  1,039  Total lease liability 1,200  1,363  At 31 December 2022, commitments for leases not yet commenced were US$481 million (2021: US$476 million); commitments relating to short-term  leases which had already commenced at 31 December 2022 were US$132 million (2021: US$165 million).   22  Cash and cash equivalents Recognition and measurement For the purpose of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents covers: cash on hand, deposits held with banks, and short-term, highly liquid  investments (mainly money market funds) that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of  changes in value.

Of this balance,  US$268 million (2021: US$165 million) could be used to repay subsidiaries’ third-party borrowings.  There are also restrictions on a further US$576 million (2021: US$981 million) of cash and cash equivalents, the majority of which is held by partially  owned subsidiaries and is not available for use in the wider Group due to legal and contractual restrictions currently in place. Of this balance US$336  million (2021: US$752 million) could be used to repay these subsidiaries’ third-party borrowings.  Credit risk related to cash and cash equivalents  Our Treasury team manages credit risk from our investing activities in accordance with credit risk framework which sets the risk appetite. We make  investments of surplus funds only with approved investment grade (BBB- and above) counterparties who have been assigned specific credit limits.  The limits are set to minimise the concentration of credit risk and therefore mitigate the potential for financial loss through counterparty failure.  At 31 December 2022 we held US$850 million (2021: US$4,520 million) of reverse repurchase agreements, measured at amortised cost and reported  within cash and cash equivalents as they are highly liquid products maturing within three months. We accepted collateral of investment grade quality  in respect of these reverse repurchase agreements, with a fair value of US$892 million as at 31 December 2022 (2021: US$4,638 million). Collateral is  not recognised on our balance sheet and if the counterparty were to default we would be able to sell it.

Agreements with derivative counterparties are based  on the International Swaps and Derivatives Association master netting agreements that do not meet the criteria for offsetting, but allow for the related  amounts to be set-off in certain circumstances. During the year, there were no material amounts offset in the balance sheet.  24  Financial instruments and risk management  Recognition and measurement We classify our financial assets into those held at amortised cost and those to be measured  at fair value either through the profit and loss (FVTPL) or  through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) based on the business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash  flows.  Classification of financial asset Amortised cost Fair value through profit and loss Fair value through other  comprehensive income Recognition and measurement At initial recognition, trade receivables  that do not have a significant financing  component are recognised at their  transaction price. Other financial assets  are initially recognised at fair value plus  related transaction costs. The asset is initially recognised at fair  value with transaction costs immediately  expensed to the income statement.  The asset is initially recognised at fair  value.   Subsequent measurement Amortised cost using the effective  interest method.  Fair value movements are recognised in  the income statement. Fair value gains or losses on revaluation  of such equity investments, including  any foreign exchange component, are  recognised in other comprehensive  income. Dividends are recognised in the  income statement when the right to  receive payment is established.  Derecognition Any gain or loss on de-recognition or  modification of a financial asset held at  amortised cost is recognised in the  income statement. Not applicable. When the equity investment is  derecognised, there is no  reclassification of fair value gains or  losses previously recognised in other  comprehensive income to the income  statement. Borrowings and other financial liabilities (including trade payables but excluding derivative liabilities) are recognised initially at fair value, net of  transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. 195 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Financial statements  ===== PAGE 198 ===== 24  Financial instruments and risk management continued Financial risk management objectives Our financial risk management objectives are:  – to have in place a robust capital structure to manage the organisation through the commodity cycle; and  – to allow our financial exposures, mainly commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rates, to, in general, float with the market.  Our Treasury and Commercial teams manage the following key economic risks generated from our operations: – Capital and Liquidity risk  – Credit risk – Interest rate risk – Commodity price risk – Foreign exchange risk These teams operate under a strong control environment, within approved limits. (i) Capital and liquidity risk Our capital and liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may not be able to settle or meet our obligations as they fall due. Refer to Our capital  and liquidity section on page 190. (ii) Credit risk  Credit risk is the risk that our customers, or institutions that we invest in, are unable to meet their contractual obligations. We are exposed to credit  risk in our operating activities (primarily from customer trade receivables); and from our investing activities that include government securities  (primarily US Government), corporate and asset-backed securities, reverse re-purchase agreements, money market funds, and balances with  banks and financial institutions. Refer to note 17 Receivables and other assets, note 22 Cash and cash equivalents and note 23 Other financial  assets and liabilities for an understanding of the size of balance. (iii) Interest rate risk Our interest rate management policy is generally to borrow and invest at floating interest rates. After the impact of hedging, 77% (2021: 85%) of our  borrowings (including leases) were at floating rates. To understand how we manage interest rate risk refer to note 20. Sensitivity to interest rate changes  Based on our floating rate financial instruments outstanding at 31 December 2022, the effect on our net earnings of a 100 basis point increase in US  dollar LIBOR or SOFR (where applicable) interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would be an expense of US$26 million (2021: income of  US$13 million). This reflects the net debt position in 2022 compared to a net cash position in prior year.  We are also exposed to interest rate volatility within shareholders’ equity. This is because we have designated some cross currency interest rate  swaps to be in a cash flow hedge relationship with our 2029 GBP loan. As we receive fixed GBP interest and pay fixed USD interest any change in the  GBP interest rate or the USD interest rate will have an impact on the fair value of the derivative within shareholders’ equity. With all factors remaining  constant, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates in each of the currencies in isolation would impact equity, before tax, by a charge of US$35  million (2021: US$55 million charge) for sterling and a credit of US$48 million (2021: US$65 million credit) for US dollars. A 100 basis point decrease  would have broadly the same impact in the opposite direction. (iv) Commodity price risk  Our broad commodity base means our exposure to commodity prices is diversified.  Our normal policy is to sell our products at prevailing market  prices. For certain physical commodity transactions for which the price was fixed at the contract date, we enter into derivatives to achieve the  prevailing market prices at the point of revenue recognition. We do not generally consider that using derivatives to fix commodity prices would  provide a long-term benefit to our shareholders. Exceptions to this rule are subject to limits, and to defined market risk tolerances and internal controls. Substantially all iron ore and aluminium sales are reflected at final prices at each reporting period. Final prices for copper concentrate, however, are  normally determined between 30 and 180 days after delivery to our customer. At 31 December 2022, we had 83 million pounds of copper sales (31 December 2021: 81 million pounds), that were provisionally priced at US 380  cents per pound (2021: US 440 cents per pound). The final price of these sales will be determined during the first half of 2023. A 10% change in the  price of copper realised on the provisionally priced sales, all other factors held constant, would increase or reduce net earnings by US$19 million  (2021: US$26 million).  Power costs represent a significant portion of costs in our aluminium business and therefore we are exposed to fluctuations in power prices. To mitigate our exposure to changes in the relationship between aluminium prices and power prices, we have a number of electricity purchase  contracts which are directly linked to the daily official LME cash ask price for high grade aluminium (“LME price”) and to the US Midwest Transaction  Premium (“Midwest premium”).  In accordance with IFRS 9, we apply hedge accounting to two embedded derivatives within our power contracts. The embedded derivatives  (notional aluminium forward sales) have been designated as the hedging instrument. The forecast aluminium sales, priced using the LME price and  the Midwest premium, represent the hedged item.  The hedging ratio is 1:1, as the quantity of sales designated as being hedged matches the notional amount of the hedging instrument. The hedging  instrument’s notional amount, expressed in equivalent metric tonnes of aluminium, is derived from our expected electricity consumption under the  power contracts as well as other relevant contract parameters.  Financial statements continued Notes to the 2022 financial statements Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 196  ===== PAGE 199 ===== When we designate such embedded derivatives as the hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge, we recognise the effective portion of the change in  the fair value of the hedging instrument in other comprehensive income, and it is accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve. The amount that is  recognised in other comprehensive income is limited to the lesser of the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the  cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged item, in absolute terms. On realisation of the hedges, realised amounts are reclassified from  reserves to consolidated sales revenue in the income statement.  We recognise any ineffectiveness relating to the hedging relationship immediately in the income statement.  Sources of ineffectiveness include: differences in the timing of the cash flows between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, non-zero initial  fair value of the hedging instrument, the existence of a cap on the Midwest premium in the hedging instrument and counterparty credit risk.  We held the following notional aluminium forward sales contracts embedded in the power contracts:  At 31 December 2022 Total Within 1 year Between 1 and  5 years Between 5 and  10 years After 10 years Notional amount (in tonnes)   501,498   72,812   289,868   138,818   —  Notional amount (in US$ millions)   1,216   166   697   353   —  Average hedged rate (in US$ per tonne)   2,425   2,282   2,404   2,542   —  At 31 December 2021 Total Within 1 year Between 1  and 5 years Between 5  and 10 years After 10 years Notional amount (in tonnes)   573,653   72,555   289,867   211,231   —  Notional amount (in US$ millions)   1,377   162   683   532   —  Average hedged rate (in US$ per tonne)   2,401   2,234   2,355   2,520   —  The impact on our financial statements of these hedging instruments and hedging items are: Aluminium embedded derivatives separated from  the power contract (Hedging instrument)(a) Highly probable forecast aluminium sales (Hedged item) Nominal US$m Carrying  amount US$m Change in fair  value in the  period US$m Cash flow  hedge  reserve(b) US$m Change in fair  value in the period US$m Total hedging  losses  recognised in reserves US$m Hedge  ineffective- ness in the  period gains/ (losses)(c) US$m Losses  reclassified  from reserves  to income  statement(d) US$m 2022   1,216   (189)   (119)   (87)   133   (110)   (9)   34  2021   1,377   (124)   (201)   (11)   300   (211)   10   17  (a) Aluminium embedded derivatives (forward contracts and options) are contained within certain aluminium smelter electricity purchase contracts.

The table below summarises the impact that changes in aluminium market  prices have on aluminium forward and option contracts embedded in power supply agreements outstanding at 31 December 2022.

The majority of our sales are denominated in the US dollar.  Our operating costs are influenced by the currencies of those countries where our mines and processing plants are located, and by those currencies  in which we buy imported equipment and services. The US dollar, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar are the most important currencies  influencing our costs. In any particular year, currency fluctuations may have a significant impact on our financial results. A strengthening of the US  dollar against the currencies in which our costs are partly denominated has a positive effect on our underlying earnings. However, a strengthening of  the US dollar reduces the value of non-US dollar denominated net assets, and therefore total equity.  In most cases our debt and other financial assets and liabilities, including intragroup balances, is held in the functional currency of the relevant  subsidiary. There are instances where these balances are held in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary. This means  we recognise exchange gains and losses in our income statement (except where they can be taken to equity) as these balances are translated into  the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary. Our income statement also includes exchange gains and losses arising on US dollar net debt and  intragroup balances. On consolidation, these balances are retranslated to our US dollar presentation currency and there is a corresponding and  offsetting exchange difference recognised directly in the currency translation reserve. There is no impact on total equity.  Under normal market conditions, we do not consider that active currency hedging of transactions would provide long-term benefits to shareholders.  We review our exposure on a regular basis and will undertake hedging if deemed appropriate. We may deem currency protection measures  appropriate in specific commercial circumstances. Capital expenditures and other significant financial items such as acquisitions, disposals, tax and  dividend cash flows may be economically hedged.  Sensitivities  The table below shows the estimated retranslation effect on financial assets and financial liabilities, including intragroup balances, of a 10%  strengthening in the closing exchange rate of the US dollar against significant currencies. We deem 10% to be the annual exchange rate  movement that is reasonably probable (on an annual basis over the long run) for any of our significant currencies and therefore an appropriate  representation.

We translate the impact of these on net earnings into US  dollars at the exchange rates on which the sensitivities are based. The impact to net earnings associated with a 10% weakening of a particular  currency, shown above, is broadly offset within equity through movements in the currency translation reserve and therefore generally has no impact  on our net assets. The offsetting currency translation movement is not shown in the table above. The impact is expressed in terms of the effect on net  earnings and equity, assuming that each exchange rate moves in isolation. The sensitivities are based on financial assets and financial liabilities held  at 31 December 2022, where balances are not denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary or joint operation, and exclude financial  assets and liabilities held by equity accounted units. These balances will not remain constant throughout 2023, and therefore the  information should  be used with care.

(e) Investments in equity shares and funds include US$153 million (31 December 2021: US$98 million) of equity shares, not held for trading, where we have irrevocably elected to present fair value  gains and losses on revaluation in other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The election is made at an individual investment level. (f) Other investments, including loans, covers: cash deposits in rehabilitation funds, government bonds, managed investment funds and royalty receivables. (g) Trade receivables include provisionally priced invoices. The related revenue is initially based on forward market selling prices for the quotation periods stipulated in the contracts with changes between the provisional price and the final price recorded separately within “Other revenue”. The selling price can be measured reliably for the Group's products, as it operates in active and  freely traded commodity markets. At 31 December 2022, US$1,234 million (31 December 2021: US$1,114 million) of provisionally priced receivables were recognised.  (h) Level 3 derivatives consist of derivatives embedded in electricity purchase contracts linked to the LME, midwest premium and billet premium with terms expiring between 2025 and 2036  (31 December 2021: 2025 and 2036).  (i) Net debt derivatives include interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps. (j) Trade and other financial payables comprise trade payables, other financial payables, accruals and amounts due to equity accounted units within note 18. There were no material transfers between level 1 and level 2, or between level 2 and level 3 in the year ended 31 December 2022 or in the year ended  31 December 2021. 199 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Financial statements  ===== PAGE 202 ===== 24  Financial instruments and risk management continued Valuation techniques and inputs The techniques used to value our more significant fair value assets/(liabilities) categorised under level 2 and level 3 are summarised below: Description Fair Value US$m Valuation technique Significant Inputs Level 2 Interest rate swaps (356) Discounted cash flows Applicable market quoted swap yield curves Credit default spread Cross currency interest rate swaps (334) Discounted cash flows Applicable market quoted swap yield curves Credit default spread Market quoted FX rate Provisionally priced receivables  1,234 Closely related listed product Applicable forward quoted metal price Level 3 Derivatives embedded in electricity contracts (208) Option pricing model LME forward aluminium price Midwest premium and billet premium Royalty receivables 209 Discounted cash flows Forward commodity price Mine production Sensitivity analysis in respect of level 3 financial instruments For assets/(liabilities) classified under level 3, the effect of changing the significant unobservable inputs on carrying value has been calculated using  a movement that we deem to be reasonably probable. To value the long-term aluminium embedded power derivatives, we use unobservable inputs when the term of the derivative extends beyond  observable market prices. Changing the level 3 inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions does not change the fair value significantly,  taking into account the expected remaining term of contracts for either reported period. The fair value of these derivatives is a net liability of US$208  million at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: US$146 million). Impact of climate change on our business - Coal royalty receivables Royalty receivables include amounts arising from our divested coal businesses with a carrying value of US$209 million (31 December 2021:  US$136 million). These are classified as “Other investments, including loans” within note 23. The fair values are determined using level 3  unobservable inputs. These royalty receivables include US$81 million from forecast production beyond 2030. These have not been adjusted  for potential changes in production rates that could occur due to climate change targets impacting the operator.  The main unobservable input is the long-term coal price used over the life of these royalty receivables. A 15% increase in the coal spot price  would result in a US$68 million increase (31 December 2021: US$63 million increase) in the carrying value. A 15% decrease in the coal spot  price would result in a US$18 million decrease (31 December 2021: US$53 million decrease) in the carrying value. We have used a 15%  assumption to calculate our exposure as it represents the annual coal price movement that we deem to be reasonably probable (on an  annual basis over the long run). Fair values disclosure of financial instruments The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of our borrowings including those which are not carried at an amount which  approximates their fair value at 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021. The fair values of our remaining financial instruments approximate their  carrying values because of their short maturity, or because they carry floating rates of interest. 31 December 2022 31 December 2021 Carrying value US$m Fair value US$m Carrying value US$m Fair value US$m Borrowings (including overdrafts) 11,071  11,192  12,168  13,904  Total borrowings with a carrying value of US$6.6 billion (31 December 2021: US$7.3 billion) relate to listed bonds with a fair value of US$6.6 billion  (31 December 2021: US$8.7 billion) and are categorised as level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Borrowings with a carrying value of US$3.8 billion  (31 December 2021: US$4.2 billion) relate to project finance drawn down by Oyu Tolgoi, with a fair value of US$3.9 billion (31 December 2021: US$4.4  billion) using a number of  level 3 valuation inputs. Our remaining borrowings have a fair value measured by discounting estimated cash flows with an  applicable market quoted yield, and are categorised as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

The awards are settled in  equity.  Equity Incentive Plan  Since 2018, all long-term incentive awards have been granted under the  2018 Equity Incentive Plan which allows for awards in the form of  Performance Share Awards (PSA), Management Share Awards (MSA)  and Bonus Deferral Awards (BDA) to be granted. In general, these  awards will be settled in equity, including the dividends accumulated  from date of award to vesting and therefore the awards are accounted  for in accordance with the requirements applying to equity-settled  share-based payment transactions.  Performance Share Awards (Performance Share Plans prior to  2018) Participants are generally assigned shares in settlement of their PSA on  vesting. Therefore the awards are accounted for in accordance with the  requirements applying to equity-settled share-based payment  transactions, including the dividends accumulated from date of award to  vesting.  For the parts of awards with Total Shareholder Return (TSR)  performance conditions, the fair value of the awards is calculated using  a Monte Carlo simulation model taking into account the TSR  performance conditions. One-third of the awards granted up to 2017  (inclusive) are subject to an earnings margin performance target relative  to ten global mining comparators. As a non-market related performance  condition, the  fair value recognised is reviewed at each accounting date  based on the prevailing expected outcome. Forfeitures prior to vesting  are assumed at 5% per annum of outstanding awards (2021: 5% per  annum). For grants made from 2018, the earnings margin performance target  applying to the PSA was removed. Since 2018, only  the TSR  performance conditions set out in the Remuneration Report apply to the  PSA.  Management Share Awards  The vesting of these awards is dependent on service conditions being  met; no performance conditions apply.  The fair value of each award on the day of grant is equal to the share  price on the day of grant. Forfeitures prior to vesting are assumed at 7%  per annum of outstanding awards (2021: 7% per annum).  Bonus Deferral Awards   BDAs provide for the mandatory deferral of 50% of the bonuses for  executive directors and Executive Committee members .  The vesting of these awards is dependent only on service conditions  being met. The fair value of each award on the day of grant is equal to  the share price on the day of grant. Forfeitures prior to vesting are  assumed at 3% per annum of outstanding awards (2021: 3% per annum).  Global Employee Share Plans  The Global Employee Share Plans were introduced in 2012 and re- approved by shareholders in 2021. Under these Plans, the companies  provide a matching share award for each investment share purchased  by a participant. The vesting of matching awards is dependent on  service conditions being met and the continued holding of investment  shares by the participant until vesting. These awards are settled in equity  including the dividends accumulated from date of award to vesting. The  fair value of each matching share on the day of grant is equal to the  share price on the date of purchase less a deduction of 15% for  estimated cancellations (caused by employees withdrawing their  investment shares prior to vesting. Forfeitures prior to vesting are  assumed at 5% per annum of outstanding awards (2021: 5% per annum). The PSA, MSA, BDA and awards under the Global Employee Share Plans  and UK Share Plan together represent 100% (2021: 100%) of the total  IFRS 2 charge for Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited plans in 2022.   Recognition and measurement: These plans are accounted for in accordance with the fair value  recognition provisions of IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment”.  The fair value of the Group’s share plans is recognised as an expense  over the expected vesting period with an offset to retained earnings for  Rio Tinto plc plans and to other reserves for Rio Tinto Limited plans.  The Group uses fair values provided by independent actuaries  calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model.  The terms of each plan are considered at the balance sheet date to  determine whether the plan should be accounted for as equity-settled  or cash-settled. The Group does not operate any material plans as  cash-settled although certain awards can be settled in cash at the  discretion of the directors or where settling awards in equity is  challenging or prohibited by local laws and regulations. The value of  these awards is immaterial.  The Group’s equity-settled share plans are settled either by: the  issuance of shares by the relevant parent company; the purchase of  shares on market; or the use of shares held in treasury. If the cost of  shares acquired to satisfy the plans differs from the expense charged,  the difference is taken to retained earnings or other reserves, as  appropriate.

Some of these plans are defined contribution and some are defined benefit, with assets held in separate trusts, foundations and  similar entities.  Defined benefit pension and post-retirement healthcare plans expose the Group to a number of risks:  Uncertainty in benefit  payments The value of the Group’s liabilities for post-retirement benefits will ultimately depend on the amount of benefits paid out. This in turn will depend on the level of future pay increases, the level of inflation (for those benefits that are subject to some form of  inflation protection) and how long individuals live. Volatility in asset values The Group is exposed to future movements in the values of assets held in pension plans to meet future benefit payments. Uncertainty in cash funding Movements in the values of the obligations or assets may result in the Group being required to provide higher levels of cash funding,  although changes in the level of cash required can often be spread over a number of years. In some countries control over the rate of  cash funding or over the investment policy for pension assets might rest to some extent with a trustee body or other body that is not  under the Group’s direct control. In addition the Group is also exposed to adverse changes in pension regulation. For these reasons the Group has a policy of moving away from defined benefit pension provisions and towards defined contribution arrangements  instead. The defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees are closed to new entrants in almost all countries. For unionised employees, some  plans remain open.   The Group does not usually participate in multi-employer plans in which the risks are shared with other companies using those plans. The Group’s  participation in such plans is immaterial and therefore no detailed disclosures are provided in this note.  Pension plans  The majority of the Group’s defined benefit pension obligations are in Canada, the UK, the US and Switzerland.  In Canada the benefits for salaried staff are generally linked to final average pay and the plans are generally closed to new entrants. Benefits for  unionised employees are reviewed in negotiation with unions and are typically linked either to final average pay or to a flat monetary amount per year  of service. New employees join arrangements which are defined contribution from the Group’s perspective, with any required additional funding  being provided by employees. The plans are subject to the regulatory requirements that apply to Canadian pension plans in the relevant provinces  and territories (predominantly Quebec). Pension Committees are responsible for ensuring that the plans operate in a manner that is compliant with  the relevant regulations. The Pension Committees generally have a number of members appointed by the sponsor and a number appointed by the  plan participants. In some cases, there is also an independent Committee member.  The defined benefit sections of the UK arrangements are linked to final pay. New employees join the defined contribution sections. The plans are  subject to the regulatory requirements that apply to UK pension plans. Trustees are responsible for ensuring that the plans operate in a manner that is  compliant with UK regulations. The trustee board governing the main UK plans has a number of directors appointed by the sponsor, a number  appointed by the plan participants and an independent trustee director.  A defined benefit pension plan is sponsored by the US entities. Benefits for salaried staff are generally linked to final average pay. Benefits for  unionised employees are reviewed in negotiation with unions and are typically a flat monetary amount per year of service. New employees are  admitted to defined contribution plans. A Benefits Governance Committee is responsible for ensuring that the plans are compliant with US  regulations. Members of that Committee are appointed by the sponsor.  The Swiss plan provides benefits linked to final average pay. The Swiss plan is overseen by a Trustee board which is responsible for ensuring that the  plan complies with Swiss regulations. Trustee board members are appointed by the plan sponsor, by employees and by retirees.  Financial statements continued Notes to the 2022 financial statements Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 204  ===== PAGE 207 ===== In Australia, the main arrangements are principally defined contribution in nature but there are sections providing defined benefits linked to final pay,  typically paid in lump sum form. These arrangements are managed by an independent financial institution, who are responsible for ensuring that the  plans are operating in a manner that is compliant with local regulations. We may nominate candidates to be considered for appointment to the  governing board, as may other employers. One third of the board positions are nominated by employers, with the remaining positions being filled by  independent directors and directors nominated by participants.  The Group also operates a number of unfunded defined benefit plans, which are included in the figures below.  Post-retirement healthcare plans  Certain subsidiaries of the Group, mainly in the US and Canada, provide healthcare and life insurance benefits to retired employees and in some  cases to their beneficiaries and covered dependants. Eligibility for coverage is dependent upon certain age and service criteria. These arrangements  are unfunded, and are included in the figures below.  Recognition and measurement: For post-employment defined benefit schemes, in accordance with IAS 19 “Employee Benefits”, local actuaries calculate the fair value of the plan  assets and the present value of the plan obligations using a variety of valuation techniques dependent on the type of asset or liability. The difference  is recognised as an asset or liability in the balance sheet. Where appropriate, the recognition of assets may be restricted to the present value of any amounts the Group expects to recover by way of refunds  from the plan or reductions in future contributions. In determining the extent to which a refund will be available the Group considers whether any third  party, such as a trustee or pension committee, has the power to enhance benefits or to wind up a pension plan without the Group’s consent.  The current service cost, any past service cost and the effect of any curtailment or settlements are recognised in the income statement. The interest  cost less interest income on assets held in the plans is also charged to the income statement. All amounts charged to the income statement in respect  of these plans are included within “Net operating costs” or in “Share of profit after tax of equity accounted units”, as appropriate. Actuarial gains/ losses and returns from assets are recognised in other comprehensive income. The Group’s contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate. These  are included within “Net operating costs” or in “Share of profit after tax of equity accounted units”, as appropriate.  Plan assets  The assets of the pension plans are invested predominantly in a diversified range of equities, bonds and property. Consequently, the funding level of  the pension plans is affected by movements in the level of equity markets and also by movements in interest rates. The Group monitors its exposure  to changes in interest rates and equity markets and also measures its balance sheet pension risk using a value at risk approach. These measures are  considered when deciding whether significant changes in investment strategy are required. Investment strategy reviews are conducted on a periodic basis to determine the optimal investment mix. This is performed while bearing in mind the  risk tolerance of the Group and local sponsor companies, and the views of the Pension Committees and trustee boards who are legally responsible  for the plans’ investments. The assets of the pension plans may also be invested in Qualifying Insurance Policies which provide a stream of payments  to match the benefits being paid out by the plans. This would therefore remove the investment, inflation and longevity risks.  In Canada, the UK and Switzerland, the Group works with the governing bodies to ensure that the investment policy adopted is consistent with the  Group’s tolerance for risk. In the US the Group has direct control over the investment policy, subject to local investment regulations.  The proportions of the total fair value of assets in the pension plans for each asset class at the balance sheet date were:  2022 2021 Equities  18.0%   17.6%  – Quoted  12.3%   13.4%  – Private  5.7%   4.2%  Bonds  58.1%   60.2%  – Government fixed income  24.6%   23.2%  – Government inflation-linked  5.0%   9.5%  – Corporate and other publicly quoted  19.6%   20.6%  – Private  8.9%   6.9%  Property  10.0%   7.9%  – Quoted property funds  2.9%   3.4%  – Unquoted property funds  7.1%   4.5%  Qualifying insurance policies  9.7%   10.5%  Cash & other  4.2%   3.8%  Total  100.0%   100.0%  The assets of the plans are managed on a day-to-day basis by external specialist fund managers. These managers may invest in the Group’s  securities subject to limits imposed by the relevant fiduciary committees and local legislation. The approximate total holding of Group securities  within the plans is US$2 million (2021: US$2 million).  The holdings of quoted equities are invested in either pooled funds or segregated accounts held in the name of the relevant pension funds. These  equity portfolios are well diversified in terms of the geographic distribution and market sectors.  205 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Financial statements  ===== PAGE 208 ===== 28  Post-retirement benefits continued The holdings of government bonds are generally invested in the debt of the country in which a pension plan is situated. Corporate and other quoted  bonds are usually of investment grade. Private debt is mainly held in the North American and UK pension funds and is invested in North American and  European companies.  The property funds are invested in a diversified range of properties.  The holdings of cash & other are predominantly cash and short-term money market instruments.  Investments in private equity, private debt and property are less liquid than the other investment classes listed above and therefore the Group’s  investment in those asset classes is restricted to a level that does not endanger the liquidity of the pension plans. Qualifying insurance policies are held with insurance companies that are regulated by the relevant local authorities. The value of those policies is  calculated by the local actuaries using assumptions consistent with those adopted for valuing the insured obligations. The Group makes limited use of futures, repurchase agreements and other instruments to manage the interest rate risk in some of its plans. Fund  managers may also use derivatives to hedge currency movements within their portfolios and, in the case of bond managers, to take positions that  could be taken using direct holdings of bonds but more efficiently. Exposure to these instruments is closely monitored and maintained at a level that  does not endanger the liquidity of any pension plan.

The settlement loss in 2021 resulted from pension obligations in France being transferred to an external insurance company. A past service cost of  US$1 million was recognised in 2020 in relation to the Lloyds Banking Group court judgment addressing the need to equalise historical transfer  values in relation to Guaranteed Minimum Pensions.

See note 17.  Deficits are shown in the balance sheet within “Provisions (including post-retirement benefits)”. See note 26.  Funding policy and contributions to plans  The Group reviews the funding position of its pension plans on a regular basis and considers whether to provide funding above the minimum level  required in each country. In Canada and the US the minimum level is prescribed by legislation. In the UK and Switzerland the minimum level is  negotiated with the local trustee in accordance with the funding guidance issued by the local regulators. In deciding whether to provide funding  above the minimum level, we consider other possible uses of cash elsewhere, the local sponsoring entity’s tax situation and any strategic advantage  we might obtain. The Group does not generally pre-fund post-retirement healthcare arrangements.

Consequently, the cash paid to  defined contribution plans is lower than the defined contribution service cost by US$4 million. Contributions to defined benefit pension plans are kept  under regular review and actual contributions will be determined in line with the Group’s wider financing strategy, taking into account relevant  minimum funding requirements. In 2021 additional cash of US$294 million was paid in order to settle pension obligations in France. This amount was  paid to an external insurer, along with the transfer of existing pension assets in order to transfer the obligations to that insurer. As contributions to  many plans are reviewed on at least an annual basis, the contributions for 2023 and subsequent years cannot be determined precisely in advance.  Most of the Group’s largest pension funds are fully funded on their local funding basis and do not require long-term funding commitments at present.  Contributions to defined benefit pension plans for 2023 are estimated to be around US$190 million but may be higher or lower than this depending  on the evolution of financial markets and voluntary funding decisions taken by the Group. Contributions for subsequent years are expected to be at  similar levels. Healthcare plans are generally unfunded and contributions for future years will be equal to benefit payments net of participant  contributions. The Group’s contributions in 2023 are expected to be similar to the amounts paid in 2022.  207 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Financial statements  ===== PAGE 210 ===== 28  Post-retirement benefits continued Movements in the net defined benefit liability  A summary of the movement in the net defined benefit liability is shown in the first table below.

The  settlement amounts shown above for 2021 relate to France, where assets and obligations for pensions in payment were transferred to an insurance  company.  The resulting effect of applying an asset ceiling is a loss of US$1 million during the year. In determining the extent to which the asset ceiling has an  effect, the Group considers the funding legislation in each country and the rules specific to each pension plan. The calculation takes into account any  minimum funding requirements that may be applicable to the plan, whether any reduction in future Group contributions is available, and whether a  refund of surplus may be available. In considering whether any refund of surplus is available, the Group considers the powers of trustee boards and  similar bodies to augment benefits or wind up a plan. Where such powers are unilateral, the Group does not consider a refund to be available at the  end of the life of a plan. Where the plan rules and legislation both permit the employer to take a refund of surplus, the asset ceiling may have no effect,  although it may be the case that a refund will only be available many years in the future.  Financial statements continued Notes to the 2022 financial statements Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 208  ===== PAGE 211 ===== Main assumptions (rates per annum)  Key estimate - Estimation of obligations for post-employment costs The value of the Group’s obligations for post-employment benefits is dependent on the amount of benefits that are expected to be paid out,  discounted to the balance sheet date. The most significant assumptions used in accounting for pension plans are: The discount rate - used to determine the net present value of the obligations, the interest cost on the obligations and the interest income on  plan assets. We use the yield from high-quality corporate bonds with maturities and terms that match those of the post-employment  obligations as closely as possible. Where there is no developed corporate bond market in a currency, the rate on government bonds is used. The long-term inflation rate - used to project increases in future benefit payments for those plans that have benefits linked to inflation. The  assumption regarding future inflation is based on market yields on inflation linked instruments, where possible, combined with consensus  views.  The mortality rates - used to project the period over which benefits will be paid, which is then discounted to arrive at the net present value of  the obligations. The Group reviews the actual mortality rates of retirees in its major pension plans on a regular basis and uses these rates to set  its current mortality assumptions. It also uses its judgment with respect to allowances for future improvements in longevity having regard to  standard improvement scales in each relevant country and after taking external actuarial advice. The weighted-average assumptions used for the valuation at year end are summarised below: Canada UK US Switzerland At 31 December 2022 Discount rate  5.0%   4.9%   5.3%   2.3%  Long-term inflation(a)  2.1%   3.3%   2.4%   1.2%  Rate of increase in pensions  0.5%   2.8%   —%   3.4%  At 31 December 2021 Discount rate  2.9%   1.9%   2.8%   0.3%  Long-term inflation(a)  1.9%   3.4%   2.4%   0.9%  Rate of increase in pensions  0.3%   2.9%   —%   1.8%  (a) The long-term inflation assumption shown for the UK is for the Retail Price Index. The assumption for the Consumer Price Index at 31 December 2022 was 2.7% (2021: 2.7%).  The main financial assumptions used for the healthcare plans, which are predominantly in the US and Canada, were: discount rate: 5.4% (2021: 3.1%);  medical trend rate: 7.1% reducing to 4.8% by the year 2031 broadly on a straight line basis (2021: 6.3%, reducing to 4.7% by the year 2031); claims  costs based on individual company experience.  For both the pension and healthcare arrangements, the post-retirement mortality assumptions allow for future improvements in longevity. The  mortality tables used imply that a man aged 60 at the balance sheet date has a weighted average expected future lifetime of 27 years (2021: 27 years)  and that a man aged 60 in 2041 would have a weighted average expected future lifetime of 28 years (2021: 28 years). The mortality tables are  generally based upon the latest standard tables published in each country, adjusted appropriately to reflect the actual mortality experience of the  plan participants where credible data is available. Adjustments have been made to some of our plans within the demographic assumptions for the  impact of the Covid-19 pandemic based on the 2021 and 2020 experience.  Sensitivity  The values reported for the defined benefit obligations are sensitive to the actuarial assumptions used for projecting future benefit payments and  discounting those payments. In order to estimate the sensitivity of the obligations to changes in assumptions, we calculate what the obligations would  be if we were to make changes to each of the key assumptions in isolation. The difference between this figure and the figure calculated using our  stated assumptions is an indication of the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in each assumption. The results of this sensitivity analysis are  summarised in the table below. Note that this approach is valid for small changes in the assumptions but will be less accurate for larger changes in the  assumptions. The sensitivity to inflation includes the impact on pension increases, which are generally linked to inflation where they are granted.  2022 2021 Approximate (increase)/ decrease in obligations Approximate (increase)/ decrease in obligations Assumption Change in assumption Pensions US$m Other US$m Pensions US$m Other US$m Discount rate Increase of 0.5 percentage points   483   32   854   51  Decrease of 0.5 percentage points   (510)   (34)   (915)   (55)  Long-term inflation Increase of 0.5 percentage points   (174)   (10)   (393)   (14)  Decrease of 0.5 percentage points   168   9   374   13  Demographic – allowance for future  improvements in longevity Participants assumed to have the mortality rates of individuals  who are one year older   241   8   441   15  Participants assumed to have the mortality rates of individuals  who are one year younger   (241)   (8)   (441)   (15)  209 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Financial statements  ===== PAGE 212 ===== 29  Directors’ and key management remuneration  Aggregate remuneration, calculated in accordance with the UK Companies Act 2006, of the directors of the parent companies was as follows:  2022 US$'000 2021 US$'000 2020 US$'000 Emoluments   6,726   6,568   6,686  Long-term incentive plans   4,691   1,587   8,974    11,417   8,155   15,660  Pension contributions: defined contribution plans   10   9   29  The Group defines key management personnel as the directors and certain members of the Executive Committee, as described on page 118.

Financial statements continued Notes to the 2022 financial statements Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 212  ===== PAGE 215 ===== Oyu Tolgoi: approval for commencement of underground operations On 25 January 2022, Rio Tinto, Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd (Turquoise Hill) and the Government of Mongolia announced their agreement, and  unanimous approval by the Board of Oyu Tolgoi, to commence the underground operations. As part of a comprehensive project budget and funding package undertaken between the parties in reaching this agreement, Turquoise Hill agreed  to waive in full, funding balances arising from a carry account loan with Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi (Erdenes) of US$2.4 billion. This comprised the amount of  common share investments in Oyu Tolgoi LLC funded by Turquoise Hill on behalf of Erdenes to build the project to date, plus US$1.0 billion of  accrued interest. The waiver took effect on 25 January 2022. Rio Tinto and Turquoise Hill also agreed a plan to deliver the funding required until  sustainable underground production is reached. Prior to the waiver agreement, the funding balances owing from Erdenes to Turquoise Hill were expected to be repaid via a pledge over Erdenes’  share of future Oyu Tolgoi common share dividends. For this reason, and because the arrangement was between Turquoise Hill and Erdenes rather  than with Oyu Tolgoi LLC itself, both the principal and interest were treated as transactions with owners acting in their capacity as owners.  Consequently, at 31 December 2021, related amounts were recorded as a reduction in the share of equity attributable to non-controlling interests,  resulting in an increase to the effective interest in Oyu Tolgoi attributable to owners of Rio Tinto. Funding balances owing from Erdenes to Turquoise Hill were not classified as loan receivables in the Group Balance Sheet, and there was no interest  income shown in the Group Income Statement. Accumulation of interest on the funding balances increased the share of retained earnings  attributable to Rio Tinto as it accrued. Waiving the funding balances owing from Erdenes to Turquoise Hill increases Erdenes’ economic share arising through entitlement to cash flows  from future dividends of Oyu Tolgoi. In the 2022 Group results, there is no Income Statement charge for loan forgiveness or write-off as a result of the  waiver, and net assets and liabilities for Oyu Tolgoi included in the Group Balance sheet remained unchanged as a result of this transaction. There  was no exchange of cash or other financial assets between parties and there has been no change to the underlying free cash flows of the Oyu Tolgoi  operations and development project. The waiver did not have an impact on the Group's assessment of impairment indicators for either 2021 or 2022,  since it related to the project shareholders' funding arrangements rather than the economic capability of the Cash Generating Unit itself. A  reallocation of the net asset value allocation between the owners of Oyu Tolgoi has been recorded in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity for  2022 by reducing equity attributable to owners of Rio Tinto and increasing equity attributable to non-controlling interests. 31  Principal joint operations  At 31 December 2022 Company and country of incorporation/operation Principal activities Group interest (%) Australia Tomago Aluminium Joint Venture Aluminium smelting 51.6 Gladstone Power Station Joint Venture Power generation 42.1 Hope Downs Joint Venture Iron ore mining 50 Queensland Alumina Limited(a)(b) Alumina production 80 Pilbara Iron Arrangements Infrastructure, corporate and mining services See other relevant judgments call  out box below New Zealand New Zealand Aluminium Smelters Limited(a)(b) Aluminium smelting 79.4 Canada Aluminerie Alouette Inc.

(b) Queensland Alumina Limited, New Zealand Aluminium Smelters Limited and Pechiney Reynolds Quebec Inc. are joint arrangements that are primarily designed for the provision of output to the  parties sharing joint control; this indicates that the parties have rights to substantially all the economic benefits of the assets. The liabilities of the arrangements are in substance satisfied by cash  flows received from the parties; this dependence indicates that the parties in effect have obligations for the liabilities. It is these facts and circumstances that gives rise to the classification of  these entities as joint operations.  (c) Pechiney Reynolds Quebec Inc. has a 50.1% interest in the Aluminerie de Bécancour, Inc. aluminium smelter, which is located in Canada. As Rio Tinto owns 50.2% of Pechiney Reynolds Quebec  Inc our effective ownership of the Becancour smelter is 25.1%. 213 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Financial statements  ===== PAGE 216 ===== 31  Principal joint operations continued Other relevant judgments - Basis of consolidation of Queensland Alumina Limited (‘QAL’) Judgment is sometimes required to assess whether, after considering all relevant factors, we have control or joint control.  QAL is 80% owned  by Rio Tinto and 20% owned by RUSAL.  Typically such ownership interests would provide control; however, we have determined in this case  that the shareholders’ agreement, which requires unanimous agreement over certain relevant activities of QAL, means that this non-managed  operation is jointly controlled. The entity operates the joint operation on a tolling basis, processing bauxite supplied by the shareholders into  alumina, which they off-take in their respective ownership share. Following the Australian Governments’s imposition of Trade Sanctions against Russia, QAL considered that they were no longer able to  process bauxite on behalf of RUSAL and therefore enacted the “step-in” clause of the shareholders’ agreement that enabled Rio Tinto to  contribute additional bauxite tonnes to ensure that 100% of production capacity was maintained. The decisions requiring unanimous consent  referred to above are restricted during the step-in period.  Due to the step-in, we have re-assessed whether our conclusion of having joint control is still valid, considering we own 80% of the entity but  currently take all plant production. If this resulted in our control of QAL we would need to account for that change as a business combination.  Based on the following facts: – RUSAL has commenced proceedings in the Australian Federal Court contending that the sanctions should not apply in these  circumstances and therefore the step-in rights should not apply; and  – the continued operation of the shareholders’ agreement, incorporating the “step-in” clause, we have concluded that we have joint control of the entity at 31 December 2022 and therefore continue to account for QAL as a joint  operation.  Other relevant judgments - Accounting for the Pilbara Iron Arrangements A number of arrangements are in place amongst the Australian Iron Ore operations, managed by Rio Tinto, which allow their respective assets  to be operated as a single integrated network across the Pilbara region. In assessing the Pilbara Iron Arrangements, it has been concluded  that they collectively constitute a joint operation on the basis that decisions about relevant activities require unanimous consent. The resulting  efficiencies are shared between Rio Tinto and Robe River Iron Associates (Robe River), and the parties fund all of the cash flow requirements  of Pilbara Iron (Company) Services Pty Ltd and Pilbara Iron Pty Ltd. Each of the partners in the joint operation is able to request the other to construct assets on their tenure to increase the capacity of the rail and  port infrastructure network. The requesting partner’s (Asset User’s) share of the capacity of the network will increase by the capacity of the  newly constructed asset, but generally that capacity may be provided from any of the network assets. The Asset User will pay an annual  charge (Committed Use Charge – “CUC”) over a contractually specified period irrespective of network usage. The constructing partner  (Asset Owner) has an ongoing obligation to make available capacity from those assets and to maintain the assets in good working order as  required under relevant State Agreements and associated tenure.  The arrangements are managed through two wholly owned subsidiaries:  Pilbara Iron (Company) Services Pty Ltd and Pilbara Iron Pty Ltd. We have also considered whether the CUC arrangements give rise to a lease between the Asset Owner and the Asset User. We have  concluded that they do not, as there is no specified asset; rather the Asset User has a first priority right to the capacity in the CUC asset. This  treatment was grandfathered on adoption of IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019, following assessment under the preceding standards IAS 17 “Leases”  and IFRIC 4 “Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease”, with no change to the conclusion under IFRS 16 for subsequent  expenditure subject to the existing CUC arrangements. Management considers that these arrangements are unique and has used judgment  to apply the principles of IFRS to the accounting for the arrangements as described above. The obligation of the Asset Owner to make  capacity available is fulfilled over time and not at a point in time. The CUC arrangement is therefore an executory contract as defined under  IAS 37, whereby neither party has performed any of its obligations, or both parties have partially performed their obligations to an equal extent,  and so the CUC payments are expensed as incurred. An alternative interpretation of the fact pattern could have resulted in a gross  presentation in the Group’s balance sheet with an asset and a corresponding liability to reflect the present value of the CUC payments. The  Asset User is a wholly owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto, whereas the Asset Owner is a joint operation. This impact would be some US$948 million  (calculated on the basis of grossing up the tax written down value of the CUC assets). Other methods of calculating the gross-up might give  rise to different numbers.

Other relevant judgments - Accounting for Minera Escondida Ltda Judgment has been applied on the determination that Escondida is a joint venture. We have based this on the nature of significant commercial  decisions, including capital expenditure, which require approval of both Rio Tinto and its partner BHP (holders of a 57.5% interest). In contrast,  our partner has assessed Rio Tinto’s rights as protective and concluded that it controls Escondida through its rights to direct relevant  activities. Adoption of the equivalent judgment by the Group would result in reclassification of Escondida from a joint venture to an associate,  with no other financial reporting consequence since accounting under the equity method would remain in place.

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net  of tax, from the proceeds.  Where any Group company purchases the Group’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable  incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to owners of Rio Tinto. Where such shares are subsequently reissued,  any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to  owners of Rio Tinto. If purchased Rio Tinto plc shares are cancelled, an amount equal to the nominal value of the cancelled share is credited to the  capital redemption reserve.

The provision reflects the best estimate of the expenditure needed to settle the obligation which existed at the balance sheet date.  Where there is sufficient objective evidence of reasonably expected future events (such as changes in technology and new legislation) we reflect this  in the amounts recognised. 2022  US$m 2021 US$m At 1 January 1,002  856  Adjustment to opening balance on transition to new accounting standard (refer to page 155) 17  —  Restated opening balance 1,019  856  Adjustment on currency translation (43)  (29)  Adjustments to mining properties/right of use assets: – increases to existing and new provisions 4  3  Charged/(credited) to profit: – increases to existing and new provisions 365  382  – unused amounts reversed (66)  (37)  – amortisation of discount 2  3  Utilised in year (176)  (128)  Transfers and other movements(a) 193  (48)  At 31 December 1,298  1,002  Balance sheet analysis: Current 554  700  Non-current 744  302  Total 1,298  1,002  (a) Transfers and other movements includes US$211 million for additional consideration to be paid to the dissenting shareholders of the Turquoise Hill Resources transaction.  It represents the  difference between their initial consideration of C$34.4 per share and C$43 per share paid to all other shareholders, with the final amount and timing to be determined by dissent proceedings.  As a transaction with shareholders of a subsidiary in their capacity as owners, this adjustment has been made through equity. 37  Contingencies and commitments Recognition and measurement Contingent liabilities, indemnities and other performance guarantees represent the potential outflow of funds from the Group for the satisfaction of  obligations including those under contractual arrangements (for example undertakings related to supplier agreements) not provided for in the  balance sheet, where the likelihood of the contingent liabilities, guarantees or indemnities being called is assessed as possible rather than probable  or remote. Contingent liabilities (subsidiaries, joint operations, joint ventures and associates)  Other relevant judgments - Contingencies Disclosure is made for material contingent liabilities unless the possibility of any loss arising is considered remote based on our judgment and  legal advice. These are quantified unless, in our judgment, the amount cannot be reliably estimated. The unit of account for claims is the matter  taken as a whole and therefore when a provision has been recorded for the best estimate of the cost to settle the obligation there is no further  contingent liability component. This means that when a provision is recognised for the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the  present obligation from a single past event, a further contingent liability is not reported for the maximum potential exposure in excess of that  already provided. We have not established provisions for certain additional legal claims in cases where we have assessed that a payment is either not probable  or cannot be reliably estimated. A number of our companies are, and will likely continue to be, subject to various legal proceedings and  investigations that arise from time to time. As a result, the Group may become subject to substantial liabilities that could affect our business,  financial position and reputation. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and large judgments may at times occur. The Group may in the future  incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could lead to material cash outflows. We do not believe that any of these proceedings  will have a materially adverse effect on our financial position. 2022  US$m 2021 US$m Contingent liabilities, indemnities and other performance guarantees(a) 498  441  (a) There were no material contingent liabilities arising in relation to the Group’s joint ventures and associates.  219 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Financial statements  ===== PAGE 222 ===== 37  Contingencies and commitments  continued Contingent liabilities - not quantifiable The current status of contingent liabilities where it is not practicable to provide a reliable estimate of possible financial exposure is:  Litigation disputes Litigation matter Latest update Timing of the impairment of Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique  (US securities and exchange commission) In October 2017, Rio Tinto announced that it had been notified by the U.S. Securities and  Exchange Commission (SEC) that the SEC had filed a complaint in relation to Rio Tinto’s  disclosures and timing of the impairment of Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique (RTCM). The  impairment was reflected in Rio Tinto’s 2012 year-end accounts. The SEC alleges that  Rio Tinto, a former chief executive, Tom Albanese, and a former chief financial officer,  Guy Elliott, committed violations of the anti-fraud, reporting, books and records, and  internal control provisions of the federal securities law by not accurately disclosing the  value of RTCM and not impairing it when Rio Tinto published its 2011 year-end accounts  in February 2012 or its 2012 interim results in August 2012. In June 2019, the trial court  dismissed an associated US class action on behalf of securities holders. In August 2020,  the appeals court partially overturned the court’s dismissal and the trial court dismissed  the case again in 2022. The securities holders have appealed further to reinstate their  claims, and the court has requested briefing in 2023. No provision has been recognised  for this case.  2011 Contractual payments in Guinea Rio Tinto continues to co-operate fully with relevant authorities in connection with their  investigations in relation to contractual payments totalling US$10.5 million made to a  consultant who had provided advisory services in 2011 on the Simandou project in  Guinea. In August 2018, the court dismissed a related US class action commenced on  behalf of securities holders. No provision has been recognised for this case.  At 31 December 2022, the outcomes of the matters remain uncertain, but they could ultimately expose the Group to material financial cost. We  believe these cases are unwarranted and will defend the allegations vigorously. A dedicated Board committee continues to monitor the progress of  these matters, as appropriate.  On 6 March 2022 we reached a settlement with ASIC regarding the disclosure of the impairment of Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique (RTCM), which was  reflected in Rio Tinto’s 2012 year-end accounts. This was previously disclosed as a contingent liability at 31 December 2021. As part of the court  approved settlement, we paid a A$750,000 penalty for a single contravention of our continuous disclosure obligations in the period 21 December  2012 to 17 January 2013, immediately preceding the impairment announcement. As part of this court approved settlement between ASIC and Rio  Tinto, there were no findings of fraud or any systemic or widespread failure by Rio Tinto. The case against Tom Albanese and Guy Elliott brought by  ASIC has been wholly dismissed.  Other contingent liabilities We are modernising agreements with Traditional Owner groups in response to the Juukan Gorge incident. We have created provisions, within “Other  provisions”,  based on our best estimate of historical claims; however, the process is incomplete and it is possible that further claims could arise  relating to past events. Close-down and restoration provisions are not recognised for those operations that have no known restrictions on their lives as the date of closure  cannot be reliably estimated. This applies primarily to our Canadian aluminium smelters, which are not dependent upon a specific orebody and have  access to indefinite-lived power from owned hydro-power stations with water rights permitted by local governments. In these instances, a closure  obligation may exist at the reporting date; however, due to the indefinite nature of asset lives it is not possible to arrive at a sufficiently reliable  estimate for the purposes of recognising a provision. Close-down and restoration provisions are recognised at these operations for separately  identifiable closure activities which can be reasonably estimated, such as the demolition and removal of fixed structures after a pre-determined  period. Any contingent liability for these assets will crystallise into a closure provision if and when a decision is taken to cease operations. Contingent assets  The Group has, from time to time, various insurance claims outstanding with reinsurers. Recognition of any assets arising takes place once the  insurance company has agreed to refund the claims and the amount is quantifiable. This is usually in the same period as payment is received. Capital commitments Our capital commitments include open purchase orders for managed operations and expenditure on major projects already authorised by our  Investment Committee for non-managed operations. It does not include the estimated incremental capital expenditure relating to decarbonisation  projects of US$7.5 billion between 2022 and 2030 unless otherwise contractually committed. On a legally enforceable basis, capital commitments  would be approximately US$1.0 billion (2021: US$1.1 billion) as many of the contracts relating to the Group’s projects have various cancellation  clauses.

The Group immediately sells the purchased products to third parties; in an  active market, and therefore does not recognise the purchase obligation.  Along with the other joint venture partners, we have commitments to provide emergency funding (such as funding required to preserve the life or  assets of the company or to comply with applicable laws) if required by Sohar Aluminium Company L.L.C., subject to approved thresholds.  At 31 December 2022, Minera Escondida Ltda held an undrawn shareholder line of credit for US$225 million (Rio Tinto share) (31 December 2021:  US$225 million). The current facility has been extended during the year and will now mature in September 2023.  Purchase obligations  Purchase obligations are enforceable and legally binding agreements to buy goods or services. They specify all significant terms, including: fixed or  minimum quantities to be purchased or consumed; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions.  Purchase obligations for goods mainly relate to purchases of raw materials and consumables, and purchase obligations for services mainly relate to  charges for the use of infrastructure, commitments to purchase power and freight contracts. These goods and services are expected to be used in  the business. To the extent that this changes, a provision for onerous obligations may be made. Purchases from joint arrangements or associates are included if the quantity to be purchased is in excess of our ownership interest in the entity.  However, purchase obligations exclude contracted purchases of bauxite, alumina and aluminium from joint arrangements and associates and  contracted purchases of alumina from third parties. This is because these purchases are made for commercial reasons and the Group is, overall, a net  seller of these commodities.  The aggregate amount of future payment commitments under purchase obligations outstanding at 31 December was:  2022  US$m 2021 US$m Within 1 year   3,618   3,483  Between 1 and 2 years   2,091   1,660  Between 2 and 3 years   1,632   1,345  Between 3 and 4 years   1,309   1,080  Between 4 and 5 years   907   1,020  After 5 years   6,574   7,125  Total   16,131   15,713  Guarantees by parent companies  Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited have, jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed the following securities issued by the following  100% owned finance subsidiaries: US$4.4 billion (31 December 2021: US$4.4 billion) Rio Tinto Finance (USA) Limited and Rio Tinto Finance (USA) plc  bonds with maturity dates up to 2051; and US$1 billion (31 December 2021: US$1.1 billion) on the European Debt Issuance Programme. In addition, Rio  Tinto Finance plc and Rio Tinto Finance Limited have entered into undrawn facility arrangements for an aggregate amount of US$7.5 billion  (31 December 2021: US$7.5 billion). The facilities are guaranteed by Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited.  Rio Tinto plc has provided a guarantee, known as the completion support undertaking (CSU), in favour of the Oyu Tolgoi LLC project finance lenders.  At 31 December 2022, US$3.9 billion of project finance debt was outstanding under this facility (2021: US$4.3 billion). Rio Tinto plc, through its  subsidiaries, owns 66% of Oyu Tolgoi LLC, with the remaining share owned by Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi LLC (34%), which is controlled by the  Government of Mongolia. The project finance has been raised for development of the underground mine and the CSU will terminate on the  completion of the underground mine according to a set of completion tests set out in the project finance facility.  The Rio Tinto guarantee applies to the extent that Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd cannot satisfy Oyu Tolgoi LLC’s project finance debt servicing  obligations under its own guarantee to the lenders, called the sponsor debt service undertaking (DSU). Both the CSU and DSU contain a carve-out for  certain political risk events.  221 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Financial statements  ===== PAGE 224 ===== 38  Auditors’ remuneration  Group auditors’ remuneration(a)  2022  US$m 2021 US$m 2020 US$m Audit of the Group   17.3   13.7   11.0  Audit of subsidiaries   8.4   7.5   6.3  Total audit   25.7   21.2   17.3  Audit-related assurance service   1.0   1.0   0.8  Other assurance services(b)   2.3   2.7   1.4  Total assurance services   3.3   3.7   2.2  Tax compliance   —   —   —  Other non-audit services not covered above   0.3   0.2   0.1  Total non-audit services   3.6   3.9   2.3  Total Group auditors’ remuneration   29.3   25.1   19.6  Audit fees payable to other accounting firms Audit of the financial statements of the Group’s subsidiaries   0.2   0.3   0.6  Fees in respect of pension scheme audits   0.1   0.1   0.1  Total audit fees payable to other accounting firms   0.3   0.4   0.7  (a) The remuneration payable to KPMG, the Group auditors, is approved by the Audit Committee. The Committee sets the policy for the award of non-audit work to the auditors and approves the  nature and extent of such work, and the amount of the related fees, to ensure that independence is maintained. The fees disclosed above consolidate all payments, including overruns, made to  member firms of KPMG by the companies and their subsidiaries, along with fees in respect of joint operations paid for by the Group. Non-audit services arise largely from assurance and  regulation related work. (b) Other assurance services relates to the review of non-statutory financial information including sustainability reporting. Under SEC regulations, the remuneration to KPMG firms and associates of US$29.3 million  (2021: US$25.1 million; 2020: US$19.6 million) is required  to be presented as follows: audit fees US$27.0 million (2021: US$22.6 million; 2020: US$18.0 million), audit-related fees US$2.0 million  (2021:  US$2.3 million; 2020: US$1.6 million), Tax fees  US$nil (2021: US$nil; 2020: US$nil) and all other fees US$0.3 million (2021: US$0.2 million; 2020:  US$nil) 39  Events after the balance sheet date  On 16 February 2023, we re-financed the US$3.9 billion Oyu Tolgoi project finance facility with a syndicate of international financial institutions,  export credit agencies and commercial lenders. The lenders have agreed to a deferral of the principal repayments by three years to June 2026 and  to an extension of the final maturity date by five years from 2030 to 2035. The terms and conditions are broadly unchanged and lenders continue to  benefit from the Debt Service Undertaking from Turquoise Hill Resources Limited and the Completion Support Undertaking from Rio Tinto plc. There were no other significant events after the balance sheet date requiring disclosure. 40  New standards issued but not yet effective  We have not early adopted any new accounting standards or amendments that have been issued but are not yet effective. Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes, mandatory  in 2023 and endorsed by the UK) The Group will adopt, from January 2023 (the transition date),  the narrow-scope amendments to IAS 12, which introduce an exclusion to the initial  recognition exemption application for transactions that give rise to equal and offsetting taxable and deductible temporary differences.   Our existing accounting policy states that “where the recognition of an asset and liability from a single transaction gives rise to equal and offsetting  temporary differences, Rio Tinto applies the initial recognition exemption allowed by IAS 12, and consequently recognises neither a deferred tax  asset nor a deferred tax liability in respect of these temporary differences”. Under the amendments, deferred tax assets and liabilities are required to  be recognised in respect of such temporary differences from the transition date, with restatement of comparatives for 2022 and 2021.   The most significant impact of implementing these amendments is expected to be from temporary differences related to the Group's provisions for  close-down and restoration (note 14), and lease obligations (note 21) and corresponding capitalised closure costs and right of use assets (note 13).  Adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities related to these balances will be recognised as at 1 January 2021, being the beginning of the earliest  comparative period presented in 2023 financial statements, with the cumulative effect recognised as an adjustment to retained earnings or other  components of equity at that date. For other transactions the amendments apply only to those taking place on or after 1 January 2021. The impact of restatement as at 31 December 2022 is that the Group will recognise additional gross deferred tax liabilities of US$922 million and  gross deferred tax assets of US$1.4 billion in relation to close-down and restoration obligations and related capitalised closure costs. The Group will  also recognise additional gross deferred tax liabilities of US$140 million and gross deferred tax assets of US$149 million in relation to lease liabilities  and related right of use assets (note 15).  After the required offsetting within the same tax jurisdiction, these adjustments result in the Group recognising additional net deferred tax assets of  US$30 million and a reduction in net deferred tax liabilities of US$437 million (note 15) with the resulting cumulative impact increasing retained  earnings (inclusive of income statement adjustments described below) by US$459 million.  As at 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2021, the  restatement of gross and net deferred tax balances does not differ materially from the impact as at 31 December 2022.  Financial statements continued Notes to the 2022 financial statements Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 222  ===== PAGE 225 ===== The impact of restatement on net earnings for the year ended 2022 is a net charge of US$28 million,  comprising a US$84 million credit (2021:US$22  million) related to depreciation of closure and right of use assets, and settlement of closure and lease liabilities, offset by a  US$112 million charge  (2021: US$nil) related to the derecognition of deferred tax assets as a result of the recently enacted Corporate  Alternative Minimum Tax regime in  the USA referred to in note 10 on page 172. There will be no impact on tax cash flows or amounts recognised on the balance sheet as tax recoverable  or payable as a result of implementing these amendments. IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and amendments to IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (mandatory in 2023 and endorsed by the UK) The standard provides consistent principles for all aspects of accounting for insurance contracts. We are finalising our assessment and have not  identified a material impact to date, particularly in areas of judgment related to reinsurance contracts with EAUs and in substance self-insurance  arrangements. Other amendments The assessment is ongoing in relation to other amendments, but no material impact has been identified to date. These are listed below:  – Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: disclosure of accounting policies (mandatory in 2023 and endorsed by the UK); – Amendments to IAS 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors: definition of accounting estimates (mandatory in 2023  and endorsed by the UK)  – Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: classification of liabilities (mandatory in 2024 and not yet endorsed by the UK).    41  Rio Tinto Limited parent company disclosures As at 31 December 2022 A$m 2021 A$m Assets Current assets   11,712   13,935  Non-current assets   2,646   3,413  Total assets   14,358   17,348  Liabilities Current liabilities   (616)   (2,296)  Non-current liabilities   (36)   (806)  Total liabilities   (652)   (3,102)  Net assets   13,706   14,246  Shareholders’ equity Share capital   3,504   3,504  Other reserves   301   309  Retained earnings   9,901   10,433  Total equity   13,706   14,246  Profit of the parent company   11,355   24,037  Total comprehensive income of the parent company   11,355   24,037  Prepared under Australian Accounting Standards (AAS) and in accordance with Australian Corporations Act (see page 249). In relation to Rio Tinto  Limited there are no significant measurement differences between AAS and IFRS as defined on page 148. Rio Tinto Limited guarantees Rio Tinto Limited provides a number of guarantees in respect of Group companies. Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited have jointly guaranteed the Group’s external listed debt under the US Shelf Programme, European Debt Issuance  Programme and Commercial Paper Programme. At 31 December 2022 this totalled A$8.1 billion (31 December 2021: A$7.6 billion). These entities also  jointly guarantee the Group’s undrawn credit facility, A$11.1 billion at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: A$10.3 billion). Rio Tinto Limited has guaranteed other external debt held by Rio Tinto Group entities which totalled A$0.1 billion at 31 December 2022 (31 December  2021: A$0.1 billion). In addition, Rio Tinto Limited has provided a guarantee of all third-party obligations, including contingent obligations, of Rio Tinto Finance Limited, a  wholly owned subsidiary. Pursuant to the DLC Merger, both Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited issued deed poll guarantees by which each company guaranteed contractual  obligations incurred by the other or guaranteed by the other. 223 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Financial statements  ===== PAGE 226 ===== Name of undertaking Country of incorporation Share class % of share class held by Group companies Effective Group % ownership Registered office address 1043802 Ontario Ltd Canada CAD Ordinary  shares 100 100 5300-66 Wellington Street West, Toronto ON M5K 1E6,  Canada 10676276 Canada Inc.

Basis of preparation The Rio Tinto plc company financial statements have been prepared  using the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of  certain financial liabilities and in accordance with the UK Companies  Act 2006 and Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure  Framework (“FRS 101”). The financial statements have been prepared on  a going concern basis.  In preparing these financial statements, the company applies the  recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of UK-adopted  international accounting standards, but makes amendments where  necessary in order to comply with Companies Act 2006. The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently  to all periods presented in these financial statements. The following  exemptions available under FRS 101 have been applied: – Paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2, “Share-based  Payment” (details of the number and weighted average exercise  prices of share options and how the fair value of goods and services  received was determined). – Paragraphs 91-99 of IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement” (disclosure of  valuation techniques and inputs used for fair value measurement of  assets and liabilities). – IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures”. – Paragraph 38 of IAS 1 “Presentation of financial statements”,  comparative information requirements in respect of Paragraph  79(a)(iv) of IAS 1. – The following paragraphs of IAS 1 “Presentation of financial  statements”: – 10 (d) (statement of cash flows); – 16 (statement of compliance with all IFRS); – 38A (requirement for minimum of two primary statements,  including cash flow statements); – 38B-D (additional comparative information); – 111 (cash flow statement information); and – 134-136 (capital management disclosures). – IAS 7 “Statement of Cash Flows”. – Paragraph 30 and 31 of IAS 8 “Accounting policies, changes in  accounting estimates and errors” (requirement for the disclosure of  information when an entity has not applied a new IFRS that has been  issued and is not yet effective). – Paragraph 17 of IAS 24 “Related party disclosures” (key management  compensation). – The requirements of IAS 24, “Related party disclosures” to disclose  related party transactions entered into between two or more  members of a group. b. Judgments in applying accounting policies and key  sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of the financial statements requires management to  make assumptions, judgments and estimates and to use judgment in  applying accounting policies and making critical accounting estimates.  These judgments, estimates and assumptions are based on  management’s best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances,  having regard to previous experience, but actual results may differ  materially from the amounts included in the financial statements. The key area of judgment that has the most significant effect on  the amounts recognised in the financial statements is the review for  impairment of investment carrying values. Investments in subsidiaries are reviewed for impairment where events or  changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the  investment may not be recoverable. The unit of account being the  equity of the subsidiary taken as a whole, which may include interests in  multiple cash-generating units. If any such indication exists, Rio Tinto plc makes an assessment of the  recoverable amount. If the asset is determined to be impaired, an  impairment loss will be recorded and the asset written down based on  the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds the higher of  fair value less cost of disposal and value in use. An impairment loss is  recognised immediately in the income statement. c. Currency translation Items included in the financial statements are measured using the  currency of the primary economic environment in which the company  operates (the functional currency). The financial statements are  presented in US dollars, which is the company’s functional and  presentation currency. Transactions denominated in other currencies,  including the issue of shares, are translated into the functional currency  using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of  such transactions, and from the translation at year-end exchange rates  of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are  recognised in the profit and loss account. Exchange rates used are consistent with the rates used by the Group as  disclosed in the consolidated financial statements on page 151. d. Investments Investments in Group companies are valued at cost less accumulated  impairment losses. Investments are reviewed for impairment if events or  changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be  recoverable. e. Financial guarantees Financial guarantees are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequently,  the liability is measured at the higher of the best estimate of the  expenditure required to settle the present obligation and the amount  initially recognised less cumulative amortisation. f. Share-based payments The Company operates a number of share-based payment plans for  Group employees, the details of which are included in the consolidated  financial statements (note 27). The fair value of the Company’s share  plans is recognised as an addition to the cost of the investment in the  subsidiary in which the relevant employees work over the expected  vesting period, with a corresponding entry to retained earnings.  Payments received from the Company’s subsidiaries in respect of these  share-based payments are recognised as a reduction in the cost of the  investment. The Company uses fair values provided by independent  actuaries calculated using either a lattice-based option valuation model  or a Monte Carlo simulation model. The fair value of the share plans is  determined at the date of grant, taking into account any market-based  vesting conditions attached to the award. Non-market based vesting conditions (for example relative EBIT margin  performance targets) are taken into account in estimating the number of  awards likely to vest. The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest  is reviewed at each balance sheet date up to the vesting date, at which  point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual awards issued. No  adjustment is made after the vesting date even if the awards are  forfeited or not exercised. g. Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment  is established. h. Treasury shares The consideration paid for shares repurchased by the Company and  held as treasury shares is recognised as a reduction in shareholders’  funds through retained earnings.

Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited have jointly guaranteed the Group’s external listed debt under the US Shelf Programme, European Debt Issuance  Programme and Commercial Paper Programme which totalled US$5.4 billion at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: US$5.5 billion). In addition,  these entities also jointly guarantee the Group’s undrawn credit facility which was US$7.5 billion at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: US$7.5  billion). Rio Tinto plc has provided guarantees in respect of certain derivative contracts that are in a liability position of US$523 million at  31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: US$273 million). Rio Tinto plc has provided a guarantee, known as the completion support undertaking (CSU), in favour of the Oyu Tolgoi LLC project finance lenders.  At 31 December 2022, US$3.9 billion of project finance debt was outstanding under this facility (31 December 2021: US$4.3 billion). Rio Tinto plc,  through its subsidiaries, owns 66% of Oyu Tolgoi LLC with the remaining share owned by Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi LLC (34%), which is controlled by the  Government of Mongolia. The project finance has been raised for development of the underground mine and the CSU will terminate on the  completion of the underground mine according to a set of completion tests set out in the project finance facility. The Rio Tinto guarantee applies to the extent that Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd cannot satisfy Oyu Tolgoi LLC’s project finance debt servicing  obligations under its own guarantee to the lenders, called the sponsor debt service undertaking (DSU). Both the CSU and DSU contain a carve-out for  certain political risk events. During 2022, fees of US$101 million (2021: US$108 million) were received from Oyu Tolgoi LLC and Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd as consideration for  the provision of the CSU.  Rio Tinto plc has provided a number of guarantees in relation to various pension funds. Subject to certain conditions, Rio Tinto plc would pay any  contributions due from Group companies participating in these funds should the companies fail to meet their contribution requirements. The  guarantees were not called upon in 2022. The aggregate of company contributions to these plans in 2022 was US$9 million (2021: US$8 million). Other guarantees issued by Rio Tinto plc in relation to Rio Tinto Group entities as at 31 December 2022 amount to US$458 million (31 December  2021: US$426 million). Included within this balance is US$23 million (31 December 2021: US$35 million) in relation to non-wholly owned subsidiaries. Pursuant to the DLC Merger, both Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited issued deed poll guarantees by which each company guaranteed contractual  obligations incurred by the other or guaranteed by the other. The liability recognised for financial guarantees is US$96 million (31 December 2021: US$156 million) presented in “Other financial liabilities” in the  balance sheet.

The order  essentially continues the relief that has applied to Rio Tinto Limited since  the formation of the Group’s dual listed companies (DLC) structure in  1995. The order applies to Rio Tinto Limited’s financial reporting  obligations for the financial years up to and including 31 December  2023. In essence, instead of being required under the Corporations Act to  prepare consolidated financial statements covering Rio Tinto Limited  and its controlled entities, it allows the Company to prepare  consolidated financial statements in which it, Rio Tinto plc and their  respective controlled entities are treated as a single economic entity. In  addition, those consolidated financial statements are to be prepared: – in accordance with the principles and requirements of International  Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the United Kingdom  (UK IFRS) rather than the Australian Accounting Standards (AAS)  (except for one limited instance in the case of any concise report),  and in accordance with UK financial reporting obligations generally; – on the basis that the transitional provisions of International Financial  Reporting Standard 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial  Reporting Standards, should be applied using the combined  financial statements previously prepared for Rio Tinto Limited, Rio  Tinto plc and their respective controlled entities under Generally  Accepted Accounting Principles in the United Kingdom, under which  the DLC Merger between Rio Tinto Limited and Rio Tinto plc was  accounted for using “merger”, rather than “acquisition”, accounting  (reflecting that neither Rio Tinto Limited nor Rio Tinto plc was  acquired by, or is controlled by, the other; and meaning that the  existing carrying amounts, rather than fair values, of assets and  liabilities at the time of the DLC Merger were used to measure those  assets and liabilities at formation); – on the basis that Rio Tinto Limited and Rio Tinto plc are a single  company (with their respective shareholders being the shareholders  in that single company); and – with a reconciliation, from UK IFRS to AAS, of the following amounts:  consolidated loss/profit for the financial year, total consolidated  comprehensive loss/income for the financial year and total  consolidated equity at the end of the financial year (see page 155). Those consolidated financial statements must also be audited in relation  to their compliance with relevant Australian and UK requirements.  Rio Tinto Limited must also prepare a Directors’ Report which satisfies  the content requirements of the Corporations Act (applied on the basis  that for these purposes the consolidated entity is the Group, and the  consolidated financial statements cover the Group). This includes a  Remuneration Report (see pages 110 to 135) prepared in accordance  with the requirements of the Corporations Act. Rio Tinto Limited is also required to comply generally with the lodgement  and distribution requirements of the Corporations Act (including timing  requirements) in relation to those consolidated financial statements  (including any concise financial statements), the Auditors’ report and the  Directors’ Report. The Corporations Act also requires that a non-binding  resolution to adopt the Remuneration Report be voted on by  shareholders at Rio Tinto Limited’s annual general meeting. Rio Tinto Limited is not required to prepare separate consolidated  financial statements solely for it and its controlled entities. Rio Tinto  Limited is also not required to prepare and lodge parent entity financial  statements for itself in respect of each relevant financial year. Rio Tinto Limited must, however, in accordance with the Corporations  Act include in the consolidated financial statements for the Group, as a  note, various parent entity information regarding Rio Tinto Limited  (including in relation to assets, liabilities, shareholders’ equity, profit and  loss, income, guarantees, contingent liabilities, and contractual  commitments) prepared in accordance with AAS (see page 223).

REPORT ON THE AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1. OPINIONS: OUR OPINIONS ARE UNMODIFIED   In KPMG UK’s opinion:  •  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the UK parent company, Rio Tinto plc’s, affairs as at  31 December 2022, and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;  •  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and IFRSs  as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). As explained on page 148 to the financial statements, the Group, in  addition to complying with its legal obligation to apply UK-adopted international accounting standards, has applied IFRSs as issued by the  IASB;  •  the Rio Tinto plc company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards, including FRS  101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”; and   •  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.  In KPMG Australia’s opinion:   •  The accompanying Group financial statements are in accordance with the Australian Corporations Act 2001, as amended by the Australian  Securities and Investments Commission Order dated 16 July 2021 (the “ASIC Order”) including:   o  giving a true and fair view of the Group’s financial position as at 31 December 2022 and of its financial performance for the year  then ended; and  o  complying with UK-adopted international accounting standards and the Australian Corporations Regulations 2001.  For the purpose of these reports, the terms ‘we’ and ‘our’ denote KPMG UK in relation to UK responsibilities and reporting obligations to the  members of Rio Tinto plc, and KPMG Australia in relation to Australian responsibilities and reporting obligations to the members of Rio Tinto  Limited. Rio Tinto (‘the Group’ or ‘Rio Tinto Group’) consists of Rio Tinto plc, Rio Tinto Limited (individually ‘the Company’ or together ‘the  Companies’) and their respective subsidiaries including the Group’s share of joint arrangements and associates, during the financial year ended  31 December 2022. The ‘Group financial statements’ denotes the financial statements prepared for the Rio Tinto Group. ‘Rio Tinto plc company  financial statements’ denotes the company only financial statements for the UK parent company, Rio Tinto plc. The 'Group financial statements'  and 'Rio Tinto plc company financial statements' taken together are referred to as ‘financial statements’.   What our opinions cover  We have audited the Group financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2022 (‘FY22’) included in the Annual Report and  Accounts, which comprise:   Rio Tinto Group   Group Income Statement  Group Statement of Comprehensive Income  Group Cash Flow Statement  Group Balance Sheet  Group Statement of Changes in Equity  Notesa to the Group financial statements, including summary of Group accounting policies covered on pages 161 to 242 and in the ‘about  presentation of financial statements’ section on pages 148 to 155.  KPMG UK has also audited the UK parent company, Rio Tinto plc’s financial statements for FY22, which comprise the UK parent company  balance sheet on page 243; the UK parent company statement of changes in equity on page 244; and related notes on pages 245 to 248, which  include a description of the significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.  KPMG Australia has considered the Directors’ declaration on page 250, the Reconciliation with Australian Accounting Standards note on page  155 and the Australian Corporations Act – Summary of ASIC relief note on page 249 to be part of the Group financial statements when forming  its opinion under the requirements of the Australian Corporations Act 2001, as amended by the ASIC Order. KPMG Australia has also audited  the Remuneration Report of Rio Tinto Limited included in the Directors’ report for FY22.   Basis for opinions  We conducted our audits in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) (KPMG UK) and Australian Auditing  Standards (“ASAs”) (KPMG Australia) and applicable laws. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’  responsibilities for the audits of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a  sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinions. Our audit opinions are consistent with our report to the Audit and Risk committee. We have  fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the  FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities; the Australian Corporations Act 2001 as amended by the ASIC Order; and the  relevant ethical requirements of the Australian Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional  Accountants (including Independence Standards).     a  KPMG UK has considered the ‘about presentation of financial statements’ section on pages 148 to 155 and notes 1 – 40 and note 42 and KPMG Australia has considered the ‘about presentation of financial  statements’ section on pages 148 to 155 and notes 1 – 42 in forming their respective opinions.  251 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Independent auditors’ reports  ===== PAGE 254 =====       Independent auditors’ reports   of KPMG LLP (‘KPMG UK’) to the members of Rio Tinto plc   and of KPMG (‘KPMG Australia’) to the members of Rio Tinto Limited    2. OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDITS  Factors driving  our view of risks  Following our FY21 audits, and considering developments affecting the Rio Tinto Group since then, our assessment  of risks and our view of how these impact the audit of the financial statements have been updated for the current  year where needed.   The Kitimat and Oyu Tolgoi CGUs were tested for impairment in FY21, with significant estimation uncertainty  inherent in key assumptions. Our assessment is that the risk has reduced following these impairment tests based on  our understanding of these CGUs’ markets and lack of indicators in the current year. Our focus has been on changes  in the macro-economic environment and long-term forecast commodity prices, which in addition to operational  performance or development of these CGUs were the key factors driving our view of risks.   Our assessment of risk on specific closure provisions remained consistent. The increase in significance as a result of  volatility in macro-economic factors such as closure discount rate was neutralised by the reduction of sites with new  closure studies. The closure provision for certain sites within Iron Ore remains a key audit matter (‘KAM’) in FY22,  while closure provisions at Gove refinery and Energy Resources of Australia, which formed a part of this KAM in FY21,  were no longer assessed to be of such significance as to be included in FY22.   Our assessment of risk in respect to the Group’s uncertain tax positions has reduced resulting from the Group’s  settlement with Australian Taxation Office (‘ATO’) earlier in FY22, and is therefore no longer considered a Key Audit  Matter.   Our assessment of risk of recoverability of the UK Parent company’s investment in subsidiaries has remained  consistent and remains as a Key Audit Matter for the UK Parent company.

KPMG are invited to attend all Audit and Risk  committee meetings and are provided with an opportunity to meet with the AC in private sessions without Executive  Directors or management being present. For each Key Audit Matter, we have set out communications with the Audit  and Risk committee in Section 4, including matters that required particular judgement for each.   The matters included in the Audit and Risk committee Chair’s report on page 105 are materially consistent with our  observations of those meetings.     Our  independence  We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain  independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements  including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest  entities; the Australian Corporations Act 2001 as amended by the ASIC  Order; and the relevant ethical requirements of the Australian  Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of  Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards).  Apart from the matters noted below, we have not performed any non- audit services during the year ended 31 December 2022 or subsequently  which are prohibited by the FRC Ethical Standard.  During 2023, we identified that certain KPMG member firms had  provided preparation of local GAAP financial statement services or  language translation services over the period 2020 to 2022 to certain  group entities. The entities to which the services were provided were not  material to the group and no audit procedures were performed on these  entities for the purpose of the group audit. The services, which have been  terminated, were administrative in nature and did not involve any  management decision-making or bookkeeping. The work was undertaken  after the group audit opinion was signed by KPMG LLP for the impacted  financial years and had no direct or indirect effect on Rio Tinto’s  consolidated financial statements.

OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDITS (CONT’D)  Our  independence  (cont’d)  In our professional judgement, we confirm that based on our assessment of the breach, our integrity and objectivity  as auditor has not been compromised and we believe that an objective, reasonable and informed third party would  conclude that the provision of these services would not impair our integrity or objectivity for any of the impacted  financial years. The audit and risk committee concurred with this view.  We were first appointed as auditors by the members for the financial year ended 31 December 2020. The period of  total uninterrupted engagement is for the three financial years ended 31 December 2022. The Group engagement  partners are required to rotate every 5 years. Trevor Hart and Jonathan Downer are required to rotate off after the  FY24 and FY25 audits respectively. The average tenure of partners responsible for component audits is 2.8 years,  with the shortest being 2 years and the longest being 3 years.    Materiality   (Section 6 below)  The scope of our work is influenced by our view of materiality and our assessment of the risks of material  misstatement.   We have determined overall materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole at US$700m (FY21:  US$700m). For both FY22 and FY21, we determined profit before taxation to be an appropriate benchmark for our  assessment of materiality. The materiality represented 3.8% of this benchmark in FY22 (FY21: 2.3% of adjusted profit  before taxation). In FY21, we adjusted profit before taxation to exclude certain items that were significant and did  not represent normal, continuing operations in determining our materiality. This exclusion was US$269m related to  the net pre-tax impairment charge of US$269m on the Group’s Kitimat asset. There were no such significant items  to adjust the profit before taxation for in FY22 in determining materiality.  KPMG UK has determined the overall materiality for Rio Tinto plc company financial statements as a whole at  US$500m (FY21: US$500m). Consistent with FY21, we determined total assets remained the benchmark for Rio Tinto  plc company financial statements. The materiality represented 1% (FY21: 1%) of this benchmark.                        Group scope   (Section 7 below)  We performed our risk assessment and planning procedures to determine which of the Group’s components are  likely to include risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, the type of procedures to be  performed at these components and the extent of involvement required from our component auditors around the  world. We identified those components which we considered to be of individual financial significance, those which  were significant due to risk and those remaining components on which we required procedures to be performed to  provide us with the evidence to conclude on the group financial statements as a whole. Refer to section 7 below for  further detail of these components.   We consider the scope of our audits, as communicated with the Audit and Risk committee, to be an appropriate  basis for our audit opinions.

OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDITS (CONT’D)  The impact of  climate change  on our audits  As a part of our risk assessment throughout the audits, we considered the potential impacts of climate change on  the Group’s business and the financial statements, based on our knowledge of the Group’s operations and their  stated strategy with respect to climate change. Recognising the increased shareholder focus on the impact of climate  change in financial reporting and financial statement audits, we are providing enhanced disclosure on the impact of  climate change on our audit in this report. We do not identify the impact of climate change as a separate Key Audit  Matter in our audit given the nature of the Group’s operations, the impact of climate on Group’s key judgements  and estimates and the resulting impact on our audit effort.  The context of climate change for the Group  The Group does not mine or extract hydrocarbons such as coal, natural gas, or oil, however, it does emit greenhouse  gases directly from energy used in its mining operations, the processing of metals and minerals, and the  transportation of its products. Certain of the Group’s products are used in energy and carbon intensive industries  including steel and aluminium production. Other of the Group’s products, such as copper, are expected to continue  to be important in the transition to a low-carbon economy.   As explained within page 152 of the Group’s financial statements, the Group, in FY21 announced updated targets to  reduce scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions relative to its 2018 baseline by 15% in 2025, by 50% in 2030 and an aim to  achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The Group has since disclosed its expectation to make capital expenditure of  US$7.5 billion associated with decarbonisation projects, including around US$1.5 billion in the next three years.  Climate change scenarios  The Group uses climate change scenarios to support its strategic decision making, capital allocation and financial  reporting. In the current year, the Group has redefined its climate change scenarios, which now include the  ‘Competitive leadership’ and ‘Fragmented Leadership’ as its two core scenarios, also used to generate a central  reference case for commodity forecasts and valuations. The Group has also formulated an ‘Aspirational leadership’  scenario which, although aligned to the Group’s view of the stretch goals of the Paris Agreement, is not considered  by the Group to be a core scenario. Refer pages 152 and 153 where the Group details these scenarios.  Group’s assessment of financial reporting consequences  IFRS requires the Group’s financial reporting to be based, amongst other things, on the Group’s best estimate of  assumptions that are reasonable and supportable as at the date of reporting. Those assumptions may not align with  the ways in which the global economy, society and government policies will need to change to meet the targets to  limit global warming to 1.5oc which is aligned with the stretch goal of the 2015 COP 21 Paris Agreement.   The Group has detailed how it has considered the financial reporting consequences of climate change on pages 152  to 155 of the financial statements including cross references where further disclosure is included in notes to the  Group financial statements.   Our audit response  General risk assessment procedures  As part of our risk assessment procedures, we made enquiries, with the assistance of our sustainability specialists,  of key members of management. Our enquiries focussed on understanding the progress of the Group’s climate  related strategy and identifying those areas where climate change could have a potential material impact on the  financial statements. Our enquiries also focussed on understanding the progress made by the Group in meeting its  revised Scope 1 and Scope 2 targets, announced in FY21, and understanding the Group’s actual capital expenditure  in relation to its decarbonisation strategy compared to that planned. We involved our sustainability specialists in our  internal risk assessment and planning discussions, where we discussed the Group’s climate strategy, and considered  potential material impacts to the financial statements.   Specific risk assessment procedures with regards to recoverable value of the Group’s assets, consideration of asset  obsolescence and assessment of useful economic lives  As the Group continues to progress its climate change strategy, we have considered the impact of climate change  when evaluating indicators of impairment of property, plant and equipment for the cash-generating units (‘CGUs’)  in-scope for the Group audit for FY22. In FY21, we had included our evaluation of the impairment assessment in the  Oyu Tolgoi and Kitimat CGUs in our Key Audit Matter (‘KAM’). We had involved sustainability specialists to assist in  understanding the Group’s approach to incorporating the impacts of climate change into the pricing process and  comparing carbon pricing assumptions to publicly available information. In FY22 the KAM was evaluating whether  there were indicators of impairment or reversal of impairment that would, in turn, require a full impairment test to  be performed.

OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDITS (CONT’D)  The impact of  climate change  on our audits  Our audit response (cont’d)  As part of our risk assessment, we made specific enquiries to assess risk of material misstatement arising from the  Group’s progress on its stated climate strategy. Our enquiries with Group personnel and other risk assessment  procedures included:  •  whether the solar power plant commissioned at Gudai-Darri has affected associated energy contracts or useful  lives of power infrastructure in the Pilbara;  •  the status of the Group’s plan to electrify its existing fleet, including locomotives in the Pilbara and  considerations for asset obsolescence or re-estimation of useful lives;  •  the status of the plans relating to renewable energy solutions for Queensland Aluminium assets including  expectations of timing compared to the current economic life of related assets. We also assessed these  expectations against our understanding of the industry with the assistance of our sustainability specialists;   •  understanding the Group’s process to continue assessing the impact of climate change on physical risk to its  operations and accounting impact, if any. This included understanding whether physical risk had impacted the  Group’s judgement on the useful economic life of its water rights in Quebec (currently indefinite); and  •  understanding the indicators which led to the impairment of the Boyne Smelters and its relevance to other  assets of the Group.  As a result of our risk assessment procedures, taking into account factors such as the stage of development and  expected timing of asset replacement projects compared to existing useful economic lives, we have not identified a  risk of material misstatement to these financial statements relating to the group’s progress on its stated climate  strategy.  As the Group continues implementing its climate strategy, there may be material accounting considerations and  consequences in the future, including impact on recoverable amounts of key assets as well re-estimation of useful  economic lives.   Other audit procedures  During the course of our audits, we carried out the following additional audit procedures:  •  we evaluated the Group’s processes for disclosures related to climate change in the financial statements;  •  we have evaluated certain material closure provisions of the Group, cost estimates of which consider impact of  climate change. This consideration was not so significant as to warrant separate discussion in our KAM on  evaluation of specific provisions for close-down, restoration and environmental;  •  we evaluated the Group’s disclosure on coal royalties, disclosed in note 24;  •  we read the disclosures related to climate change in the Directors’ Report and Strategic Report, including the  TCFD recommended disclosures, and considered its consistency with the financial statements and our audit  knowledge; and  •  we assessed the consistency between the Group’s estimate of the capital expenditure planned for  decarbonisation of US$7.5 billion with the cash flows used in its going concern and viability assessments.     255 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Independent auditors’ reports  ===== PAGE 258 =====       Independent auditors’ reports   of KPMG LLP (‘KPMG UK’) to the members of Rio Tinto plc   and of KPMG (‘KPMG Australia’) to the members of Rio Tinto Limited    3. GOING CONCERN, VIABILITY AND PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES (KPMG UK ONLY)  The Directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the UK parent company or  the Group or to cease their operations, and they have concluded that the UK parent company’s and the Group’s financial position means that  this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to  continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements (“the going concern period”).  Going concern  We used our knowledge of the Group, its industry, and the general  economic environment to identify the inherent risks to its business model  and analysed how those risks might affect the Group’s financial resources  or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks  we consider as most relevant to the level of the Group’s financial  resources over this period relate to levels of demand and commodity  pricing of key products.  We critically assessed the assumptions in the Directors’ downside  scenarios relevant to liquidity and covenant metrics, in particular in  relation to revenue growth by assessing:  •  The directors’ forecasting by comparing previous forecasts with  actual results;  •  The assumptions in the Group’s forecast of reasonably possible  downsides; and  •  The impact of applying more severe downside scenarios  The extent of our work was influenced by the level of liquidity. We also  assessed the completeness of the going concern disclosure.  Accordingly, based on those procedures, we found the directors’ use of  the going concern basis of accounting without any material uncertainty  for the Group and UK Parent Company to be acceptable. However, as we  cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events  may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were  reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a  guarantee that the Group or the Parent Company will continue in  operation.  Our conclusions  We consider that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis  of accounting in the preparation of the Group’s and UK parent  company’s financial statements is appropriate.  We have not identified, and concur with the Directors’  assessment that there is not a material uncertainty related to  events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast  significant doubt on the Group’s or UK parent company's ability  to continue as a going concern for the going concern period.  We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in  relation to the Directors’ statement in the section ‘about the  presentation of financial statements’ in the financial  statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting  with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt  over the Group and UK parent company’s use of that basis for  the going concern period, and we found the going concern  disclosure in to be acceptable.  The related statement under the UK Listing Rules set out on  page 141 is materially consistent with the financial statements  and our audit knowledge.    Disclosures on emerging and principal risks and longer-term viability  Our responsibility   We are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency  between the directors’ disclosures in respect of emerging and principal risks and the viability  statement, and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.   Based on those procedures, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:    the directors’ confirmation within the longer-term viability statement on page 78 that they  have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Group,  including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and  liquidity;    the Principal Risks and uncertainties disclosures describing these risks and how emerging  risks are identified and explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and    the directors’ explanation in the longer-term viability statement of how they have assessed  the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they considered  that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable  expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as  they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing  attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.  We are also required to review the longer-term viability statement set out on page 78 under the  Listing Rules.  Our work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only the knowledge acquired  during our financial statements audits. As we cannot predict all future events or conditions and  as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were  reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of anything to report on these statements  is not a guarantee as to the Group’s and UK parent company’s longer-term viability.  Our reporting  We have nothing material to add or  draw attention to in relation to these  disclosures.  We  have  concluded  that  these  disclosures are materially consistent  with the financial statements and our  audit knowledge.

KEY AUDIT MATTERS  What we mean  Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audits of the current year financial  statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including  those which had the greatest effect on:   •  the overall audit strategies;   •  the allocation of resources in the audits; and  •  directing the efforts of the engagement teams.   We include below the key audit matters for the Group and Company, in decreasing order of audit significance, together with our principal audit  procedures to address those matters and, as required for public interest entities, our results from those procedures. These matters were  addressed in the context of, and our results are based on procedures undertaken for the purpose of our audits of the financial statements as  a whole and in forming our opinions thereon, and consequently are incidental to those opinions, and we do not provide separate opinions on  these matters.   4.1 Evaluation of indicators of impairment or impairment reversal of property, plant and equipment in specific cash  generating units (‘CGU’)  Financial statement elements  Our assessment of risk vs FY21  Our results    FY22  FY21    The Kitimat and Oyu Tolgoi CGUs were tested for  impairment in FY21, with significant estimation  uncertainty inherent in key assumptions. Our  assessment is that the risk has reduced following  these  impairment  tests  based  on  our  understanding of these CGUs’ markets and lack of  indicators in the current year. Our focus has been  on changes in the macro-economic environment  and long-term forecast commodity prices, which in  addition  to  operational  performance  or  development of these CGUs were the key factors  driving our view of risks.   FY22: Acceptable   (FY21: Acceptable)b  Carrying value of the Oyu  Tolgoi copper-gold mine  (‘Oyu Tolgoi’ or ‘OT’)  Included in  US$64,734m of property,  plant and  equipment  US$11.8b  Carrying value of the  Kitimat smelter (‘Kitimat’)  US$3,323m  Description of the Key Audit Matter  Our response to the risk  The Group has determined that there were no indicators of  impairment or impairment reversal of property, plant and  equipment in the Oyu Tolgoi and Kitimat CGUs.   The assessment of whether indicators of impairment or  impairment reversal exist over the Oyu Tolgoi, and Kitimat  CGUs is a key audit matter due to:  •  the history of impairments in these CGUs meaning they  are more susceptible to further indicators of  impairment or an impairment reversal;  •  the complex nature of the indicators, requiring  involvement of valuation specialists alongside our  senior audit team members; and  •  the level of auditor judgement required in challenging  the Group’s determination that there were no  indicators of impairment or impairment reversal.  We focussed on the internal and external factors impacting  the CGUs, including:  •  volatility in forecast long term commodity prices which  are subject to greater uncertainty in the current  economic environment and its impact on the assessment  of indicators impairment or impairment reversal for  these CGUs.  Our procedures to address the risk included:  Control operation  Evaluating the design, implementation and testing the operating  effectiveness of certain internal controls of the Group related to the  identification of indicators of impairment or impairment reversal of  property, plant and equipment for the Oyu Tolgoi and Kitimat CGUs.  Tests of detail  We performed the following procedures to challenge the Group’s  determination of indicators of impairment or impairment reversal:  •  evaluated the Group’s assessment with reference to our knowledge of  the Group, our industry experience, current conditions and  requirements of IAS 36 – Impairment of Assets; and  •  involved our valuation professionals with specialised skills and  knowledge who assisted us in assessing the forecast long-term  commodity prices used in the Group’s assessments, by comparing  them to market consensus forecasts.  Specifically, for the Oyu Tolgoi CGU we,  •  evaluated the impact of the Group’s reforecast of timing, production  and costs resulting from the updates to the development of the  underground mine in the current year by comparing them with these  assumptions used in the FY21 impairment assessment, subjected to  audit testing; and  •  evaluated the transaction to acquire the remaining shareholding of  TRQ as a potential indicator of impairment or impairment reversal.        b  In FY21, the Oyu Tolgoi and Kitimat cash generating units were assessed for impairment, after identifying indicators of impairment, with acceptable results.  257 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Independent auditors’ reports  ===== PAGE 260 =====       Independent auditors’ reports   of KPMG LLP (‘KPMG UK’) to the members of Rio Tinto plc   and of KPMG (‘KPMG Australia’) to the members of Rio Tinto Limited      4. KEY AUDIT MATTERS (CONT’D)  4.1 Evaluation of indicators of impairment or impairment reversal of property, plant and equipment in specific cash  generating units (‘CGU’) (cont’d)  Description of the Key Audit Matter  Our response to the risk  Specifically, for Oyu Tolgoi CGU,  •  the transaction to acquire the minority shareholding of  Turquoise Hill Resources Limited (‘TRQ’); and  •  schedule of the underground mine development and  the associated forecast capital costs.   Specifically, for Kitimat CGU,  •  operational performance, including forecast timing and  volume of production, post the 2021 workforce strikes.  Refer to note 4, and the Audit and Risk committee’s views set  out on page 105.  Specifically, for the Kitimat CGU we,  •  critically compared the timing and volume of forecast production,  including the pace of return to full capacity following the workforce  strikes in FY21, to the assumptions used in the impairment  assessment at the previous year end, subjected to audit testing.  Assessing disclosures  We assessed the related disclosures in note 4, for compliance with the  relevant accounting and reporting requirements and against the results of  our work.  Communications with the Rio Tinto Audit and Risk committee  Our discussions with and reporting to the Audit and Risk committee included:  •  Change in the significance of the risk from FY21;  •  Factors listed above which impacted our assessment of the risk for the Oyu Tolgoi and Kitimat CGUs;  •  Key procedures performed to respond to the risk as listed above; and  •  Involvement of our own specialist, who assisted us in assessing the forecast commodity prices.  Areas of particular auditor judgement  The evaluation of the transaction of the Group to acquire the minority shareholding of TRQ as a potential indicator of impairment or  impairment reversal was an area of particular judgement, by the Group and us.  Our results  Based on the risk identified and our procedures performed, we found the Group’s determination of no indicators of impairment or  impairment reversal in respect of Oyu Tolgoi and Kitimat cash generating units (CGUs) to be acceptable.      4.2 Evaluation of specific provisions for close-down, restoration and environmental obligations (‘closure provisions’)  Financial statement elements  Our assessment of risk vs FY21  Our results    FY22  FY21   Our assessment of risk on provision for specific  closure provisions remained consistent. The  increase in significance as a result of volatility in  macro-economic factors such as closure  discount rate was neutralised by the reduction  of sites with new closure studies. The closure  provision for certain sites within Iron Ore  remains a key audit matter (‘KAM’) in FY22,  while closure provisions at Gove refinery and  Energy Resources of Australia, which formed a  part of this KAM in FY21, were no longer  assessed to be of such significance as to be  included in FY22.  FY22: Acceptable   (FY21: Acceptable)c  Carrying value of the  closure provisions for  certain sites within Rio  Tinto Iron ore (‘Pilbara’)  Included in  US$15,759m  Included in  US$14,542m      c  In the previous year, conclusion on the KAMs included closure provisions at Iron Ore, Gove refineries and Energy Resources of Australia.  Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 258  ===== PAGE 261 =====       Independent auditors’ reports   of KPMG LLP (‘KPMG UK’) to the members of Rio Tinto plc   and of KPMG (‘KPMG Australia’) to the members of Rio Tinto Limited    4. KEY AUDIT MATTERS (CONT’D)  4.2 Evaluation of specific provisions for close-down, restoration and environmental obligations (‘closure provisions’)  (cont’d)  Description of the Key Audit Matter  Our response to the risk  The Group incurs legal and constructive obligations for close- down and restoration activities which include the  dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, the removal of  residual materials and the remediation of disturbed areas for  mines and certain refineries and smelters. Generally, there is  relatively limited activity within the Group or broader  industry of completing large scale restoration and  rehabilitation projects, and elements of restoration and  rehabilitation of each site are relatively unique to the site. As  such, there are limited comparable historical precedents  against which to benchmark estimates of future costs, which  increases estimation uncertainty for the Group, and  increases audit focus for us.  A significant proportion of the Group’s assets have long  remaining lives, which also increases the estimation  uncertainty relating to the rehabilitation activities required  and the timing and amount of the associated future cash  flows. Because of this, the effect of the time value of money  is material.  Close-down, restoration and environmental remediation  activities are governed by a combination of legislative  requirements, and the Group’s policies. These vary across  location, product and operation.  The Group has disclosed that the determination of when an  estimate associated with close-down, restoration and  environmental obligations is sufficiently reliable to update is  an area of judgement that may have a significant effect on  the amounts recognised in the financial statements.  The evaluation of closure provisions for certain sites within  Rio Tinto Iron ore (‘Pilbara’) is a key audit matter due to the  significant amount of the provision and the judgement and  specialised skills involved in our audit testing of key  assumptions used by the Group to determine the provision  including:  •  the future close-down and restoration costs including  costs associated to post-closure monitoring (‘closure  costs’);   •  the life of the operation and the nature and timing of  closure and rehabilitation activities; and  •  the discount rate.  Refer to note 14, and the Audit and Risk committee’s views  set out on page 105.  Our procedures to address the risk included:  Control operation  Evaluating the design, implementation and testing the operating  effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Group’s process to  estimate provisions for close-down, restoration and environmental  obligations over the Group’s selection of key assumptions to be used.   Tests of detail  •  We evaluated the scope, competency and objectivity of the Group’s  experts, both internal and/or external to the Group, who produce the  cost estimates by examining the work they were involved to perform,  their professional qualifications and experience;   •  We inspected the most recent closure studies and other technical  material prepared by the Group relating to changes in the closure  provision to assess the nature and scope of restoration work planned  to be undertaken. This included assumptions relating to the life of the  operation and the nature and timing of closure and rehabilitation  activities and strategy;  •  We compared a sample of previous forecast cost assumptions to  actual costs to assess the Group’s ability to accurately forecast closure  costs;  •  Using a sample, we compared the nature, timing and quantum of costs  contained in the Group’s provisions to the Group’s third-party expert  report and internal and external underlying documentation; and  •  We evaluated the completeness of the provisions against the Group’s  analysis of where disturbance requires rehabilitation and comparing  to our understanding of the Pilbara sites.   Our closure and valuation expertise  We involved our valuations professionals with specialised skills and  knowledge who assisted in evaluating the discount rate applied by the  Group to calculate the net present value of these provisions. We compared  the discount rate to external data including yields on long-term  government bonds and external market research.   We involved our own environmental professionals with specialised skills  and knowledge who evaluated the methodology applied by the Group’s  third-party experts and assisted us in assessing certain assumptions  regarding the forecast closure costs of closure activities based on their  experience and familiarity with applicable legislative requirements and  industry practice and the Group’s closure commitments.  Assessing disclosures  We have assessed the disclosures in note 14 of the Group financial  statements, including the accounting policy, using our understanding  obtained from our testing, against the requirements of the accounting  standard. This included evaluating the current and non-current closure  provision disclosure for consistency to the planned timing of the  expenditure as well as evaluating the specific disclosure around the  discount rate sensitivity, and whether the disclosure reflected the risks  inherent in the estimation of the provision.  259 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Independent auditors’ reports  ===== PAGE 262 =====       Independent auditors’ reports   of KPMG LLP (‘KPMG UK’) to the members of Rio Tinto plc   and of KPMG (‘KPMG Australia’) to the members of Rio Tinto Limited    4. KEY AUDIT MATTERS (CONT’D)  4.2 Evaluation of specific provisions for close-down, restoration and environmental obligations (‘closure provisions’) (cont’d)  Communications with the Rio Tinto Audit and Risk committee  Our discussions with and reporting to the Audit and Risk committee included:  •  Key procedures performed as listed above;  •  Involvement of our valuation professionals assisting in assessing the discount rates applied by the Group;  •  Involvement of our environmental professionals, for specific provisions within Iron ore, in assessing certain assumptions regarding the  forecast closure costs of closure activities; and  •  Conclusions drawn from our audit procedures  Areas of particular auditor judgement  The discount rate was an area of particular judgement, by the Group and us, given the long-term nature of the estimate and the sensitivity  of the provision to small changes in the rate.  Our results  Based on the risk identified and our procedures performed, we consider that the level of provisions for close-down, restoration and  environmental obligations for certain sites within Rio Tinto Iron ore (‘Pilbara’) to be acceptable.

KEY AUDIT MATTERS (CONT’D)  4.3 Evaluation of recoverability of Rio Tinto plc’s investments in subsidiaries (KPMG UK only)  Financial statement elements  Our assessment of risk vs FY21  Our results    FY22  FY21   Our assessment of risk of recoverability of Rio  Tinto plc’s investment in its subsidiaries of  the Group has remained consistent and  remains as a Key Audit Matter for the UK  Parent company.  FY22: Acceptable   (FY21: Acceptable)  Carrying value of Rio  Tinto plc’s investments  in Group companies  US$36,250m  US$36,280m  Description of the Key Audit Matter  Our response to the risk  In respect of KPMG UK’s audit of the UK parent company, Rio  Tinto plc, the sole key audit matter relates to the  recoverability of its investment in its subsidiaries of the  Group. The carrying amount of the UK parent Company’s  investments in subsidiaries as noted in Note B of the Rio  Tinto plc company financial statements represents 70.7%  (FY21: 68.7%) of the UK parent Company’s total assets.  Their recoverability is not at a high risk of significant  misstatement or subject to significant judgement.  However, due to the value of these investments in the  context of the UK parent company, Rio Tinto plc’s financial  statements, this is the area that had the greatest effect  overall on our UK parent company audit.  Refer to note B of the Rio Tinto plc company financial  statements on page 246.  We performed the tests below rather than seeking to rely on any of the  company’s controls because the nature of the balance is such that we  would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed  procedures described.   Our procedures to address the risk included:  Tests of detail  We performed the following procedures:  •  compared the carrying amount of its investments with the relevant  subsidiaries’ draft balance sheet to identify whether their net assets,  being an approximation of their minimum recoverable amount, were  in excess of their carrying amount; and  •  evaluating the UK parent company’s considerations of indicators of  impairment or impairment reversal of the Group’s CGUs within the  subsidiaries owned by the UK parent company.  Communications with the Audit and Risk committee  Our discussions with and reporting to the Audit and Risk committee included:  We reported to the Audit and Risk committee that based on the risk identified and our procedures performed, we found the company’s  conclusion that there is no impairment of its investments in subsidiaries to be acceptable.   Areas of particular auditor judgement  There were no areas of particular auditor judgement.  Our results  We reported to the Audit and risk committee that based on the risk identified and our procedures performed, we found the company’s  conclusion that there is no impairment of its investments in subsidiaries to be acceptable.    Key Audit Matter for FY21, not considered to be a Key Audit Matter in FY22    We continue to perform procedures over the Group’s uncertain tax positions, particularly disputes with the Mongolian Tax Authority  (‘MTA’) regarding transaction related issues. However, the Group’s settlements with Australian Taxation Office (‘ATO’) earlier in FY22  resulted in a significant reduction in the total exposure to the Group and in the level of judgement required by the Group in assessing  uncertain tax positions. As such, we have not assessed this as one of the matters of most significance in our current year audit and,  therefore, it is not separately identified as a Key Audit Matter in our report this year.     261 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Independent auditors’ reports  ===== PAGE 264 =====       Independent auditors’ reports   of KPMG LLP (‘KPMG UK’) to the members of Rio Tinto plc   and of KPMG (‘KPMG Australia’) to the members of Rio Tinto Limited    5. KPMG UK’S REPORTING ON OUR ABILITY TO DETECT IRREGULARITIES, AND OUR RESPONSE   Fraud – Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatements due to fraud  Fraud risk  assessment  To identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud (“fraud risks”) we assessed events or conditions that could  indicate an incentive or pressure by the Directors and other management to commit, or provide an opportunity to  commit, fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:  •  Enquiries of the Directors, other management, internal audit and the Audit and Risk committee, including  obtaining and reviewing supporting documentation, concerning the Group’s policies and procedures relating  to:  o  detecting and responding to the risks of fraud; and  o  internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud;  •  Enquiries of the Directors, other management, internal audit and the Audit and Risk committee as to whether  they had knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;  •  Reading Board and Audit and Risk committee minutes;  •  Considering remuneration incentive schemes and performance targets for Directors and other management,  including the flexed and unflexed underlying earnings and STIP free cash flow target ranges for executive  remuneration;   •  Using analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships between financial statement  line items; and  •  Discussions among the engagement team regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial  statements and any potential indicators of fraud. The engagement team includes audit partners and staff who  have extensive experience of working with companies in the mining sector, and this experience was relevant  to the discussion about where fraud risks may arise. The discussions also involved our own forensic specialists  to assist us in identifying fraud risks based on discussions of the circumstances of the Group, who advised the  engagement team of fraud schemes that had arisen in similar sectors and industries and participated in the  initial fraud risk assessment discussions.    Risk  communications  We communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud  throughout the audits. This included communication from the group audit team to component audit teams of  relevant fraud risks identified at the group level and requests to component audit teams to report to the group audit  team any instances of fraud that could give rise to a material misstatement of the Group financial statements.    Fraud risks   As required by UK auditing standards we addressed the risk of management override of controls and the risk of  fraudulent revenue recognition. In particular we considered the risk that revenue is recorded in the wrong period,  specifically overstated and the risk that Group and component management may be in a position to make  inappropriate accounting entries, and the risk of bias in accounting estimates and judgements.    Procedures to  address fraud  risks   Our audit procedures included evaluating the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness of internal  controls relevant to mitigate these risks.  We also performed substantive audit procedures including:  •  Comparing journal entries to supporting documentation for a selection based on risk including, for example,  those posted by senior finance management, those posted to unusual accounts or those containing unusual  journal descriptions;  •  Assessing significant accounting estimates for bias;  •  Obtaining third party confirmations for all material cash balances; and  •  Assessing when revenue was recognised, particularly focusing on revenue recognised in the days before and  after the year end date, and whether it was recognised in the appropriate year.  Work on the fraud risks was performed by a combination of component auditors and the group audit team.  Laws and regulations – Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement relating to compliance with laws and  regulations  Risk assessment   We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the  financial statements:  •  from our general commercial and mining sector experience;  •  through discussion with the Directors and other management (as required by auditing standards);  •  from inspection of the Group’s regulatory and legal correspondence;  and discussed with the Directors and other management about the policies and procedures regarding compliance  with laws and regulations.  Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 262  ===== PAGE 265 =====       Independent auditors’ reports   of KPMG LLP (‘KPMG UK’) to the members of Rio Tinto plc   and of KPMG (‘KPMG Australia’) to the members of Rio Tinto Limited    5. KPMG UK’S REPORTING ON OUR ABILITY TO DETECT IRREGULARITIES, AND OUR RESPONSE (CONT’D)  Laws and regulations – Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement relating to compliance with laws and  regulations (cont’d)  Risk assessment   As the Group operates in a regulated environment, our assessment of risks of material misstatement also involved  gaining an understanding of control environment including the Group’s higher-level procedures for complying with  regulatory requirements.     Risk  communications  Communication of identified laws and regulations risks was made throughout our team, and we remained alert to  any indications of non-compliance throughout the audits. This included communication from the group audit team  to all component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at group level, and a request for component  auditors to report to the group audit team any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could  give rise to a material misstatement of the Group financial statements.    Direct laws  context and link  to the audits  The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.   Firstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including:  •  financial reporting legislation (including related companies’ legislation);  •  distributable profits legislation;  •  taxation legislation (direct and indirect); and  •  pensions legislation.  We assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related  financial statement items.    Most significant  indirect  law/regulation  areas  Secondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could  have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of  fines or litigation or harm to the Group’s license to operate.   We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect:  •  anti-bribery, fraud and corruption;   •  health and safety legislation;  •  employment and social security legislation;   •  environmental protection legislation; and   •  competition legislation.   Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations  to enquiry of the Directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any.  Therefore, if a breach of law or regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, our audits  will not detect that breach.    Known actual  matters   For the contingent liabilities disclosed in note 37 we assessed disclosures against our understanding from legal  confirmations received from external counsel.    Context    Context of the  ability of the  audits to detect  fraud or  breaches of law  or regulation  Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some  material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our  audits in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and  regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently  limited procedures required by UK auditing standards would identify it.  In addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as fraud may involve collusion,  forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are  designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and  cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.    263 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Independent auditors’ reports  ===== PAGE 266 =====       Independent auditors’ reports   of KPMG LLP (‘KPMG UK’) to the members of Rio Tinto plc   and of KPMG (‘KPMG Australia’) to the members of Rio Tinto Limited    6. OUR DETERMINATION OF MATERIALITY  The scope of our audits was influenced by our application of materiality. We set quantitative thresholds and overlay qualitative considerations  to help us determine the scope of our audits and the nature, timing and extent of our procedures, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements,  both individually and in the aggregate, on the distinct financial statements as a whole.  US$700m   (FY21: US$700m)  Materiality for  the Group  financial  statements as a  whole  What we mean by materiality for the financial statements as a whole  A quantitative reference for the purpose of planning and performing our audits.  Basis for determining materiality and judgements applied  We have determined overall materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole at US$700m (FY21: US$700m).  For both FY22 and FY21, we determined profit before taxation to be an appropriate benchmark for our assessment  of materiality. The materiality represented 3.8% of this benchmark in FY22 (FY21: 2.3% of adjusted profit before  taxation).  In FY21, we adjusted profit before taxation to exclude certain items that were significant and did not represent  normal, continuing operations of the Group in determining our materiality. This exclusion was US$269m related to  the net pre-tax impairment charge of US$269m on the Group’s Kitimat asset. There were no such significant items  to adjust the profit before taxation for in FY22 in determining materiality.  KPMG UK has determined the materiality for Rio Tinto plc company financial statements as a whole at US$500m  (FY21: US$500m). Consistent with FY21, we determined total assets remained the benchmark for Rio Tinto plc  company financial statements. The materiality represented 1% in FY22 (FY21: 1%) of this benchmark.    US$455m   (FY21: US$525m)  Performance  materiality for the  Group financial  statements  What we mean by performance materiality  Our procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to a lower threshold, performance  materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial misstatements in individual  account balances might add up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.  Basis for determining performance materiality and judgements applied  We have considered performance materiality at a level of 65% (FY21: 75%) of materiality for the Rio Tinto Group  financial statements as a whole to be appropriate, equating to US$455m (FY21:US$525m). We lowered the  percentage applied in our determination of performance materiality compared with prior year based on our  expectation of control risk at the start of the audit based on the findings of previous audits.  We have considered performance materiality at a level of 75% (FY21: 75%) of materiality for the Rio Tinto plc  company financial statements as a whole to be appropriate, equating to US$375m (FY21:US$375m). KPMG UK  applied this percentage in the determination of performance materiality because we did not identify any factors  indicating an elevated level of risk.    US$35m   (FY21: US$35m)  Audit  misstatement  posting threshold  for the Group  financial  statements  What we mean by Audit misstatement posting threshold  This is the amount below which identified misstatements are considered to be clearly trivial from a quantitative  point of view. We may become aware of misstatements below this threshold which could alter the nature, timing  and extent of our audit procedures, for example if we identify smaller misstatements which are indicators of fraud.  This is also the amount above which all misstatements identified are communicated to Rio Tinto’s Audit and Risk  committee.  Basis for determining the audit misstatement reporting threshold and judgements applied  We set our audit misstatement posting threshold at 5% (FY21: 5%) of our materiality for both the Group financial  statements and the UK parent company financial statements. This equated to US$35m (FY21: US$35m) for the Group  and US$25m (FY21: US$25m) for the UK parent company. We also report to the Audit and Risk committee any items  that warrant reporting on qualitative grounds.    Materiality for the Group financial statements was set at US$700m (FY21: US$700m) which compared to the following main Group financial  statement caption amounts as follows:       Total Group revenue  Group profit before  taxation  Total Group assets  FY22  Group financial statement caption  US$55,554m  US$18,662m  US$96,744m  FY22  Group materiality as % of caption  1.3%  3.8%  0.7%            FY21  Group financial statement caption  US$63,495m  US$30,833m  US$102,896m  FY21  Group materiality as % of caption  1.1%  2.3%  0.7%  Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 264  ===== PAGE 267 =====       Independent auditors’ reports   of KPMG LLP (‘KPMG UK’) to the members of Rio Tinto plc   and of KPMG (‘KPMG Australia’) to the members of Rio Tinto Limited    7. THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDITS  Group scope  What we mean  How we determined the procedures to be performed across the Group:  In order to determine the work performed at a component, and after performing relevant risk assessment and  planning procedures, we identified those components which we considered to be of individual financial significance,  those which were significant due to risk and those remaining components on which we required procedures to be  performed to provide us with the evidence in order to conclude on the group financial statements as a whole.  We determined individually financially significant components as those contributing at least 10% (FY21: 10%) of Total  revenue or Total assets. We selected these metrics because these are the most representative of the relative size of  the components. We identified four (FY21: four) components as individually financially significant components and  performed full scope audits on these components.  We further identified three (FY21: three) components as significant due to risk of material misstatement associated  to revenue and one (FY21: three) component as significant due to risk of material misstatement associated to  provision for closedown, restoration, and environmental obligations. Of the four (FY21: six) components identified  as significant due to risk, we performed full scope audits for two components (FY21: two), and performed audits of  one or more account balances on two components (FY21: four).  In addition, to enable us to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence for the group financial statements as a  whole, we selected nine (FY21: ten) components on which to perform procedures. Of these components, we  performed full scope audits for three components (FY21: two), and performed audits of one or more account  balances on six components (FY21: eight).      Range of component  materialities applied FY22  Number of components   (reflecting FY22 reporting structure)  FY22  FY21  Full scope audits  US$75m - US$425m (FY21: US$75m - US$425m)  9  8  Audits of one or more account balances  US$65m - US$150m  (FY21: US$54m - US$150m)  8  12  Total    17  20  Certain Group sales and purchase transactions that originate in various countries are processed in Singapore and  Delhi respectively where we have established audit teams to perform testing on behalf of our component teams.  Our audit teams in Singapore and Delhi, while performing procedures on transactions, also test key underlying  Group controls.   We have also performed audit procedures centrally across the Group, in the following key areas:   •  Testing of IT systems and configurations;   •  Consolidation of the financial information;  •  Climate considerations and impact on the financial statements;  •  Identifying journal entries with a defined high-risk criteria; and  •  Pensions and post-retirement benefits.  The components within the scope of our work accounted for the following percentages of the Group’s total  revenue, profit before taxation and total assets:    Total Group revenue  Group profit before  taxation  Total Group assets  Full scope audits  82% (FY21: 77%)  69% (FY21: 70%)  71% (FY21: 64%)  Audits of one or more account balances   5% (FY21: 19%)  13% (FY21: 19%)  16% (FY21: 23%)  Remaining components  13% (FY21: 04%)  18% (FY21: 11%)  13% (FY21: 13%)    None of the remaining components individually represented more than 3% (FY21: 2%) of any of total Group revenue,  total profits and losses making up Group profit before taxation or Group assets. The work on 20 of the 21 in-scope  components (FY21: 16 of the 17 components, reflecting FY22 reporting structure) was performed by KPMG member  firms with the remaining component audited by a non-KPMG component auditor. In addition, we have performed  Group level analysis on the remaining components to determine whether further risks of material misstatement  exist in those components. The audit of the UK parent company, Rio Tinto plc company financial statements was  performed by the group audit team.  Approach on controls  For the audit of the Group financial statements, we were able to rely upon the Group’s internal controls over financial  reporting in several areas of our audit, where our controls testing supported this approach, which enabled us to  reduce the scope of our substantive audit work; in the other areas the scope of the audit work performed was fully  substantive. For the audit of the Rio Tinto plc company financial statements, the scope of the audit work performed  was fully substantive.      265 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Independent auditors’ reports  ===== PAGE 268 =====       Independent auditors’ reports   of KPMG LLP (‘KPMG UK’) to the members of Rio Tinto plc   and of KPMG (‘KPMG Australia’) to the members of Rio Tinto Limited      7. THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT (CONT’D)  Group audit team  oversight  What we mean  The extent of the Group audit team’s involvement in component audits.  In working with component auditors, we:  •  Held planning calls with component audit teams to discuss the significant areas of the audit relevant to the  components, including the key audit matters in respect of:   o  Evaluation of indicators of impairment or impairment reversal of property, plant and equipment in  specific cash generating units; and  o  Evaluation of specific provisions for close-down, restoration and environmental obligations (‘closure  provisions’).  •  Issued group audit instructions to component auditors on the scope of their work, which included significant  areas to be covered, relevant risks and the information to be reported back. The group audit team approved  the component materialities, which ranged from US$65m to US$425m, having regard to the mix of size and risk  profile of the Group across the components.  •  Held risk workshops with component audit teams before the commencement of the final phases of the audit.  •  As a part of determining and executing the audit plan and strategy, the group audit team physically visited  various Rio Tinto sites, with the component audit teams in the current year, with restrictions in relation to  COVID-19 lifted in most places. This was in addition to frequent video conference held throughout the audit  where we discussed and challenged component teams’ key observations, inspected key work papers related to  significant risks and assessed the conclusions and consistencies between reported findings and work performed.  Sites visited along with our component auditors, where we also held meetings with relevant Rio Tinto personnel:    FY22 FY21  Sites visited  •  Pilbara operations  •  Oyu Tolgoi operations  •  Saguenay operations  •  Kennecott Utah operations  •  Weipa operations  •  Group  services  hub  in  Delhi,  Brisbane, Perth and Montreal  •  Pilbara operations  •  Perth (Southern Hemisphere Hub)            8.

RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES  Directors’ responsibilities for the financial statements  As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 250 of the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for: the preparation  of the financial statements, including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view in accordance with the relevant financial reporting  frameworks; implementing such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that give a  true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group, Rio Tinto plc’s and Rio Tinto  Limited’s ability to continue as a going concern and whether the use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, disclosing, as  applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group,  Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.  Auditors’ responsibilities for the audits of the financial statements  Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or other irregularities, or error, and to issue our opinions in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of  assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) or ASAs will always detect a material misstatement  when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud, other irregularities or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they  could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.  A fuller description of KPMG UK’s responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

The disclosures in this note include certain alternative performance  measures (APMs). For more information on the APMs used by the Group,  including definitions and calculations, please refer to pages 273 to 278. (a) Segmental revenue, Underlying EBITDA and Capital expenditure are  defined and calculated in note 1 from pages 161 to 163. Underlying  Earnings is defined and calculated within the Alternative  performance measures section on pages 274 and 275.  (b) Pilbara represents the Group’s 100% holding in Hamersley, 50%  holding in Hope Downs Joint Venture and 65% holding in Robe  River Iron Associates. The Group’s net beneficial interest in Robe  River Iron Associates is 53%, as 30% is held through a 60% owned  subsidiary and 35% is held through a 100% owned subsidiary. (c) Segmental revenue, Underlying EBITDA, Underlying earnings and  Operating assets within Evaluation projects/other include activities  relating to the shipment and blending of Pilbara and Iron Ore  Company of Canada (IOC) iron ore inventories held at portside in  China and sold to domestic customers. Transactions between  Pilbara and our portside trading business are eliminated through the  Iron Ore “intra-segment” line and transactions between IOC and the  portside trading business are eliminated through “inter-segment  transactions”.  (d) Until 16 December 2022, our interest in Oyu Tolgoi was held  indirectly through our 50.8% investment in Turquoise Hill Resources  Ltd (TRQ), where TRQ’s principal asset was its 66% investment in  Oyu Tolgoi LLC, which owned the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine.  Following the purchase of TRQ we now directly hold a 66%  investment in Oyu Tolgoi LLC.  (e) Simfer Jersey Limited, a company incorporated in Jersey, in which  the Group has a 53% interest, has an 85% interest in Simfer S.A., the  company that manages the Simandou project in Guinea. The Group  therefore has a 45.05% indirect interest in Simfer S.A. These entities  are consolidated as subsidiaries and together referred to as the  Simandou iron ore project. (f) Includes our interests in Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Quebec  Operations (100%), QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM, 80%) and  Richards Bay Minerals (attributable interest of 74%). (g) Includes our interests in Argyle (100%) residual operations which  relates to the sale of remaining inventory and Diavik. Until 18  November 2021 we recognised our 60% share of assets, revenue  and expenses relating to the Diavik joint venture. Liabilities were  recognised according to Diavik Diamond Mine Inc’s contractual  obligations at 100%, with a corresponding 40% receivable or  contingent asset representing the co-owner’s share where  applicable. Post acquisition, we now consolidate (100%) of the  Diavik Diamond Mine. From 1 June 2021, management responsibility  for rehabilitation of the Argyle site moved from Minerals to Rio Tinto  Closure (RTC), hence the Argyle closure is reported in Other  operations effective from 1 January 2021. Refer to (h). (h) Other operations include our 100% interest in the Gove alumina  refinery (under rehabilitation), Rio Tinto Marine, and the remaining  legacy liabilities of Rio Tinto Coal Australia. These include provisions  for onerous contracts, in relation to rail infrastructure capacity, partly  offset by financial assets and receivables relating to contingent  royalties and disposal proceeds. From 16 June 2022, Commercial  Treasury and related central costs are reported as part of ‘Other  operations’ instead of ‘Other items’ in previous periods. We have not  restated prior year balances as the impact was not significant. From  1 January 2021, Uranium moved from Minerals to Other operations  and Argyle closure has been included in Other operations. (i) Capital expenditure is the net cash outflow on purchases less sales  of property, plant and equipment, capitalised evaluation costs and  purchases less sales of other intangible assets as derived from the  Group cash flow statement. The details provided include 100% of  subsidiaries’ capital expenditure and Rio Tinto’s share of the capital  expenditure of joint operations but exclude equity accounted units.  We have adjusted the comparatives for this change in definition. (j) Operating assets of the Group represents equity attributable to Rio  Tinto adjusted for net (debt)/cash. Operating assets of subsidiaries,  joint operations and the Group’s share relating to equity accounted  units are made up of net assets adjusted for net (debt)/cash and  post-retirement assets and liabilities, net of tax. Operating assets are  stated after the deduction of non-controlling interests; these are  calculated by reference to the net assets of the relevant companies  (i.e. inclusive of such companies’ debt and amounts due to or from  Rio Tinto Group companies).  Rio Tinto Financial Information by Business Unit continued Notes to Financial Information by Business Unit Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 272  ===== PAGE 275 ===== The Group presents certain alternative performance measures (APMs) which are reconciled to directly comparable IFRS financial measures below.  These APMs are used by management to assess the performance of the business and provide additional information, which investors may find useful.  APMs are presented in order to give further insight into the underlying business performance of the Group's operations. APMs are not consistently defined and calculated by all companies, including those in the Group’s industry. Accordingly, these measures used by the  Group may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures made by other companies. Consequently, these APMs should not be  regarded as a substitute for the IFRS measures and should be considered supplementary to those measures. The following tables present the Group's key financial measures not defined according to IFRS and a reconciliation between those APMs and their  nearest respective IFRS measures. APMs derived from the income statement The following income statement measures are used by the Group to provide greater understanding of the underlying business performance of its  operations and to enhance comparability of reporting periods. They indicate the underlying commercial and operating performance of our assets  including revenue generation, productivity and cost management. Segmental revenue  Segmental revenue includes consolidated sales revenue plus the equivalent sales revenue of equity accounted units in proportion to our equity  interest (after adjusting for sales to/from subsidiaries). The reconciliation can be found in “Our financial performance” on page 161. Underlying EBITDA Underlying EBITDA represents profit before tax, net finance items, depreciation and amortisation adjusted to exclude the EBITDA impact of items that  do not reflect the underlying performance of  our reportable segments. The reconciliation of profit after tax to underlying EBITDA can be found in  “Our financial performance” on page 163.

Exclusions from underlying earnings are those gains and losses that, individually or in aggregate with similar items, are of a nature and size to require  exclusion in order to provide additional insight into underlying business performance. The following items are excluded from net earnings in arriving at underlying earnings in each year irrespective of materiality:  – Net gains/(losses) on disposal of interests in subsidiaries.  – Impairment charges and reversals.  – Profit/(loss) after tax from discontinued operations.  – Exchange and derivative gains and losses. This exclusion includes exchange gains/(losses) on external net debt and intragroup balances,  unrealised gains/(losses) on currency and interest rate derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting, unrealised gains/(losses) on certain  commodity derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting, and unrealised gains/(losses) on embedded derivatives not qualifying for hedge  accounting. – Adjustments to closure provisions where the adjustment is associated to an impairment charge, for legacy sites where the disturbance or  environmental contamination relates to the pre-acquisition period.  In addition, there is a final judgmental category which includes, where applicable, other credits and charges that, individually or in aggregate if of a  similar type, are of a nature or size to require exclusion in order to provide additional insight into underlying business performance.  Exclusions from underlying earnings relating to equity accounted units are stated after tax and included in the column “Pre-tax”.

In 2021, exchange gains on external net debt and intragroup balances included post-tax foreign exchange  gains on intragroup balances of US$913 million partially offset by post-tax losses of US$187 million on external net debt, primarily as a result of a weakening Australian dollar against the US dollar  during the year. In 2020, exchange losses on external net debt and intragroup balances included post-tax foreign exchange losses on intragroup balances of US$1,330 million partially offset by  post-tax gains of US$205 million on external net debt, primarily as a result of the Australian dollar strengthening against the US dollar. (b) Valuation changes on currency and interest rate derivatives, which are ineligible for hedge accounting, other than those embedded in commercial contracts, and the currency revaluation of  embedded US dollar derivatives contained in contracts held by entities whose functional currency is not the US dollar. (c) Valuation changes on derivatives, embedded in commercial contracts that are ineligible for hedge accounting but for which there will be an offsetting change in future Group earnings. Mark-to- market movements on commodity derivatives entered into with the commercial objective of achieving spot pricing for the underlying transaction at the date of settlement are included in  underlying earnings. (d) During the first half of 2022, LNG Canada elected to terminate their option to purchase additional land and facilities for expansion of their operations at Kitimat, Canada. The resulted gain has  been excluded from underlying earnings consistent with prior years as it is part of a series of transactions that together were material. On 3 December 2021 we gained control over a new wharf at  Kitimat, Canada that was built and paid for by LNG Canada. The gain on recognition was  excluded from underlying earnings on the grounds of individual magnitude and consistency with the  associated impairment charge, refer to note 4.  (e) In 2022 the charge relates to inflationary increases to the closure provision for non-operating and fully impaired sites in excess of the unwind of the discount. On 2 February 2022, Energy  Resources of Australia released preliminary findings from its reforecast of the total undiscounted cost schedule for the Ranger rehabilitation project. Information available from this study resulted  in the Group recording an increase to the closure provision of US$510 million at 31 December 2021. Other increases to closure estimates charged to the income statement in 2021 related to  Diavik, Gove refinery, and a number of the Group's legacy sites where the environmental damage preceded ownership by Rio Tinto. The adjustments at Energy Resources Australia and Gove  refinery were recognised in the income statement as these are non-operating sites, and excluded from underlying earnings due to the magnitude of the individual updates and materiality when  aggregated. In 2020 we recognised an increase in the Diavik closure provision based on preliminary Pre-Feasibility Study findings. On completion of the study in 2021 a true-up was recorded in  the income statement and excluded from underlying earnings in line with the treatment of the initial increase in 2020, which was excluded from underlying earnings as Diavik was fully impaired  during the year. Other closure costs excluded in 2020 were the increase in the Gove refinery closure provision offset by a decrease in the Argyle mine closure provision on completion of Pre- Feasibility Studies at each site. The 2020 comparative also included the net earnings impact (US$138 million loss) in respect of increases to Closure provisions in legacy and non-operating sites  following a reduction of the closure discount rate to 1.5%. When further funding is required, no allocation is made to the non-controlling interests of partially owned legacy sites until the funding is  received.  (f) On 2 August 2022, we completed the sale of a gross production royalty which was retained following the disposal of the Cortez Complex in 2008. The gain recognised on sale of the royalty has  been excluded from underlying earnings on the grounds of individual magnitude. (g) In 2022 we wrote off US$0.8 billion of our deferred tax assets in the United States following the introduction of the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax legislation, refer to note 10. Basic underlying earnings per share Basic underlying earnings per share is calculated as underlying earnings divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the  year.  2022 (cents) 2021  (cents) 2020   (cents) Basic earnings per ordinary share 766.8 1,303.4 604.0 Items excluded from underlying earnings per share(a) 52.8 17.7 165.6 Basic underlying earnings per ordinary share 819.6 1,321.1 769.6 (a) Calculation of items excluded from underlying earnings per share: 2022 2021 2020 Income excluded from underlying earnings (refer to pages 274 and 275) 855 286 2,679 Weighted average number of shares (millions) 1,619.8 1,618.4 1,617.4 Items excluded from underlying earnings per share (cents) 52.8 17.7 165.6 We have provided basic underlying earnings per share as this allows the comparability of underlying financial performance adjusted to exclude items  that do not reflect the underlying performance of the Group's operations. 275 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Financial statements  ===== PAGE 278 ===== Interest cover Interest cover is a financial metric used when managing our risk. It represents the number of times finance income and finance costs (including  amounts capitalised) are covered by profit before taxation before finance income, finance costs, share of profit after tax of equity accounted units  and items excluded from underlying earnings, plus dividends from equity accounted units. 2022 US$m 2021  US$m Profit before taxation 18,662 30,833 Add back Finance income   (179)   (64)  Finance costs   335   243  Share of profit after tax of equity accounted units   (777)   (1,042)  Items excluded from underlying earnings   (49)   508  Add: Dividends from equity accounted units   879   1,431  Calculated earnings   18,871   31,909  Finance income   179   64  Finance costs   (335)   (243)  Add: Amounts capitalised   (416)   (358)  Total finance income/costs before capitalisation   (572)   (537)  Interest cover   33   59  Payout ratio The payout ratio is used by us to guide the dividend policy we implemented in 2016, under which we have sought to return 40-60% of underlying  earnings, on average through the cycle to shareholders as dividends. It is calculated as total equity dividends per share to owners of Rio Tinto  declared in respect of the financial year divided by underlying earnings per share (as defined above). Dividends declared usually include an interim  dividend paid in the year, and a final dividend paid after the end of the year.

This is  equivalent to “Purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets” in the cash flow statement less “Sales of property, plant and  equipment and intangible assets”. This measure is used to support management's objective of effective and efficient capital allocation as we need to invest in existing assets in order to  maintain and improve productive capacity, and in new assets to grow the business. Rio Tinto share of capital investment Rio Tinto’s share of capital investment represents the Group’s economic investment in capital projects. It has been newly introduced during the year  to better represent the Group’s share of funding for capital projects which are jointly funded with other shareholders and which may differ from the  consolidated basis included in the Capital expenditure APM. This better reflects the Group’s approach to capital allocation.  The measure is based upon the Capital expenditure APM, adjusted to deduct equity or shareholder loan financing provided to partially owned  subsidiaries by non-controlling interests in respect of major capital projects in the period. Where funding which would otherwise be provided directly  by shareholders is replaced with project financing, an adjustment is also made to deduct the share of project financing attributable to the non- controlling interest. This adjustment is not made in cases where Rio Tinto has unilaterally guaranteed this project financing. Lastly, funding  contributed by the Group to Equity Accounted Units for its share of investment in their major capital projects is added to the measure. No adjustment  is made to the Capital expenditure APM where capital expenditure is funded from the operating cash flows of the subsidiary or Equity Accounted  Unit.  In the current and prior years the Capital expenditure APM and Rio Tinto share of capital investment are identical.  Free cash flow Free cash flow is defined as net cash generated from operating activities minus purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangibles and  payments of lease principal, plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. This measures the net cash returned by the business after the expenditure of sustaining and development capital. This cash can be used for  shareholder returns, reducing debt and other investing/financing activities. 2022 US$m 2021  US$m 2020  US$m Net cash generated from operating activities   16,134   25,345   15,875  Less: Purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets   (6,750)   (7,384)   (6,189)  Less: Lease principal payments   (374)   (358)   (324)  Add: Sales of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets   —   61   45  Free cash flow   9,010   17,664   9,407  277 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Financial statements  ===== PAGE 280 ===== APMs derived from the balance sheet Net (debt)/cash Net (debt)/cash is total borrowings plus lease liabilities less cash and cash equivalents and other liquid investments, adjusted for derivatives related to  net debt. Net (debt)/cash measures how we are managing our balance sheet and capital structure. Refer to note 19 on page 191 for the reconciliation. Net gearing ratio Net gearing ratio is defined as net (debt)/cash divided by the sum of net debt and total equity at the end of each year.

(g) Cash flow before financing activities is stated before deducting dividends payable to owners of Rio Tinto. (h) Total capital includes equity attributable to owners of Rio Tinto plus net debt and non-controlling interests. (i) Underlying earnings: owners’ equity represents underlying earnings expressed as a percentage of the mean of opening and closing equity attributable to owners of Rio Tinto. (j) Interest cover is a financial metric used when managing our risk. It represents the number of times finance income and finance costs (including amounts capitalised) are covered by profit before  taxation before finance income, finance costs, share of profit after tax of equity accounted units and items excluded from underlying earnings, plus dividends from equity accounted units.

Production figures are sometimes more precise than the rounded numbers  shown, hence small differences may result from calculation of Rio Tinto share of production. The Argyle diamond mine closed on 3 November 2020. Production is included up to that date. 1. Rio Tinto percentage share, shown above, is as at 31 December 2022. The footnotes below include all ownership changes over the three years. 2. Jonquière’s (Vaudreuil) production shows smelter grade alumina only and excludes hydrate produced and used for specialty alumina. 3. Rio Tinto has a 22.95% shareholding in the Sangarédi mine, but benefits from 45% of production. 4. Borate quantities are expressed as B2O3. 5. Production data in the table represents 33.52% ownership in Oyu Tolgoi. On 16 December 2022, we completed the acquisition of 100% of Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd, increasing our ownership in  Oyu Tolgoi from 33.52% to 66%. From 1 January 2023, our share of production will be updated to reflect this change. We will also separately report production from open pit and underground operations. 6. On 17 November 2021, our ownership interest in Diavik increased from 60% to 100%. Production from 1 November 2021 is reported including this change. 7. Includes 100% of production from Paraburdoo, Mount Tom Price, Western Turner Syncline, Marandoo, Yandicoogina, Brockman, Nammuldi, Silvergrass, Channar, Gudai-Darri and the Eastern Range  mines. While we own 54% of the Eastern Range mine, under the terms of the joint venture agreement, Hamersley Iron manages the operation and is obliged to purchase all mine production from the  joint venture and, therefore, all of the production is included in Rio Tinto’s share of production. Our ownership interest in Channar mine increased from 60% to 100%, following conclusion of its  joint venture with Sinosteel Corporation upon reaching planned 290 million tonnes production on 22 October 2020. 8. Quantities comprise 100% of Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Quebec Operations and our 74% share of Richards Bay Minerals’ production. Ilmenite mined in Madagascar is processed in Canada. 9. Energy Resources of Australia (ERA) reports drummed U3O8. ERA ceased processing operations on 8 January 2021, as required by the Ranger Authority. In February 2020, our interest in ERA  increased from 68.4% to 86.3% as a result of new ERA shares issued to Rio Tinto under the Entitlement Offer and Underwriting Agreement to raise funds for the rehabilitation of the Ranger Project  Area. Production is reported including this change from 1 March 2020.  ===== PAGE 285 ===== 283 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Production, Ore Reserves, Mineral Resources and Operations Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves for  Rio Tinto managed operations are reported in  accordance with the Australasian Code for  Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral  Resources and Ore Reserves, 2012 edition  (the JORC Code), as required by the Australian  Securities Exchange (ASX). Rio Tinto also files  an annual report on Form 20-F (Form 20-F)  with the US Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC) and prepares the Form  20-F Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves  in accordance with subpart 1300 of Regulation  S-K (Regulation S-K). Mineral Reserves under  Regulation S-K are the equivalent of Ore  Reserves under ASX. Some variations may  occur between the reporting in accordance  with the JORC Code and Regulation S-K. A Mineral Resource is a concentration or  occurrence of solid material of economic  interest in or on the Earth’s crust in such form,  grade (or quality) and quantity that there are  reasonable prospects for eventual economic  extraction. Estimates of such material are  based largely on geological information with  only preliminary consideration of mining,  economic and other factors. While in the  judgment of the Competent Person there are  realistic expectations that all or part of the  Mineral Resources will eventually become  Proved or Probable Ore Reserves, there is no  guarantee that this will occur, as the result  depends on further technical and economic  studies and prevailing economic conditions in  the future. An Ore Reserve is the economically mineable  part of a Measured and/or Indicated Mineral  Resource. It includes diluting materials and  allowances for losses, which may occur when  the material is mined or extracted. It is defined  by studies at pre-feasibility or feasibility level  as appropriate, with the application of modifying  factors. Such studies demonstrate that, at the  time of reporting, extraction can reasonably  be justified. Rio Tinto’s Mineral Resources are reported   as additional (exclusive) to the reported  Ore Reserves. For Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve  reporting, the JORC Code envisages the use of  reasonable investment assumptions to test the  economic viability of the Ore Reserves and the  reasonable prospects of eventual economic  extraction for the Mineral Resources. To achieve  this, Rio Tinto uses internally generated,  projected long-term commodity prices. Regulation S-K requires the use of a justifiable  commodity price to test the economic viability  of the Mineral Reserves and the reasonable  prospects of economic extraction for the  Mineral Resources, and prices used in  calculating the estimates must be disclosed.  As a result of the commercial sensitivity of  Rio Tinto’s long-term commodity prices,  Rio Tinto uses commercially available consensus  pricing or historical pricing for SEC reporting.  For this reason and others, some Mineral  Resources and Mineral Reserves reported to  the SEC in the Form 20-F may differ from   those Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves  reported below. Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve information  in the following tables is based on information  compiled by Competent Persons (as defined  by the JORC Code), most of whom are full-time  employees of Rio Tinto or related companies.  Each has had a minimum of five years’ relevant  experience and is a member of a recognised  professional body whose members are bound  by a professional code of ethics. These bodies  include the Australasian Institute of Mining and  Metallurgy (AusIMM), Australian Institute of  Geoscientists (AIG) or recognised professional  organisations (RPO). Each Competent Person  consents to the inclusion in this Annual Report  of information they have provided in the form  and context in which it appears. Competent  Persons responsible for the estimates are   listed on page 307, by operation, along with  their professional affiliation, employer, and  accountability for Mineral Resources and/or  Ore Reserves. Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves from  externally managed operations, in which  Rio Tinto holds a minority share, are reported  as received from the managing entity and in  accordance with the JORC Code. Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves from our  managed operations are the responsibility of  the managing directors of the business units  and estimates are carried out by the  Competent Persons. The Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve figures  in the following tables are as of 31 December  2022. Summary data for year end 2021 are  shown for comparison. Metric units are used  throughout. The figures used to calculate  Rio Tinto’s Mineral Resources and Ore  Reserves are more precise than the rounded  numbers shown in the tables, hence small  differences might result if the calculations are  repeated using the tabulated figures. JORC Table 1 reports for new or materially  changed significant deposits are released to  the market; they are also available at   riotinto.com. JORC Table 1, SEC Technical  Report Summaries and NI 43-101 technical  reports generated by non-managed units or  joint venture partners are referenced within the  reporting footnotes, with the location and initial  reporting date identified.  ===== PAGE 286 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 284 1.

Australian iron ore Ore Reserves are all located on State Agreement mining leases. Prior to mining, state government approvals (including environmental and heritage) are required. Reported Ore  Reserves include select areas where one or more approvals remain outstanding. In these areas, it is expected that these approvals will be obtained within the timeframes required in the current  production schedule.  5. Ore Reserves of Brockman Ore are 87.4% Rio Tinto-owned, with the remainder split between the non-Rio Tinto partners in the Bao-HI joint venture and the Hope Downs joint venture.  6. Ore Reserves of Marra Mamba Ore are 79.7% Rio Tinto-owned, with the remainder split between the non-Rio Tinto partners in the Hope Downs joint venture and the Robe River joint venture. 7. Ore Reserves of Pisolite Ore are 80.6% Rio Tinto-owned, with the remainder split between the non-Rio Tinto partners in the Robe River joint venture. 8. Iron Ore Company of Canada Ore Reserves are reported as marketable product (57% pellets and 43% concentrate for sale) at a natural moisture content of 2%. The marketable product is derived  from mined material comprising 675 million dry tonnes at 38% iron, 35% silica, 0.2% alumina, 0.024% phosphorus (Proved) and 401 million dry tonnes at 38% iron, 35% silica, 0.22% alumina, 0.02%  phosphorus (Probable) using process-recovery factors derived from current IOC concentrating and pellet operations. No meaningful relationship has been established between the product and  feed grades of alumina and phosphorus, so these grades cannot be reported for Ore Reserves. Saleable product is produced to meet silica grade specifications, so the Ore Reserve silica grade is  the targeted silica grade for the currently anticipated long-term product mix. Loss on ignition (LOI) is not determined for resource drilling samples, so no estimate of % LOI is available for Ore  Reserves.  ===== PAGE 289 ===== 287 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Production, Ore Reserves, Mineral Resources and Operations Total Ore Reserves  as at 31 December 2022 Rio Tinto  interest Rio Tinto  share  marketable  product Total Ore Reserves  as at 31 December 2021 Tonnage Grade Tonnage Grade Mt % Fe % SiO2 % Al2O3 % P % LOI % Mt Mt % Fe % SiO2 % Al2O3 % P % LOI 1,330 61.9 3.5 2.0 0.13 5.4 87.4 1,163 1,345 62.0 3.5 1.9 0.13 5.3 729 62.0 3.1 1.9 0.06 5.7 79.7 581 649 62.1 3.0 1.8 0.06 5.7 618 57.5 4.8 2.0 0.05 10.5 80.6 498 680 57.6 4.7 2.0 0.05 10.5 2,678 60.9 3.7 2.0 0.09 6.7 2,242 2,675 60.9 3.7 1.9 0.09 6.7 453 65.0 3.0 – – – 58.7 266 483 65.0 3.2 – – – 3,130 61.5 3.6 1.7 0.08 5.7 2,508 3,158 61.5 3.6 1.6 0.08 5.7 Australian iron ore Brockman Ore Rio Tinto interest percentage incorporates changes due to the signing of the joint venture agreement between Rio Tinto (54%) and China Baowu Steel Group  Corp. Ltd (46%) to develop the Western Range iron ore project as reported to the market in on 14 September 2022. A JORC Table 1 in support of this change was released  to the market and can be viewed at riotinto.com/resourcesandreserves. Ore Reserve updates to Brockman Ore and Marra Mamba Ore include mining depletion, the addition of new deposits, primarily Bedded Hilltop and Hope Downs 2, changes  to cut-off grades and reclassification of select deposits to Mineral Resources. Through engagement with the Traditional Owners, approximately 14 million tonnes of material  has been removed from the Ore Reserve estimate (Brockman, Marra Mamba and Pisolite), primarily from Gudai-Darri.  Ore Reserve classification is determined based on confidence in all the modifying factors. Generally, Proved Ore Reserves are derived from Measured Mineral Resources  and Probable Ore Reserves are derived from Indicated Mineral Resources. In 2022, portions of the Ore Reserve derived from Measured Mineral Resources have been  classified as Probable Ore Reserves. This classification primarily represents areas where one or more state government approvals remain outstanding or specific Traditional  Owner engagement is required prior to mining.   ===== PAGE 290 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 288 Ore Reserves continued Type of  mine1 Proved Ore Reserves  as at 31 December 2022 Probable Ore Reserves  as at 31 December 2022 Tonnage Grade Tonnage Grade Copper2 Mt % Cu g/t Au g/t Ag  % Mo Mt % Cu g/t Au g/t Ag  % Mo Bingham Canyon (US)   – Bingham Open Pit3 O/P 484 0.40 0.18 2.10 0.037 395 0.35 0.17 1.82 0.029   – Underground Skarns U/G – – – – – 1.7 1.90 0.71 10.07 0.044 Total (US) 484 0.40 0.18 2.10 0.037 397 0.36 0.17 1.86 0.029 Escondida (Chile)   – oxide O/P 127 0.57 – – – 51 0.51 – – –   – sulphide O/P 3,100 0.70 – – – 1,747 0.57 – – –   – sulphide leach O/P 1,413 0.42 – – – 232 0.40 – – – Total (Chile) 4,640 0.61 – – – 2,030 0.55 – – – Oyu Tolgoi (Mongolia)   – Hugo Dummett North4 U/G – – – – – 410 1.54 0.30 3.18 –   – Hugo Dummett North Extension U/G – – – – – 37 1.61 0.56 3.82 –   – Oyut open pit O/P 246 0.53 0.39 1.30 – 401 0.41 0.25 1.14 –   – Oyut stockpiles S/P – – – – – 55 0.32 0.12 1.04 – Total (Mongolia) 246 0.53 0.39 1.30 – 903 0.97 0.28 2.17 – Total copper 5,371 0.59 0.03 0.25 0.003 3,330 0.64 0.10 0.81 0.003 1.

Jabiluka (Energy Resources of Australia) Based on Rio Tinto’s assessment that the deposit does not currently have reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction, as required under the JORC Code   for reporting of a Mineral Resource, given the Mirarr people’s publicly stated opposition to further mining and the operation of ERA’s Long Term Care and  Maintenance Agreement, Rio Tinto has therefore decided to no longer report a Mineral Resource for Jabiluka.  ===== PAGE 308 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 306 Mineral Resources continued Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve  governance and internal controls Rio Tinto has well-established governance  processes and internal controls to support   the generation and publication of Mineral  Resources and Ore Reserves, including a  series of business unit and product group  structures and processes independent of  operational reporting. Audit Committee The Audit Committee’s remit includes the  governance of Mineral Resources and  Ore Reserves. This includes an annual review  of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves at   a Group level, as well as a review of findings  and progress from the Group Internal  Audit programme. Ore Reserves Steering Committee The Ore Reserves Steering Committee (ORSC),  chaired by the Chief Technical Officer,  Development & Technology, meets at least  quarterly. The ORSC comprises senior  representatives across our technical, financial,  governance and business groups, and  oversees the appointment of Competent  Persons nominated by the business units;  reviews Exploration Results, Mineral Resource  or Ore Reserve data prior to public reporting;  and oversees the development of the Group  Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve standards  and guidance. Orebody Knowledge Centre  of Excellence The Orebody Knowledge Centre of Excellence  contains a dedicated Orebody Knowledge  Technical Assurance team. Orebody Knowledge  Technical Assurance, in conjunction with the  ORSC, is the guardian and author of Group  Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve standards  and guidance, and is responsible for the  governance and compilation of Group Mineral  Resource, Ore Reserve and reconciliation  reporting. The Technical Assurance team also  monitors the external reporting environment,  facilitates internal audits and monitors actions  with Group Internal Audit. Group Internal Audit Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve internal  audits are conducted by independent external  consulting personnel in a programme managed  by Group Internal Audit, with the assistance of  the Orebody Knowledge Centre of Excellence  and the ORSC. Material findings are reported  outside of the product group reporting line to  the Audit Committee, and all reports and action  plans are reviewed by the ORSC for alignment  to internal and external reporting standards.  During 2022, two internal Mineral Resource  and Ore Reserve audits were completed. Geoscientific information management  and assurance We employ industry-standard drilling,  sampling, assaying and quality assurance/ quality control (QA/QC) practices supported  by formally documented procedures. Diamond core and reverse circulation are   our primary drilling methods. We use other  methods such as sonic and air core if  appropriate for the style of deposit. Drill hole  locations are typically confirmed by high- precision differential Global Positioning System  (GPS) and down-hole trace positioning is  primarily achieved by gyroscopic survey. Drill sample recovery is typically recorded,  and all geological data is collected by qualified  geoscientific professionals. Geological logging  consistency is secured via formal logging  procedures and training, reference materials,  application of geological code libraries   and digital logging directly to the  geological database.  On-site or commercial laboratories provide  appropriate analytical (assaying) techniques,  according to the commodity and style of  deposit. Reliability of assay data is maintained  via QA/QC procedures, which monitor assay  accuracy and precision through the analysis of  blanks, sample duplicates and matrix-matched  certified reference materials. Our geoscientific information management  standard is the industry-leading acQuire  system and we employ strict QA/QC criteria to  ensure only high-quality assay data is  uploaded to a project’s database. Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve  risk management Risks to our Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve  estimates are managed through  comprehensive risk assessments undertaken in  support of the annual reporting cycle. Risks are  identified and managed by verifying controls,  determining and undertaking suitable actions  to remove or reduce the risk, conducting  reviews, and maintaining compliance with  standards and procedures. Risks are managed  through a commercial risk management solution. At the end of each reporting cycle, we analyse  the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve risks  across all business units to ensure both  consistency of reporting and determine any  Group-wide risks to the various processes.  ===== PAGE 309 ===== 307 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Production, Ore Reserves, Mineral Resources and Operations Competent Persons Association(a) Employer Accountability Deposits Bauxite A McIntyre AusIMM Rio Tinto Resources Gove, East Weipa and Andoom, North of Weipa, Amrun W Saba AusIMM Reserves Gove, East Weipa and Andoom, Amrun M Alpha DIALLO EFG Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinée Resources Sangaredi M Keersemaker AusIMM External consultant to Compagnie des  Bauxites de Guinée Reserves R Aglinskas AusIMM External consultants to Mineração  Rio do Norte Resources Trombetas J P M Franco AusIMM Reserves Borates B Griffiths SME Rio Tinto Reserves Boron Copper H Martin AusIMM Rio Tinto Resources Resolution(b)(c)  J Marshall AusIMM Resources A Schwarz AusIMM Resources O Dendev AusIMM Rio Tinto Resources Oyu Tolgoi(b) (c) (d) B Ndlovu AusIMM Reserves N Robinson AusIMM Reserves R Hayes AusIMM Rio Tinto Resources Bingham Canyon(b) (c) (d) S McInerney AusIMM Reserves B Pett AusIMM Reserves P Rodriguez AusIMM Resources K Schroeder AusIMM Resources F Barrera AusIMM Minera Escondida Ltda.

Mount Tom Price began  operations in 1966,  followed by Paraburdoo  in 1974. During the  1990s, Channar (1990),  Brockman 2 (1992),  Marandoo (1994) and  Yandicoogina (1998)  achieved first ore.  Nammuldi achieved first  ore in 2006 followed by  Brockman 4 (2010),  Western Turner Syncline  (2011) and Silvergrass  (2017). The latest  addition to the network  of Hamersley Iron mines  is Gudai-Darri, had first  ore railed in December  2021, and commissioned  its primary crusher in  Q2 2022. All mines operated by  Rio Tinto within the  property are open pit  mines. The mining  method employed uses  conventional surface  mining, whereby shovels  and loaders are used to  load drilled and blasted  material into trucks for  removal to waste dumps  and stockpiles or feed to  process plants. In addition to mining  activities, Rio Tinto  conducts both  exploration and  development drilling  across the property. Brockman 2, Brockman 4,  Channar, Gudai-Darri, Tom  Price, Paraburdoo and  Western Turner Syncline:  mineralisation is haematite/ goethite mineralisation  hosted within the banded iron  formations of the Brockman  Formation. Detrital deposits  also occur at these sites.  At Tom Price and Western  Turner Syncline, some  goethite/haematite  mineralisation hosted within  the Marra Mamba Formation  also occurs. Marandoo and Silvergrass:  mineralisation occurs as  goethite/ haematite within the  banded iron formations of the  Marra Mamba Formation.  Some detrital mineralisation  also occurs. Yandicoogina: goethite  mineralisation occurs as  pisolite ores within the  paleo-channel of a channel  iron formation. At Brockman 2, Brockman 4,  the Nammuldi dry plant and  Gudai-Darri, dry crushing and  screening is used to produce  lump and fines iron ore  products. Ore from the  Silvergrass and Nammuldi  mines is blended and  processed through a wet  scrubbing and screening  plant, ahead of desliming of  the fines product using  hydrocyclones. At Marandoo,  wet scrubbing and screening  is used to produce lump and  fines iron ore products, prior  to desliming of fines products  using hydrocyclones. Ore  from the Channar and  Paraburdoo mines is crushed  and then processed through  a central tertiary crushing and  dry screening plant to  produce a dry lump product,  with further wet processing of  the fines using hydrocyclones  to remove slimes. Ore from  the Tom Price and Western  Turner Syncline mines is  directed to either the high  grade plant for dry crushing  and screening to dry lump  and fines products, or to the  low grade plant for  beneficiation. Heavy media  separation is used to  beneficiate low grade lump,  and a combination of heavy  media hydrocyclones and  spirals is used to beneficiate  the low grade fines. At Yandi,  ore is crushed to fines  product only through a  combination of dry crushing  and screening, or crushing  and wet processing of ore  using classification to remove  finer particles. The processing plants within  the Hamersley Iron network  vary considerably in age, and  many plants have been  subject to brownfields  development since original  construction. All plants are  subject to an ongoing regime  of sustaining capital  investment and maintenance,  underpinned by asset  integrity audits, engineering  inspections, engineering life  cycles for key equipment and  safety inspections and audits.

Robe Valley deposits:  goethite mineralisation  occurs as pisolite ores within  the paleo-channel of a  channel iron formation. West Angelas deposit:  mineralisation occurs as  goethite/ haematite within the  banded iron formations of the  Marra Mamba Formation.  Some detrital mineralisation  also occurs. Ore from the Robe Valley  mines of Mesa A and Mesa J  is processed through either  dry crushing and screening  plants or through wet  processing plants using  scrubbing and screening to  remove finer particles.  Crushed and deslimed ore  from the Robe Valley mines   is railed to Cape Lambert,  where further dry crushing  and screening through a  dedicated processing plant  produces lump and fines iron  ore products. At West Angelas mine, dry  crushing and screening is  used to produce lump and  fines iron ore products. The processing plants within  the Hamersley Iron network  vary considerably in age, and  many plants have been  subject to brownfields  development since original  construction. All plants are  subject to an ongoing regime  of sustaining capital  investment and maintenance,  underpinned by asset  integrity audits, engineering  inspections, engineering life  cycles for key equipment and  safety inspections and audits. Supplied through the  integrated Hamersley  and Robe power  network operated by  Pilbara Iron. State Agreement  conditions are set by   the Western Australian  Government and broadly  comprise environmental  compliance and  reporting obligations;  closure and rehabilitation  considerations; local  procurement and  community initiatives/ investment requirements;  and payment of taxes  and government royalties. Construction of the  Dampier field started in  1969; first shipment in  1972. Lake MacLeod  was acquired in 1978   as an operating field.  Port Hedland was  acquired in 2001 as   an operating field. Solar evaporation of  seawater at Dampier and  Port Hedland;  underground brine at  Lake MacLeod;  extraction of gypsum at  Lake MacLeod. Salt is grown every year  through solar evaporation in  permanent crystallising pans. Gypsum is present in the top  layer covering most of the  Lake Macleod. Salt is processed through a  washing plant, consisting of  screening washbelts at Lake  MacLeod, Screwbowl  classifiers and static screens  at Port Hedland and sizing  screens, counter-current  classifiers with dewatering  screens and centrifuges at  Dampier. Dampier produces  shipping-ready product for  immediate shiploading.  Washed salt at Lake MacLeod  and Port Hedland is  dewatered on stockpiles. Lake Macleod also mines   and processes gypsum in  leaching heaps.

Open pit Supergene-enriched  itabirite hosted iron ore  deposits. The deposits are  part of a supracrustal belt  with the BIF proto-ore  likely deposited in a  shallow marine setting  within a forearc basin.  The age of deposition is  considered to be between  2.7 Ga and 2.2 Ga. Current plans are for the  run-of-mine ore to be coarsely  crushed at the Ouéléba mine site  at a maximum rate of 60 Mtpa  phase 1 capacity to P100 of  -100 mm through two identical  primary and secondary crushing  stations in a staged arrangement.  The coarsely crushed ore will then  be conveyed to the mine  stockyard. The ore will be  reclaimed from the stockpiles and  conveyed to the train load-out  facility for loading into trains which  transport materials to the port  facility where it will be shipped by  bulk carrier to several ports in  China. Other major facilities that  will support the operations include  power generation, explosives  facilities, fuel and lubricants  facilities, administration buildings,  workshops and permanent village. Current designs  contemplate that power  for the mine site and  other areas will be  supplied by a hybrid  power plant consisting   of diesel generators   and solar generation  powered fuel station.  Further, there is a plan to  connect the facility to the  power grid local operator  Électricité de Guinée   as well. This will require  an approx. 20 km  connection line to the  main grid once it is  available and would  substantially reduce  energy costs and  fuel consumption.

The project includes   a wellfield for brine  extraction and a chemical  plant for the production of  lithium carbonate, a spent  brine disposal facility,  wellfield for the extraction  of process water and  water pre-treatment  equipment, camp and  office buildings,  warehouses and loading /  unloading facilities. Connected to the  national electric  grid with access  to power from  nearby solar  farms. Option for  the construction  of a solar farm  under agreement  with a 3rd party   on a build / own /  opearte model  under  consideration. The project is governed by two main  pieces of Serbian legislation: Mining Law  is administered by the Ministry of Mining  and Energy (MME) and Planning and  Construction Law is administered by the  Ministry of Construction, Transportation  and Infrastructure (MCTI). The permitting process base case  foresees the following:    – Mine, beneficiation plant and mine  surface facilities are subject to the  permitting procedure of MME.    – Processing plant, industrial waste  landfill and infrastructure (rail, roads,  power and water pipelines) are  subject to the unified permitting  procedure under MCTI. The Jadar deposit was  discovered in 2004 by Rio Tinto  Exploration geologists during a  regional exploration program  for borates in the Balkans. The  deposit is in its majority  composed of a mineral new to  science named Jadarite with  high concentrations of lithium  and boron. Resource definition  and processing workflow  development and testing were  conducted for over a decade.  The Pre-feasibility Study (PFS)  completed in July 2020 has  shown that the Jadar project  has the potential to produce  both battery grade lithium  carbonate and boric acid. In  January 2022, the Government  of Serbia cancelled the Spatial  Plan for the Jadar project and  required all related permits to  be revoked.  Underground mine Jadarite mineralisation  is present in three  broad zones  containing stratiform  lenses of variable  thickness. These units  are hosted in a much  thicker gently dipping  sequence mainly  composed of  fine-grained  sediments affected by  syn and post  depositional faulting. The planned site layout  includes a concentrator  to beneficiate the primary  ore, a chemical plant to  produce boric acid and  lithium carbonate, paste  plant, water and waste  treatment plants, surface  waste storage (dry stack),  railroad spur and  warehouses for product  storage and loading /  unloading, and office  buildings. Connected to the  national electric  grid. Electricity  planned to be  sourced from  nearby  hydroelectrical  power plant.  ===== PAGE 328 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 326 Group mines as at 31 December 2022 Aluminium Production properties Property Ownership Operator Location Access and Infrastructure Title/lease/acreage CBG Sangaredi Rio Tinto Group  22.95%, Guinean  Government  49%, Alcoa  22.95%, Dadco  Investments  Limited 5.1% La Compagnie  des Bauxites de  Guinée  Sangaredi, Guinea  Road, air and port.

Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards  Legislation          Basis for Conclusion  We conducted our work in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000 and in respect of greenhouse gas  emissions, International Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE 3410 (the Standards). In accordance with the Standards we have:    used our professional judgement to plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance that we are not aware of any material  misstatements in the Sustainability Information Subject to Assurance, whether due to fraud or error;    used our professional judgement to assess the risk of material misstatement and plan and perform the engagement to obtain reasonable  assurance that the GHG Emissions is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;    considered relevant internal controls when designing our assurance procedures, however we do not express a conclusion on their  effectiveness; and    ensured that the engagement team possess the appropriate knowledge, skills and professional competencies.    Summary of Procedures Performed    In gathering evidence for our conclusions, our assurance procedures comprised:    enquiries with relevant Rio Tinto personnel to understand and evaluate the design and implementation of the key systems, processes and  internal controls to capture, collate, calculate and report the Sustainability Information Subject to Assurance and GHG Emissions;    assessment of the suitability and application of the Reporting Criteria in respect of the Sustainability Information Subject to Assurance  and GHG Emissions;    analytical procedures over the Sustainability Information Subject to Assurance and GHG Emissions;    risk analysis to validate the completeness of Rio Tinto’s materiality assessment;    substantively tested performance data within the Sustainability Information Subject to Assurance, on a sample basis at corporate and  operational level, which included testing a selection of 6 operations being Weipa, Winu, West Angelas, Kitimat, Iron Ore Company of  Canada and Borates – RTM California Operations;    substantively tested the GHG Emissions, on a sample basis at corporate and operational level, which included testing a selection of 15  operations being Weipa, Winu, Gladstone Power Station, Pilbara Rail Operations, Brockman, Yandicoogina, Marandoo, Boyne Smelters  Limited, Tomago, Alouette, IOC Processing Plant, Queensland Alumina Limited, RTFT Smelting, Yarwun and Sohar, and how this  information is reported and captured at corporate level;    interviews and walkthroughs with site personnel at each of the 15 operations listed above to assess the key systems, processes and  internal controls to capture, collate, calculate and report GHG Emissions at an operational level, and how this information is reported and  captured at corporate level;    testing the mathematical accuracy of a sample of calculations underlying the GHG Emissions;    assessing the appropriateness of a sample of emissions factors applied in calculating the GHG Emissions;    evaluating the design and effectiveness of controls implemented by the Rio Tinto Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) Services reporting  function over the Sustainability Information Subject to Assurance and GHG Emissions;    assessing Rio Tinto’s incorporation of the requirements of the ICMM 10 Principles for sustainable development, and the mandatory  requirements set out in the ICMM Position Statements, into its own policies, strategies and standards; and    reviewing the Rio Tinto Annual Report 2022, the Rio Tinto Strategic Report 2022 and the Rio Tinto Sustainability Fact Book 2022 in their  entirety to ensure they are consistent with our overall knowledge of Rio Tinto.    How the Standard Defines Limited Assurance, Reasonable Assurance and Material Misstatement  The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for a reasonable  assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the  assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.   Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that it will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements, including omissions, are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence  relevant decisions of the Directors of Rio Tinto.    Use of this Assurance Report  This report has been prepared for the Directors of Rio Tinto for the purpose of providing assurance conclusions on the Sustainability  Information Subject to Assurance and GHG Emissions and may not be suitable for another purpose. We disclaim any assumption of  responsibility for any reliance on this report, to any person other than the Directors of Rio Tinto, or for any other purpose than that for which it  was prepared.         ===== PAGE 339 ===== 337 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Additional information Independent Assurance Report  of KPMG (KPMG Australia) to the Directors of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited (Rio Tinto)  ©2023 KPMG, an Australian partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

Rio Tinto is headquartered in London with a  corporate office in Melbourne. Rio Tinto plc has a sponsored American  Depositary Receipts (ADR) facility, with  underlying shares registered with the US  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  and listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

Nomenclature and financial data Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited operate  together and are referred to in this report as  Rio Tinto, the Rio Tinto Group or the Group.  These expressions are used for convenience,  since both companies, and other companies   in which they directly or indirectly own  investments, are separate and distinct legal  entities. Likewise, the words “we”, “us”, “our”  and “ourselves” are used in some places to  refer to the companies of the Rio Tinto Group   in general. These expressions are also used  where no useful purpose is served by  identifying any particular company or  companies. We usually omit “Limited”, “plc”,  “Pty”, “Inc.”, “Limitada”, “L.L.C.”, “A.S.” or “SA”  from Group company names, except to  distinguish between Rio Tinto plc and  Rio Tinto Limited. Financial data in US dollars  ($) is derived from, and should be read in  conjunction with, the 2022 financial statements.  In general, where we have provided financial  data in other currencies, it has been translated  from the consolidated financial statements, and  is provided solely for convenience; exceptions  arise where data has been extracted directly  from source records. History Rio Tinto plc was incorporated on 30 March  1962, then called The Rio Tinto-Zinc  Corporation Limited (RTZ), and was formed by   the merger of The Rio Tinto Company Limited  and The Consolidated Zinc Corporation  Limited. The Rio Tinto Company was  incorporated in 1873 to reopen ancient copper  workings in Spain. The Consolidated Zinc  Corporation Limited began operations in the  early twentieth century as part of the Australian  mining industry. Based at Broken Hill in New  South Wales, it began mining silver, lead and  zinc deposits and later expanded into lead and  zinc smelting. Rio Tinto Limited was incorporated on  17 December 1959, then called The Rio Tinto  Mining Company of Australia Pty Limited. In 1962  the Australian interests of The Consolidated  Zinc Corporation Limited and The Rio Tinto  Company Limited were merged to form  Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Limited, a limited  liability company under the laws of the State   of Victoria, Australia. In 1980, Conzinc Riotinto  of Australia Limited changed its name to  CRA Limited. Between 1962 and 1995, both RTZ and CRA  discovered important mineral deposits,  developed major mining projects and grew  through acquisition. RTZ and CRA began operating in 1995 through  a dual-listed companies structure. In 1997, RTZ  became Rio Tinto plc and CRA became  Rio Tinto Limited. Dual-listed companies structure In 1995, Rio Tinto shareholders approved   the terms of the dual-listed companies’   merger (the DLC structure). The aim was   to put shareholders of both companies in  substantially the same position they would   be in if they held shares in a single entity  owning all assets of both companies. Following the approval of the DLC structure,  both companies entered into a DLC Merger  Sharing Agreement (the Sharing Agreement).  As part of this, both companies agreed to be  managed in a unified way, to share the same  Board of Directors, and to put in place  arrangements to provide shareholders of both  companies with a common economic interest  in the DLC structure. To achieve this third objective, the Sharing  Agreement fixed the ratio of dividend, voting  and capital distribution rights attached to each  Rio Tinto plc share and each Rio Tinto Limited  share at an Equalisation Ratio of 1:1. This has  remained unchanged ever since, although the  Sharing Agreement makes clear this can be  revised in special circumstances, for example  where certain modifications are made to the  share capital of one company (such as rights  issues, bonus issues, share splits and share  consolidations) but not to the other. Outside the circumstances specified in the  Sharing Agreement, the Equalisation Ratio   can only be altered with the approval of  shareholders under the class rights action  approval procedure, described in the  Voting arrangements section below.   Any adjustments must be confirmed   by the Group’s external auditors. Consistent with the DLC structure, the  directors of both companies aim to act in the  best interests of Rio Tinto as a whole. The class  rights action approval procedure exists to deal  with instances where there may be a conflict of  interest between the shareholders of the  two companies. To ensure that the Boards of both companies  are identical, resolutions to appoint or remove  Directors must be put to shareholders of both  companies as Joint Decisions, described   in the Voting arrangements section below.   The Articles of Association of Rio Tinto plc   and the Constitution of Rio Tinto Limited make  clear that a person can only be a Director of  one company if he or she is also a Director of  the other. This means that if a person were  removed as a Director of Rio Tinto plc, he or  she would also cease to be a Director of  Rio Tinto Limited. One consequence of the DLC merger is that  Rio Tinto is subject to a wide range of laws,  rules and regulatory reviews across multiple  jurisdictions. Where these rules differ, Rio Tinto  will comply with the requirements in each  jurisdiction at a minimum. Dividend arrangements The Sharing Agreement ensures that dividends  paid on Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited  shares are equalised on a net cash basis  without taking into account any associated tax  credits. Dividends are determined in US dollars  (with the exception of ADR holders, paid in  sterling and Australian dollars) and both  companies are required to announce and   pay dividends and other distributions or as  close to at the same time as possible.  The payment of dividends between companies  and their subsidiaries, including the payment   of dividends on the DLC dividend shares,  provides the Group with flexibility to manage  internal funds and distributable reserves to  enable the payment of equalised dividend   or equalised capital distributions. If the payment of an equalised dividend   would contravene the law applicable to one   of the companies, they can depart from the  Equalisation Ratio. In that situation, the relevant  company must put aside reserves for payment  on the relevant shares at a later date. Rio Tinto shareholders have no direct rights to  enforce the dividend equalisation provisions of  the Sharing Agreement. Voting arrangements In principle, the Sharing Agreement enables  the shareholders of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto  Limited to vote as a joint electorate on any  matters that affect them in similar ways. These  are referred to as Joint Decisions, and include  the creation of new classes of share capital, the  appointment or removal of directors and  auditors, and the receiving of annual financial  statements. All shareholder resolutions that  include Joint Decisions are voted on a poll. The Sharing Agreement also protects  shareholders of both companies by requiring  joint approval for decisions that do not affect  the shareholders of both companies equally.  These are known as class rights actions, and  are voted on a poll. For example, fundamental  elements of the DLC structure cannot be  changed unless approved separately by the  shareholders of both companies. Shareholder information  ===== PAGE 341 ===== 339 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Additional information Exceptions to these principles can arise in  situations such as where legislation requires  the separate approval of a decision by the  appropriate majority of shareholders in one  company, and where approval of the matter   by shareholders of the other company is  not required. Where a matter has been expressly categorised  as either a Joint Decision or a class rights action,  the directors cannot change that categorisation.  If a matter falls within both categories, it is  treated as a class rights action. In addition, if an  issue is not expressly listed in either category,  Directors can decide how it should be put to  shareholders for approval. To support joint voting arrangements, both  companies have entered into shareholder  voting agreements, where a Special Voting  Share is issued to a special purpose company  (SVC) and held in trust for shareholders by a  common trustee. Rio Tinto plc (RTP) has issued  its Special Voting Share (RTP Special Voting  Share) to Rio Tinto Limited (RTL) Shareholder  SVC, while Rio Tinto Limited has issued its  Special Voting Share (RTL Special Voting  Share) to RTP Shareholder SVC. The total  number of votes cast on Joint Decisions by the  shareholders of one company are decided at a  parallel meeting of the other company. The  exact role of these SVCs is described below. In exceptional circumstances, certain  shareholders can be excluded from voting at  their respective company’s general meetings.  For example, they may have acquired shares   in the other company in excess of a given  threshold without making an offer for all the  shares in the other company. In this situation,  votes cast by these excluded shareholders  are disregarded. Following the companies’ general meetings,  the overall results of the voting are announced  to relevant stock exchanges and the media,  and published at riotinto.com. At a Rio Tinto plc shareholders meeting during  which a Joint Decision is considered, each  Rio Tinto plc share carries one vote. The holder  of the Special Voting Share has one vote for  each vote cast by the public shareholders of  Rio Tinto Limited in their parallel meeting. The  holder of the Special Voting Share must vote in  accordance with the votes cast by public  shareholders for and against the equivalent  resolution at the parallel Rio Tinto Limited  shareholders’ meeting. The holders of Rio Tinto  Limited ordinary shares do not hold voting  shares in Rio Tinto plc by virtue of their holding  in Rio Tinto Limited, and cannot enforce the  voting arrangements relating to the Special  Voting Share. Similarly, at a Rio Tinto Limited shareholders  meeting during which a Joint Decision is  considered, each Rio Tinto Limited share  carries one vote and the holder of its Special  Voting Share will have one vote for each vote  cast by the public shareholders of Rio Tinto plc  in their parallel meeting. The holder of the  Special Voting Share must vote in accordance  with the votes cast for and against the  equivalent resolution at the parallel Rio Tinto plc  shareholders meeting. The holders of Rio Tinto  plc ordinary shares do not hold any voting  shares in Rio Tinto Limited by virtue of their  holding in Rio Tinto plc, and cannot enforce the  voting arrangements relating to the Special  Voting Share. Capital distribution arrangements If either company goes into liquidation, the  Sharing Agreement ensures a valuation is  made of the surplus assets of both companies.  If the surplus assets available for distribution   by one company on each of the shares held   by its shareholders exceed the surplus assets  available for distribution by the other company  on each of the shares held by its shareholders,  then an equalising payment must be made – to  the extent permitted by applicable law – such  that the amount available for distribution on  each share held by shareholders of both  companies reflects the Equalisation Ratio.  The aim is to ensure the shareholders of both  companies have equivalent entitlements to the  assets of the combined Group on a per share  basis, taking account of the Equalisation Ratio. The Sharing Agreement does not grant any  enforceable rights to the shareholders of either  company upon liquidation of either company. Limitations on ownership of shares and  merger obligations The laws and regulations of the UK and  Australia impose restrictions and obligations on  persons who control interests in publicly listed  companies in excess of defined thresholds.  These can include an obligation to make a  public offer for all outstanding issued shares   of the relevant company. The threshold  applicable to Rio Tinto plc under UK law and  regulations is 30% and to Rio Tinto Limited  under Australian law and regulations is 20% on  both a standalone and a Joint Decision basis. As part of the DLC merger, the Articles   of Association of Rio Tinto plc and the  Constitution of Rio Tinto Limited were  amended with the aim of extending these laws  and regulations to the combined enterprise.  This amendment also ensures that a person  cannot exercise control over one company  without having made offers to the public  shareholders of both companies. This guarantees the equal treatment of   both sets of shareholders, and that the   two companies are considered as a single  economic entity. The Articles of Association of  Rio Tinto plc and the Constitution of Rio Tinto  Limited impose restrictions on any person who  controls, directly or indirectly, 20% or more   of the votes on a Joint Decision. If, however,  such a person has an interest in either Rio Tinto  Limited or Rio Tinto plc only, then the restrictions  only apply if they control, directly or indirectly,  30% or more of the votes at that company’s  general meetings. If one of these thresholds is exceeded,  the person cannot attend or vote at general  meetings of the relevant company, cannot  receive dividends or other distributions from  the relevant company, and may be divested of  their interest by the directors of the relevant  company (subject to certain limited exceptions  and notification by the relevant company).  These restrictions continue to apply until that  person has either made a public offer for all   the publicly held shares of the other company,  has reduced their controlling interest below the  thresholds specified, or has acquired through a  permitted means at least 50% of the publicly  held shares of each company. This arrangement ensures that offers for the  publicly held shares of both companies would  be required to avoid the restrictions set out  above, even if the interests which breach   the thresholds are held in just one of the  companies. The Directors do not have the  discretion to exempt a person from the  operation of these rules. Under the Sharing Agreement, the companies  agree to co-operate to enforce the above  restrictions contained in their Articles of  Association and Constitution. Guarantees In 1995, each company entered into a deed  poll guarantee in favour of creditors of the  other company. In addition, each company  guaranteed the contractual obligations of the  other and the obligations of other persons  guaranteed by the other company, subject to  certain limited exceptions.  Beneficiaries under deed poll guarantees can  make demands on the relevant guarantor  without first having recourse to the company   or persons whose obligations are being  guaranteed. The obligations of the guarantor  under each deed poll guarantee expire upon  termination of the Sharing Agreement and  under other limited circumstances, but only in  respect of obligations arising after such  termination and, in the case of other limited  circumstances, the publication and expiry of  due notice.

As far as is  permitted by the UK Companies Act 2006,  the Australian Corporations Act 2001 and ASX  Listing Rules, this principle is reflected in the  Articles of Association of Rio Tinto plc and in  the Constitution of Rio Tinto Limited. The following summaries describe the material  rights of shareholders of both Rio Tinto plc and  Rio Tinto Limited. Objects At the 2009 AGMs, shareholders of Rio Tinto plc  and Rio Tinto Limited approved amendments  to their Articles of Association and Constitution  whereby the object clauses were removed to  allow the companies to have the widest  possible scope of activities. Directors’ interests Under Rio Tinto plc’s Articles of Association,  a Director may not vote in respect of any  proposal in which he or she, or any other  person connected with him or her, has any  interest, other than by virtue of his or her  interests in shares or debentures or other  securities of, in or through the company,  except in certain circumstances, including in  respect of resolutions:   – Indemnifying him or her or a third party   in respect of obligations incurred by the  Director on behalf of, or for the benefit of,  the company, or in respect of obligations of  the company, for which the Director has  assumed responsibility under an indemnity,  security or guarantee.   – Relating to an offer of securities in which   he or she may be interested as a holder   of securities or as an underwriter.   – Concerning another body corporate in  which the Director is beneficially interested  in less than 1% of the issued shares of any  class of shares of such a body corporate.   – Relating to an employee benefit in which   the Director will share equally with  other employees.   – Relating to liability insurance that the  company is empowered to purchase for   the benefit of Directors of the company in  respect of actions undertaken as Directors  (or officers) of the company.   – Concerning the giving of indemnities in  favour of Directors or the funding of  expenditure by Directors to defend criminal,  civil or regulatory proceedings or actions  against a Director. Under Rio Tinto Limited’s Constitution,  a Director may be present at a meeting of the  Board while a matter in which the Director has   a material personal interest is being considered  and may vote in respect of that matter, except  where a Director is constrained by Australian law. The Directors are empowered to exercise all  the powers of the companies to borrow money;  to charge any property or business of the  companies or all, or any, of their uncalled  capital; and to issue debentures or give any  other security for a debt, liability or obligation   of the companies or of any other person.   The Directors shall restrict the borrowings of  Rio Tinto plc to the limitation that the aggregate  amount of all monies borrowed by the company  and its subsidiaries shall not exceed an amount  equal to 1.5 times the companies’ share capital  plus aggregate reserves unless sanctioned by  an ordinary resolution of the company. Directors are not required to hold any shares   of either company by way of qualification.   The Remuneration Report on pages 110-135  provides information on shareholding policies  relating to Executive and Non-Executive  Directors. Please refer to the Directors’ Report  for information on the appointment of Directors. Rights attaching to shares Under UK law, dividends on shares may only   be paid out of profits available for distribution,  as determined in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles and by the  relevant law. Shareholders are entitled to  receive such dividends as may be declared by  the Directors. Directors may also pay interim  dividends to shareholders as justified by the  financial position of the Group. Under the Australian Corporations Act 2001,  dividends on shares may only be paid if the  company’s assets exceed its liabilities  immediately before the dividend is declared,  the excess is sufficient for the payment of the  dividend, the payment is fair and reasonable to  the company’s shareholders as a whole, and  the payment does not materially prejudice the  company’s ability to pay its creditors. Any  Rio Tinto plc dividend unclaimed after 12 years  from the date the dividend was declared, or  became due for payment, will be forfeited and  returned to the company. Any Rio Tinto Limited  dividend unclaimed may be invested or  otherwise used by the Board for the benefit of  the company until claimed or otherwise  disposed of according to Australian law.  Rio Tinto Limited is governed by the State of  Victoria’s unclaimed monies legislation, which  requires the company to pay to the state  revenue office any unclaimed dividend  payments of A$20 or more that on 1 March  each year have remained unclaimed for over  12 months. Voting Voting at any general meeting of shareholders  on a resolution on which the holder of the  Special Voting Share is entitled to vote shall be  decided by a poll, and any other resolution  shall be decided by a show of hands unless a  poll has been duly demanded. On a show of  hands, every shareholder who is present in  person or by proxy (or other duly authorised  representative) and is entitled to vote, has one  vote regardless of the number of shares held.  The holder of the Special Voting Share is not  entitled to vote in a show of hands. On a poll,  every shareholder who is present in person or  by proxy (or other duly authorised representative)  and is entitled to vote, has one vote for every  ordinary share for which he or she is the holder.  In the case of Joint Decisions, the holder of the  Special Voting Share has one vote for each  vote cast in respect of the publicly held shares  of the other company. A poll may be demanded by any of  the following:   – The Chair of the meeting.   – At least five shareholders entitled to vote on  the resolution.   – Any shareholder(s) representing in the  aggregate not less than one tenth (Rio Tinto plc)  or one 20th (Rio Tinto Limited) of the total  voting rights of all shareholders entitled to  vote on the resolution.   – Any shareholder(s) holding Rio Tinto plc  shares conferring a right to vote at the  meeting on which there have been paid-up  sums in the aggregate equal to not less than  one tenth of the total sum paid up on all the  shares conferring that right.    – The holder of the Special Voting Share of  either company. A proxy form gives the proxy the authority   to demand a poll, or to join others in  demanding one. The necessary quorum for a Rio Tinto plc  general meeting is three members present  (in person or by proxy or other duly authorised  representative) and entitled to vote. For a  Rio Tinto Limited general meeting it is two  members present (in person or by proxy or  other duly authorised representative). Matters are transacted at general meetings by  the proposing and passing of resolutions as:   – Ordinary resolutions (for example the  election of Directors), which require the  affirmative vote of a majority of persons  voting at a meeting for which there is  a quorum.   – Special resolutions (for example amending  the Articles of Association of Rio Tinto plc or  the Constitution of Rio Tinto Limited), which  require the affirmative vote of not less than  three-quarters of the persons voting at a  meeting at which there is a quorum. Shareholder information continued  ===== PAGE 345 ===== 343 Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com Additional information The Sharing Agreement further classifies  resolutions as Joint Decisions and class rights  actions as explained on page 338. Annual general meetings must be convened  with 21 days’ written notice for Rio Tinto plc   and with 28 days’ notice for Rio Tinto Limited.  In accordance with the authority granted by  shareholders at the Rio Tinto plc AGM in 2021,  other meetings of Rio Tinto plc may be  convened with 14 days’ written notice for   the passing of a special resolution, and with  14 days’ notice for any other resolution,  depending on the nature of the business to be  transacted. All meetings of Rio Tinto Limited  require 28 days’ notice. In calculating the  period of notice, any time taken to deliver the  notice and the day of the meeting itself are not  included. The notice must specify the nature   of the business to be transacted. Variation of rights If, at any time, the share capital is divided into  different classes of shares, the rights attached  to each class may be varied, subject to the  provisions of the relevant legislation, the written  consent of holders of three-quarters in value   of the shares of that class, or upon the adoption  of a special resolution passed at a separate  meeting of the holders of the shares of that class.  At every such meeting, all of the provisions of  the Articles of Association and Constitution  relating to proceedings at a general meeting  apply, except that the quorum for Rio Tinto plc  should be two or more persons who hold or  represent by proxy not less than one-third in  nominal value of the issued shares of the class. Rights upon a winding-up Except as the shareholders have agreed or  may otherwise agree, upon a winding-up, the  balance of assets available for distribution after  the payment of all creditors (including certain  preferential creditors, whether statutorily  preferred creditors or normal creditors), and  subject to any special rights attaching to any  class of shares, is to be distributed among the  holders of ordinary shares according to the  amounts paid-up on the shares held by them.  This distribution should generally be made   in cash. A liquidator may, however, upon   the adoption of a special resolution of the  shareholders, divide among the shareholders  the whole or any part of the assets in specie  or kind. The Sharing Agreement describes the  distribution of assets of each of the companies  in the event of a liquidation, as explained on  page 339. Facility agreement Details of the Group’s $7.5 billion multi-currency  committed revolving credit facilities are set out  in “Our capital and liquidity” section to the  financial statements on page 190. Exchange controls and foreign  investment Rio Tinto plc There are no UK foreign exchange controls or  other restrictions on the import or export of  capital by, or on the payment of dividends to,  non-resident holders of Rio Tinto plc shares,   or that materially affect the conduct of Rio Tinto  plc’s operations. It should be noted, however,  that various sanctions, laws, regulations or  conventions may restrict the import or export   of capital by, or the payment of dividends to,  non-resident holders of Rio Tinto plc shares.  There are no restrictions under Rio Tinto plc’s  Articles of Association or under UK law that  specifically limit the right of non-resident  owners to hold or vote Rio Tinto plc shares.  However, certain of the provisions of the  Australian Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers  Act 1975 (the Takeovers Act) described   below also apply to the acquisition by  non-Australian persons of interests in  securities of Rio Tinto plc. Rio Tinto Limited Under current Australian legislation, Australia  does not impose general exchange or foreign  currency controls. Subject to some specific  requirements and restrictions, Australian and  foreign currency may be freely brought into and  sent out of Australia. There are requirements to  report cash transfers in or out of Australia of  A$10,000 or more. There is a prohibition on  (or in some cases the specific prior approval of  the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or  Minister for Foreign Affairs must be obtained for)  certain payments or other dealings connected  with countries or parties identified with terrorism,  or to whom United Nations or autonomous  Australian sanctions apply. Sanction, anti-money  laundering and counterterrorism laws may  restrict or prohibit payments, transactions   and dealings or require reporting of  certain transactions. Rio Tinto Limited may be required to deduct  withholding tax from foreign remittances   of dividends, to the extent that they are  unfranked, and from payments of interest. Acquisitions of interests in shares, and certain  other equity instruments in Australian  companies by non-Australian (“foreign”)  persons are subject to review and approval   by the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of  Australia under the Takeovers Act.  In broad terms, the Takeovers Act applies to  acquisitions of interests in securities in an  Australian entity by a foreign person where, as  a result, a single foreign person (and any  associate) would control 20% or more of the  voting power or potential voting power in the  entity. The potential voting power in an entity is  determined having regard to the voting shares  in the entity that would be issued if all rights  (whether or not presently exercisable) in the  entity were exercised.  The Takeovers Act also applies to direct  investments by foreign government investors,  in certain circumstances regardless of the   size of the investment. Persons who are  proposing relevant acquisitions or transactions  may be required to provide notice to the  Treasurer before proceeding with the  acquisition or transaction.  The Treasurer has the power to order  divestment in cases where relevant  acquisitions or transactions have already  occurred, including where prior notice to the  Treasurer was not required. The Takeovers Act  does not affect the rights of owners whose  interests are held in compliance with  the legislation. Limitations on voting and shareholding  Except for the provisions of the Takeovers Act,  there are no limitations imposed by law,  Rio Tinto plc’s Articles of Association or  Rio Tinto Limited’s Constitution, on the rights of  non-residents or foreigners to hold the Group’s  ordinary shares or ADRs, or to vote that would  not apply generally to all shareholders. Directors Appointment and removal of Directors The appointment and replacement of Directors  is governed by Rio Tinto plc’s Articles of  Association and Rio Tinto Limited’s Constitution,  relevant UK and Australian legislation, and the  UK Corporate Governance Code. The Board  may appoint a Director either to fill a casual  vacancy or as an addition to the Board,   so long as the total number of Directors does  not exceed the limit prescribed in these  constitutional documents. An appointed  Director must retire and seek election to office  at the next AGM of each company. In addition  to any powers of removal conferred by the UK  Companies Act 2006 and the Australian  Corporations Act 2001, the company may   by ordinary resolution remove any Director  before the expiry of his or her period of office  and may, subject to these constitutional  documents, by ordinary resolution appoint  another person who is willing to act as a  Director in their place. In line with the UK  Corporate Governance Code, all directors are  required to stand for re-election at each AGM.   ===== PAGE 346 ===== Annual Report 2022 | riotinto.com 344 Directors’ powers The Board manages the business of Rio Tinto under the powers set out in these constitutional documents. These powers include the Directors’ ability  to issue or buy back shares. Shareholders’ authority to empower the Directors to purchase its own ordinary shares is sought at the AGM each year.  The constitutional documents can only be amended, or replaced, by a special resolution passed in general meeting by at least 75% of the votes cast.

All statements other than statements of historical  facts included in this report, including, without  limitation, those regarding Rio Tinto’s financial  position, business strategy, plans and  objectives of management for future  operations (including development plans and  objectives relating to Rio Tinto’s products,  production forecasts, and reserve and  resource positions), are forward-looking  statements. The words “intend”, “aim”, “project”,  “anticipate”, “estimate”, “plan”, “believes”,  “expects”, “may”, “should”, “will”, “target”,  “set to” or similar expressions, commonly  identify such forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve  known and unknown risks, uncertainties and  other factors which may cause the actual  results, performance or achievements of  Rio Tinto, or industry results, to be materially  different from any future results, performance  or achievements expressed or implied by such  forward-looking statements. Such forward- looking statements are based on numerous  assumptions regarding Rio Tinto’s present and  future business strategies and the environment  in which Rio Tinto will operate in the future.  Among the important factors that could cause  Rio Tinto’s actual results, performance or  achievements to differ materially from those in  the forward-looking statements include, but  are not limited to: an inability to live up to  Rio Tinto’s values and any resultant damage to  its reputation; the impacts of geopolitics on  trade and investment; the impacts of climate  change and the transition to a low-carbon  future; an inability to successfully execute and/ or realise value from acquisitions and  divestments; the level of new ore resources,  including the results of exploration  programmes and/or acquisitions; disruption to  strategic partnerships that play a material role  in delivering growth, production, cash or  market positioning; damage to Rio Tinto’s  relationships with communities and  governments; an inability to attract and retain  requisite skilled people; declines in commodity  prices and adverse exchange rate movements;  an inability to raise sufficient funds for capital  investment; inadequate estimates of ore  resources and reserves; delays or overruns of  large and complex projects; changes in tax  regulation; safety incidents or major hazard  events; cyber breaches; physical impacts from  climate change; the impacts of water scarcity;  natural disasters; an inability to successfully  manage the closure, reclamation and  rehabilitation of sites; the impacts of civil  unrest; the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic;  breaches of Rio Tinto’s policies, standards and  procedures, laws or regulations; trade tensions  between the world’s major economies;  increasing societal and investor expectations,  in particular with regard to environmental,  social and governance considerations; the  impacts of technological advancements; and  such other risks identified in Rio Tinto’s most  recent annual report and accounts in Australia  and the United Kingdom and the most recent  annual report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC  or Form 6-Ks furnished to, or filed with, the SEC.  Forward-looking statements should, therefore,  be construed in light of such risk factors and  undue reliance should not be placed on  forward-looking statements. These forward- looking statements speak only as of the date   of this report. Rio Tinto expressly disclaims any  obligation or undertaking (except as required  by applicable law, the UK Listing Rules, the  Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules  of the Financial Conduct Authority and the  Listing Rules of the Australian Securities  Exchange) to release publicly any updates or  revisions to any forward-looking statement  contained herein to reflect any change in  Rio Tinto’s expectations with regard thereto   or any change in events, conditions or  circumstances on which any such statement  is based.
