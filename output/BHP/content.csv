Examples of forward-looking statements contained in this  CTAP include, without limitation, statements describing:  (i) our strategy, our values and how we define our  success; (ii) our expectations regarding future demand  for certain commodities, in particular copper, nickel,  iron ore, steelmaking coal, potash and steel, and our  intentions, commitments or expectations with respect  to our supply of certain commodities, including copper,  nickel, iron ore, potash, and uranium; (iii) our future  exploration and partnership plans and perceived benefits  and opportunities, including our focus to grow our copper  and potash assets; (iv) our business outlook, including  our outlook for long-term economic growth and other  macroeconomic and industry trends; (v) our projected  and expected production and performance levels and  development projects; (vi) our expectations regarding  our investments, including in potential growth options  and technology and innovation, and perceived benefits  and opportunities; (vii) our plans for our major projects,  such as operational decarbonisation, and related budget  and capital spend allocations and commitments; (viii) our  expectations, commitments and objectives with respect to  sustainability, decarbonisation, structural GHG emissions  abatement, natural resource management, climate  change and portfolio resilience; (ix) timelines and plans  to seek to achieve or implement our objectives, including  our approach to equitable change and transitions, our  climate change strategy (including our approach to  mitigation and adaptation), and our goals, targets, plans,  pathways and programs to seek to reduce or support  the reduction of GHG emissions, and related perceived  risks (threats and opportunities), costs and benefits for  BHP; (x) the assumptions, beliefs and conclusions in our  climate-related statements and strategies, for example, in  respect of future temperatures, energy consumption and  GHG emissions, technology developments, credibility and  availability of carbon credits and climate-related impacts;  (xi) our commitments to social value; (xii) our approach  to climate policy advocacy; (xiii) our commitments to  sustainability reporting, frameworks, standards and  initiatives; and (xiv) our commitments to achieve certain  targets and outcomes with respect to Indigenous peoples  and the communities where we operate.  Forward-looking statements are based on management’s  expectations and reflect judgements, assumptions,  estimates and other information available, as at the date  of this CTAP and/or the date of BHP’s planning processes  or scenario analysis processes. These statements do not  represent guarantees or predictions of future financial or  operational performance and involve known and unknown  risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are  beyond our control and which may cause actual results to  differ materially from those expressed in the statements  contained in this CTAP. BHP cautions against reliance on  any forward-looking statements. For example, the potential decarbonisation pathways  and stages of progression that individual steelmakers in  our value chain may take will vary, influenced by a range  of factors, including: (i) global and national economic  trajectories; (ii) government policy and regulatory  settings; (iii) steel grades that need to be produced;  (iv) land, labour and capital stock (including the age of  existing infrastructure); (v) materials and energy; and  (vi) technological advances. Other factors that may affect our future operations  and performance, including the actual construction or  production commencement dates, revenues, costs or  production output and anticipated lives of assets, mines  or facilities include: (i) our ability to profitably produce  and deliver the products extracted to applicable markets;  (ii) the impact of economic and geopolitical factors,  including foreign currency exchange rates on the market  prices of the commodities we produce and competition  in the markets in which we operate; (iii) activities of  government authorities in the countries where we sell  our products and in the countries where we are exploring  or developing projects, facilities or mines, including  increases in taxes and royalties or implementation of  trade or export restrictions; (iv) changes in environmental  and other regulations; (v) political or geopolitical  uncertainty; (vi) labour unrest; (vii) weather, climate  variability or other manifestations of climate change; and  (viii) other factors identified in the risk factors discussed  in section 8.1 of the Operating and Financial Review in  the BHP Annual Report 2024 and BHP’s filings with the  US SEC (including in Annual Reports on Form 20-F),  available on the US SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.  In addition, there are limitations with respect to scenario  analysis, including any climate-related scenario analysis,  and it is difficult to predict which, if any, of the scenarios  might eventuate. Scenario analysis is not an indication  of probable outcomes and relies on assumptions that  may or may not prove to be correct or eventuate, and  scenarios may be impacted by additional factors to the  assumptions disclosed. Except as required by applicable regulations or by law,  BHP does not undertake to publicly update or review any  forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new  information or future events. Past performance cannot be relied on as a guide to  future performance. Reliance on third party information  This CTAP may contain climate- and sustainability- related disclosures that have been prepared by BHP  on the basis of publicly available information, internally  developed data and other third-party sources believed  to be reliable. BHP has not sought to independently  verify information obtained from public and third-party  sources and makes no representations or warranties as  to accuracy, completeness, reasonableness or reliability  of such information.

The BHP GHG Emissions  Calculation Methodology explains the different calculation  approaches based on the purpose for which the data is  being provided. Inherent uncertainty and limitations in  measuring GHG emissions mean all GHG emissions data  or volumes (including ratios or percentages) in this CTAP  are estimates. Third-party data may not be comparable  to our data due to different calculation methodologies or  reporting approaches. The latest BHP GHG Emissions Calculation Methodology  is available at bhp.com/climate Where to find important information in  this CTAP and our annual reporting suite Our GHG emissions targets and goals We reference our GHG emissions targets and goals  throughout this CTAP. For the essential definitions, assumptions and adjustments  for the targets and goals for our operational GHG emissions  (Scopes 1 and 2 emissions from our operated assets) and  value chain GHG emissions (Scope 3 emissions), as well  as more information on factors that inform them, refer to  Additional information – Definitions and key details for  our GHG emissions targets and goals on pages 57 to 60 Non-operated assets Non-operated assets have their own operating and  management standards. Non-operated assets do not  form part of our operational GHG emissions as we use an  operational control boundary for our calculation approach.  Scopes 1 and 2 emissions from our non-operated joint  venture interests are reported in our Scope 3 emissions  inventory under Category 15 ‘Investments’ but are an  insignificant source of Scope 3 emissions when compared  to our total annual reported Scope 3 emissions inventory  (based on FY2024 figures). For more information on our approach to non-operated assets,  refer to Value chain GHG emissions – Our net zero goal for  value chain GHG emissions (Scope 3 emissions) on pages  20 and 21 Alignment with the voluntary UK Transition  Plan Taskforce Disclosure Framework When developing this CTAP, we considered the voluntary  UK Transition Plan Taskforce Disclosure Framework, which aims  to support companies to develop high-quality, consistent and  comparable transition plan disclosures.  We illustrate the extent of the alignment of our disclosures in  this CTAP with the disclosure elements of the Transition Plan  Taskforce Disclosure Framework in Additional information –  Our Transition Plan Taskforce alignment on page 56 BHP Annual Reporting Suite We recommend this CTAP be read in conjunction with the latest  BHP Annual Report to provide a more comprehensive view of past  performance and future plans and for our annual reported Scopes  1, 2 and 3 emissions inventories (presented on both an adjusted  and unadjusted basis): 	 – The BHP Annual Report: Operating and Financial Review  provides recent prior year and current progress against our  climate change strategy, GHG emissions targets and goals,  commitments and key metrics. 	 – The BHP Annual Report: Governance provides an overview  of governance structures, activities and remuneration incentives,  some of which relate to our climate change strategy.  	 – The BHP Annual Report: Financial Statements reflect  or explain the potential financial statement impacts, where  material or relevant, of the assumptions, plans and actions  of our climate change strategy.

It continues  our multi‑decade focus on climate  and underscores our commitment  to becoming a more sustainable  and resilient business. This is  important work that will help set  us up to grow long-term value  for shareholders.   Much has changed in our portfolio since we released  our first Climate Transition Action Plan in September  2021. We have increased our exposure to commodities  that stand to benefit from the trends that will shape the  world in the decades to come. We have divested our  petroleum business. We are focusing our coal portfolio  on the higher-quality steelmaking coals increasingly  preferred by customers. And we have increased our  exposure to copper and potash, with further growth to  come. We expect the traditional drivers of demand for  our key commodities to endure. That demand will only  be amplified by the energy transition. What has not changed is our resolve to operate  our business in ever more sustainable ways. Since  the 1990s, we have set and achieved targets for  Scopes 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  from our operated assets.  We call these operational GHG emissions and we are  working to extend our track record of delivery through  this plan.  In doing so, we seek to give our partners and  stakeholders confidence in the integrity of our plans  and our ability to deliver them. That confidence is  important – not just for shareholders, but also the  broader public and policymakers. And we will all  need to hold that confidence over multiple decades  to achieve the world’s net zero transition.  We remain on track to meet our operational GHG  emissions target of at least a 30 per cent reduction  by FY2030 against an FY2020 baseline.   Much of our early progress has come from the purchase  of renewable electricity from large scale, grid-connected  power assets. Importantly, nine out of our 10 power  purchase agreements for renewable electricity are  enabling the development of new generation. As a  major and, in some cases, foundational customer,  we play a key role in delivering the demand needed  to secure investment in these projects. The next wave of our operational decarbonisation is  going to require even more effort and investment. We  estimate up to US$4 billion (nominal terms) in spend and  commitments over the decade to FY2030 to execute our  operational decarbonisation plans. This incorporates  capital expenditure and lease commitments that  were previously expected to be classified as capital  expenditure. We apply our Capital Allocation Framework  to help maximise the returns we achieve from the capital  we invest to reduce operational GHG emissions.  Our biggest remaining source of operational GHG  emissions is diesel. Since CY2021, we have been  working with the likes of Caterpillar and Komatsu  to support the development of battery-electric  trucks. We are trialling electric mining equipment  and vehicles in Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO)  and Copper South Australia and will continue  working with manufacturers on the electrification  of more equipment in the years ahead.   We are developing pathways for our long-term goal  to achieve net zero operational GHG emissions by  CY2050. Progress towards our medium-term target  and long-term goal won’t be linear. To help achieve  global net zero and support population growth, we  will have to provide more of the resources the world  needs, not less. That means production growth. More copper for electrification of transport and  energy networks. More steelmaking raw materials to  develop our cities and build renewable infrastructure.   More potash to underpin our food security with more  sustainable land use.  While we work to decarbonise our operations, we also  seek to support our suppliers and customers to do  the same. As Scope 3 GHG emissions relate to their  businesses, we cannot directly control them, however,  we can seek to influence better outcomes through  our procurement decisions and the investments and  partnerships we choose to pursue. Our iron ore and coal products are mostly used for  steelmaking, which is a GHG emissions intensive  process that is currently hard-to-abate. We’re  supporting multiple potential pathways to a lower  GHG emissions future for steelmakers.   We are working with and investing alongside  our customers like ArcelorMittal, China Baowu,  JFE, HBIS, POSCO, Tata Steel and Zenith –  representing around 20 per cent of the world’s  reported steel production – on projects to help  support future reductions in steelmaking’s GHG  emissions intensity.  Another example is the partnership we have entered  into with Rio Tinto and BlueScope on a potential  Australian ironmaking electric smelting furnace pilot.  This is promising technology, which could materially  lower GHG emissions intensity and is also amenable  to a wider range of iron ores.  Through BHP Ventures, we are also investing directly  in companies like Boston Metal and Electra, which  are working to develop breakthrough processes that  could one day produce near zero emissions steel.  In shipping, we are using five dual-fuelled LNG  vessels within our time-chartered fleet that, when run  on LNG, reduce GHG emissions by voyage compared  to conventional fuel. We are also working with other  miners and shipping stakeholders to explore the  potential for alternative fuels, such as low to zero  GHG emission ammonia, in the future.  By supporting and investing in various potential  pathways, we want to help accelerate the  development of technology that could not just benefit  our value chain, but that of our broader industry.  The road from ambition to abatement is hard. No  business can navigate it alone. In fact, we need  industry and government to walk it together to  achieve the world’s net zero ambitions.  This is why we continue to support government  policies aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement  and conduct our advocacy efforts consistent with our  Climate Policy Principles.  This Climate Transition Action Plan reaffirms our  intent to play our part in this global effort – producing  more of the essential commodities the world needs  to develop and decarbonise; investing to reduce our  operational GHG emissions; and collaborating to  support lower GHG emissions in our value chain.  In doing this, we continue to reflect our purpose  of bringing people and resources together to build  a better world. We appreciate the engagement  of shareholders and other stakeholders in the  development of this plan and look forward to hearing  your feedback on it in the weeks and months ahead.  Thank you.

Through our differentiated approach  to social value, we aim to be a trusted partner that creates value for  all stakeholders. We do this by creating mutual benefit for BHP, our  shareholders, Indigenous partners and the broader community. We are positioning our portfolio of  commodities and assets to create value  for today and the future. Over the last few years, we have repositioned our portfolio  towards commodities that enable and support decarbonisation  and electrification, urbanisation and a growing population.  In our portfolio we have copper, iron ore, steelmaking coal, nickel,  uranium and energy coal. Among other end uses, copper is used in  electric vehicles, renewable energy technologies and the power grid;  nickel is used in batteries; uranium is a feedstock for nuclear power;  potash is used in fertilisers, which can assist with food security for  a growing population and more sustainable land use; while iron ore  and steelmaking coal create steel to build new infrastructure. As the global population grows and urbanises and the world pursues  decarbonisation and electrification, we are positioning our portfolio to  increase our exposure to these megatrends. We have made significant changes to our portfolio since our  previous CTAP in CY2021. As we continue to build a portfolio of  high-quality assets producing more of our chosen commodities,  we are mindful of a global transition towards net zero. Our climate change strategy and this CTAP at a glance Commitments, targets and goals What we are doing Value chain GHG emissions  (Scope 3 emissions) from page 19 We have a long-term goal of net zero   Scope 3 GHG emissions by CY2050.  Achievement of this goal is uncertain,  particularly given the challenges of a net zero  pathway for our customers in steelmaking,  and we cannot ensure the outcome alone Our long-term targets are to achieve net  zero by CY2050 for the GHG emissions  from all shipping of BHP products and  for the operational GHG emissions of  our direct suppliers Our medium-term goals for CY2030 are to  support industry to develop steel production  technology capable of 30 per cent lower GHG  emissions intensity relative to conventional  blast furnace steelmaking3 and to support  40 per cent GHG emissions intensity  reduction of BHP‑chartered shipping  of BHP products4 Supporting the development of steel production  technology to help the steel sector reach near zero  emissions by partnering with our

Our long-term goal is to  achieve net zero operational  GHG emissions (Scopes 1 and  2 emissions from our operated  assets) by CY2050. We use FY2020 as the reference year for our  long‑term net zero goal. Our operational GHG  emissions medium-term target and long-term net  zero goal apply to our entire reported Scopes 1  and 2 emissions inventory. We adjust these GHG  emissions for our medium-term target’s baseline  year and long‑term net zero goal’s reference year  and subsequent performance for acquisitions,  divestments and methodology changes. For the essential definitions, assumptions and  adjustments for this medium-term target and long‑term  net zero goal, as well as more information on factors  that inform them refer to Additional information –  Definitions and key details for our GHG emissions  targets and goals on pages 57 to 60 For how we set our medium-term target in FY2020  with reference to the ‘well-below 2°C’ Paris  Agreement goal, refer to Spotlight: Influences on  our operational GHG emissions target- and goal- setting on page 18, later in this section In FY2024, our reported Scopes 1 and 2 emissions  inventory was 9.2 MtCO2-e, a reduction of  32 per cent compared to our FY2020 baseline  (both years adjusted for acquisitions, divestments  and methodology changes). For comparison,  our reported Scope 3 emissions inventory was  377.0 MtCO2-e (adjusted for acquisitions, divestments  and methodology changes). We apply a different  calculation approach to our reported Scope 3  emissions inventory. For more information on our latest progress, refer to  the Climate change section in the latest BHP Annual  Report, available at bhp.com/investors/annual-reporting For information on the implications of Western  Australia’s temporary suspension on our operational  GHG emissions, refer to page 13 Pathway to our medium-term target We adjust our medium-term target’s baseline year  and subsequent performance for acquisitions,  divestments and methodology changes to provide  a like-for-like comparison for our operational GHG  emissions for continuing operations. We do not adjust  our baseline year and subsequent performance for  organic changes in our production of commodities,  so increasing production will require us to achieve  additional GHG emission reductions.  At the end of FY2030, we also aim to be at or below  a cumulative carbon budget (i.e. a total net amount  of GHG emissions that can be emitted). The carbon  budget is defined by our operational GHG emissions  being at or below a hypothetical straight line between  our adjusted baseline in FY2020 and a 30 per cent  reduction to that baseline in FY2030, despite our  pathway being non-linear.  Our plan is to meet our medium-term target  through structural GHG emissions abatement  instead of offsetting.  We will not use regulatory carbon credits (i.e. those  used for compliance under regulatory schemes,  such as Australia’s Safeguard Mechanism) to meet  our medium-term target. In addition, in our projected  pathway, we have not planned to use voluntary  carbon credits to meet our medium-term target.  However, if there is an unanticipated shortfall in  our pathway, we may need to use voluntary carbon  credits that meet our integrity standards to close the  performance gap. For more information on the difference between  regulatory and voluntary carbon credits, and the integrity  standards we apply to the voluntary carbon credits we  source, refer to Enabling delivery – How we manage  carbon credits on page 54 We aim to design new facilities and major projects  to emit or be ready to enable lower GHG emissions  than a conventional business as usual design. We  also assess the operational GHG emissions profile of  potential acquisitions and their potential impact on our  overall operational GHG emissions. Both are critical  to support our increased production of commodities.

Our projected pathway  is represented by the top of the ‘range of uncertainty’,  which should enable us to meet our medium-term  target. The bottom of the ‘range of uncertainty’ exceeds  a 30 per cent reduction to protect against individual  project risks and allow for sufficient options to meet our  medium‑term target, as well as maintaining momentum  on developing technologies required to achieve our  long‑term net zero goal. Pathway to our long-term net zero goal Our potential pathway to our long-term net zero goal  beyond FY2030, as shown in Figure 1.2, requires us to: Displace diesel via electric mining equipment/ vehicles (e.g. haul trucks, locomotives,  excavators, shovels) Procure additional renewable and other low  to zero GHG emissions electricity to support  the increased amount of electricity required for  electric mining equipment/vehicles Minimise fugitive methane emissions to the  greatest extent technically and commercially  viable, through enhanced application of  existing or emerging technology Many of the technologies we will need to achieve  our long‑term net zero goal are not yet ready to  be deployed.  A pathway between our medium-term target in FY2030  and our long-term net zero goal in CY2050 will require  a significant technological step change in safety,  reliability, productivity, availability and economics. The ‘range of uncertainty’, as shown in Figure 1.2,  reflects the potential for additional GHG emission  reductions from options we have currently identified,  including possible options to increase the scale or pace  of GHG emissions abatement. These options may  enable faster or more substantive reduction of GHG  emissions, but they also currently have a relatively low  technology readiness, higher operational integration risk  and/or are not yet commercially viable. We believe there are sufficient encouraging  developments in the market, including with our  suppliers, to identify a challenging but feasible potential  pathway to our long-term net zero goal. We are working  closely with suppliers to accelerate the readiness of new  technologies in this decade, including several planned  pilots and proof of concept trials primarily as alternatives  for diesel‑consuming mining equipment/vehicles.

We anticipate electric haul trucks (compared to  current state diesel haul trucks) will have superior  fuel-to-wheel energy efficiency and trucks are  able to drive faster on trolley assist than on diesel  motors. However, significant operational challenges  exist, including how we manage our fleet, how we  integrate a mix of static and dynamic charging,  how electrification impacts mine design and mine  planning, and how we manage the risks associated  with new technologies. Improvements to battery size,  cost, weight, capacity and replacement cycles are  also needed before large-scale adoption. When renewable and other low to zero GHG  emissions electricity production is localised or on-site,  it can increase the security and stability of supply  and offer improved economics over the lifecycle of an  investment. However, wind and solar generation must  also be sized (compensating for seasonal changes in  electricity production) and must be firmed (ensuring  the reliability and stability of energy supply over time). Minimising fugitive methane emissions continues  to be challenging as it requires a mix of enhanced  use of currently available solutions and significant  technology development, as well as challenges with  integration into existing operations. There are also  considerations and complexities in adapting currently  available abatement solutions, including safety,  integration and commercial viability. We will continue to look for opportunities to help  see the emerging technologies we need to reach  technological readiness and commercial viability. Based on what we know today,  we estimate we can reduce our  gross operational GHG emissions  by up to around 85 per cent against  FY2020 levels by CY2050 (adjusted  for acquisitions, divestments and  methodology changes), without the  use of offsetting. This is based on the projected improvements to the  technologies we need, the nature of our business  and the GHG emissions profile of our operations  (particularly fugitive methane emissions). We believe  a feasible pathway to net zero operational GHG  emissions will require the use of some offsetting. For more information on our approach to sourcing  carbon credits, refer to Enabling delivery – How  we manage carbon credits on page 54 Risks to our long-term net zero goal Our ability to pursue a pathway beyond our  medium‑term target in FY2030 to our long-term  net zero goal in CY2050 is affected by a range of  considerations and potential complications, including: 	 – availability of commercially viable renewable and  other low to zero GHG emissions electricity 	 – procurement strategies for electric mining  equipment/vehicles, battery and charging  infrastructure in a constrained supply environment 	 – scaling and incorporating electric mining  equipment/vehicles may not be as efficient or  effective as projected 	 – cost competitiveness of, and social concern  regarding, the use of biofuels for hard-to-electrify  applications 	 – the technical feasibility of fugitive methane  emissions abatement and its commercial  integration into mine designs and mine plans 	 – design of mine and processing facilities and  our ability to integrate new technologies into  existing operations 	 – impact of our acquisitions and divestments, as  well as our new country and commodity entries 	 – availability of specialist skills for future operations For more information on how our risk framework  supports our operational GHG emission reduction  strategy, refer to Enabling delivery – How we manage  climate-related risk (threats and opportunities) on  page 52 Spend and commitments Investment in the reduction of operational GHG  emissions is embedded in our corporate planning  processes, which are used to prioritise and allocate  capital across our business. For more information on our Capital Allocation  Framework and how it supports our operational  GHG emission reduction strategy, refer to Enabling  delivery – How we manage capital on page 53 On current assumptions, our overall collection of  operational GHG emission reduction projects that  support meeting our medium-term target remain net  present value positive under current technology and  cost assumptions and when factoring in our internal  carbon price protocol. We estimate up to US$4 billion (nominal  terms) in spend and commitments over the  decade to FY2030 to execute our operational  decarbonisation plans.  This incorporates capital expenditure and lease  commitments that were previously expected to  be classified as capital expenditure. Our estimate  represents incremental capital spend and lease  commitments of the lower GHG emissions option  above ordinary business as usual spend or  commitment (e.g. the additional cost of an electric  truck versus a diesel combustion truck).  The majority of our capital expenditure profile in this  decade is weighted towards diesel displacement and  weighted towards the late 2020s.  While some of our operational GHG emission  reduction projects have a higher degree of delivery  certainty, we also continue to study and progress  projects that have a lower degree of certainty. As  we progress necessary studies, we will learn more,  and our estimates of our spend and commitments to  FY2030 and beyond will evolve over time.  Our estimated spend and commitments will support  our projected pathway to our medium-term target  and our potential pathway to our long-term net  zero goal. However, most of our estimated spend  and commitments prior to FY2030 is focused  on advancing diesel displacement solutions via  electric mining equipment/vehicles. This would not  significantly impact operational GHG emissions by  FY2030 and we expect our estimated spend and  commitments to more significantly impact operational  GHG emissions post-FY2030. Key actions 	 – Continue electric mining equipment/vehicle trials  to test and learn in FY2025 	 – Pursue maximum renewable electricity penetration  at all grid-connected operated sites, with an aim  of 100 per cent purchased renewable electricity by  FY2030, where available and commercially viable 	 – Investigate and collaborate on novel techniques  for fugitive methane emissions measurement and  reduction at our steelmaking coal mines, including  atmospheric monitoring and open‑cut mine  gas drainage Western Australia Nickel and its impact In July 2024, we announced our Nickel West operations  and West Musgrave project (Western Australia Nickel)  would be temporarily suspended from October 2024.  We intend to review the decision to temporarily suspend  Western Australia Nickel by February 2027. We will continue to report on Western Australia  Nickel’s operational GHG emissions, including as part  of our baseline year for our medium-term target and  reference year for our long-term net zero goal. For our reported Scopes 1 and 2 emissions  inventory (adjusted for acquisitions, divestments and  methodology changes), Western Australia Nickel’s  operational GHG emissions were 11 per cent in  FY2024 and 8 per cent in FY2020 (the baseline year  for our medium-term target and reference year for our  long-term net zero goal). Western Australia Nickel’s planned incremental capital  spend and lease commitments on operational GHG  emission reductions are less than five per cent of the  estimated US$4 billion (nominal terms) in spend and  commitments over the decade to FY2030 to execute  our operational decarbonisation plans. This was  calculated prior to the decision to temporarily suspend  Western Australia Nickel. Western Australia Nickel’s temporary suspension  does not change our strategy to reduce operational  GHG emissions, nor materially impact our projected  pathway to our medium-term target or our potential  pathway to our long-term net zero goal or our planned  incremental capital spend and lease commitments.

We use a standardised  set of requirements, guidance and tools to develop  a demonstrable and verifiable plan that considers a  range of factors, both internal and external. We monitor and manage changes in these plans  each year for a variety of reasons, including the  overall BHP strategy, individual asset strategies, our  Capital Allocation Framework, growth plans, business  performance to date, external regulations and carbon  pricing. We incorporate updated views on market  availability and demand for lower GHG emission  technologies, and the outcomes of our early-stage  studies, trials and pilots. Our teams monitor technology  progress and actively engage and collaborate with  our suppliers, where relevant, to enable our plans to  reflect the dynamic nature of the energy transition and  emerging lower GHG emission technologies.  Senior management continues to play an important  role in reviewing the progress of our planned activities  towards our operational GHG emissions medium-term  target and long-term net zero goal, and the rationale  for any changes. Senior management approves the  plan and the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) and  Board maintain regular oversight over the progress  of our climate change strategy.  We also aim to be transparent by disclosing in the  BHP Annual Report, where appropriate, when and  why these changes occurred. When disclosing in  the BHP Annual Report, we have these disclosures  assured by a third party. Changes to our projected and potential  pathways to our long-term net zero goal In the BHP Annual Report 2023, we published our  operational GHG emissions projected pathway to  FY2030 and potential pathway between FY2031  and CY2050. Incorporating the outcomes of our  most recent annual planning process, our operational  GHG emissions projected (to FY2030) and potential  (beyond FY2030) pathways to our long-term net zero  goal (as shown in Figure 1.2 on page 12, earlier in  this section) has been updated for FY2024, with the  primary changes being: 	 – a decrease in diesel GHG emissions abatement  due to new and unforeseen challenges experienced  by original equipment manufacturers, resulting  in less certainty of technology and commercial  readiness of diesel displacement options. An  example is questions around the ability to apply  electrification to certain mining equipment/vehicles  (e.g. drill rigs, dozers, tugboats) before CY2050,  which have led to an increase in projected residual  GHG emissions from diesel 	 – an increase in the range of uncertainty due  to less certainty of technology and commercial  readiness of diesel displacement options, as well  as our enhanced understanding of the challenges  presented by a change to our operations  as complex and far‑reaching as large-scale  electrification Additionally: 	 – our Jansen potash project’s heightened focus  on operational readiness for first production  has deferred certain studies on low to zero GHG  emission energy options and GHG emission  reduction technologies until after first production  commences (expected in late CY2026). We continue  to pursue commercial solutions with our partners to  reduce operational GHG emissions for Jansen 	 – the planned FY2024 drilling program at BMA,  which will assist in obtaining a deeper understanding  of methane quality and quantity (in both magnitude  and density), will now commence during FY2026/27 For more information on our approach to methane  measurement, management and mitigation at BMA, refer  to Our areas of focus to reduce operational GHG  emissions on pages 15 to 17, later in this section   These changes are not expected to have any material  impact on our ability to meet our medium‑term target. Likely future changes As our studies, trials and pilots progress, we expect  there will be future changes in our operational GHG  emissions plans. We anticipate, in some cases, we may have been  conservative in our assessment of when the market  can innovate and develop new technologies that  are safe and productive, while in other cases, there  may be unforeseen delays and challenges impacting  our planning. Critical to minimising impacts to our plans is our  identification and management of varying types of  risks, including asset-, technology‑ and project-specific.  We aim to do this primarily through the integration of  decarbonisation into our corporate planning and capital  project delivery processes. Our estimated spend and commitments over the  decade to FY2030 for operational GHG emission  reductions will continue to evolve as we seek to  maximise returns while growing the business and  decarbonising our operations. To do this, we apply  our Capital Allocation Framework to seek to ensure  our decisions are aligned with our medium-term target  and long-term net zero goal, as applicable, and rank  highly against the risk and return metrics we use to  evaluate decarbonisation projects.  Spotlight How we plan operational GHG emission reductions in a dynamic environment The tugboats we operate at our WAIO asset are an example where we have less certainty of technology and commercial readiness of diesel  displacement options Introduction Contents Physical risk  and adaptation Equitable change   and transition Climate policy  advocacy Enabling  delivery Additional   information Portfolio  Value chain   GHG emissions BHP Climate Transition Action Plan 2024 14 Operational   GHG emissions  ===== PAGE 15 ===== Our areas of focus to reduce operational GHG emissions Electricity Most of our operated assets are in locations that are  grid-connected and have access to renewable and  other low to zero GHG emissions electricity through  a network.  This has enabled us to establish a number  of low to zero GHG emission power purchase  agreements rapidly and at scale for a significant  proportion of our total FY2024 electricity demand. We aim to prioritise and encourage new renewable  generation where commercially feasible to help  drive a broader and positive change in the grid’s  profile mix, instead of increasing the burden on  existing generation. Nearly all of our power purchase  agreements signed in or before FY2024 enable new  renewable generation projects as a foundational or  major customer. Diesel displacement via electric mining equipment/ vehicles will increase the amount of electricity  required at some of our operated assets by between  two and four times by CY2050. Future electricity  demand from the grid will also be amplified by the  broader electrification trend we are seeing within  our mining peers and other industries. We expect  demand-side management and load optimisation  will become more important, including matching  time-of-use and time-of-consumption. Depending on  our ability to manage load and reduce peak power  demand or add on-site generation and storage, many  of our sites are likely to require increased capacity in  transmission lines providing electricity to site. We are studying the spare network capacity and the  ability to meet this load growth with existing networks.  We will continue to work with our network service  providers to understand and plan for future capacity. Our  management of this risk considers the significant long  lead time for approvals, permitting, availability of key  equipment (e.g. transformers) and specialised workforce  with skills in building high voltage transmission and  distribution networks, substations, and other tasks  associated with electrification of our operations. In some of our more isolated locations (e.g. our WAIO  asset in the Pilbara region in Western Australia)  there is currently a shortage of renewable electricity  under development. We are working with electricity  generators, network operators, renewable electricity  developers and Traditional Owners to explore  opportunities to increase availability in these locations. Diesel Diesel combustion was the single largest source  of GHG emissions – 63 per cent – in our FY2024  reported Scopes 1 and 2 emissions inventory  (adjusted for acquisitions, divestments and  methodology changes). Finding new ways of  extracting and moving material is critical to achieving  our long-term net zero goal. We expect to displace diesel primarily via electrification  of mining equipment/vehicles (including locomotives)  and the associated use of low to zero GHG emissions  electricity sources.  The potential for additional upside benefits of  electrification over diesel and other low to zero GHG  emission alternatives (e.g. biofuels) includes: 	 – improved maintenance performance 	 – elimination of diesel particulate matter and any  other tail-pipe emissions 	 – reduction in heat, noise and vibrations 	 – compatibility with autonomous driving technology  such as easier pairing with trolley lines, reduced  idle time, and overall efficiency improvements We have been working with original equipment  manufacturers and our mining peers on electric  vehicles/mining equipment through groups such as the  International Council on Mining and Metals’ ‘Innovation  for Cleaner Safer Vehicles’ initiative to help accelerate  the availability of mining equipment and vehicles that  are safe and reliable. The electrification of our mining equipment/vehicles  will also be a change to the way we operate at our sites,  which we will need to manage so that our operations  remain safe and productive. For example, electrification  will require a significant increase in high voltage  electrical infrastructure for trailing cables, trolley lines,  fast chargers and other infrastructure that will need to  be safely integrated into our operations.  The introduction of vehicle autonomy at a number  of our sites has taught us valuable lessons about  adopting and de-risking new technology, which we  intend to incorporate into our electrification plans.  This includes taking a site-by-site approach to learn  and adapt our plans as we progress, and to identify  any implications of these changes to the safety of our  teams and the productivity of our operations. Trials and pilots of electric mining equipment/vehicles  have begun, such as excavators, jumbos (used to  drill holes underground) and light vehicles, and will  continue until adopted as business as usual. All trial,  pilot and adoption dates (as shown in Figure 1.2 on  page 12, earlier in this section) are current estimates  and we expect some could change due to external  factors. These include possible manufacturing  challenges as they move from research and  development to mass production, and the degree  of acceleration of new technologies. These trials and pilots will inform the operational  changes we need to make and help validate our  GHG emission reduction models. This will enable  investment decisions and also inform future operating  and maintenance strategies, including safety and  operating conditions for future electrified sites.  Our trials, pilots and other supporting studies aim to  understand and address a wide and essential range  of variables, including: 	 – additional safety considerations 	 – performance in high temperature, high altitude,  dusty and rough environments 	 – battery lifecycle and recycling 	 – high-power static and dynamic charging 	 – mixed diesel and electric mining equipment/vehicles 	 – integration with autonomous haulage We expect original equipment manufacturers to be  ready to produce electric mining equipment/vehicles  at scale in the late 2020s. Our WAIO asset will likely  be our first operated asset to  progressively roll-out electric haul  trucks and excavators towards the  end of the 2020s.  We consider biofuels as a backup option if  electrification is delayed or unsuccessful, and we  continue to monitor developments in this area.  Our position on biofuels is informed by a trial in  FY2023 that provided us valuable insights into using  hydrogenated vegetable oil in multiple types of mining  equipment. The trial also helped us understand the  biofuels value chain and the importance of standards  and quality assurance to mitigate potential concerns  with these fuels (e.g. competition with food production,  water use, land use, and transparency of feedstocks). While our plan for displacing diesel used in most of  our mining equipment/vehicles is clear, our potential  pathway to decarbonise hard-to-electrify mining  equipment/vehicles (e.g. drill rigs, dozers, tugboats) and  other ancillary equipment is less clear. Biofuels are a  technically viable option, but remain relatively expensive  and subject to the potential environmental and ethical  concerns we noted from our trial. We will continue to  look for opportunities to collaborate to support further  innovation for hard-to-electrify equipment. Fugitive methane emissions Fugitive emissions occur when methane or CO2  contained within and near coal seams are released  during the mining process.  Fugitive emissions come from our steelmaking coal  asset BMA (which has four open-cut mines that  comprise the bulk of our steelmaking coal production  and one underground mine) and our energy coal asset  New South Wales Energy Coal (NSWEC). For BMA,  although we have a 50 per cent ownership interest,  as the operator we incorporate 100 per cent of its  operational GHG emissions in our reported inventory.  Our strategy to address fugitive emissions focuses on  BMA as we plan to cease mining at NSWEC by the  end of FY2030. Our strategy also focuses on fugitive  methane emissions, as the volume of fugitive CO2  emissions occurring at BMA is relatively small. Our analysis shows we currently have lower  fugitive methane emissions intensity at our coal  mines relative to Australian and international  coal mines.  Introduction Contents Physical risk  and adaptation Equitable change   and transition Climate policy  advocacy Enabling  delivery Additional   information Portfolio  Value chain   GHG emissions BHP Climate Transition Action Plan 2024 15 Operational   GHG emissions  ===== PAGE 16 ===== Our areas of focus to reduce operational GHG emissions continued Fugitive methane emissions continued Our methane emissions intensity is expected to increase  over time as mining deeper coal seams typically  releases more methane than from shallower seams.  Mitigating fugitive methane emissions presents  significant challenges for BMA, as it does for many  of our mining peers. These challenges include:  	 – the relatively low fugitive methane emissions  intensity of our open-cut mines, while positive,  means abatement using current prevention  technologies is either not feasible or viable 	 – the configuration and scale of open-cut mines  make it hard to accurately apply less intrusive  ‘atmospheric’ monitoring techniques necessary  for targeted and effective prevention measures 	 – we need to supplement our existing, advanced  long-term coal resource knowledge with  comparable gas resource data to inform effective  methane mitigation plans Our strategy is to achieve accurate measurement  and forecasting, and then advance to fugitive  methane emissions prevention and, where necessary,  mitigation. This will be a multi-year journey that we  are progressing now.  Measurement We are developing a gas  resource characterisation drilling  plan that is intended to provide the  data we need to identify potentially  viable sites and seams for  prevention measures.  Certain methane management studies have been  completed at BMA that identified some changes to  the long-term characterisation of its methane gas  profile. Combined with investigation of other technical  and operational factors (e.g. coal seam thickness and  permeabilities, drilling techniques and mining and  drainage operational interfaces), improved knowledge  and insight (including the study findings) will inform  and enable the development of a more targeted  methane measurement, management and mitigation  strategy for our open-cut mines. All our open-cut steelmaking coal mines and our energy  coal mine now employ direct, site-specific measurement  of their fugitive emissions, known as ‘Method 2’ under  Australia’s National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting  (NGER) rules, which more accurately estimates fugitive  methane emissions than ‘Method 1’. This is because it  is based on site-specific in-situ gas content rather than  default emission factors. For more information on ‘Method 2’ direct, site- specific measurement of fugitive emissions, refer to  Spotlight: The Australian Government’s methods for  measuring fugitive methane emissions on this page In addition, we recently worked with researchers  and service providers on ‘top-down’ atmospheric  monitoring using satellite, aerial and ground-based  sensing techniques, which detected varying methane  levels leading to inconclusive measurement results.  Through this work, we have learned that applying  ‘top-down’ techniques to geographically large,  topographically complex and diffuse methane  sources, such as our open-cut coal mines, is very  complicated. We believe more research is required,  including the trialling of different combinations of  methane detection instruments and atmospheric  modelling techniques, to enable a proper  understanding of the role of ‘top-down’ monitoring  in complementing and/or verifying the ‘bottom-up’  measurement methods we currently employ.  We are currently partnering with other companies in  industry research and are supporting, where suitable,  other ‘top-down’ measurement trials by credible  stakeholders, such as the Australian Government and  United Nations International Methane Observatory. Our aim is to identify the potential for emerging  technologies to improve our understanding of real-time  relationships of fugitive methane emission levels and  mining activities and use that to inform our future  efforts in measurement, prevention and mitigation.  We continue to monitor the developing potential of  these technologies to enable effective monitoring and  assessment of methane emissions. We disclose our fugitive methane and CO2 emissions  by mine site in the latest BHP ESG Standards and  Databook, available at bhp.com/climate Prevention Abating fugitive methane emissions is a more difficult  prospect in our open-cut mines (compared to our only  underground mine, Broadmeadow at BMA). Gas drainage is a proven technology for  underground mining and is used primarily for  safety reasons. However, gas drainage is novel  for open-cut mining. This is especially the case  at established mines where the integration of gas  drainage and handling is likely to lead to planning  and operational challenges.  Use of drainage in open-cut mines is currently in its  infancy, with potential impacts to safety, the environment  and productivity still being explored. Its current  effectiveness in open-cut mines is highly variable and is  limited by multiple factors, including geology, reservoir  characteristics, lead time, engineering design, access  and operating parameters. Additionally, not all our  open‑cut mines will allow drainage due to their relatively  low fugitive methane emissions intensity.  Deployment of drainage in suboptimal conditions  could result in wasted investment and misprioritisation  that could divert expenditure from more impactful  management or mitigation options. Even if the  challenges posed by drainage could be overcome, it  is unlikely to prevent 100 per cent of fugitive methane  emissions at our mines. We are working to address these challenges,  including by collaborating with other miners in the  Australian Coal Industry Research Program. We are  also actively monitoring for new and evolving fugitive  methane emission abatement technologies and intend  to allocate funding to explore suitable opportunities  as they arise. Mitigation At our only underground coal mine, Broadmeadow  at BMA, we have made good progress destroying  drained methane through flaring (which converts  methane into less harmful CO2), when safe  and practical to do so. In FY2024, we abated  approximately 85,000 tCO2-e using this approach. Our efforts are now focused on maximising the  volume of methane destroyed, including a recent  investment to upgrade our gas drainage gathering  pipeline to enable more methane to be safely flared.  Spotlight The Australian Government’s  methods for measuring fugitive  methane emissions Method 2 is a ‘higher order’ direct measurement  approach that more accurately estimates fugitive  methane emissions associated with a mine site than  the Australian state-specific default emission factors  specified in the NGER rules for Method 1. Method 2 uses a Commonwealth Scientific and  Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)‑developed  technique for determining in-situ gas contents that  has been operationalised using industry standard gas  sampling, testing and modelling techniques to enable  site‑specific measurements that meet the NGER  regime’s stringent requirements for data sufficiency,  integrity and auditability. To the best of our knowledge,  it is the only direct measurement method for open‑cut  coal mine fugitive methane emissions in the world and  represents the most scientifically rigorous approach  currently available for this source. Method 2 has two primary steps: 	 Analyse core samples and geological  characteristics to develop a model that identifies  the distribution and composition of gas content  across the mine (or for a particular mine plan  horizon). The model may take the form of a  three dimensional ‘grid’ of different gas contents  per coal seam and location, or one or more  ‘zones’ containing similar strata for which gas  content and composition are averaged. The  standards for development of the gas model  are strict and govern the procedures for core  sample acquisition and laboratory testing,  gas data validation and screening, geological  interpretation, and the skills of the person or  team performing the estimations. 	 Yearly mapping of the location and quantity  of the coal and other carbonaceous material  extracted against the mine’s gas model to  determine the estimated amount of methane  and CO2 released to the atmosphere. This  includes a portion of gas that is assumed to be  released from any coal seams up to 20 metres  below the open‑cut pit floor.

We have been active in industry collaborations.  Collaboration between industry stakeholders, with  essential support from professional services firms  and academia, is critical to demonstrating that it is  technically and commercially feasible to decarbonise  heavy industry. We have also collaborated in the  electrification of mining equipment, where we work  with mining peers through industry-led consortiums.  Our industry collaborations include our work with: 	 – Australian Industry Energy Transitions  Initiative, which brought together key  stakeholders across the Australian industry to  build demonstrable pathways to decarbonisation 	 – International Council on Mining and Metals’  ‘Innovation for Cleaner, Safer Vehicles’  initiative, which brought together suppliers and  mining operators to help accelerate the transition  to electrified mining equipment/vehicles 	 – CharIN’s ‘Mining Taskforce’, which brought  together equipment manufacturers, mining  operators and industry bodies to standardise the  charging connectors for future electrified heavy  mining equipment 	 – Clean Technology Institute, where Chilean  universities, mining companies and other industry  companies will collaboratively develop projects to  support the electrification of mining operations 	 – Caterpillar, who we are collaborating with through  its Early Learner program to develop and deploy  Cat zero-exhaust emission trucks 	 – Komatsu, who we partnered with to seek to develop  commercially viable zero GHG emission trucks 	 – Rio Tinto, a mining peer with whom we plan to  mutually share Caterpillar and Komatsu truck  trial outcomes 	 – Progress Rail, a Caterpillar company, that will  supply two battery electric locomotives for our  planned trials in CY2025 	 – Wabtec, where we plan to use two battery electric  locomotives supplied by Wabtec for our planned  trials in CY2025 	 – Toyota Australia, who we partnered with to  enhance our approach to reducing operational  GHG emissions and improving safety measures  for vehicles at our Minerals Australia assets Our engagement with industry associations, such  as the Chilean Mining Council and Minerals Council  of Australia (MCA), are important platforms for  cross‑industry collaboration to support our efforts  to reduce operational GHG emissions. An example  of this is our work within the MCA to provide feedback  in support of the reforms to Australia’s Safeguard  Mechanism from the perspective of the Australian  mining sector. We have also been active in executive-level  collaborations to facilitate senior level discussion  across industry, such as the World Economic  Forum’s Transitioning Industrial Clusters and Clean  Power for Industry initiatives. Outcomes from these  collaborations have had meaningful benefits for us,  including the progression of reporting frameworks to  enable renewable electricity supply to be matched  with consumption, helping inform the mix of electricity  generation sources we plan to contract.

However, NDCs  for countries where we have significant operations  have baseline years of CY2005 to CY2007, which  makes it hard to compare their trajectory with the  FY2020 baseline we have for our medium-term target  and against which we track progress towards our  long-term net zero goal. Our position is to support appropriate sectoral  policy responses that, in aggregate, contribute to  the delivery of NDCs at a country level, such as  Australia’s Safeguard Mechanism. Influences on our operational  GHG emissions target- and goal-setting To determine whether we should adjust our  medium‑term target or long-term net zero goal  in the future, we monitor key factors, including: 	 – advances in knowledge and insight from the  scientific community 	 – government climate policies 	 – international developments, such as the  Conference of the Parties to the United Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP) 	 – technology readiness and commercial viability 	 – the expectations and decarbonisation progress  of our mining peers, suppliers and customers 	 – the expectations of our shareholders and other  stakeholders and partners Medium-term target influences Our medium-term target percentage reduction was  established in FY2020 by applying the same rate  of reduction to our operational GHG emissions  as the rate of reduction to global GHG emissions  required to meet the Paris Agreement goal to hold  the global average temperature increase to well  below 2°C (based on the Science Based Targets  initiative’s (SBTi) absolute contraction approach  at that time). While there is no universal standard for determining  the alignment of targets with the goals of the Paris  Agreement, SBTi is often cited as a means of  providing some assurance on the level of ambition. At the end of FY2024, SBTi had not developed  a methodology to assess the diversified mining  sector. It currently excludes target verification for  any company deriving more than five per cent  revenue from fossil fuel assets – drawing no  distinction between coal used for steelmaking and  coal produced for energy generation. SBTi criteria  also currently require companies to set Scope 3  emissions targets related to the GHG emissions  from the steel sector that are aligned with a 1.5°C  pathway. However, our analysis indicates the steel  sector, particularly in the developing world, is far from  being aligned with a 1.5°C pathway with significant  technological uncertainty and challenges remaining  for the decarbonisation of steelmaking. Therefore,  it is not possible for us to set and verify a suite of  targets that the SBTi would validate at this stage. Long-term net zero goal influences Our operational GHG emissions long-term net zero  goal was influenced by the Paris Agreement, the NDCs  of the countries we have significant operations in, the  expectations of our shareholders and key stakeholders,  and the general scientific consensus that the world must  be operating in a net zero GHG emissions environment  by CY2050 to hold the global average temperature  increase to well below 2°C. Other regulatory mechanisms A pathway to our operational GHG emissions  long‑term net zero goal, as for most companies,  is a multi-decade challenge. It requires  fundamental shifts in market design, reporting  regimes and energy infrastructure.  Climate-related regulations and policies are key to  our success because they enable effective long‑term  strategic decision-making and are directly or indirectly  supportive of actions that reduce GHG emissions. The recent introduction of climate-related regulations  such as reforms to Australia’s Safeguard Mechanism,  Canada’s Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act  and Chile’s Climate Change Law seek to create and  maintain commercial environments that help to support  the transition to a lower GHG emissions economy.  These types of policies and regulations help create  an environment where business can invest in lower  GHG emission solutions with increased certainty. For  example, Australia’s Renewable Energy Target resulted  in the scale-up of cost-competitive renewable energy  being available to us. We support government policies through our policy  advocacy that enable technology development and  deployment, as well as incentives for decarbonisation,  in line with our Climate Policy Principles.

We have a long-term goal of net  zero Scope 3 GHG emissions  by CY2050. Achievement of this  goal is uncertain, particularly  given the challenges of a net  zero pathway for our customers  in steelmaking, and we cannot  ensure the outcome alone. We use FY2020 as the reference year for our  long‑term net zero goal. Our value chain GHG  emissions long-term goal of net zero Scope 3  emissions by CY2050 applies to our entire reported  Scope 3 emissions inventory. We adjust value chain  GHG emissions (Scope 3 emissions) for our long‑term  net zero goal’s reference year and subsequent  performance for acquisitions, divestments and  methodology changes.  For the essential definitions, assumptions and  adjustments for our long-term net zero goal, as well as  more information on factors that inform them, including  how we and our value chain may use carbon credits  for offsetting, refer to Additional information –  Definitions and key details for our GHG emissions  targets and goals on pages 57 to 60 We also have medium-term goals for steelmaking  and BHP-chartered shipping of our products, and  long-term net zero targets for the shipping of BHP  products and the operational GHG emissions of  our direct suppliers. In FY2024, our reported Scope 3 emissions inventory  was 377.0 MtCO2-e (adjusted for acquisitions,  divestments and methodology changes). For  comparison, our reported Scopes 1 and 2 emissions  inventory was 9.2 MtCO2-e (adjusted for acquisitions,  divestments and methodology changes).  We apply a different calculation approach to our  reported Scope 3 emissions inventory than for our  Scopes 1 and 2 emissions inventory. For more information on our latest progress, refer to  the Climate change section in the latest BHP Annual  Report, available at bhp.com/investors/annual-reporting Strategy Our strategy to support reduction of GHG emissions  in our value chain has four primary focus areas: 1.	 Support the development and adoption of  GHG emissions intensity reduction technologies  in steelmaking 2.	 Enhance the quality of the iron ore and  steelmaking coal we produce 3.	 Encourage direct suppliers to pursue net zero for  their operational GHG emissions (Scopes 1 and 2  emissions) 4.	 Support the development and adoption of GHG  emission reduction technologies in shipping For more information on our value chain GHG  emissions medium‑term goals and long-term net zero  targets and our approach to: 	 – supporting GHG emissions intensity reductions for  steelmaking, refer to Steelmaking: Our Scope 3  emissions goal to support capability for GHG  emissions intensity reduction on pages 24 and  25, later in this section 	 – encouraging direct suppliers to pursue net zero  operational GHG emissions, refer to Direct  suppliers: Our Scope 3 emissions net zero  target for direct suppliers’ operational GHG  emissions on page 28, later in this section 	 – supporting GHG emission reductions from shipping,  refer to Shipping: Our Scope 3 emissions goal  to support GHG emissions intensity reduction  and net zero target on pages 29 and 30, later in  this section These focus areas have been set with consideration  of the scale of GHG emissions in our value chain  (the dominant source being from processing of our  iron ore and steelmaking coal by our customers for  steelmaking), as shown in Figure 2.1, the level of  impact we can achieve with stakeholders and  industry, as shown in Figure 2.2, and the alignment  to our portfolio strategy. We estimate the current committed or planned  funding and in-kind contributions from FY2020  to FY2029 by BHP and our industry partners in  these steelmaking and shipping focus areas would  result in a co-investment total of approximately  US$820 million, based on available information  and our assumptions.

We anticipate  that steelmakers will increasingly prefer higher quality  raw materials as the steel sector decarbonises. We  have increased the ratio of high grade lump ore that  we produce through the recent development of our  South Flank mine which completed its ramp up to full  production capacity in FY2024.  In recent years we have divested our interests in BHP  Mitsui Coal (BMC) and BMA’s Blackwater and Daunia  mines to high-grade our steelmaking coal portfolio. We are also assessing other options to enhance  the quality of our product portfolio in a targeted  manner, including: 	 – beneficiating (i.e. using physical processes  to remove impurities from ore) our iron ores 	 – washing our steelmaking coals to reduce ash content 	 – supporting customers to pelletise our iron ores  to improve steelmaking efficiency  Other important considerations For more information on the calculation methodologies,  assumptions, treatment of divestments and acquisitions  and key references used in the preparation of our  reported GHG emissions data, refer to the latest BHP  GHG Emissions Calculation Methodology, available at  bhp.com/climate Changes in our portfolio Since our previous CTAP in CY2021 we have  made changes in our portfolio relevant to our  reported Scope 3 emissions inventory, primarily  the divestment of our Petroleum business in FY2022  and the divestment of our interest in the energy coal  asset Cerrejón in FY2022. Subsequently, Scope  3 emissions in Category 11 ‘Use of sold products’  (which covers GHG emissions from the end use of  goods and services sold by the reporting company,  such as the combustion of energy coal or natural gas)  are a significantly smaller source of GHG emissions   in our reported Scope 3 emissions inventory.  We project the planned closure of our Mt Arthur Coal  mine by FY2030 would result in Scope 3 emissions in  Category 11 becoming an insignificant source in our  reported Scope 3 emissions inventory. Carbon credits used for offsetting We anticipate offsetting by our customers, suppliers  and other third parties will play a role in meeting our  long-term net zero goal (and potentially our long-term net  zero targets), particularly for residual GHG emissions in  steelmaking which are not currently expected to reach   net zero by CY2050.  Over time, as transparency improves over third-party  offsetting of their GHG emissions that appear in  our reported Scope 3 emissions inventory, we plan  to recognise and report the net Scope 3 emissions  after offsetting.  Carbon credits sourced by third parties in our value chain  and associated with GHG emissions that appear in our  reported Scope 3 emissions inventory would need to  be high-integrity before we recognised that offsetting  in our reporting. For more information on our integrity standards  that we apply to the carbon credits we source, refer  to Enabling delivery – How we manage carbon  credits on page 54 Measuring Scope 3 emissions Improving GHG emissions measurement is essential  to quantifying the GHG emission reductions occurring  in our value chain as a result of our actions and  support, as well as those occurring as a result of  a global transition to net zero.  We currently estimate certain Scope 3 emission  categories using methodologies that rely on  industry assumptions rather than supplier- or  customer‑specific data. As a result, estimated GHG  emissions for those categories may be higher or lower  than calculated by the supplier or customer. This also  means a significant proportion of our reported Scope  3 emissions inventory is currently not able to reflect  GHG emission reductions that our suppliers and  customers may achieve. We are seeking ways to improve  the availability and reliability of  supplier- and customer-specific  Scope 3 emissions data, and we  have included this as part of our  strategy for steelmaking, shipping  and suppliers.  We are developing technology projects to streamline,  automate and enhance carbon accounting and better  integrate Scope 3 emissions data sources, as well as  a pilot project for a data exchange platform to learn  about viability and scalability. We regularly engage with our steelmaking customers  to discuss ways to align GHG emission calculation  methodologies. We have started to introduce contractual requirements  for regular GHG emissions reporting by our suppliers  that will help to build their measurement capability and  improve our ability to report Scope 3 emissions. We have already had some early successes with  data availability for shipping stemming from our  partnership with DNV and our use of its Veracity data  platform for validation and reporting of shipping- related value chain GHG emissions since FY2022. Non-operated assets Our non-operated assets, like Samarco and Antamina,  have their own operating and management standards.  Operational GHG emissions from our non-operated  joint venture interests are reported in our Scope 3  emissions inventory under Category 15 ‘Investments’  and are an immaterial source of Scope 3 emissions  when compared to our FY2024 reported Scope 3  emissions inventory. We see our role in non-operated  joint ventures as primarily to encourage and seek to  influence them through their respective governance  structures to reduce their operational GHG emissions,  as well as sharing decarbonisation knowledge and  experience where appropriate.  Samarco, which is jointly owned (50:50) by BHP  Billiton Brasil LTDA and Vale S.A., has a target to  reduce Scopes 1 and 2 emissions by 30 per cent by  CY2032 compared to a CY2015 baseline, which is an  important step towards its ambition to reach net zero  for operational GHG emissions longer-term.7 Antamina, which we partly own (33.75 per cent), did  not have public GHG emission reduction targets or  goals in FY2024.

Today, integrated steelmaking via blast furnaces  dominates ore-based steel production and has  evolved to be more energy efficient, but it remains  GHG emissions intensive. Lowering the GHG  emissions intensity of ore-based steelmaking will  require innovation through the adoption of alternative  process routes, new equipment design and different  operating parameters. Near zero emissions steel can be successfully  produced from scrap today in an electric arc furnace  powered by renewable or other low to zero GHG  emissions electricity. However, production is limited by  the amount of scrap that can be recovered and there  is expected to be a large deficit between scrap-based  steel production and steel demand through to CY2050.  We therefore expect ore-based steel production will  continue to be a vital part of the industry. We use our conceptual ‘steel decarbonisation  framework’ as a foresight tool for how ore-based steel  production may evolve. It consists of the four process  routes which, in our view, offer the greatest potential  for developing into near zero emissions steelmaking  with sufficient flexibility, scalability and efficiency to  support widespread adoption.  The four process routes, as shown in Figure 2.3,  are described by the core ironmaking furnace or  reactor used: 1.	 Blast furnace 2.	 Electric arc furnace 3.	 Electric smelting furnace 4.	 Electrolysis The electric arc furnace and electric smelting  furnace process routes are collectively referred to  as direct reduced iron routes as they both require  a direct reduced iron processing step prior to the  electric furnace. Under our framework, reaching an end state where  near zero emissions steel production is widespread  would involve the sector migrating through three  stages of progression: 1.	 Optimisation 2.	 Transition 3.	 End state Estimates of the typical GHG emissions intensity  in the end state for the four process routes are  shown in Figure 2.3. For residual GHG emissions,  it may be technically feasible to reduce them even  further, however offsetting methods may be a more  cost‑effective alternative. Overall, the pathways and stages of progression that  individual steelmakers may take will vary, influenced  by a range of factors, including: 	 – global and national economic trajectories 	 – government policy and regulatory settings 	 – steel grades that need to be produced 	 – land, labour and capital stock (including the age  of existing infrastructure) 	 – materials and energy, particularly the availability,  grade and cost of iron ore, scrap metal, low to zero  GHG emissions electricity and key reductant fuel  sources (steelmaking coal, natural gas and low to  zero GHG emissions hydrogen) 	 – technological advances These factors will largely determine how extensively  hydrogen, natural gas, CCUS and electrolysis is used,  as the industry pursues near zero emissions steel  production. They will also mean there are likely to be  significant differences in the prevalence of the four  process routes, their configurations and the timing of  adoption between regions, particularly between Asia  and Europe.  We support government policies through our policy  advocacy which enables technology development and  deployment, as well as incentives for decarbonisation,  in line with our Climate Policy Principles.

Our strategy is to support the  development of technologies  across all four process routes. Currently there are no near zero emissions  technologies for iron ore-based steelmaking that are  ready for widespread commercial adoption. This must  change for us to achieve our long-term net zero goal.  Near zero emissions steelmaking options for the  traditional blast furnace require CCUS in combination  with other complementary technologies (e.g. top  gas recycling). Low to zero GHG emissions hydrogen has the  potential to decarbonise the electric arc furnace and  the electric smelting furnace process routes to near  zero emissions.  The electric arc furnace route is relatively mature but  lacks flexibility and there are insufficient high‑quality  iron ore resources to rely exclusively on this route  to meet global demand. In CY2023, only 3 to 4 per  cent of global seaborne iron ore supply met the  specifications currently accepted in the market for  production of direct reduced iron for electric arc  furnaces.9 It is critical the steel sector develops  alternative technology pathways to near zero  emissions steel that are compatible with a wider  range of iron ore types. For new process routes, we estimate the electric  smelting furnace will begin to play a substantive  role from the early- to mid-2030s, while electrolysis  is unlikely to be ready for widespread deployment  until the late 2030s. These estimates remain subject  to further advancements and testing required to  demonstrate technical and commercial viability. For case studies on how we’re supporting the  development of the electric smelting furnace and  electrolysis for steelmaking, refer to Steelmaking:  Case studies on pages 26 and 27, later in this section Our view is that decarbonisation of the steel  sector is likely to occur more slowly than has been  projected by many low GHG emission scenarios,  including our 1.5°C scenario. For more information on the steel sector in our 1.5°C  scenario, refer to Portfolio – Steelmaking, iron ore  and steelmaking coal in our 1.5°C scenario on  pages 37 and 38 We also believe decarbonisation of the steel  sector will occur more slowly than what has been  projected by the International Energy Agency’s Net  Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario. That scenario  incorporates a larger role for electrolysis in the period  to CY2050, which we believe is unlikely to be feasible  based on current technical and commercial readiness. Our view of a near zero emissions steel trajectory  for the sector informs our strategy and actions, and  reflects the signposts we have observed, particularly  over the past three years. Our view is informed by: 	 – insights from our customers 	 – investment commitments from steelmakers 	 – lead time for permits and construction for  new operations or retrofitting of existing blast  furnace assets 	 – policy settings in the dominant steel producing  regions (particularly China and India) 	 – cost 	 – technology readiness levels 	 – lifespan of existing assets (particularly for regions  with younger blast furnace fleets) We continue to monitor these signposts and  incorporate their signals into our views on a feasible  transition for the steel sector and its likely timeframe.

Our medium-term goal is to  support industry to develop  steel production technology  capable of 30 per cent lower  GHG emissions intensity  relative to conventional blast  furnace steelmaking, with  widespread adoption expected  post-CY2030. For the essential definitions, assumptions and  adjustments for this medium-term goal, as well as  more information on factors that inform it, and more  information on how we define the GHG emissions  intensity of the unmodified blast furnace process route,  refer to Additional information – Definitions and key  details for our GHG emissions targets and goals on  pages 57 to 60 We have revised the language used in our medium- term goal for steelmaking to provide greater clarity  and to reflect the range of steelmaking process  routes that now form part of our strategy. This is due  to technological advances as well as the evolution  of our strategy. We have clarified that ‘technologies  and pathways’ (as used in our original language)  means ‘steel production technology’. We have also  replaced ‘reduction in integrated steelmaking’ with  ‘relative to conventional blast furnace steelmaking’,  which broadens the scope of our medium-term goal to  encompass GHG emissions abatement across more  process routes than just the conventional blast furnace  route. This brings the wording of our medium-term goal  in line with our current activities (as described on this  page) and plans across all four steelmaking process  routes (as described on the previous pages). For the previous language of our medium-term  goal for steelmaking, refer to the Climate change  section in the BHP Annual Report 2023, available  at bhp.com/investors/annual-reporting We are technically and financially contributing  to the development of technologies that can  potentially provide a GHG emissions intensity  reduction of at least 30 per cent.  These technologies may be deployed either in  isolation or in combination. While some of the  technologies we are supporting have a potential  GHG emissions intensity reduction exceeding  30 per cent, none has the commercial readiness  and flexibility needed for widespread adoption today. We currently estimate steelmaking-associated Scope  3 emissions using a methodology that relies on  industry assumptions rather than customer-specific  data. As a result, any GHG emission reductions  achieved by our steelmaking customers because of  our actions are not reflected in our FY2024 reported  Scope 3 emissions inventory. We continue to engage  with our steelmaking customers on ways to enhance  GHG emission data collection and calculation  methodologies with an eventual aim to increase  visibility of the Scope 3 emissions associated with  the processing of our sold products. For more information on our latest progress, refer to  the Climate change section in the latest BHP Annual  Report, available at bhp.com/investors/annual-reporting Our strategy and actions Since publishing our previous CTAP in CY2021,  we have made substantial progress toward  the achievement of our medium-term goal for  steelmaking. Drawing upon our in-house iron and  steelmaking industry expertise, we have developed  our steelmaking decarbonisation project program,  as shown in Figure 2.4. Our ambition is for multiple  technology pathways to mature so that there  are commercially feasible options available to  steelmakers in different regions. More information on the projects we have in our  steelmaking decarbonisation program is available  at bhp.com/climate The primary criteria we use to identify and prioritise  projects for our program are:  	 – Scale: The depth of GHG emission abatement  that could be attained, how quickly it could be  brought to readiness, and how broadly it could  be adopted across the industry 	 – Influence: Our capabilities and the leverage  available to us to have a tangible impact on  development and help enable the technology to  be successfully propagated 	 – Alignment: Relevance to our assets, our  commodities and our customers, and the fit within  the wider technology landscape Steelmaking: Our Scope 3 emissions goal to support capability for GHG emissions intensity reduction 48 partners 20% coverage Distinct industry partners, including 9 steelmakers,  16 research institutes and 11 technology companies  (both start-ups and vendors)10 Partnerships with steelmakers represent  20 per cent of CY2023 reported global steel  production11 i.

Collaborative partnerships and consortiums:  We partner to develop and execute high-impact  tests, trials, pilots and demonstrations that can be  shared with steelmakers and are aligned with our  conceptual steel decarbonisation framework. 2.	 Research: We directly fund, produce and  disseminate industry-leading research, collaborate  with technology developers and support the  establishment of cooperative research centres. 3.	 BHP Ventures: We invest in early-stage  technologies with breakthrough potential and  participate in their development journey. 4.	 Standardisation and transparency: We  advocate for consolidated, robust sustainability  and reporting standards that are fit-for-purpose  and support transparency and traceability  improvements in the value chain. Across all four areas, we regularly monitor the merits  of technologies under development. Collaborative partnerships  and consortiums We collaborate with strategic partners in the steel  sector through bilateral partnerships and through larger  consortiums. Our partners share a common aim to  accelerate GHG emission reductions in steelmaking –  for existing and new steelmaking assets. The scope of  each of our partnership projects is consistent with our  partners’ technology roadmaps. To support the development of near zero emissions  steelmaking technologies, we aim to progress specific  partnerships to more mature development phases  over time, while also considering options for greater  collaboration to increase the scale and impact of  knowledge sharing. Our electric smelting furnace  pilot plans are an example where: 1.	 In FY2022, we successfully tested electric smelting of  our iron ores at laboratory scale (at the University of  Newcastle) and prioritised the technology for scale up. 2.	 In FY2023, we formed a partnership with the  engineering firm, Hatch, to design an electric  smelting furnace pilot plant. The design study  was completed in February 2024. 3.	 In FY2024, we formed a consortium with BlueScope  and Rio Tinto to conduct a joint pre-feasibility study  for a pilot facility. This arose from a shared ambition  to collaborate and advance near zero emissions  steelmaking in Australia. If the study is successful and  further investment is approved by all partners, a pilot  plant could be commissioned as early as CY2027. Research The research we conduct is a foundation for  effective technological development. Our laboratory  experimental programs and published research build the  understanding of fundamental processes to inform the: 	 – scope of larger and more costly industrial trials  	 – optimisation of our customers’ operations to lower  their GHG emissions 	 – design of GHG emission abatement technology We are expanding our established and industry-leading  research programs with further funding and enhancing  our own capabilities to help accelerate the generation  and sharing of knowledge.  During FY2024, we strengthened our funding  commitment to the BHP Centre for Sustainable  Steelmaking Research (formerly the Centre for  Ironmaking Materials Research) at the University  of Newcastle in Australia. Through this and other  research activities, we have been focusing on areas  such as demonstrating the performance of BHP ores  in pellet blends in China, testing hydrogen reduction  and electric smelting of BHP ores, and studying  biomass utilisation in coke-making. BHP Ventures Through our venture capital arm, BHP Ventures,  we search for and invest directly in early-stage and  developing technologies with breakthrough potential.  BHP Ventures’ participation in the technology ecosystem  affords us early visibility of potential breakthroughs and the  opportunity to access and accelerate their development  creating real strategic benefits and financial returns. In the iron and steel sector, BHP Ventures is invested in  transformative electrochemical reduction technologies,  which utilise electrons instead of carbon to reduce iron  oxide ores to metallic iron. Leading startups Boston  Metal and Electra have demonstrated to us their focus  and capability to rapidly advance and adapt their  technologies toward the technical demands of efficient,  scalable iron and steelmaking. These technologies  have now progressed through from the laboratory to  pilot‑scale, with plans for demonstration-scale options. Standardisation and transparency We advocate for the harmonisation of sustainability- related standards, including Scope 3 emission  measurement methodologies in steel value chains. As a member of ResponsibleSteel, we are actively  engaged in the development of broader sustainability  performance standards that promote responsible  production improvements in steel value chains. Co-investment Through our steelmaking decarbonisation program, we  aim to leverage our own funding by significant multiples  by attracting and enabling investment (financial and  in‑kind) from our strategic partners. As shown in  the key metrics on the right, we estimate a potential  co‑investment figure by combining funding by us and  funding and in-kind contributions from our partners for  the period from FY2020 to FY2029, to indicate how our  funding can amplify impact. This figure is not a forecast  and relies on estimation that is limited by available  information and our assumptions. We hope to see  certain projects in our program qualify for government  funding available to accelerate pre-commercial  innovation, which can further amplify impact. Governance  Our strategy, actions and progress to support  steelmaking GHG emission reductions are subject  to existing Board and management governance. Between FY2021 and FY2023, we have included  measures related to steelmaking and the support  of our steelmaking medium-term goal as part of the  determination of remuneration outcomes for our Chief  Executive Officer (CEO) and other ELT members. For more information on our climate-related governance  and remuneration, refer to: 	 – Enabling delivery – Our governance on page 50  	 – Enabling delivery – Our management,  remuneration and organisational capability on  page 51 All investments related to steelmaking GHG emission  reductions that are above a certain financial threshold  are subject to existing capital management processes.

Operational   GHG emissions Introduction Contents Physical risk  and adaptation Equitable change   and transition Climate policy  advocacy Enabling  delivery Additional   information BHP Climate Transition Action Plan 2024 27 Value chain   GHG emissions Portfolio   ===== PAGE 28 ===== Direct suppliers: Our Scope 3 emissions net zero target for direct suppliers’ operational GHG emissions Our long-term target is to  achieve net zero by CY2050 for  the operational GHG emissions  of our direct suppliers. We use FY2020 as the reference year for our  long‑term net zero target. This long-term net zero  target covers the Scopes 1 and 2 emissions (i.e.  operational GHG emissions) of our direct suppliers  in our reported Scope 3 emissions inventory in: 	 – Category 1 ‘Purchased goods and services  (including capital goods)’ 	 – Category 3 ‘Fuel-related and energy-related  activities’ 	 – Category 6 ‘Business travel’ 	 – Category 7 ‘Employee commuting’ We adjust supplier-related value chain GHG  emissions (Scope 3 emissions in the above  categories) for our reference year and subsequent  performance for acquisitions, divestments and  methodology changes. For the essential definitions, assumptions and  adjustments for this long-term net zero target, as well  as more information on factors that inform it including  how we and our value chain may use carbon credits for  offsetting, refer to Additional information – Definitions  and key details for our GHG emissions targets and  goals on pages 57 to 60 For more information on our latest progress, refer to the  Climate change section in the latest BHP Annual Report,  available at bhp.com/investors/annual-reporting Industry pathways Most of our reported Scope 3 emissions inventory  covered by our long-term net zero target for direct  suppliers is in Category 1, as shown in Figure 2.5. Around five per cent of our FY2024 reported Scope  3 emissions inventory for Category 1 (adjusted  for acquisitions, divestments and methodology  changes) was from suppliers providing engineering,  financial, labour, insurance and consulting services.  Operational GHG emissions from these types of  suppliers are typically dominated by electricity use.  We expect that because reducing operational GHG  emissions from electricity is one of the relatively  easier GHG emission abatement pathways to pursue,  these types of suppliers should be more willing and  able to set a net zero operational GHG emissions  target or goal – and potentially for a timeframe well  before CY2050. Around 44 per cent of our FY2024 reported Scope  3 emissions inventory for Category 1 (adjusted for  acquisitions, divestments and methodology changes)  was from types of suppliers whose GHG emissions  are hard-to-abate. These include suppliers of major  mobile and fixed equipment, tyres, air transportation,  chemicals and explosives. Due to their hard-to- abate operational GHG emissions profile, these  suppliers can find it more challenging to set a net  zero operational GHG emissions target or goal.  This situation is further complicated by the relatively  smaller pool of these types of suppliers, requiring  us to work more closely to encourage their GHG  emission reduction efforts. The level of difficulty in abating the remainder of our  FY2024 reported Scope 3 emissions inventory for  Category 1 sits somewhere in between easier-to- abate and hard-to-abate. Our long-term net zero target for direct suppliers  also covers Category 3, 6 and 7. We aim to apply  our strategy to these other categories where  feasible, noting that they have significantly less  GHG emissions than Category 1. Strategy Each year we spend billions of dollars on goods and  services from thousands of suppliers. Our strategy  targets our top 500 suppliers by spend, which  contributed to 78 per cent of our FY2024 total spend  on suppliers. Selective purchasing Our selective purchasing approach sets a commercial  requirement that, over time, a supplier must actively  reduce its operational GHG emissions and/or  maintain a competitive level of GHG emissions  intensity for their product or service. We expect that,  for contracts where we implement this, it will add  commercial value for direct suppliers with robust  plans and demonstrated performance improvement. We have also recently begun to incorporate new GHG  emission reduction criteria into our supplier selection  and tendering processes, including the setting of net  zero targets and goals, the GHG emissions intensity  of the goods and services being provided, or specific  and relevant GHG emission reduction initiatives. We have seen a year-on-year increase in the  proportion of our top 500 suppliers that have a  target or goal aligned with our long-term net zero  target for direct suppliers – from 27 per cent in  FY2022, increasing during FY2023 and up to  78 per cent in FY2024.  We also recognise selective purchasing will be a  progressive strategy as many suppliers are still early  in the journey towards setting and progressing towards  their GHG emission reduction targets and goals. Supportive engagements Our supportive engagements intend to identify,  assess and pursue opportunities to partner with  our direct suppliers to support their GHG emission  reduction initiatives. Measurement and monitoring Measurement and monitoring are essential to  assessing performance against our long-term net  zero target for direct suppliers. Our current calculation  methodology for Scope 3 emissions reporting  depends on industry averages.  We plan to improve the accuracy of our Scope 3  emissions inventory reporting over time, noting there  is currently a wide range of reporting capabilities  among our suppliers. We have started to introduce  contractual requirements for regular GHG emissions  reporting by our suppliers that will help to build their  measurement capability and improve our ability to  report progress against our long-term net zero target  for direct suppliers. We have also made incremental  improvements in the calculation of this part of our  reported Scope 3 emissions inventory, moving from  spend-based emission factors to quantity-based  measurement for certain supplied items.

Our long-term net zero target is  to achieve net zero by CY2050  for the GHG emissions from all  shipping of BHP products. We use FY2020 as the reference year for our  long‑term net zero target. We adjust shipping-related  value chain GHG emissions (Scope 3 emissions,  Category 4 ‘Upstream transportation and distribution’  and Category 9 ‘Downstream transportation and  distribution’ emissions) for our CY2008 baseline year  for our medium-term goal and FY2020 reference year  for our long-term net zero target, and subsequent  performance for acquisitions, divestments and  methodology changes. For the essential definitions, assumptions and adjustments  for this medium-term goal and long-term net zero target,  as well as more information on factors that inform them,  including how we and our value chain may use carbon  credits for offsetting, refer to Additional information –  Definitions and key details for our GHG emissions  targets and goals on pages 57 to 60 We have also committed that, by CY2030, 10 per  cent of our total products shipped to our customers  using our time charter vessels will be using zero  GHG emission fuels. This commitment is subject to  the availability of technology, supply, safety standards  and the establishment of reasonable thresholds for  price premiums. Our medium-term goal for shipping relies on sector‑wide  progress being made by the shipping industry and so we  have framed it as a goal and aligned it with the approach  of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), which  has set levels of ambition for GHG emissions for the  international shipping sector. We selected CY2008 as  our goal’s baseline year to align with the base year for  the IMO’s CY2030 goal and its corresponding reasoning  and strategy. Together, shipping industry participants, including us,  have made significant progress, particularly through  vessel efficiency, to enable GHG emissions intensity  reductions compared to CY2008 for BHP-chartered  shipping of our products. In FY2024, the GHG emissions intensity of  BHP-chartered shipping was 42 per cent below  CY2008 (adjusted for acquisitions, divestments  and methodology changes), as shown in  Figure 2.6, achieved through a combination  of lower GHG emission fuel use and vessel  efficiency improvements.  We believe it will be possible to at least maintain,  if not reduce, GHG emissions intensity in the coming  years although this will be more challenging because  of our expanding business activity and the associated  dependence on the availability of GHG emission  reduction solutions for the shipping industry. We see the potential for emerging pathways to enable  net zero GHG emissions from shipping in the future  based on the industry’s ambition and promising  progress so far in the development and trialling of  low to zero GHG emission fuels. Our long-term net  zero target reflects this ambition and progress. For more information on our latest progress, refer to the  Climate change section in the latest BHP Annual Report,  available at bhp.com/investors/annual-reporting Industry pathways The IMO has set levels of ambition, strategies and  regulations governing the GHG emissions resulting  from the international shipping sector. As a result, we  are seeing the shipping industry beginning to focus on  the next stage of what will be required to decarbonise  to net zero. For more information on the IMO’s levels of ambition  for international shipping, refer to Spotlight: The  International Maritime Organisation and its levels  of ambition for international shipping on this page Figure 2.6: Reported Scope 3 emissions intensity covered by our medium-term goal for shipping Grams of CO2-e per deadweight tonne per nautical mile (gCO2-e/dwt/nm) (adjusted for acquisitions, divestments  and methodology changes) CY2008 FY2024 0 2 4 6 8   CY2008  FY2024 Category 4 (subset)  5.8  3.4 BHP-chartered shipping  of BHP products Figure 2.7: Reported Scope 3 emissions inventory covered by our long-term net zero target for shipping Scope 3 emissions (MtCO2-e) (adjusted for acquisitions, divestments and methodology changes) FY2020 FY2024 0 2 4 6 8   FY2020  FY2024 Category 4 (subset)  4.5  4.3 BHP-chartered shipping  of BHP products Category 9 (subset)  2.1  1.9 Third party-chartered shipping  of BHP products Spotlight The International Maritime Organisation and its levels of ambition for  international shipping The IMO is the United Nations agency responsible  for measures to improve international shipping and  prevent pollution. The IMO has set the following levels  of ambition for the international shipping sector: 	 – reduce CO2 emissions per transport work (i.e.  the transport of a unit of cargo or passengers per  nautical mile), as an average, by at least 40 per  cent compared to CY2008, by CY2030 	 – uptake of zero or near zero GHG emission  technologies, fuels and/or energy sources17 to  represent at least five per cent, striving for 10 per  cent, of the energy used, by CY2030 	 – peak GHG emissions as soon as possible,  and reach net zero GHG emissions by or around  CY2050 The IMO is supporting shipping industry progress  to achieve these ambitions through current and  proposed regulatory measures and a capacity  building and technical assistance program that  includes a range of global projects. For more information on the IMO’s work to cut  GHG emissions from ships, refer to the IMO  website, available at imo.org/en/MediaCentre/ HotTopics/Pages/Cutting-GHG-emissions.aspx Operational   GHG emissions Introduction Contents Physical risk  and adaptation Equitable change   and transition Climate policy  advocacy Enabling  delivery Additional   information BHP Climate Transition Action Plan 2024 29 Value chain   GHG emissions Portfolio   ===== PAGE 30 ===== Shipping: Our Scope 3 emissions goal to support GHG emissions intensity reduction and net zero target  continued Industry pathways continued In the 2020s, the largest GHG emission reduction  opportunities for international shipping are expected  to come from improved operational and technological  energy efficiencies, including voyage optimisation and  energy saving technologies. Lower GHG emission  alternative fuels that have reached a suitable level  of technological readiness are also expected to  play some role in the 2020s. For example, on a  well-to-wake basis, a B24 biodiesel blend has a  potential to reduce GHG emissions by up to 19 per  cent compared to conventional fuel oils.18 However,  widespread use of these fuels is dependent on the  availability and commercial viability of supply in  shipping routes. In the 2030s and beyond, switching to low to zero  GHG emission fuels (e.g. ammonia produced with low  to zero GHG emissions, civil nuclear technologies  for commercial vessel propulsion) is expected to be  a significant lever. The transition to low to zero GHG  emission fuels will require the alignment of many  factors, including technology readiness, appropriate  safety regulations, crew competency, availability  and security of fuel supply and commercially viable  charter and fuel pricing. The alignment of these  factors is likely to be a continuing challenge for the  shipping industry and will require collaboration and  partnerships to solve. Strategy As one of the world’s largest dry bulk charterers,  we play an important role in supporting the maritime  industry to meet or exceed the GHG emission  reduction ambitions set by the IMO. Our shipping medium-term goal, long-term net  zero target and CY2030 commitment are generally  consistent with or exceed the IMO’s CY2030 ambitions  and CY2050 ambition as outlined above, and therefore  we expect to have a similar pathway as the sector. Our  pathway will be accelerated directly by our actions and  indirectly by the impact of our actions and influence in  the industry. Our strategy to support our pathway encompasses  three areas of focus: 1.	 Efficiency improvements: Drive operational  efficiency through vessel and voyage optimisation  and technological energy efficiency improvements.  Operational efficiency measures include consolidating  parcel sizes to use larger and more efficient vessels  and using alternative routes. Technological measures  include chartering vessels with energy saving  technologies such as vessels with premium hull  coatings and wind-assisted propulsion, which we are  trialling with Pan Pacific Copper and Norsepower. 2.	 Lower GHG emission and low to zero GHG  emission alternative fuels: Establish demand and  incentivise industry uptake of lower GHG emission  fuels and low to zero GHG emission fuels, such  as our dual-fuelled LNG chartered vessels and  biodiesel-fuelled voyages, respectively. We are also  working across the ammonia value chain for the  design and build of ammonia fuelled vessels, and  supply of low to zero GHG emissions ammonia. 3.	 Improve carbon accounting: Step change  improvements in the completeness and accuracy  of our carbon accounting through digitisation  and automation in our value chain. This builds  on our partnership with DNV and our use of their  Veracity data platform for validation and reporting  of shipping-related value chain GHG emissions  since FY2022. We estimate our shipping strategy since FY2021  has led to actual or committed co-investment from  BHP and our maritime industry partners totalling  approximately US$400 million19 for the period from  FY2021 to FY2024. The vast majority of the co-investment figure is based  on our assumptions about the cost to the owners of five  new dual-fuelled LNG chartered vessels to meet our  chartering requirements in alignment with our strategy,  together with actual and committed future spend on  the Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation by  BHP, its other five founding partners and the Singapore  Maritime and Port Authority. The retrofit installation of a wind rotor on a BHP-chartered vessel, with our partners Pan Pacific Copper and Norsepower Stewardship International shipping is a hard-to-abate industry.  Demand signals for vessels powered by low to zero  GHG emission fuels are important to establish the  business case for investment and development of new  shipping fuel supply chains.  Considering this, we have launched an expression  of interest for establishing an ammonia value chain  for the maritime industry, which includes the design  and build of ammonia-fuelled vessels and supply of  low to zero GHG emissions ammonia for use as a  shipping fuel. We are now working closely with vessel  owners and fuel providers, as well as shipyards  and regulators, on critical developments to address  challenges for use of ammonia onboard vessels. We intend to start deploying  ammonia-fuelled vessels on our  iron ore shipping routes in the  latter half of this decade, subject to  technical and commercial viability.

Through our differentiated approach to social value,  we will be a trusted partner who creates value for  all stakeholders. We are positioning our portfolio of  commodities and assets to create  value for today and the future. In our portfolio we have copper, nickel, uranium, iron  ore, steelmaking coal and, currently, energy coal.  Among other end uses, copper is used in electric  vehicles, renewable energy technologies and the power  grid, nickel is used in batteries, uranium is a feedstock  for nuclear power, potash is used in fertilisers, which  can assist with food security for a growing population  and more sustainable land use, while iron ore and  steelmaking coal create steel to build new infrastructure. We have made or announced significant changes  to our portfolio since our previous CTAP in CY2021,  including: 	 – the acquisition of OZ Minerals in FY2023  to support the creation of a South Australia  copper basin 	 – sanctioning of our Jansen Stage 2 potash  investment in FY2024 (following approval  of Jansen Stage 1 in FY2022) 	 – the divestment of our Petroleum business in  FY2022 to provide shareholders with further  choice as to their exposure to oil and gas 	 – consolidation of our coal portfolio to concentrate  on higher-quality (grade) coals through the  divestment of our interest in BMC and Cerrejón  in FY2022 and divestment of the Blackwater and  Daunia mines from our BHP Mitsubishi Alliance  (BMA) joint venture in FY2024 	 – agreement with Lundin Mining Corporation to  jointly acquire Filo Corp and form a 50:50 joint  venture to develop an emerging copper district  with world-class potential 	 – planned closure of our Mt Arthur Coal mine  by FY2030 To continue responding to changes in the external  environment and help shape a more resilient strategy,  we carefully monitor key signposts for economic,  societal, political and technological changes that  could materially move our long-term forecast for  demand, supply and price across our commodities  (referred to as ‘our planning range’). We regularly  reassess our views on commodity and asset  attractiveness to this end.  Climate change, climate scenarios and the progress  towards the global net zero transition are among the  key drivers of decision-making that support our risk  appetite and commodity outlook to inform strategy  and corporate planning. Insights from commodity and portfolio reviews are  presented to our ELT and Board. They inform major  portfolio decisions and cascade through our planning  processes, including how we allocate capital and how  we unlock new business opportunities. Our strategy  formation, capital allocation and planning processes  enable deliberate and timely responses to the  climate-related risks (threats and opportunities) our  portfolio is facing. We maintain a strong balance sheet and monitor our  net debt and gearing ratio (the ratio of net debt to  net debt plus net assets). This gives us the flexibility  to respond to changing external factors, including  climate-related risks, as they arise. This, coupled  with our Capital Allocation Framework, enables us  to execute our portfolio positioning decisions for the  benefit of shareholders. For more information on how we form our views on  commodity and asset attractiveness, refer to: 	 – Spotlight: Our planning range   – what it is and how we use it on this page  	 – Spotlight: Our 1.5°C scenario   – what it is and how we use it on the next page For more information about our capital management  processes, refer to Enabling delivery – How we  manage capital on page 53 Our portfolio strategy Our planning range refers to our long-term  forecast for demand, supply and price across  our commodities. It is comprised of three unique  independent planning cases: a ‘most likely’ base  case, and an upside case and downside case  that provide the range’s boundaries. These three cases reflect proprietary forecasts for  the global economy and associated sub-sectors  (i.e. energy, transport, agriculture, steel) and the  resulting market outlook for our core commodities.  We regularly make updates to our planning range,  which is informed by key signposts associated  with the global economy and sub-sectors, as  well as commodity markets. For example, since  we published the BHP Climate Change Report  2020 (containing our previous portfolio analysis),  we have updated our planning range to reflect an  acceleration in policy and progress on climate  change for certain sectors, such as power  and transport.  The modelled outputs of our planning range result in  global CO2 emission pathways implying a projected  global temperature increase of around 2°C by CY2100.  How we use our planning range Our planning range’s demand, supply and  price forecasts for key commodities are used  to inform data inputs into operational modelling  and drive operational planning. Our planning  range is also used for strategy formation and  investment decisions.

Operational   GHG emissions Introduction Contents Physical risk  and adaptation Equitable change   and transition Climate policy  advocacy Enabling  delivery Additional   information Value chain   GHG emissions BHP Climate Transition Action Plan 2024 32 Portfolio   ===== PAGE 33 ===== Scenarios Scenarios highlight different hypothetical pathways for  the future and are not necessarily what we or others  expect to happen. We use scenarios to explore different  themes or end states to stress test business decisions  and portfolio resilience.  Among the scenarios we use are climate scenarios  with lower global average temperature outcomes to  assess climate-related transition risks as they imply  a more rapid transition and therefore greater potential  exposure to transition risk. This is in contrast to physical  climate-related risk, which would be expected to be  more pronounced in higher temperature outcomes. Our  studies of physical climate‑related risks at our operated  assets include scenarios aligned to higher global average  temperature outcomes to assess our potential exposure. For more information on the scenarios we are using  in our physical climate-related risk studies, refer to  Physical risk and adaptation – Our approach to  physical climate-related risk on pages 43 and 44 1.5°C scenarios present a significant acceleration in  efforts to reduce GHG emissions from what we see today,  and therefore are considered among the most effective  scenarios for testing potential impacts of climate-related  transition risks. All 1.5°C scenarios require historically unprecedented  global annual GHG emission reductions across all  sectors, sustained for decades, to stay within a 1.5°C  carbon budget (i.e. the total net amount of GHG emissions  that can be emitted worldwide to limit global average  temperature increase to 1.5°C by CY2100). Nonetheless, we include a 1.5°C scenario as one  aspect of our analysis to inform our understanding  of the potential impacts of an acceleration in global  decarbonisation. We have used an internally developed  1.5°C scenario, benchmarked against external scenarios,  to test the modelled impacts of potential pathways  towards deep decarbonisation and the climate-related  transition risks it would give rise to. For potential pathways to 1.5°C, refer to Additional  information – Our 1.5°C scenario compared to  benchmarks on page 62 There are limitations to scenario analysis, including any  climate-related scenario analysis, and it is difficult to  predict which, if any, of the scenarios might eventuate.  Scenario analysis is not a forecast and is not an indication  of probable outcomes and relies on assumptions that may  or may not prove to be correct or eventuate. Our new 1.5°C scenario In FY2024, we developed a new 1.5°C scenario (which  we refer to in this CTAP as ‘our 1.5°C scenario’) to  reflect recent technology changes and efforts to reduce  GHG emissions globally. We use this CTAP to present  our new 1.5°C scenario for the first time and describe  in detail the pathway it charts, recognising the level  of shareholder and other stakeholder interest in the  resilience of our portfolio should global ambitions be  realised in the future. We believe it is unlikely this pathway will play out,  because of current trends and global efforts to date  to address climate change. Our 1.5°C scenario uses aggressive assumptions  around political, technological and behavioural change,  particularly for hard-to-abate sectors, such as steel. It is  designed to specifically test our current portfolio following  the changes to our portfolio since our previous 1.5°C  scenario was developed in CY2020 and presented in the  BHP Climate Change Report 2020 (which we refer to  in this CTAP as ‘our CY2020 1.5°C scenario’).  The assumptions used in our 1.5°C scenario result in an  almost immediate impact to pricing for some commodities  and carbon markets. Our 1.5°C scenario charts one of many potential  pathways in which future GHG emissions are constrained  within a carbon budget that is aligned to scenarios from  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which  limit global average temperature increase to 1.5°C by  CY2100.21 In our 1.5°C scenario, there is a smaller carbon budget  than in our CY2020 1.5°C scenario to reflect that GHG  emissions have continued to grow over the last four years,  requiring steeper GHG emission reductions to achieve net  zero and to meet a 1.5°C temperature outcome.  We do not see our 1.5°C scenario as being any more  likely than our CY2020 1.5°C scenario.  For the key metrics for our 1.5°C scenario and our  CY2020 1.5°C scenario, together with other third-party  1.5°C scenarios, refer to Additional information – Our  1.5°C scenario compared to benchmarks on page 62 How we use our 1.5°C scenario We use our 1.5°C scenario in two distinct ways. First, we use it to derive commodity price  sensitivities to assess potential impacts on portfolio  value compared with our base case valuations using  our planning range. We calculate the net present value  for all assets and the overall portfolio using commodity  prices and carbon prices from our 1.5°C scenario, and  we then assess the impact of these prices on portfolio  value relative to the base case of our planning range.  All other inputs into this sensitivity test are derived from  the base case of our planning range. The results of this  analysis, as described on the next page, are presented  to the ELT and the Board and provide insights about  resilience against changing commodity and carbon prices  to inform strategic decision-making (such as acquisitions  or divestments to reposition our portfolio). Second, we consider our 1.5°C scenario as a  sensitivity in capital allocation processes, which  compares the demand outlook for our products in  our planning range to that of a rapidly decarbonising  global economy, should that eventuate. We use our  1.5°C scenario commodity and carbon prices as one of  the stress tests to the assessment based on our planning  range, to support investment decisions. Before developing our new 1.5°C scenario, we used our  CY2020 1.5°C scenario in these two processes.  We do not use our 1.5°C scenario: 	 – for operational planning, which is based on our  planning range 	 – to inform how we plan to achieve our GHG  emissions targets and goals 	 – in the studies we are undertaking to assess   physical climate-related risks Approaches to scenario analysis continue to evolve,  with an increasing number of external scenarios  becoming available as reference points for the full range  of commodities we produce. Recognising this, and the  increasing maturity of those external scenarios, in future  years we plan to transition to the use of externally- developed 1.5°C scenarios, where appropriate, to  derive commodity price sensitivities to inform resilience  testing of our portfolio and to consider as a sensitivity  in capital allocation processes. 1.5°C scenarios are  inherently ambitious and currently have a low likelihood of  eventuating, therefore we will be able to draw more useful  insights from a broader range of 1.5°C scenario versions  than only our own. For the key assumptions, carbon budget and carbon  prices used in our 1.5°C scenario, refer to Additional  information – Our 1.5°C scenario assumptions and  the signposts we monitor on page 61 Figure 3.1: Global indicators in our planning range and our 1.5°C scenario20 Spotlight Our 1.5°C scenario – what it is and how we use it GDP growth CO2 emissions intensity CO2 emissions Our planning range Our 1.5°C scenario 100 400 0.1 0.2 500 900 Source: BHP analysis Cumulative economic output  in the 30 years from CY2021 to CY2050 versus the previous 30 years, % Average tonnes of CO2 emissions per US$ of GDP, CY2021–CY2050 Cumulative CO2 emissions  CY2021–CY2050, billion tonnes Additional policy,  technology,  behavioural  changes and  investment  required to  move from our  planning range  to our 1.5°C  scenario’s CO2  emissions  trajectory Operational   GHG emissions Introduction Contents Physical risk  and adaptation Equitable change   and transition Climate policy  advocacy Enabling  delivery Additional   information Value chain   GHG emissions BHP Climate Transition Action Plan 2024 33 Portfolio   ===== PAGE 34 ===== Resilience in our 1.5°C scenario Our portfolio remains resilient  under our 1.5°C scenario.  The net present value of our portfolio under our  1.5°C scenario is approximately the same as  under the current base case of our planning range,  indicating we would be resilient in an accelerated  transition to this 1.5°C outcome, as described in this  section and as shown in Figure 3.2. The impact of our 1.5°C scenario is different on each  of our commodities. The value of our copper, potash  and nickel assets increases relative to our base case,  and offsets the effect to our portfolio from some  downside risk to steelmaking coal. The base case of our planning range now incorporates  a significant acceleration in the pace of renewable  energy deployment and electrification of transport,  which aligns with recent trends (relative to our planning  range when we conducted scenario analysis in  CY2020). The gap between demand for copper and  nickel in our 1.5°C scenario and our base case has  narrowed. This reflects the significant growth we have  seen in these areas over the last four years. In order to test the resilience of our steelmaking  commodities, we have assumed an aggressive  decarbonisation pathway for the steel sector in our  1.5°C scenario, which sets a trajectory for the sector  that we see as unlikely to occur at this pace.  The pathway for the steel sector in our 1.5°C  scenario is far from what we see unfolding today,  and it diverges significantly from the base case  of our planning range.  It is important to note this assessment of our  portfolio’s performance doesn’t account for changes  that could be made or actions that could be taken  if our 1.5°C scenario was to eventuate. This could  include harnessing new opportunities or mitigating  potential financial impacts. Our 1.5°C scenario results in a marginal decrease  in the value of our iron ore assets and some loss of  value in steelmaking coal relative to the base case  of our planning range. Western Australia Nickel’s temporary suspension  has not altered our scenario analysis, which includes  nickel in our portfolio.  The overall portfolio outcome indicated by our  1.5°C scenario is different to our portfolio analysis  presented in the BHP Climate Change Report  2020. There was a larger increase in demand for  copper, nickel, potash and iron ore between our  CY2020 1.5°C scenario and the base case of our  planning range at that time than there is between  our 1.5°C scenario and the current base case of  our planning range.  Signposts for our 1.5°C scenario Based on current trends, it is unlikely our 1.5°C  scenario will play out, however different elements  of the scenario may be more or less likely. For our 1.5°C scenario to eventuate, it would require  every sector of the economy to transform to net  zero or net negative or, in the case of hard-to- abate sectors, to otherwise deeply decarbonise22  by CY2050. In some sectors, such as power and  light duty transport, there are one or more clear  pathways for such a transition, albeit challenging  ones. However, some hard-to-abate sectors, such  as the steel sector, require much larger technological,  political and behavioural shifts from today's settings  to achieve this end state.  We see two important factors influencing likelihood: 1.	 The electrification megatrend is well underway,  which we expect to lead to upside demand for  copper, nickel and uranium in our portfolio. 2.	 The global steel sector, like many hard-to-abate  sectors, is not currently seeing the investment,  policy settings or technological progress needed to  align with a 1.5°C trajectory. Based on these trends,  we believe the modelled outcome for our iron ore  and steelmaking coal portfolio is unlikely to occur. We remain aware of non-linear transition risks that  could impact commodity markets. We regularly  monitor signposts related to decarbonisation and  the energy transition and incorporate them into our  annual planning processes and asset strategies. For more information about the key signposts that we  monitor, refer to Additional information – Our 1.5°C  scenario assumptions and the signposts we monitor  on page 61 Figure 3.2: Our diversified portfolio in our 1.5°C scenario Net present value of our 1.5°C scenario versus our planning range base case i.

Electricity is also vital for producing   low to zero GHG emissions electrolytic hydrogen  and ammonia for use in hard-to-abate sectors. Our 1.5°C scenario sees power demand triple  between CY2021 and CY2050 driven by the  large‑scale trend towards electrification. Demand for the metals needed to build power  generation, storage and infrastructure grows as a result  of this electrification megatrend in our 1.5°C scenario.  The scenario assumes most governments ban  new coal-fired power in the mid‑2020s and force  all unabated fossil power generation offline two  decades later. Extraordinary growth in renewable  energy and efficient storage capacity is required  to displace retiring plants and meet rapidly growing  electricity demand. Large transmission infrastructure  upgrades, growing consumer demand and zero GHG  emission dispatchable power are required for last-mile  decarbonisation of the power grid. Vast electricity  networks must also be enhanced and expanded to  connect dispersed renewable electricity supply and  demand centres.  There is an increase in the recycling of metals,  but the limited availability of scrap metals means  it only slightly dampens demand growth in our  1.5°C scenario. Scrap is particularly limited in  developing economies as there is not a large  pool of existing stock to draw from. Our portfolio of copper, nickel and  uranium is positioned to benefit  from megatrends of population  growth, urbanisation and rising  living standards. In our 1.5°C  scenario, the demand for these  commodities increases even further  due to the scale of electrification  that would be required. Copper  Copper demand grows rapidly due to strong  renewable electricity uptake, the expansion of  electricity networks and electrification of transport,  as shown in Figure 3.5.  Our 1.5°C scenario sees cumulative total copper  consumption (primary and recycled) increase  2.1 times and cumulative copper (primary) demand  increase 1.9 times over the 30 years from CY2021  to CY2050 compared to the 30 years preceding  that period.  This increase in demand for copper flows through  to higher valuations of our copper assets and  growth options. Our 1.5°C scenario sees healthy growth of copper- intensive energy transition technologies. Wind and  solar facilities are more copper-intensive than fossil  power generation. Electric vehicles require about  three times as much copper as internal combustion  engine vehicles. With all countries looking to electrify  simultaneously in our 1.5°C scenario, this leads to an  unprecedented upswing in demand. Scrap availability remains constrained, particularly  in developing countries, even after assuming much  higher recovery and collection rates than today. The current pipeline of copper supply projects  is unlikely to be able to meet the rapidly growing  demand in our 1.5°C scenario. This creates risks for  a supply shortfall in the latter half of the 2020s, which  could lead to prices rising materially above the cost  curve. Our 1.5°C scenario assumes the dynamics in  this period prompt manufacturers to thrift copper use  where feasible (e.g. by using thinner foil in electric  vehicle batteries) and to look for opportunities for  substitution (e.g. replacing copper with aluminium  cables or wires). Nevertheless, substitution and  product redesign have proven to be relatively  slow‑moving trends. We would expect this to create  risks to the overall energy transition during this  period. In time, the ramp up of new projects, higher  scrap collection and recovery rates, and new mining  technologies such as sulphide leaching, would help  to alleviate potential shortfalls.

Our 1.5°C scenario sees cumulative primary nickel  demand increase 3.7 times over the 30 years from  CY2021 to CY2050 compared to the 30 years  preceding that period. In July 2024, we announced our Nickel West  operations and West Musgrave project (Western  Australia Nickel) would be temporarily suspended  from October 2024. Over the longer-term, our 1.5°C  scenario and the base case of our planning range see  nickel demand growing in response to the transition.  However, the decision to temporarily suspend  operations follows oversupply in the global nickel  market. At the time of our announcement, forward  consensus nickel prices over the next half of the  decade had fallen sharply reflecting strong growth of  alternative low-cost nickel supply. Uranium  Nuclear power plays a stronger role in our 1.5°C  scenario than the base case of our planning range,  especially to enable last-mile decarbonisation in  renewables-heavy power grids, although construction  of new conventional and small modular reactors  remains a relatively expensive generation option  with currently comparatively long lead times. Our 1.5°C scenario sees uranium demand  increase 2.3 times over the 30 years from CY2021  to CY2050 compared to the 30 years preceding  that period. Land use for agriculture In our 1.5°C scenario, greater demand for food, fibre,  biofuels and land for afforestation over the years to  CY2050 requires the world to increase crop production  with less agricultural land. The need to improve  agricultural productivity is increased due to the higher  land competition associated with building out a large- scale distributed renewables power network, bioenergy  infrastructure, as well as afforestation of CO2 removals. Potash  The value of potash in our portfolio would increase  in our 1.5°C scenario, with demand modelled to  rise above our planning range. This is driven by  increasing competition for land and the need for  agricultural productivity. Potash is used in fertilisers to enable more efficient  and sustainable farming. The need to further improve  productivity yields in our 1.5°C scenario adds upside  to the outlook in the base case of our planning range.  With the world’s population continuing to grow and  rising concerns around food security and competition  for land use, potash demand could rise significantly. An intensification of farming in our 1.5°C scenario  means the uptake of natural potassium in the soil  is higher and therefore needs to be more regularly  replenished in the form of potash fertiliser.  Our 1.5°C scenario sees potash demand increase  2.3 times over the 30 years from CY2021 to  CY2050 compared to the 30 years preceding  that period. Higher demand is assumed to  translate to higher potash prices  and therefore higher valuation  for our Jansen asset in our  1.5°C scenario. Potash mining and processing also has a more  favourable upstream environmental footprint  among the major fertiliser nutrients. Beyond the  mine gate, potash does not generate some of the  negative environmental impacts (e.g. leaching into  and polluting waterways and the release of GHG  emissions in the application process) that are  associated with excessive application of nitrogen,  and to a lesser extent, phosphorus fertilisers. Potash production at Jansen is  expected to start in late CY2026 Operational   GHG emissions Introduction Contents Physical risk  and adaptation Equitable change   and transition Climate policy  advocacy Enabling  delivery Additional   information Value chain   GHG emissions BHP Climate Transition Action Plan 2024 36 Portfolio   ===== PAGE 37 ===== Steelmaking, iron ore and steelmaking coal in our 1.5°C scenario Steelmaking While overall steel demand grows, iron ore demand is  slightly reduced by the increased use of scrap metal  instead of iron ore.  Our 1.5°C scenario sees cumulative steel demand  increase 1.8 times over the 30 years from CY2021  to CY2050 compared to the 30 years preceding  that period. Our 1.5°C scenario incorporates  policies and technological  advances in the steel sector that  could challenge our steelmaking  commodities, although these  are unlikely to occur at the pace  assumed in our 1.5°C scenario.  In particular, it assumes: 	 – countries and regions increase scrap collection 	 – the steel sector progresses or accelerates a  number of currently challenging, evolving or  early‑stage steel decarbonisation technologies 	 – governments enact top-down policies that  constrain investment in new and re-lined blast  furnaces and the continued operations of existing  steel mills These measures are in addition to carbon pricing  significantly ramping up in all regions, compared to  today’s levels. In our 1.5°C scenario, the maturation of near zero  emissions steelmaking technologies from research  stage to adoption is significantly faster than has been  typically seen in the steel sector. Our 1.5°C scenario  also considers the different age and size of the  existing steelmaking stock in different regions in  determining the potential pace of change. Four major technology options drive the scenario’s  technological GHG emission reductions: 1.	 Blast furnace – basic oxygen furnace route  with carbon capture, utilisation and storage  (CCUS) and powered by low to zero GHG  emissions electricity, which is a modification  of the incumbent technology 2.	 Hydrogen-based, direct reduced iron – electric  arc furnace route, which is mature but less  flexible, with low to zero GHG emissions hydrogen  and low to zero GHG emissions electricity 3.	 Hydrogen-based, direct reduced iron – electric  smelting furnace route, which is an emerging  alternative, with low to zero GHG emissions  hydrogen and renewable electricity 4.	 Electrolysis route powered by low to zero  GHG emissions electricity, which is relatively  early-stage For more information about near zero emissions  steelmaking process routes, refer to Value chain  GHG emissions – Steelmaking: Longer-term  industry pathways on pages 22 and 23 The likelihood and timing of the technology roll‑out  vary by region and are influenced by factors, including: 	 – availability of scrap, lower carbon feedstock  (e.g. low to zero GHG emission hydrogen and  bioenergy) and CO2 emissions storage 	 – age of existing steelmaking facilities 	 – access to a consistent supply of low to zero  GHG emissions electricity 	 – levels of policy support 	 – levels of investment 	 – regions’ dependence on export markets 	 – continued demand for affordable steel Figure 3.6: Global steelmaking GHG emissions outlook and key reduction levers in our 1.5ºC scenario GHG emissions (MtCO2) CY2020 Demand increase Scrap and direct  reduced  iron Low to  zero GHG emission power Better quality raw  materials Process optimisation Blast  furnace modification and CCUS Lower carbon fuel in blast furnace CY2050 4,000 0 Hydrogen direct reduced iron and electrolysis Source: BHP analysis Operational   GHG emissions Introduction Contents Physical risk  and adaptation Equitable change   and transition Climate policy  advocacy Enabling  delivery Additional   information Value chain   GHG emissions BHP Climate Transition Action Plan 2024 37 Portfolio   ===== PAGE 38 ===== Iron ore  Iron ore demand is slightly reduced by the increased  use of scrap metal instead of iron ore in our 1.5°C  scenario. This is partially offset by an increase in  demand due to higher overall steel demand. Our 1.5°C scenario sees cumulative iron ore  demand increase 1.6 times over the 30 years from  CY2021 to CY2050 compared to the 30 years  preceding that period. The roll-out of hydrogen-based direct reduced iron  from the mid-2030s has a negligible impact on total  seaborne iron ore demand as this technology still  requires primary ore. However, higher deployment of  electric arc furnace steelmaking increases demand for  higher quality ores, which reduces the value-in-use of  comparatively lower grades (including Australian iron  ores). This effect is dampened by the assumed uptake  of the electric smelting furnace in Asia, which is a key  market for Australian iron ores today. Our 1.5°C scenario results in a marginal decrease in  the value of our iron ore assets relative to the base  case of our planning range. Demand for our iron ore is resilient in our 1.5°C  scenario, but the spread in prices between different  ore grades widens due to demand for ore suitable  for use in direct reduced iron electric arc furnaces.  Any potential discount for lower grade ores could be  partially offset by premiums for low impurity iron ore  fines and direct charge materials (i.e. materials that  can be fed directly into furnaces without significant  processing, such as iron ore lump that we produce)  for use in blast furnaces, as steel mills look to improve  efficiency and reduce GHG emissions. Significant technical and commercial progress is  required to move towards the technological end state  assumed by our 1.5°C scenario. In CY2023, only 3  to 4 per cent of global seaborne iron ore supply met  the specifications currently accepted in the market  for production of direct reduced iron for electric  arc furnaces.9 Even when using higher-grade ores,  electric arc furnaces are currently unsuitable for  producing the best grades of steel (e.g. auto sheets  for car manufacture). If lower grade ores are used,  today’s processes are inefficient, and generate large  volumes of operational GHG emissions (primarily  from fossil fuel power and the use of fossil carbon  reductants) and larger amounts of mine waste. Steelmaking coal In our 1.5°C scenario, demand for steelmaking coal  peaks in the late CY2020s followed by a modest  decline over the following decade. The blast furnace  equipped with CCUS, which requires steelmaking  coal, remains an important route for steel production  out to CY2050. Our 1.5°C scenario sees cumulative  steelmaking coal demand increase 1.25 times over  the 30 years from CY2021 to CY2050 compared to  the 30 years preceding that period. Higher carbon pricing leads to a growing preference  for higher-quality hard steelmaking coal by remaining  blast furnaces to reduce GHG emissions intensity.  High-strength coke made from higher-quality hard  steelmaking coal is essential to improving energy  efficiency for large-sized blast furnaces in the initial  ‘optimisation’ stage of decarbonisation. It also  enables lower carbon fuels (including hydrogen  injection) to displace lower-quality steelmaking coal  as mills enter the ‘transition’ stage of steeper GHG  emission reductions. Because of these factors,  higher-quality (grade) steelmaking coal, like what we  produce at BMA, will be the most resilient given the  lower associated GHG emissions of steelmaking coal  during use.  The near- to medium-term demand resilience  means that cumulative seaborne steelmaking coal  demand in our 1.5°C scenario is only marginally  lower to the base case of our planning range until  the mid-2030s. However, the assumed rapid roll- out of hydrogen-based direct reduced iron begins  to erode steelmaking coal demand thereafter. By  CY2050, approximately half of all global primary iron  production no longer requires steelmaking coal under  our 1.5°C scenario. While there is some loss of  value in steelmaking coal in our  1.5°C scenario, the outlook for  steelmaking coal in the base case of  our planning range remains robust.  Steelmaking coal continues to be an attractive  commodity for us over the next several decades.  Demand for steelmaking coal could decline in the  future depending on the pathways taken by the  steel sector, however we are not yet seeing signals  of the decarbonisation needed to align with our  1.5°C scenario. For our view on more likely longer-term industry  pathways for steelmaking, as well as our medium-term  goal, strategy and actions to support the reduction of  GHG emissions intensity from steelmaking in our value  chain, refer to: 	 – Value chain GHG emissions – Steelmaking:  Longer-term industry pathways on pages 22  and 23 	 – Value chain GHG emissions – Steelmaking: Our  Scope 3 emissions goal to support capability for  GHG emissions intensity reduction on pages 24  and 25 Figure 3.7: Primary iron and scrap use in steelmaking and primary iron making in our 1.5°C scenario Primary iron and scrap use (million tonnes) 2020 2050 2040 2030 China 100% 50% 0% 0% 0% 0% India and other  emerging Asia European  Union Developed  Asia Electrolysis Direct reduced iron  electric smelting furnace 100% 50% 50% 100% 100% 50% 0 CY2050 CY2040 CY2045 CY2035 CY2030 CY2025 CY2020 CY2015 Scrap i.

Engaging constructively  with governments on climate  policy is an important way we can  help the world decarbonise and  build resilience to the impacts of  climate change. We believe governments around the world should  adopt and progress policies aligned with the goals of  the Paris Agreement to limit the increase in the global  average temperature by CY2100 to well below 2°C  above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit  the increase to 1.5°C. We commit to conducting our  climate policy advocacy consistent with these goals  in our direct advocacy and our indirect advocacy. Our Climate Policy Principles show how we intend  this commitment to be translated into action. They  represent our views on how governments can best  pursue the goals of the Paris Agreement, with a focus  on policymaking principles and policy outcomes. We  use our Climate Policy Principles to inform and guide  our own advocacy (our ‘direct advocacy’) and to seek to  influence the advocacy of the industry associations of  which we are a member (our ‘indirect advocacy’). Our latest Climate Policy Principles are available at   bhp.com/sustainability/climate-change/advocacy-on- climate-policy How we focus our advocacy efforts The global climate policy environment is  continually evolving. We focus our advocacy efforts on areas where we  have the greatest ability to influence positive change. In addition to our Climate Policy Principles, we  typically consider three factors in determining which  climate policy issues to engage on and how to do so: 1.	 The relevance of the issue, taking into account  our previous advocacy efforts, the extent of the  connection between the issue and our business  or industry, and the views of our stakeholders. 2.	 The materiality of the issue, in terms of how it  could contribute to achieving the goals of the Paris  Agreement and its potential implications for our  strategy or operations. 3.	 Our ability to influence policy discussions  on the issue, which will largely be driven by the  degree of relevance of the issue to us, the strength  of our stakeholder relationships, and the extent to  which we share a similar view on the issue with  other relevant companies. Our industry association memberships also play an  important role in our engagement approach. They  provide an avenue for us to help influence industry  views on climate policy issues and allow us to  extend and augment our own advocacy efforts (e.g.  by undertaking policy monitoring, commissioning  research, and engaging with governments on  behalf of members). We believe these associations  perform a number of functions that can lead to better  outcomes on public policy, practice and standards.  We expect these associations to act with integrity, be  constructive in their engagements with governments  and stakeholders and reflect the consensus views  and positions of their members. Our approach to policy advocacy has been informed  by our regular engagement with investors and  other stakeholders. We engage on a wide and varying range of policy  and regulatory issues in line with the principles and  factors outlined here. For more information on these  engagements, refer to Our recent and planned policy  engagements on the next page Governance and oversight The Board approves significant social, community  and sustainability policies, including those related  to climate change and public sustainability goals  and targets. In FY2023, the Board approved our  Climate Policy Principles and Industry Association  Review 2023. Management, primarily our Chief Legal,  Governance and External Affairs Officer, President  Minerals Australia, President Minerals America,  Group Sustainability and Social Value Officer and  Group Corporate Affairs and Communications Officer,  oversees the day-to-day implementation of our  climate policy engagement approach and practices. We maintain four processes to assist stakeholder  visibility and understanding of our climate policy  engagement approach and practices: 1.	 Industry association review (IAR): Every two  years, we undertake a comprehensive review  of the alignment between the advocacy of our  material association memberships and our Climate  Policy Principles. Where we identify misalignment,  which may be material or non-material, we  take steps consistent with our Principles for  Participating in Industry Associations. We  publish the findings and outcomes of our IARs  on our website. In the intervening years, we  have committed to publish an update on the  progress we have made in addressing areas  of misalignment from the prior review and any  relevant findings from our real time monitoring. 2.	 Real time monitoring: We monitor the advocacy  of our material23 association memberships (as  represented on their websites and in the media).  We are committed to disclose on our website if we  identify advocacy that is materially misaligned with  our Climate Policy Principles. 3.	 Membership disclosure: Every year, we disclose  the industry associations of which we are a  member on our website. We categorise all our  memberships in terms of their materiality, broad  purpose and location. For our material association  memberships, we separately provide information  on our base membership fees and the highest  governance role we play in the association. 4.	 Direct advocacy disclosure: We believe  governments have a vital role to play in addressing  climate change. We advocate in support of  proposed climate policies that are aligned with  our Climate Policy Principles, where relevant to  our operations and strategy. Each quarter, we  disclose on our website our direct advocacy on  climate policy, including how this advocacy is  aligned with our Climate Policy Principles.

Risks A changing climate can exacerbate and create  physical climate-related risks, which include: –	 Acute physical climate-related risks:  Extreme climatic events, such as floods, cyclones  and heatwaves, that may be more severe or more  frequent because of a changing climate –	 Chronic physical climate-related risks: The  incremental worsening of conditions, such as the  gradual increase in the number of extreme heat  days over the years, or rising sea levels The mining sector is exposed to both acute and  chronic physical climate-related risks because  of its remote outdoor operations with labour and  physical capital exposed to the elements, and  because of its dependency on global value chains.  The long lives of mining assets mean they could  encounter deteriorating conditions in later decades.  Geographically dispersed sites and value chains  increase the diversity of physical climate-related  impacts we could encounter. Assessment We are undertaking studies to assess our exposure  to physical climate-related risks that draw on science- based climate data (as discussed later on this page). We are working to complete these studies and  continue verification and review of results in FY2025. Operated assets Our approach to evaluating our operational physical  climate-related risks is illustrated in Figure 5.1. For many years, we have managed weather-related  risks through our Risk Framework and business  planning routines, including through the use of historical  data (e.g. allowances for weather-related downtime  in production planning and designing and upgrading  infrastructure to improve weather-related resilience).  To enhance our risk management approach, we are  also drawing on a range of forward-looking scenarios. For more information on how our Risk Framework  supports our approach to physical climate-related  risk, refer to Enabling delivery – How we manage  climate‑related risk (threats and opportunities)  on page 52 Climate modelling We commissioned WTW (one of our insurance  advisors) to develop a climate dataset covering our  operated assets and some key value chain locations,  to develop a more holistic understanding of the  potential parameters of our physical climate-related  risk exposure and how it may change over time. This climate dataset is based on the publicly available  Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) scenarios  used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change, and includes latest generation (Coupled  Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6))  and CMIP5 climate models, applied to our operated  assets. The dataset covers more than 20 climate- related hazards potentially relevant to our global  operations, such as average temperature, extreme  precipitation, and cyclones, which can represent  physical climate-related risks. Alongside this, we  apply local observational climate data and other  sources of climate projections. This approach allows  us to develop a localised view of potential impacts,  including changes in rainfall patterns, average and  maximum temperatures and sea level rise. The climate dataset includes a baseline (CY2001  to CY2020) and projections for three future  time horizons (CY2026 to CY2045, CY2046 to  CY2065, CY2066 to CY2085) for the following  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  SSP‑based GHG emission scenarios:25 	 – Low-case: Estimated average global temperature  increase of 1.8°C by CY2100 (SSP1-2.6) 	 – Mid-case: Estimated average global temperature  increase of 2.7°C by CY2100 (SSP2-4.5) 	 – High-case: Estimated average global temperature  increase of 4.4°C by CY2100 (SSP5-8.5) Our studies of physical climate-related risks are  considering at least two of these scenarios for each  of the potentially relevant climate-related hazard  given the range of uncertainty inherent in climate  modelling and the divergence of scenarios particularly  later in the century. Our planning range (i.e. our long-term view on  demand, supply and price across our commodities)  that we use for operational planning implies a  projected global average temperature increase  of around 2°C by CY2100. Our studies of physical  climate-related risks are using a set of scenarios  that are different to the scenarios we use to test the  resilience of our portfolio against climate-related  transition risks (including our 1.5°C scenario). This  is due to higher temperature outcomes usually being  associated with greater physical climate-related risks.  The scenarios we are considering in our studies of  physical climate-related risks are intended to help  inform a risk-based approach rather than reflect any  view on future climate outcomes.  For more information on our planning range, our 1.5°C  scenario and how we test the resilience of our portfolio,  refer to the Portfolio section on pages 31 to 38 Our approach to physical climate-related risk Figure 5.1: Our approach to physical   climate-related risk Climate data projections: Use of climate  data and projections for different scenarios  and time horizons Safety, productivity and cost impacts:  Applying internal models to assess potential  impacts to safety, cost and productivity Financial impacts and value-at-risk:  Incorporating assessment results into  internal planning models to understand  potential financial impacts and value-at-risk Incorporating into business planning,  risk management and capital allocation:  Embedding consideration of physical  climate-related risk (including value-at-risk)  into business planning, risk management,  and capital allocation, as required Operational site impacts: Engineering  assessments to understand the potential  direct impact of climate-related events on  our sites Operational   GHG emissions Introduction Contents Equitable change   and transition Climate policy  advocacy Enabling  delivery Additional   information Portfolio  Value chain   GHG emissions BHP Climate Transition Action Plan 2024 43 Physical risk  and adaptation  ===== PAGE 44 ===== Our approach to physical climate-related risk continued Assessment continued Risk quantification studies We are undertaking our studies of physical  climate-related risks to progressively identify,  assess and quantify the potential future impacts to  site operations, productivity and estimated cost for  our operated assets. The first stage of our analysis looks at our operated  assets that are currently producing (excluding  NSWEC and former OZ Minerals sites) and our  Jansen potash project. We plan to include currently  producing former OZ Minerals sites and to expand  and adapt our approach to incorporate our legacy  assets and NSWEC in FY2025. Our studies are focusing on the climate scenario with  the most significant potential impacts for the identified  climate hazards (generally the high-case) and the  scenario that most closely aligns to the world’s current  GHG emissions trajectory (the mid-case).26 In certain  circumstances, the low-case has also been assessed  where it has the most significant potential impact (e.g.  for certain extreme rainfall events at our Minerals  Americas operations due to the complexities of  climate modelling). Our studies, will support ongoing  evaluation and maturation of our approach. Table 5.1 shows the physical climate-related risks  that our studies to date indicate could have potential  impact for our operated assets (including via impacts  in our value chain).27 Value chain We are also in the process of conducting value  chain‑specific assessments to deepen our  understanding of how physical climate-related  risks may impact certain existing upstream and  downstream risks. Our value chain assessments are  using climate data to estimate potential downtime due  to key climate-related hazards, both on an average  annual basis and for certain extreme events. We have also undertaken a preliminary assessment of  compound risk, whereby multiple climate hazards could  result in greater impact than the component individual  events, or impacts could accumulate along the value  chain. Potential opportunities to progress include: 	 – Reviewing related business continuity plans to  identify whether there may be over-reliance on  a few alternative suppliers or locations 	 – Exploring how we can encourage greater  resilience in our value chain through engagement  with suppliers and enhancements to procurement  and contractual processes. We are incorporating outputs of our value chain  assessments into routine annual risk evaluations,  as applicable, to determine if additional controls  (including adaptation measures) are needed. Community Adaptation measures that we may implement can  have broader social value benefits but need to be  designed to avoid or minimise maladaptation risks.  We are aiming to build our capability for future  engagement with the communities where we operate  on the topic of climate resilience. We acknowledge the importance of an inclusive and  equitable approach to community adaptation that  seeks to incorporate Indigenous and local knowledge. For a case study of a social investment-funded  community climate adaptation project that prioritised the  incorporation of Indigenous and local knowledge, refer to  Case study: Fostering community climate resilience  in Northern Chile on the next page Table 5.1: Potential physical climate-related risks at our operated assets and in their value chains Climate hazard Potential operational site impacts Potential productivity or operating cost  impacts (for quantification)   Extreme precipitation   and/or flooding Inundation of mines and/or key production  infrastructure  	 – Production disruption 	 – Pumping and repair costs Disruption and/or damage to water supply  infrastructure  	 – Production disruption 	 – Repair costs Exacerbation of tailings storage facility  failure risk 	 – Production disruption 	 – Repair costs   Coastal hazards (including higher sea  levels, cyclones, storm surge and changes  in marine ecosystems) Disruption and/or damage to port and  coastal infrastructure and operations 	 – Production disruption 	 – Repair costs   Extreme temperatures Disruption and/or damage to electrical  infrastructure 	 – Production disruption 	 – Repair and additional maintenance costs   Changes in rainfall, temperature   and/or evaporation patterns Water shortages for operational activities 	 – Production disruption Extreme weather events (including  extreme heat, extreme precipitation   and/or flooding, cyclones) Workforce health and safety incidents 	 – Production disruption 	 – Additional rostering costs Disruption in the supply of critical  production inputs, and access to supply  chain infrastructure 	 – Production disruption 	 – Logistics disruption Operational   GHG emissions Introduction Contents Equitable change   and transition Climate policy  advocacy Enabling  delivery Additional   information Portfolio  Value chain   GHG emissions BHP Climate Transition Action Plan 2024 44 Physical risk  and adaptation  ===== PAGE 45 ===== Our management of physical climate-related risk Table 5.2: Examples of potential adaptation responses that could help to protect value and enable growth Acute physical climate-related risks Chronic physical climate-related risks Protect value: 	 – Risk mitigation and prevention 	 – Maintain productivity Improved safety for our people and communities:  	 – enhanced bushfire risk management Reduced outage time: 	 – increased pumping capacity in pits 	 – higher capacity spillways Supply chain resilience: 	 – ports resilient to sea-level rise 	 – geographically diverse suppliers 	 – larger inventory and stockpiles Mitigate business interruption: 	 – extreme heat resilient rail and runways 	 – increased raw water storage Enable growth:  	 – Continuous improvement 	 – Competitive advantage Enhanced capital planning: 	 – tailored sustaining capital expenditure plans 	 – more resilient mine plans Increased reliability of critical infrastructure: 	 – power grid 	 – rail and roads 	 – ecosystem-based adaptation measures to reduce flood risk with environmental co-benefits Insurance portfolio efficiency: 	 – targeted controls to preserve/optimise cover 	 – deeper coverage for named risks Optimising returns on capital: 	 – adjusted truck scheduling in wet conditions to maximise productivity 	 – climate informed predictive maintenance routines  Talent attraction:  	 – extreme heat resilient accommodation for fly-in fly-out workers Social value:  	 – community initiatives on shared risks Risk controls and potential  adaptation measures We have a range of existing controls in place  for extreme weather-related risks. These controls are designed to prioritise safety  at our operating sites, including weather detection  monitoring, associated weather preparation,  emergency management plans and personnel  trained in emergency response. We are also committed to conforming with the Global  Industry Standard on Tailings Management, including  its climate-related requirements. To guard against potential equipment failure or  inefficiencies we: 	 – aim to operate equipment in accordance with  industry best practice 	 – have robust inspection and maintenance routines 	 – hold inventory of critical spares based on our  risk appetite 	 – undertake contingency planning We also maintain value chain-related contingency  plans, which cover how we would respond to  various scenarios that could impact our access  to key markets, including physical disruptions  to outbound logistics. Completion of our risk quantification studies for our  operated assets will enable us to identify and design,  support or influence adaptation responses additional  to existing controls, where appropriate.  Adaptation measures may include steps designed  to maintain asset integrity, safe and productive  operations and value chain resilience. Through our  studies of climate-related risks we aim to identify  opportunities to continue to protect value and enable  growth, such as those shown in Table 5.2. For more information on how we manage water  and tailings-related risks, including those that are  climate‑related, refer to the Sustainability section of our  website, available at bhp.com/sustainability Key actions As we build further upon our knowledge base and  capability with respect to physical climate-related  risks, our risk quantification studies will evolve and  we will continue to refine how to assess, manage  and monitor these risks. Once the results of the risk quantification studies  for our operated assets are completed, we propose  to use the results to: 	 – inform updates to our risk profile, including  new risk management activities 	 – inform corporate planning 	 – identify areas where we should focus our  assessment of new or strengthened controls  or adaptation responses 	 – assess the financial and social value  of adaptation measures  In the Tarapacá region of Chile we are supporting  community climate adaptation through an initiative  called Kuskalla (“Together” in Quechua), funded  by our voluntary social investment. The project has  been co-developed with local communities, drawing  on local knowledge to identify potential innovative  technological and infrastructure responses that  could support resilience to the impacts of a changing  climate through improved water and energy security.  This includes the following initiatives in the  communities of Mamiña, Iquiuca and Macaya: 	 – Energy: Installation of a solar microgrid (Mamiña)  and solar photovoltaic system (Iquiuca) 	 – Water: Development of a water monitoring  system supporting improved agricultural water  management (Iquiuca and Macaya) 	 – Waste: Waste management pilot producing  bio-fertilisers for local use from organic waste  (Mamiña)  Kuskalla has been implemented by a multidisciplinary  consortium comprising EBP Chile, SER Patrimonio,  The Sustainable Minerals Institute at the University  of Queensland and Power Ledger. Kuskalla is one of three projects selected for social  investment support through Súmate, BHP and  Fundación Chile that sought to identify projects to  help communities in Tarapacá and Antofagasta adapt  to the impacts of a changing climate. The other two  projects include: 	 – Proyecto PURI, which is installing grey water  recycling technology in a kindergarten and social  housing in Antofagasta, in order to irrigate and  improve access to green spaces 	 – AcuyMinAgro, which aims to support fishing  communities in the Antofagasta region, through  the development of aquaculture facilities in marine  management areas All projects prioritise involvement of the local  community in their design and implementation  to support appropriateness and sustainability  of the solutions.

We aim to ensure change and  transitions are equitable and  deliberately considered across the  lifecycle of our business and for the  communities where we operate.  We also acknowledge and consider that, while the  energy transition is essential, the world’s repositioning  must be aligned with international human rights  obligations and the United Nations Sustainable  Development Goals.  Implementation Our approach is grounded in our existing strategies,  policies, standards and frameworks in relation to  our people, the environment, communities and  other stakeholders and partners. As equitable change and transition is intrinsically  founded in human rights standards, our Human  Rights Policy Statement, Indigenous Peoples Policy  Statement, and Inclusion and Diversity Position  Statement help underpin our approach. Our social value framework pillars provide opportunities  to directly support equitable change and transitions,  including for example: 	 – Decarbonisation: Opportunities for post-closure  land use options that support the energy transition;  nature-based mitigation projects; and adaptation  measures with potential for wider benefits to  ecosystems and communities 	 – Healthy environment: Opportunities for  non‑operational land to be under nature‑positive  management practices (i.e. conservation,  restoration or regenerative practices), including  projects in partnership with Indigenous peoples  and local communities 	 – Indigenous partnerships: Enable or support  Indigenous access and cultural practices in  post‑closure land use options 	 – Thriving, empowered communities:  Co‑designed transitions that deliver positive  long-term economic, social and environmental  outcomes beyond closure; targeted analysis of  factors that may influence levels of vulnerability  or adaptive capacity within communities where  we operate to support climate resilience Our Closure and Legacy Management Global  Standard, Community and Indigenous Peoples Global  Standard, Climate Change Global Standard and  Environment Global Standard set out requirements  aligned to our equitable change and transition  principles. These Global Standards aim to achieve  optimised closure outcomes and objectives,  set minimum requirements for engagement and  communication with stakeholders and partners,  implement our commitments to human rights and  Indigenous peoples’ rights, and manage environmental  risks, in addition to meeting compliance obligations. For our approach to and reporting on our social value  framework and the goals, metrics and milestones, refer to  the Sustainability section of the latest BHP Annual Report  available at bhp.com/investors/annual-reporting Our Global Standards describe our mandatory minimum  performance requirements and provide the foundation  to develop and implement management systems at our  operated assets. Public versions of our Global Standards  are available at bhp.com/about/operating-ethically/ corporate-governance Our Human Rights Policy Statement, Indigenous Peoples  Policy Statement, and Inclusion and Diversity Position  Statement are available at bhp.com/local-communities  and bhp.com/careers/inclusion-diversity More information on our community-related insights,  engagements and initiatives is available at bhp.com/ local-communities We have committed to principles that guide our  approach to equitable change and transitions: 	 – Create opportunity for meaningful engagement  and co-designed processes: We will seek  to develop relationships with stakeholders and  partners, including government, local businesses,  community members, suppliers, Indigenous  peoples and workers, that support understanding  of the issues and co-creation of solutions. We will  communicate transparently on the types of changes  the business needs to make and enable active  participation of those most impacted. 	 – Recognise the economic, social and  environmental dimensions of sustainable  development are interrelated: We will aim  to avoid or mitigate adverse environmental  impacts of change and transitions, while pursuing  opportunities to build climate resilience and  environmentally sustainable communities. 	 – Recognise our responsibility to our workforce:  Where a major change in our business is expected  to affect our workforce, we will engage in  meaningful dialogue and support those impacted.  	 – Recognise the impacts associated with  gender, land connectedness and social and  economic vulnerability: We will not assume  all people are affected similarly. We will seek  to understand how impacts may be differently  experienced, including for Indigenous peoples,  and recognise plans and solutions must take  into account the particular strengths of each  community and tackle the unique impacts  they experience. Given change and transitions involve multiple  stakeholders and partners, we seek to be a catalyst  to bring people together and draw on our relationships  to advocate for equitable change and transition in line  with these principles.

We are working to leave a positive  legacy from our mining in the  Hunter Valley as we transition to the  planned closure of Mt Arthur Coal,  an open-cut energy coal mine in  New South Wales, Australia.  This includes working with employees, contractors,  suppliers, the local community and other relevant  stakeholders and partners to achieve sustainable  landforms and land uses to contribute to supporting  the needs of the Hunter region. Pathway to 2030 In FY2022, we decided to retain Mt Arthur Coal, seek  the relevant approvals to continue mining beyond the  current consent that expires at the end of FY2026 and  proceed with a managed process to cease mining by  the end of FY2030, which we refer to as our ‘Pathway  to 2030’. This decision followed the review of our  lower grade steelmaking and energy coal assets that  resulted in divestment of our interests in Cerrejón and  BHP Mitsui Coal in FY2022 and a trade sale process  for NSWEC that did not result in a viable offer. An important part of our Pathway to 2030 is to seek  the relevant approvals to continue mining past expiry  of the existing consent at the end of FY2026. This  timeframe is intended to provide the opportunity  to consult, prepare, plan and make considered  decisions for the long-term future of our people and  surrounding communities. We have applied to the  New South Wales Department of Planning, Housing  and Infrastructure for the extension. We expect  additional maintenance capital spend of less than  US$100 million will be required for the proposed life  extension of Mt Arthur Coal from FY2027 through to  the end of FY2030. More information on our Pathway to 2030 and beyond,  including our plan for mining at Mt Arthur Coal beyond  FY2026 is available at bhp.com/pathway-2030 Workforce Our ‘Tomorrow, together’ program aims to support  our employees to identify and progress towards a  career pathway that will be most appropriate for their  circumstances post-closure of Mt Arthur Coal. The  program is about understanding each individual BHP  employee’s future aspirations beyond FY2030 and how  we can help support them to achieve these aspirations. Key themes identified from these discussions have  led us to offer free financial planning advice for all  employees. Career advice sessions will also be  available to enable individual career pathway plans  for those who may decide to leave the mining industry  as part of the planned closure.  We are also engaging in contractor and supplier  forums and we are working on a plan to help support  a transition for contractors and suppliers who depend  on Mt Arthur Coal. We recognise individual needs  are unique for each contractor and supplier and  their workforces. In FY2024, as part of our engagement with other  regions undertaking a similar transition away  from energy coal mining, our Mt Arthur Coal team  members undertook a site visit to Collie in Western  Australia. This provided an understanding of the State  Government’s Collie Just Transition Plan and how it is  being implemented, which will see Collie’s coal-fired  power stations retired by CY2030. Community We recognise the importance of community  self‑determination as we prepare to cease mining  at Mt Arthur Coal. BHP is listening to community  members and other external stakeholders and   partners to better understand their values and  aspirations for the region. Through our assessment of closure legacy  expectations and a research project with the  University of Newcastle, we have undertaken  stakeholder interviews, community surveys and  workshops to explore key issues and opportunities  and understand how we can work in partnership  to enable the continuation of a prosperous and  diverse Upper Hunter region. It is anticipated these  initiatives will help inform future plans and community  investment programs. Future land use options Our rehabilitation strategy for Mt Arthur Coal is  being progressively implemented as part of the  current mining phase and will continue post-closure.  Rehabilitation aims to improve the native ecosystem  and enhance the native woodland habitat. Our  strategy is supported by rehabilitation completion  criteria and performance indicators, overseen by  the New South Wales State Government. We are engaging with multiple stakeholders and  partners to seek ideas and feedback on the transition  and closure of the Mt Arthur Coal mine. We have  completed a land capability assessment for the site  and we continue to explore opportunities to facilitate  the ongoing use of the land at Mt Arthur Coal to  enable alternative re-uses, such as recreation,  large‑scale renewable electricity generation, and  land uses with high economic diversity and value.  There are a number of post-closure land use options  that have the potential to generate social, cultural,  environmental and economic benefit locally and  regionally, as well as creating greater economic  diversification for the Hunter Valley. We will continue to work closely with key  stakeholders and partners, including the community  and government agencies, to determine the most  appropriate land use options in closure. Most  alternative land uses will require planning and  approval by both BHP and government agencies. Key actions 	 – Obtain a decision on government approval of our  mining extension.

Board reporting The Board met 16 times during FY2024 with  climate‑related issues regularly on the agenda for  Board meetings, including reviewing and approving  public sustainability disclosures, reviewing progress  against our climate change targets and goals,  assessing corporate strategy and portfolio options,  approving certain investment requests, risk and policy  setting. The Board is informed through board papers,  progress updates from management, material risks  reports, presentations from external subject matters  experts and reports from the chair of each Committee  following Committee meetings. Climate-related  topics are also incorporated into Director induction  programs, ongoing training, external speakers and  site visits to assist the directors in their oversight. The Board will monitor and oversee progress against  our GHG emissions targets and goals and the key  commitments detailed in this CTAP. The Sustainability  Committee, with assistance from the management- level Sustainability and ESG Steering Committee,  will oversee BHP’s implementation and performance  against this CTAP and climate-related matters. For more information on the Sustainability and ESG  Steering Committee, refer to Our management,  remuneration and organisational capability on  the next page Board and Committees Climate change is a Board-level issue, including in  relation to our strategic approach, risk management,  public disclosures, annual budgets and business plans. The Board is responsible for the approval and  oversight of BHP’s climate-related risks (threats and  opportunities) and BHP’s climate change strategy.  The Board has four standing Committees to assist in  the discharge of its responsibilities, including in relation  to climate-related matters. Each of these Committees reports to the Board on  the key issues discussed, including, where applicable,  climate-related issues: 	 – The Board approves BHP’s significant social,  community and sustainability policies (upon  recommendation from the Nomination and  Governance Committee), including those related  to climate change and climate transition planning,  public sustainability-related goals and targets  (including for GHG emission reductions). The Board  reviewed and approved BHP’s climate-related  targets and goals, and approved this CTAP. 	 – The Nomination and Governance Committee  assists the Board with reviewing BHP’s significant  social, community and sustainability-related  policies (including those related to climate change  and climate transition planning), and reviews and  makes recommendations to the Board on BHP’s  public sustainability-related targets and goals.  The Nomination and Governance Committee  reviewed and recommended this CTAP to the  Board for approval. The Committee also assists  with assessing the capability of the Board to  deliver on BHP’s strategy by regularly assessing  the Board skills matrix and the collective skills,  experience and knowledge of the Board to be able  to discharge its duties, including on the strategic  direction of BHP. 	 – The Sustainability Committee assists the  Board with overseeing climate performance  including monitoring implementation of BHP’s  climate strategy, policies and processes, and  performance against public targets and goals,  and reviews and reports to the Board on the  Group’s material climate risks. The Committee  also makes recommendations to the People  and Remuneration Committee on both setting  climate performance measures and evaluating  performance against those measures for the CEO  and other members of the ELT. 	 – The Risk and Audit Committee oversees and  assists the Board in reviewing the emerging and  principal risks facing BHP. This includes business  risk, financial reporting risk and climate risk.  The Committee also reviews and recommends  to the Board for approval public financial  disclosures, including financial information  related to sustainability matters and financial  information contained in climate change reports  and climate transition action plans. The Risk and  Audit Committee reviewed the climate-related  financial disclosures appearing in this CTAP  and the Financial Statements in the BHP Annual  Report 2024, both prior to the Board’s approval. 	 – The People and Remuneration Committee assists  the Board with reviewing performance measures  and performance outcomes for the CEO and  approves performance measures and assesses  and determines performance outcomes against  those performance measures for the ELT. In doing  so, the Committee considers recommendations from  the Sustainability Committee in relation to climate  performance measures. The responsibilities of the BHP Board and Board  Committees are reflected in their respective charters  available at bhp.com/about/operating-ethically/ corporate-governance Board skills The Board maintains a skills matrix that identifies  the skills and experience the Board needs for the  next period of BHP’s development, considering  BHP’s circumstances and the changing external  environment. Skills in the current matrix related  to the Board’s capability to assess and monitor  climate-related risk (threats and opportunities) and  climate transition strategies include Sustainability  and decarbonisation transition, Strategy, Operating  risk, Commodity value chain and customers, Social  value, Community and stakeholder engagement,  Technology and Capital allocation and cost efficiency. The Board collectively possesses the skills  and experience set out in the skills matrix. The  Directors also participate in an ongoing training  and development program and receive updates on  climate-related issues and reporting requirements,  including from external experts on evolving  climate‑related developments where required.

The membership  of the Sustainability and ESG Steering Committee  includes the Chief Legal, Governance and External  Affairs Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief  Operating Officer, Chief Commercial Officer,  President Minerals Australia and President  Minerals Americas from the ELT, and sustainability  and ESG leaders within BHP, including the Group  Sustainability and Social Value Officer. 	 – The Group Sustainability and Social Value  Officer, Dr Fiona Wild, is responsible for driving  BHP’s climate change strategy, including climate  considerations in broader company strategy and  portfolio evaluation, operational and value chain  decarbonisation, physical climate-related risk  and adaptation, equitable change and transition,  stakeholder engagement and disclosure.  The ELT receives progress and performance reports  on operational GHG emissions, operational and value  chain GHG emission reduction activities, adaptation  strategy-related activities and climate-related risks  from our asset and functions teams. Management is supported by BHP’s asset and  function teams: 	 – The Group Sustainability and Social Value team  is responsible for collaborating with BHP’s asset  and function teams, external partners and industry  to develop practical climate change solutions. The  team regularly prepares information and advice for  management-level and Board-level stakeholders  and committees on climate-related strategy, risks  (threats and opportunities) and performance  against climate-related metrics. The team also uses  key risk indicators to help monitor performance  against our appetite for climate-related risks and  monitors relevant signposts for emerging risks.  	 – The Risk team is responsible for providing  expertise, support, monitoring and challenge on  risk-related matters and our internal audit team  is responsible for providing independent and  objective assurance over the control environment  (governance, risk management and internal controls)  to the Board and ELT. Additional assurance may  also be provided by external providers, such as  our external auditor, in relevant circumstances.  	 – The asset and function teams are responsible  for undertaking climate-related activities. Management skills Our CEO and other members of the ELT attend  meetings and review papers and materials intended  to provide them with new and additional knowledge,  skills and competencies required to oversee our  climate change strategy. Our CEO and other members of the ELT also make  use of regular, structured forums that provide detailed  information on climate-related topics, including: 	 – The Forum on Corporate Responsibility:  A forum we host that meets half-yearly and  convenes external leaders in sustainability-related  fields to discuss views on current and emerging  trends and risks, including climate change. 	 – The Quarterly Business Review: An internal  forum that meets quarterly to review and consider  updates on strategic direction and tactical  progress on operational GHG emission reduction. 	 – Commodity and Market Outlook Review: An  internal forum that hosts discussions at least twice  a year about new events and challenges affecting  our forecasting of commodity demand, the global  economy, financial markets and the overarching  potential impact of climate change and the net  zero transition globally. Remuneration CEO and ELT remuneration Our executive remuneration framework is aligned  with key drivers of our business strategy, to help  deliver the short-, medium- and long-term success  of BHP and create value for shareholders and other  stakeholders and partners. Strategic drivers are  reflected in incentive plan performance measures  linking executive incentives to actual performance. The amount of remuneration actually received by  executives each year depends on the achievement  of business and individual performance measures  that generate sustained shareholder value. Before  deciding on the final incentive outcomes for  the CEO and other executives, the People and  Remuneration Committee considers the achievement  of pre‑determined performance measures. In FY2020, we strengthened the link between  executive remuneration and the delivery of our climate  change strategy, coinciding with the implementation  of a revised remuneration framework, comprising  fixed remuneration, the Cash and Deferred Plan  (CDP) and Long Term Incentive Plan. The CDP is an annual cash and equity award that  encourages and focuses executives’ efforts for the  relevant financial year on the delivery of our strategic  priorities, balancing financial and non-financial  performance, to deliver short-, medium- and long-term  success aligned to our purpose. For FY2025, the CDP  scorecard includes performance measures related  to safety and sustainability (25 per cent weighting),  financial (50 per cent weighting) and group and personal  objectives (25 per cent weighting). CDP awards are  provided as cash and deferred shares vesting in  two and five years, respectively. Vesting of five-year  deferred shares under the CDP is underpinned by a  holistic review of performance at the end of the five- year vesting period, including a review of safety and  sustainability performance over the five-year period. The safety and sustainability-related targets include  significant health, safety, environment and community  (HSEC) events, climate change and Indigenous  partnerships. Climate change-related scorecard  targets will represent 10 per cent weighting in the  CDP scorecard for FY2025 and have been in place  each year since FY2020. These performance  measures seek to motivate executives to achieve and  exceed internal targets, which support delivery of our  GHG emissions targets and goals in this CTAP. A CDP award is determined based on the assessment  of each scorecard performance measure by the People  and Remuneration Committee and the Board, with  guidance provided by other relevant Board Committees,  including the Sustainability Committee with respect to  safety and sustainability targets and outcomes.  The latest information about our performance against  our CDP climate change measures is available in the  Remuneration Report in the latest BHP Annual Report,  available at bhp.com/investors/annual-reporting For FY2025, our CDP climate-related performance  measures include:  	 – reduction in operational GHG emissions (Scopes  1 and 2 emissions from our operated assets) 	 – deliver the FY2025 actions in the approved  climate adaptation work program 	 – inclusion of capital for mitigating/preventative  controls for physical climate-related risks in  future plans Climate change measures, including reduction in  operational GHG emissions, play a meaningful role in  the determination of remuneration outcomes for our  CEO and other ELT members. Employee remuneration We have a short-term incentive plan that applies  to the majority of employees below the ELT level  (excluding employees under industrial or enterprise  agreements who have separate short-term incentive  and bonus arrangements). A company scorecard  used for this short-term incentive plan is similar to the  CDP scorecard and includes climate change-related  performance measures, including targets related to  the reduction in our operational GHG emissions. Employees who have specific climate‑related  responsibilities also have individual performance  goals related to climate-related progress. The  achievement of these goals is used to determine  entitlement to short-term incentive outcomes. Organisational capability We conduct periodic capability reviews across our  business for roles with climate-related accountabilities  to help us design and deliver training to support  capability improvement. Our training has completion  required and monitored for certain roles.

This CTAP has been developed to reflect the  identification and management of climate-related  risks (threats and opportunities) that we face. We take an enterprise approach to risk management  and operate to one Risk Framework for all risks  including climate-related risks (threats and  opportunities). Our Risk Framework requires  the identification and management of risks to  be embedded in business activities and provides  requirements and guidance on the tools and  processes to manage current and emerging risks.  Our mandatory minimum performance requirements  for risk management and the Climate Change  Global Standard set the minimum requirements to  manage climate-related risks and apply across our  operated assets, functions, and regional teams, and  our decision-making processes for procurement,  sales and marketing.  We interpret external signals associated with  transition risk and physical climate-related risk,  including material changes in climate-related  political dynamics, policy and regulation, including  legal developments, carbon pricing and markets,  stakeholder sentiments, and industry developments.  We also interpret external events and trends  associated with transition and physical climate- related risk which may include, scientific, policy, legal,  reputation and market developments. This supports  the identification and management of climate-related  risks at BHP.  Operational GHG emissions risk We conduct annual long-term strategic planning  for our operated assets, which includes detailed  operational GHG emissions reduction planning. As  part of this, we assess projects using criteria such  as technology readiness, operational risk and overall  risk associated with likelihood of progression. We  also consider project success at the planned scale  of implementation required to meet our medium-term  target and achieve our long-term net zero goal.  Impacts to our operational GHG emissions are  included in our investment risk management framework  for minor projects, major capital projects, transactions,  and greenfield exploration projects. Project teams are  required to identify a potential investment’s operational  GHG emissions profile and the availability of GHG  emission abatement solutions to assess the impact on  our operational GHG emissions medium-term target  and long-term net zero goal. We then use this planning process to prioritise and  accelerate the delivery of our operational GHG  emission reduction strategy where possible. This  typically includes a focus on technologies and GHG  emission sources that are not as well progressed  or that do not have as high a level of technology or  commercial readiness. We continue to study and  identify options to accelerate our strategy, including  by working with our suppliers, others in the industry  and our innovation and BHP Ventures teams to  source new ideas or gain access to new technologies.

As shown in Figure 7.2, our framework provides  an overarching hierarchy for the potential uses of  surplus operating cash and is used to guide short-,  medium- and long-term business decision-making  and planning processes. Capital is prioritised from  a portfolio perspective consistent with our long-term  strategy, to enable maximum value and returns. Operational GHG emissions Operational GHG emission reduction projects are  considered as part of the maintenance capital  category within this framework, along with other  forms of risk reduction, asset integrity, compliance,  and major, minor and sustaining projects intended  to preserve the ability to generate value at our  operated assets. This enables consideration of a  risk assessment across qualitative and quantitative  criteria relevant to each capital allocation decision.  However, an important principle within the framework  prioritises operational GHG emission reduction  projects where they are critical in supporting the  achievement of our operational GHG emissions  medium-term target and long-term net zero goal. Individual operational GHG emission reduction projects  must justify the investment based on abatement  efficiency, technology readiness, maturity, operational  impact and relative economics compared with other  maintenance capital projects in the portfolio.  Operational GHG emission reduction projects are  incorporated into our corporate planning processes  that includes review of our mine plans, which are  critical to creating alignment across BHP. These  processes guide the development of plans, targets  and budgets to help us decide where to deploy our  capital and resources. We have a number of Investment Review Committees  that assist our decision-makers with review of  proposed investments. The appropriate Investment  Review Committee, based on investment size and  any complexity elements, provides endorsement  for whether to progress operational GHG emission  reduction projects based on qualitative and  quantitative measures. Our Quarterly Business Review forum also reviews  and updates strategic direction and tactical progress  on operational GHG emission reduction. For more information on the Quarterly Business Review  forum, refer to Our management, remuneration and  organisational capability on page 51, earlier in this section Execution is monitored through periodic reporting  to senior leaders and project sponsors on key  performance indicators. Value chain GHG emissions Value chain GHG emission reduction projects are  usually considered and prioritised using similar  criteria to compliance and risk reduction projects. For steelmaking-related projects (including our  steelmaking customer partnerships), our Investment  Review Committees operate in the same manner  as described for operational GHG emission  reduction projects. Carbon pricing  We embed carbon prices, as shown in Table 7.2, within  our planning range and planning cases that inform  asset planning, asset valuations and operational  decision-making, including the prioritisation of  operational GHG emission reduction projects.  Our carbon price forecasts are also used along with  other qualitative and quantitative metrics in assessing  investments and informing our portfolio strategy and  investment decisions. Our internal carbon price for a region is based  on existing and forecast carbon taxes or GHG  emission allowance prices known as a ‘compliance  carbon price’. In regions where there is currently  no regulated carbon pricing method in place, we  assume the implementation of these measures  taking into consideration national or regional  circumstances, including current and announced  government climate-related policies, targets and  goals (including net zero) and societal factors,  such as public acceptance and demographics.  As climate ambition differs by country or region and  will likely evolve over time, we use regional carbon  price trajectories from today to FY2050. The carbon price forecast for our operational  countries and customer countries aligns with our  planning range framing and associated regional  net zero ambitions.

However, if there is  an unanticipated shortfall in our pathway to our  medium‑term target, we may need to use voluntary  carbon credits that meet our integrity standards to  close the performance gap. Our approach to the use of carbon credits for  offsetting for our other GHG emissions targets and  goals varies and continues to evolve. For more information on: 	 – how we may use carbon credits to support the  achievement of our operational GHG emissions target  and goal 	 – how we and our value chain may use carbon credits  to support the achievement of our value chain GHG  emissions targets and goals refer to Additional information – Definitions and key  details for our GHG emissions targets and goals on  pages 57 to 60 Types of carbon credits Where commercially feasible, we prioritise carbon  credits from nature-based projects as they may  unlock the potential to bring wider benefits to  ecosystems and communities, in conservation  and restoration of carbon sequestration. In the future, we may consider the sourcing and  use of natural (e.g. forest-related) and technological  (e.g. direct air capture) carbon credits if there is a  satisfactory increase in technology and commercial  readiness, and they are supported by robust carbon  crediting methodologies. Voluntary carbon credits We undertake risk-based screening and/or due  diligence to test that carbon credits sourced by  BHP meet our integrity standards. Our integrity standards are designed to align to global  best practice for high-integrity carbon credits (such  as the International Carbon Reduction and Offsetting  Alliance’s accreditation Code of Best Practice and  its list of endorsed carbon crediting standards,  and the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon  Market’s Core Carbon Principles). We will review  and update alignment over time as best practices  on carbon credit integrity evolve. Carbon credits we intend to source go through a  review process that includes technical, governance,  legal and stakeholder aspects, carried out by internal  and external subject matter experts.  We apply the following integrity standards to voluntary  carbon credits that we source: 	 – Registered under an internationally  recognised standard: Independent verification  and issuance of voluntary carbon credits and/or  satisfaction of national standards for regulatory  carbon credits. Carbon credits we source are  predominantly issued under Verra’s and Gold  Standard’s respective standards. 	 – Adheres to a robust GHG emissions reduction  accounting methodology: Assurance of the  volume of atmospheric carbon that is reduced   by a project. 	 – Demonstrates that the GHG emission  reductions are additional: GHG emissions  would not have been reduced in the absence of  a carbon market. 	 – Has a high likelihood of permanence: GHG  emissions reduction is ongoing and not reversed  (e.g. for forestry projects, the trees are not cut  down or destroyed by a natural disaster). 	 – Provides robust mitigation against leakage:  Does not increase GHG emissions elsewhere  (e.g. for forestry projects, another forest area is  not destroyed). 	 – Demonstrates high environmental and social  integrity: Does not cause broader social or  environmental harm (e.g. for forestry projects, no  community displacement occurs) and appropriate  engagement is undertaken with local communities  and Indigenous groups, and the findings  incorporated into project design (e.g. equitable  benefit sharing is defined). 	 – Restricts early vintage years: Not retiring  credits with a vintage greater than five years  to avoid concerns regarding unsophisticated  methodologies, non-additionality and inadequate  benefit sharing. In some cases, the integrity standards of carbon  credits may be set and monitored by certain  government agencies (e.g. Australian Carbon Credit  Units (ACCUs)). Where the principles underpinning  their integrity standards are broadly aligned to our  own, we do not apply our review process. Regulatory carbon credits We are subject to the Australian Government’s  Safeguard Mechanism, under which facilities  we operate are required to maintain their Scope  1 emissions at or below progressively declining  legislated baselines (e.g. by surrendering carbon  credits from eligible sources). ACCUs can be used  to comply with the Safeguard Mechanism. The  principles underpinning the ACCU Scheme align to  our own integrity standards for the carbon credits  we source. The Australian Clean Energy Regulator  is responsible for approving and issuing ACCUs to  projects according to those principles. We do not apply  a vintage restriction to purchases of ACCUs because  the additionality of projects is rigorously assessed. We anticipate needing to source eligible carbon  credits to comply with the Safeguard Mechanism  given its applicability to Scope 1 emissions only.  Although we prioritise structural GHG emissions  abatement for our operational GHG emissions, many  of the technologies and solutions we need to abate  Scope 1 emissions (e.g. electric mining equipment/ vehicles and fugitive methane emissions prevention  and mitigation) are not yet ready to be deployed.  Accordingly, our need for eligible carbon credits may  grow over time to support compliance. While the Safeguard Mechanism in Australia  is currently the primary regulatory driver of our  requirement for regulatory carbon credits, we are  subject to other regulations that may require mandatory  carbon credit surrender in the future. We will continue to evaluate our approach as the  regulatory environment evolves, including in other  regions where we operate.

The disclosure framework  aims to support companies to  develop high-quality, consistent  and comparable transition  plan disclosures. The disclosure framework has three guiding principles: 1.	 Ambition 2.	 Action 3.	 Accountability As shown in Table 8.1, we have mapped where  our disclosures in this CTAP seek to align with the  disclosure framework. The Transition Plan Taskforce Disclosure  Framework is available at transitiontaskforce.net We acknowledge there are areas of the disclosure  framework that this CTAP does not address or  substantially align with, the most significant of which are: 	 – Targets associated with governance  engagement, business activity, operational  matters and financial metrics: The disclosure  framework requires publicly disclosed targets in  each of these areas. We actively monitor a range  of climate-related metrics in these areas and  adjust our strategy and actions where necessary. 	 – Absolute gross Scope 3 emissions reduction  target: We are not currently in a position to commit  to a new absolute gross target for any part of our  value chain GHG emissions, given achievement of  our value chain GHG emissions long-term net zero  goal is uncertain, particularly given the challenges of  a net zero pathway for our customers in steelmaking,  and we cannot ensure the outcome alone. 	 – Impacts and dependencies that have  been identified with respect to nature: We  acknowledge the interdependencies between  climate and nature. Although not contained within  this CTAP, we do disclose information on our  strategies to manage land, water and biodiversity  in the BHP Annual Report and on our website.

We will not use regulatory carbon credits (i.e. those used for compliance under regulatory schemes, such as the Australia’s  Safeguard Mechanism) to meet our target. In our projected pathway, we have not planned to use voluntary carbon credits to meet our  medium-term target, but if there is an unanticipated shortfall in our pathway, we may use voluntary carbon credits that meet our integrity  standards to close the performance gap 	 – Offsetting: Planned, to close the performance gap beyond our current estimate of up to around an 85 per cent gross operational GHG  emissions reduction against FY2020 levels by CY2050 without the use of carbon credits for offsetting 	 – Measurement approach: Scope 1 emissions are calculated using emission factors and methodologies required under mandatory local regulatory programs where BHP operates, including the National Greenhouse Energy and Reporting (NGER) scheme for Australian operations,  Green Tax legislation (referencing Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emission factors) for Chilean operations and Canadian Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (referencing IPCC emission factors) for our Jansen potash project. In the absence of mandatory local  regulatory programs, the Australian NGER scheme emission factors and methodology is used. Scope 2 emissions are calculated using the market-based method using electricity emission factors sourced directly from the supplier where available, as evidenced by Renewable Energy  Certificates and/or supplier-provided documentation. Where supplier-specific emission factors are not available, a default location-based emission factor for electricity, as published in local regulations or industry frameworks, is used 	 – Key adjustments made to our baseline year, reference year and subsequent data: Baseline year (for our target) and reference year (for our goal) and performance data have been adjusted for divestment of our interest in BMC (completed on 3 May 2022), divestment of our  Petroleum business (merger with Woodside completed on 1 June 2022), BMA’s divestment of the Blackwater and Daunia mines (completed on 2 April 2024), our acquisition of OZ Minerals (completed on 2 May 2023) and for methodology changes (use of IPCC Assessment Report 5  (AR5) Global Warming Potentials and the transition to a facility-specific GHG emission calculation methodology for fugitives at Caval Ridge and Saraji South) 	 – Performance, adjusted: FY2020: 13.6 MtCO2-e | FY2021: 13.8 MtCO2-e | FY2022: 10.2 MtCO2-e | FY2023: 9.1 MtCO2-e | FY2024: 9.2 MtCO2-e 	 – Target/goal setting method: Our target is measured on a cumulative GHG emission basis against an overall carbon budget. The target  percentage reduction was established in FY2020 by applying the same rate of reduction to BHP’s GHG emissions as the rate at which the world’s  GHG emissions would have to contract in order to meet the Paris Agreement goal to hold global average temperature increase to well-below 2°C  above pre-industrial levels (known as the ‘absolute contraction method’) 	 – Target/goal derived using a sectoral decarbonisation approach: No, our target was derived using the absolute contraction method  specified earlier. At the time of setting the target, there were no mining sector-specific pathways for jurisdictions where we operate 	 – Target/goal setting method: Our goal was developed with the ambition to achieve net zero for our operational GHG emissions by  CY2050. Our progress against this goal will be measured on an absolute basis 	 – Target/goal derived using a sectoral decarbonisation approach: No, however our goal is consistent with the global net zero ambition 	 – Processes for reviewing the setting of our target/goal: The Board approves BHP’s significant social, community and sustainability policies (upon recommendation from the Nomination and Governance Committee), including those related to climate change and climate transition  planning, public sustainability goals and targets (including for GHG emission reductions). We review our GHG emissions targets and goals as part of the periodic development of an updated CTAP, or more frequently if required 	 – Processes for monitoring progress towards our target/goal: Monitored on an annual basis through our business planning processes, which forecast operational GHG emissions and identify planned, proposed or potential GHG emission reduction projects out to CY2050. As part of  this process, an internal GHG emissions target is set for the relevant financial year, and monitored through our annual reporting processes, with progress reviewed by management and the Board as part of publication of our annual reporting disclosures, or more frequently if required. Our  target is also monitored on a six-monthly basis through our social value scorecard framework, with progress reviewed by management and the Board as part of publication of our half-year results (as well as annual reporting disclosures), or more frequently if required 	 – Third-party validation of our target/goal: No, but we obtain reasonable assurance over our externally reported performance against our target and goal 	 – Carbon budget for our target/goal period: 126.9 MtCO2 -e (FY2020 to FY20230). This reflects a linear reduction between our baseline  year and the target year. In the interim years before FY2030, we periodically refer to our carbon budget to assess our cumulative GHG  emissions against our carbon budget to FY2030. This enables us determine if we are on track to achieve our medium-term target or  whether we anticipate potential use of voluntary carbon credits to close any performance gap by FY2030 (which we do not currently  anticipate) 	 – Carbon budget for our target/goal period: For the period FY2020 to FY2030, refer to the carbon budget for our target. We do not  currently use a carbon budget for the period beyond FY2030 	 – Expected progression: Progress towards our target and goal is expected to be non-linear and affected by organic changes in our production of commodities The latest BHP GHG Emissions Calculation Methodology  and BHP ESG Standards and Databook are available at  bhp.com/climate  ===== PAGE 58 ===== Definitions and key details for our GHG emissions targets and goals continued Table 8.3: Value chain GHG emissions (Scope 3 emissions) medium-term goals definitions, assumptions, adjustments and additional key details Steelmaking medium-term goal Shipping medium-term goal 	 – Description: Support industry to develop steel production technology capable of 30 per cent lower GHG emissions intensity relative to  conventional blast furnace steelmaking, with widespread adoption expected post-CY2030 	 – Reference year: CY2020 (global average GHG emissions intensity for conventional blast furnace steelmaking as at CY2020, being 2.2  tonnes of CO2 per tonne of crude steel.

GHG emissions intensity calculations currently include the transportation of  copper, iron ore, steelmaking coal, energy coal, molybdenum, uranium and nickel. Baseline year and performance data have also been adjusted for  a methodology change to use maritime transport emission factors from EU Regulation 2023/1805, after The British Standards Institution EN 16258  standard (the source of the emission factors we previously used) was withdrawn in CY2023 	 – Performance, adjusted: CY2008: 5.8 gCO2-e/dwt/nm | FY2023: 3.5 gCO2-e/dwt/nm | FY2024: 3.4 gCO2-e/dwt/nm 	 – Goal setting method: Set as a point in time, i.e. with the specific date of ‘by CY2030’ for our goal to support a 40 per cent GHG emissions  intensity reduction of BHP‑chartered shipping of BHP products, while reflecting the challenges and uncertainty and our inability (as BHP  alone) to ensure Scope 3 emission reductions. As a result, the goal is not based on a trajectory and does not imply a specific carbon  budget, and so Scope 3 emissions may fluctuate (with some increases and/or non-linear decreases) during the period before the goal date 	 – Goal derived using a sectoral decarbonisation approach: No, although our goal is generally consistent with the IMO’s CY2030 emissions  intensity goal for the international shipping sector and we selected CY2008 as our goal’s baseline year to align with the base year for the IMO’s  CY2030 goal and its corresponding reasoning and strategy 	 – Processes for reviewing the setting of the goal: The Board approves BHP’s significant social, community and sustainability policies (upon recommendation from the Nomination and Governance Committee), including those related to climate change and climate transition planning,  public sustainability goals and targets (including for GHG emission reductions).

For the upstream GHG emissions component, the boundary is defined on a  category-by-category basis due to data limitations 	 – Inventory boundary: Scope 3 emissions 	 – Exclusions: Refer to exclusions for our shipping and suppliers targets 	 – GHGs included: Defined by the available data, which differs by Scope 3 emissions  category. We intend to continue to improve our GHG emission calculations over time to  encompass specific greenhouse gases as data becomes available 	 – Boundary: 	 – GHG emissions from maritime transportation not owned or operated by BHP where the  transportation was of BHP-produced products sold by BHP. May be BHP-chartered or   third-party-chartered. In some cases, the target’s boundary may differ from the boundaries  under mandatory reporting 	 – Inventory boundary: Scope 3 emissions, Categories 4 and 9, shipping of BHP  products only 	 – Exclusions: 	 – GHG emissions from maritime transportation not owned or operated by BHP, but  chartered and paid for by BHP, where the transportation was of third-party-produced  products sold by BHP (pursuant to our third-party-trading activity) 	 – GHG emissions from maritime transportation not owned or operated by BHP, but  chartered and paid for by BHP or a third party, where the transportation was of products  purchased by BHP 	 – GHGs included: CO2, CH4, N2O 	 – Boundary: 	 – Scopes 1 and 2 emissions of our direct suppliers included in BHP’s reported Scope  3 emissions reporting categories of purchased goods and services (including  capital goods), fuel- and energy-related activities, business travel and employee  commuting. In some cases, the target’s boundary may differ from the boundaries under  mandatory reporting 	 – Inventory boundary: Scope 3 emissions, Categories 1, 3, 6 and 7 (subset) emissions are  being used as a proxy for the Scopes 1 and 2 emissions of our direct suppliers 	 – Exclusions: Scope 3 emissions (for our direct suppliers) associated with our purchased  goods and services (including capital goods), fuel- and energy-related activities, business  travel and employee commuting 	 – GHGs included: Defined by the available data, which differs by Scope 3 emissions  category. We intend to continue to improve our GHG emission calculations over time to  encompass specific greenhouse gases as data becomes available 	 – Offsetting: We anticipate offsetting by our customers, suppliers and other third parties will play a role in meeting our long-term net zero goal (and potentially our long-term net zero targets), particularly for residual GHG emissions in steelmaking which are not currently expected to reach zero by  CY2050. Where third parties offset their GHG emissions that appear in our reported Scope 3 emissions inventory, we plan to recognise and report the net GHG emissions after offsetting. Carbon credits sourced by third parties in our value chain and associated with GHG emissions that appear in  our reported Scope 3 emissions inventory would need to be high-integrity before we recognised that offsetting in our reporting. 	 – Measurement approach: Description of the calculation methodology used for each Scope  3 emissions category can be found in the BHP GHG Emissions Calculation Methodology  2024, available at bhp.com/climate 	 – Key adjustments made to our baseline year, reference year and subsequent  data: Category 1, Category 3, Category 4 (maritime component), Category 9 (maritime  component), Category 10, Category 11 and Category 15 GHG emissions in reference year  and performance data have been adjusted for the divestment of our interest in Cerrejón  (with an effective economic date of 31 December 2020), divestment of our interest in BMC  (completed on 3 May 2022), divestment of our interest in the Rhourde Ouled Djemma (ROD)  Integrated Development (completed in April 2022), divestment of our Petroleum business  (merger with Woodside completed on 1 June 2022), BMA’s divestment of the Blackwater and  Daunia mines (completed on 2 April 2024), and acquisition of OZ Minerals (completed on 2  May 2023).

Based on the  procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe the BHP  Climate Transition Action Plan 2024 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria (as defined below). What our review covered (the ‘Subject Matter’) Ernst & Young (‘EY’) was engaged by BHP to provide limited  assurance over the BHP Climate Transition Action Plan (2024)  (‘CTAP’) in accordance with the Criteria (as defined below). Criteria In preparing the CTAP, BHP applied:  	 – The Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related  Financial Disclosures 	 – The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure  Recommendations Principles for Effective Disclosures 	 – The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure  Guidance on Scenario Analysis for Non-Financial Companies 	 – The UK Financial Conduct Authority Listing Rule 14.3.24R 	 – BHP Scopes 1, 2, and 3 GHG Emissions Calculation Methodology  2024, as informed by the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting  (Measurement) Determination 2008 for scope 1 and scope 2 GHG  data, and the World Resource Institute/World Business Council for  Sustainable Development Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate  Accounting and Reporting Standard, including the GHG Protocol:  Scope 2 Guidance and the Corporate Value Chain Scope 3  Accounting and Reporting Standard for scope 3 GHG data.  In preparing the CTAP, BHP also used the below list of principles to  inform the approach to disclosing its 1.5°C scenario analysis; and  the assumptions and claims supporting BHP’s planned actions and  climate-related goals and targets: 	 – Completeness –  	 – that the assumptions, approach and inputs forming the basis of  BHP’s 1.5°C scenario analysis, as presented within the CTAP,  do not omit relevant, well-established and publicly available  inputs that could reasonably be expected to affect decisions of  the intended users made on the basis of that CTAP information 	 – that the assumptions, approach and inputs forming the basis  of BHP’s planned actions and climate-related goals and  targets, as presented within the CTAP, do not omit relevant,  well‑established and publicly available inputs that could  reasonably be expected to affect decisions of the intended  users made on the basis of that CTAP information, and  incorporate BHP’s decarbonisation approach across its  self‑identified climate related risks and opportunities. 	 – Reasonableness, including: 	 – Transparency – that the CTAP details BHP’s approach to  decarbonisation across its publicly stated climate-related  targets, goals, and commitments 	 – Neutrality – that the CTAP neither overstates, nor understates  the impact 	 – Defensibility – that BHP’s approach to decarbonisation as set  out in the CTAP is achievable, subject to the assumptions,  limitations and uncertainties described therein, and does not  contradict credible external climate scenarios. The standards, recommendations, guidance, rules, BHP documents  and principles referenced above in this Criteria section together  constitute the ‘Criteria’, which is what we assured the CTAP against. Key responsibilities  BHP’s responsibility  BHP’s management is responsible for selecting the Criteria, and for  presenting the CTAP in accordance with that Criteria, in all material  respects. This responsibility includes establishing and maintaining  internal controls, maintaining adequate records and making  estimates that are relevant to the preparation of the CTAP, such that  it is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. EY’s responsibility and independence Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the CTAP based on  our review. We have complied with the independence and relevant ethical  requirements, which are founded on fundamental principles of  integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care,  confidentiality and professional behaviour.  The firm applies Auditing Standard ASQM 1 Quality Management  for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Reports  and Other Financial Information, or Other Assurance or Related  Services Engagements, which requires the firm to design,  implement and operate a system of quality management including  policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical  requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and  regulatory requirements. Our approach to conducting the review We conducted this review in accordance with the International  Auditing and Assurance Standards Board’s International Standard  on Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of  Historical Financial Information (‘ISAE 3000’) and the terms of  reference for this engagement as agreed with BHP on 12 March  2024. That standard requires that we plan and perform our  engagement to express a conclusion on whether anything has  come to our attention that causes us to believe that the CTAP is not  prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria,  and to issue a report. Summary of review procedures performed  A limited assurance engagement consists of making enquiries,  primarily of persons responsible for preparing the CTAP and related  information and applying analytical and other review procedures.  The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend  on our professional judgement, including an assessment of the  risk of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The  procedures we performed included, but were not limited to: 	 – Evaluating the suitability of the Criteria and that the Criteria have  been applied appropriately to the CTAP 	 – Interviewing select BHP personnel to understand the reporting  process at group, business, asset, and site level, including  management’s processes to identify BHP’s material climate-related  risks and opportunities for the purposes of identifying existence  and understanding completeness of reported information 	 – Checking the CTAP to understand how BHP’s self-identified  material climate-related risks and opportunities are reflected  within the qualitative disclosures, and considering whether this is  consistent with the principles specified in the Criteria 	 – Reviewing data, information and obtaining explanations,  undertaking analytical procedures, and reperforming calculations  to support the climate-related performance data and statements  included within the CTAP 	 – Reviewing information on a sample basis, based on our  professional judgement, to support BHP’s stated actions towards  BHP’s publicly stated climate-related targets and goals 	 – Reviewing evidence underpinning BHP’s portfolio disclosures  including checking that the material assumptions and inputs  into BHP’s 1.5°C scenario analysis are substantiated and are  benchmarked to credible sources, and where they deviate, are  transparently justified 	 – Reviewing quantitative and qualitative information within the  CTAP for consistency and alignment across the CTAP and across  BHP’s annual reporting disclosures. We believe that the evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate  to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion. Inherent limitations Procedures performed in a review (i.e., a limited assurance  engagement) vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent  than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the  level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement  is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been  obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.  Our procedures were designed to obtain a limited level of assurance  on which to base our conclusion and do not provide all the evidence  that would be required to provide a reasonable level of assurance. While we considered the effectiveness of management’s internal  controls when determining the nature and extent of our procedures,  our assurance engagement was not designed to provide assurance  on internal controls. Our procedures did not include testing controls  or performing procedures relating to checking aggregation or  calculation of data within IT systems. The greenhouse gas quantification process is subject to scientific  uncertainty, which arises because of incomplete scientific  knowledge about the measurement of greenhouse gases.  Additionally, greenhouse gas procedures are subject to estimation  and measurement uncertainty resulting from the measurement and  calculation processes used to quantify emissions within the bounds  of existing scientific knowledge. Climate-related risk management is an emerging area, and often  uses data and methodologies that are developing and subject  to a higher degree of uncertainty. The CTAP contains forward  looking statements, including climate-related scenarios, targets,  assumptions, climate projections, forecasts, statements of  future intentions and estimates and judgements that have not yet  occurred and may never occur.

We exceeded this target with a 15 per cent decrease in operational GHG emissions from our  adjusted FY2017 baseline. The FY2017 baseline was adjusted for divestments and methodology changes. 3	 With widespread adoption expected post-CY2030. 4	 From a CY2008 baseline, reflecting International Maritime Organisation objectives for the shipping industry. 5	 Future GHG emission estimates are based on current annual business plans.

Reactor technology readiness demonstrates  the technologies already established (blast furnace and electric arc furnace indicated by the full dark blue  bar) relative to those that are emerging and are yet to achieve commercial readiness (electric smelting  furnace and electrolysis). These factors influence expected time to market. Raw material flexibility indicates  whether the process route can use variable iron ore and scrap grades (indicated by the full dark blue bar) or  is sensitive to ore and scrap quality (for example electric arc furnace). Steel grade flexibility indicates whether  the process route can be used to produce a range of steel grades (such as the blast furnace and electric  smelting furnace) or produces a narrower range of products (such as the electric arc furnace). We expect  technologies with wider raw material and steel grade flexibility to be more attractive options for steelmakers.  Integration with existing plants reflects the ability for these process routes to use or be retrofitted to existing  steelmaking infrastructure.  	 The blast furnace process route GHG emissions intensity ‘today’ value has been calculated using a baseline  reference of 2.2 tonnes of CO2-e per tonne of crude steel, as sourced from IEA Iron and Steel Technology  Roadmap (October 2020). The ‘end state’ value assumes a blast furnace basic oxygen furnace steel plant  with electrolytic hydrogen injection, top gas recycling and CCUS applied to key point sources (coke ovens  underfiring, blast furnace hot stoves and on-site power plant), utilising raw materials typically available in  Asia markets and a 15 per cent scrap rate in the basic oxygen furnace.  	 The electric arc furnace route GHG emissions intensity ‘today’ value is sourced from an average of a sample  of natural gas-based direct reduced iron electric arc furnace sites utilising up to 25 per cent scrap in CY2023,  as well as the CRU Steel Cost Model and BHP analysis. 	 All other GHG emissions intensity values are sourced from BHP analysis. 9	 Wood Mackenzie analysis. Seaborne iron ore exports containing greater than 67.5 per cent Fe and less than  3.5 per cent gangue impurities (alumina and silica).  10 	 Distinct industry partners refers to individual corporate entities participating in our steelmaking projects to  support GHG emissions intensity reduction.  11 	 Global steel production sourced from World Steel in Figures 2024, World Steel Association. 12 	 Estimated co-investment includes the funding we committed from FY2020 to FY2024 (refer to endnote 13  for more information) and our additional funding planned from FY2025 to FY2029 (refer to endnote 14 for  more information), totalling around US$215 million. It also includes our estimate of actual and anticipated  funding and in-kind contributions from strategic partners for a number of the projects under our steelmaking  decarbonisation program from FY2020 to FY2029 totalling around US$205 million. Where all the partners  (including BHP) to a program project have agreed to share costs equally, our estimate assumes that each  of our strategic partners has contributed or will contribute equivalently (through funding and/or in-kind  contribution) to our committed and budgeted funding for that project. The estimate also assumes projects  that require final approval at a future tollgate will be approved by all partners. 13 	 Funding committed by BHP in the past five years is made up our investments and contractual funding  commitments for our steelmaking decarbonisation program from FY2020 to FY2024, including BHP  Venture investments, research and development funding and collaborative partnerships (such as with our  steelmaking customers).

A technology with a high TRL does not mean it has been commercially deployed.  We assess TRLs as a way of measuring the maturity of the technologies that form part of our steelmaking  decarbonisation program. 17 	 The International Maritime Organisation has not defined ‘zero’ or ‘near zero’, although we consider this to  mean technologies, fuels and/or energy sources capable of 90 per cent (‘near zero’) to 100 per cent (‘zero’)  lower GHG emissions intensity (gCO2-e/joule) on a well-to-wake basis compared to conventional fossil fuels  used in shipping. 18 	 Biodiesel GHG emission reduction calculations based on certified fuel product with the fuel certificates  provided by biodiesel suppliers. 19 	 Estimated co-investment for the period from FY2021 to FY2024 includes our spend on initiatives under our  shipping decarbonisation strategy and assumed third-party spend. The vast majority of our estimated co- investment figure is made up of our actual and committed future spend on the Global Centre for Maritime  Decarbonisation (GCMD) and the actual and committed future spend on the GCMD by its other five founding  partners and the Singapore Maritime and Port Authority, together with assumed third-party spend based on  our estimated value of five new dual-fuelled LNG chartered vessels and one wind propulsion device of the  kind retrofitted to a BHP-chartered vessel in a trial with Pan Pacific Copper and Norsepower. We estimated  the value of the five dual-fuelled LNG chartered vessels with reference to the resale value (as a proxy for new  build cost) at the date of the maiden voyage of the first of the five vessels by BHP, as sourced from an external  shipping research portal. 20	 Energy-related CO2 emissions only.

Page 24 of Summary for Policymakers. In: Global Warming of  1.5°C. IPCC, CY2018. GHG emissions in our 1.5°C scenario are constrained to a carbon budget of 500Gt  CO2-e (on a net GHG emissions basis) between CY2020 and CY2050, and is modelled to have a global  warming trajectory that temporarily overshoots 1.5°C before returning to below 1.5°C by CY2100, on the  basis of the median of probabilities. 22 	 Our 1.5°C scenario assumes the sectoral total GHG emissions in CY2050 compared to CY2021 declines  as follows: For the power sector there is a decline of 105 per cent; for the transport sector there is a decline  of 98 per cent; for the building sector there is a decline of 57 per cent; and for all other industry there is a  decline of 74 per cent. 23	 We consider an industry association membership to be material if: (1) our annual base membership fee is  equal to or greater than US$100,000; and/or (2) there is significant stakeholder interest in the advocacy of  the association (as determined by whether the association was listed on InfluenceMap’s ranking of industry  associations). 24	 Engagements on climate policy are as at the publication of this CTAP on 27 August 2024. 25	 Table SPM.1, Summary for Policymakers.

Adjusted/unadjusted (with respect to GHG  emissions data) Adjusted means calculated to present the GHG  emissions data for a time period (such as a baseline  year or reporting year) as though relevant changes  took effect from the start of that period even though  they occurred during or not until after the end of the  period. Unless expressly stated otherwise, relevant  changes are all acquisitions, divestments and/or GHG  emission calculation methodology changes.  For example, when we adjust the FY2020 baseline  year for our operational GHG emission medium-term  target and long-term net zero goal to compare our  adjusted FY2024 performance data against it: 1.	 the FY2020 data is presented with our Scopes  1 and 2 emissions for operated assets that have  been acquired or divested by BHP added or  removed (respectively), and applying methodology  changes that took effect, between 1 July 2019 and  30 June 2024  2.	 the FY2024 data is then presented as though any   acquisitions, divestments and/or methodology  changes that occurred during the year took effect  from the start of the year This enables a ‘like for like’ comparison that provides  the information most relevant to assessing progress  against our GHG emissions targets and goals.   Unadjusted means calculated to present the  GHG emissions data for a reporting year so that  any relevant changes that occurred during the  year (including acquisitions, divestments and/or  methodology changes) are applied only from the date  they took effect. Adjustments (with respect to our GHG emissions  targets and goals) Calculations to present GHG emissions data on an  adjusted basis. Assets (in relation to BHP) A set of one or more geographically proximate  operations (including open-cut mines and  underground mines). Assets include our operated  assets and non-operated assets. Base case One of three planning cases in our planning range,  being the ‘most likely’ base case in our planning  range. Refer to the definition of our planning range. Baseline/baseline year (with respect to GHG  emissions targets and goals) A year used as a basis to compare and measure  performance of subsequent years. BHP BHP Group Limited and its subsidiaries. Bioenergy Energy produced from renewable biological sources,  such as biomass. Biofuel/biodiesel A fuel, usually a liquid fuel, produced from renewable  biological feedstock sources, such as plant material,  vegetation or agricultural waste. Biomass Plant material, vegetation, or agricultural waste used  as a fuel or energy source. This could be in solid,  liquid or gaseous form. Carbon budget (for BHP) A total quantity of GHG emissions from FY2020 to  FY2030 equivalent to our cumulative operational  GHG emissions (Scopes 1 and 2 emissions from our  operated assets) being at or below a hypothetical  straight line between our adjusted baseline in FY2020  and a 30 per cent reduction to that baseline in  FY2030, despite our pathway being non-linear.  For how our carbon budget relates to our medium-term  target, refer to Table 8.2 in Definitions and key details  for our GHG emissions targets and goals on page 57,  earlier in this section Carbon budget (for the global economy, transition  or future, or similar) The total net amount of greenhouse gases measured in  CO2-equivalent tonnes that can be emitted while limiting  global warming to a specified level.

Carbon capture and storage The process of carbon capture and the subsequent  transport of captured carbon to a storage location  where it is isolated from the atmosphere long-term.  Refer to the definition of carbon capture. Carbon capture, utilisation and storage The process of carbon capture and subsequently  either the use of captured carbon to create other  commercial products or services or the transport  of captured carbon to a storage location where it is  isolated from the atmosphere long-term. Refer to the  definition of carbon capture. Carbon credit The reduction or removal of carbon dioxide, or  the equivalent amount of a different greenhouse  gas (GHG), using a process that measures, tracks  and captures GHGs to compensate for an entity’s  GHG emissions exuded elsewhere. Credits may be  generated through projects in which GHG emissions  are avoided, reduced, removed from the atmosphere  or permanently stored (sequestration). Carbon credits  are generally created and independently verified in  accordance with either a voluntary program or under a  regulatory program. The purchaser of a carbon credit  can ‘retire’ or ‘surrender’ it to claim the underlying  reduction towards their own GHG emissions reduction  targets or goals or to meet legal obligations, which is  also referred to as carbon offsetting or offsetting.  We define regulatory carbon credits to mean carbon  credits used to offset GHG emissions for regulatory  compliance in our operational locations (such as the  Australia’s Safeguard Mechanism). We define voluntary carbon credits to mean carbon  credits generated through projects that reduce  or remove GHG emissions outside the scope of  regulatory compliance (including Australian Carbon  Credit Units not used for regulatory compliance). Carbon neutral Making or resulting in no net release of GHG  emissions into the atmosphere, including as a result  of offsetting. Includes all those greenhouse gas  emissions as defined for BHP reporting purposes.  Carbon dioxide equivalent The universal unit of measurement to indicate the  global warming potential of each greenhouse gas,  expressed in terms of the global warming potential  of one unit of carbon dioxide. It is used to evaluate  releasing (or avoiding releasing) different greenhouse  gases against a common basis.

Co-investment Our estimation of the potential combined impact  of funding by us and funding and/or in in-kind  contributions from third parties under our steelmaking  decarbonisation program and/or as a consequence of  our shipping strategy. These figures seek to illustrate  the opportunity to leverage our funding and approach  for broader impact. They are not forecasts and rely on  estimation that is limited by available information and  our assumptions. Electrolytic hydrogen/ammonia Hydrogen produced by splitting water into hydrogen  and oxygen using renewable or other low to zero  GHG emissions electricity, commonly referred to as  ‘green hydrogen’.  Ammonia produced by synthetically combining  nitrogen with low to zero GHG emission hydrogen  (ammonia synthesis) using renewable or other low to  zero GHG emissions electricity commonly referred to  as ‘green ammonia’.  Emission factor A factor that converts activity data into greenhouse  gas emissions data (e.g. kgCO2-e emitted per GJ  of fuel consumed, kgCO2-e emitted per KWh of  electricity used). Energy (in relation to BHP) All forms of energy products where ‘energy products’  means combustible fuels, heat, renewable energy,  electricity or any other form of energy from operations  that are owned or controlled by BHP. The primary  sources of energy consumption come from fuel  consumed by haul trucks at our operated assets, as well  as purchased electricity used at our operated assets.

Goal (for BHP with respect to GHG emissions) An ambition to seek an outcome for which there is no  current pathway(s), but for which efforts are being or  will be pursued towards addressing that challenge,  subject to certain assumptions or conditions. Such  efforts may include the resolution of existing potential  or emerging pathways. Goals of the Paris Agreement The central objective of the Paris Agreement is its  long-term goal to hold global average temperature  increase to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels  and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase  to 1.5°C above pre‑industrial levels. Greenhouse gas For BHP reporting purposes, these are the aggregate  anthropogenic carbon dioxide equivalent emissions  of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide  (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons  (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).

Our Climate Transition Action Plan 2024 provides an update on our climate  change strategy and our progress and plans in relation to our greenhouse  gas emissions goals and targets. Our plan shows we are serious about  addressing the impacts of climate change from our business while  continuing to provide strong shareholder returns. At the Annual General  Meeting this year there will be a ‘Say on climate’ vote and I recommend  you vote in favour of our Climate Transition Action Plan 2024.   Board updates  Our structured Board renewal process continued in FY2024. Ross McEwan  joined the Board as a Non-executive Director on 3 April 2024. Ross has  significant experience in the financial services industry with deep expertise  in capital allocation, risk management and value creation in complex  regulatory environments. Don Lindsay also joined the Board as a Non- executive Director on 1 May 2024 and brings over 40 years of global  experience in the resources sector and investment banking, including in  mining and resource development, financial markets, growth and value  creation. In April 2024, Ian Cockerill retired from the Board and in October  2023, Terry Bowen also retired from the Board. We benefited greatly from  Ian’s and Terry’s extensive experience and I would like to thank them for their  contribution and commitment to BHP during their time with us.   Outlook  In recent decades, we have seen global economies and supply chains  come together and support sustained economic development. Today, we  are seeing more turbulence, tension and polarisation in the geopolitical  landscape. We expect economic conditions to remain challenging in  FY2025 as geopolitical issues continue to create volatility and impact  global markets, security and trade.  Despite these challenges, I am optimistic about our future.  We have a world-class portfolio of large, long-life and high-quality assets  which stands to benefit from the global changes shaping our world. We have  a clear focus on being the best operator in the resources sector, being  disciplined in capital management through our Capital Allocation Framework  and having a differentiated approach to creating social value. We have a  culture that is committed to safety, productivity and continuous improvement  and we are working to make our workforce more inclusive and diverse. I am confident BHP is well positioned to continue to create sustainable  long-term value for shareholders and for our partners and stakeholders in  the year ahead.  Thank you for your continued support. Ken MacKenzie   Chair Chair’s review Dear Shareholders, I am pleased to provide BHP’s Annual Report for FY2024. Our operational and financial performance was strong in FY2024,  and we made solid progress against our social value and sustainability  commitments. It is more than four years since we began the  strategic transformation of BHP’s portfolio towards future-facing  commodities and the world has changed markedly in that time.  Thank you for the trust you have given us through this period.   Today, BHP has a portfolio of world-class assets focused on products  that are critical to the future. A portfolio positioned for growth, yet  resilient and able to withstand volatility. A product mix that can  continue to deliver financial and social value over the long term.  However, FY2024 was overshadowed by a fatality. We are deeply saddened  that Luke O’Brien, a team member working with one of our contracting  partners at BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA), was fatally injured in January in a  vehicle incident at the Saraji mine in Queensland. Our heartfelt thoughts and  condolences go to Luke’s family and friends. Safety is our top priority and  our commitment to zero fatalities and serious injuries at BHP is unwavering.   Our strategic priorities  During FY2024 I had the pleasure of meeting with our people, Indigenous  partners, suppliers and other stakeholders at our global sites and offices.  These discussions reinforced that our ongoing commitment to the  priorities of safety, culture and capability, capital discipline, the continued  development of our world-class portfolio and social value continue to be  the right focus areas for BHP.  Safe, inclusive and productive workplaces Our commitment to safety includes eliminating sexual harassment, racism  and bullying in our workplaces. We are determined to eliminate these  unequivocally unacceptable behaviours.   We know diverse and inclusive teams are safer and more productive.  We achieved a 1.9 percentage point year-on-year increase in female  employee participation in FY2024 to 37.1 per cent by year end. We also  made progress towards our Indigenous employment targets, including  Indigenous employee participation reaching 10.1 per cent in Chile and  11.2 per cent in Canada by year end. We have more work to do, but we  are making progress on our commitment to provide a safe and inclusive  workplace culture. Positioned for success  BHP, and mining, have a clear and undeniable role to provide the metals  and minerals the world needs for more sustainable development.  The global trends shaping our future are interconnected, unstoppable and  bring with them new challenges and opportunities for our sector. A growing  and increasingly urbanised population seeking a higher standard of living  will require vast amounts of metals and minerals. That demand will only be  amplified by the energy transition.  We are continuing to position our portfolio to align with these trends.  Iron ore for steel to build cities and renewables infrastructure,  steelmaking coal for the blast furnace process for making steel, copper  for electrification, nickel for electric vehicle batteries and potash for food  security and more sustainable land.  Delivering value  BHP’s strong operational performance and disciplined approach to  capital allocation has seen the Board determine dividends totaling  US$7.4 billion to shareholders for the year. This will take the total amount  of cash dividends returned to you since 1 July 2021 to over $US42 billion  including the FY2024 final dividend. We continued to make significant contributions to the communities where  we operate through employment, community partnerships, payments to  local suppliers, and taxes and royalties paid to governments. Our total  global economic contribution was US$49.2 billion in FY2024.  Creating social value is vital to our business and goes hand in hand with  long-term sustainable shareholder value. In FY2024, we delivered tangible  progress in each of the six pillars of our social framework which are  focused on decarbonisation, the environment, Indigenous partnerships,  workforce, communities, and supply chains.  Social value is interwoven into our strategic decision-making through our  social value framework, which helps us to meet the world’s demand for  resources more sustainably, with more renewable energy, less fresh water  use and less disruption. Today, BHP has a portfolio   of world-class assets focused   on products that are critical   to the future. A portfolio  positioned for growth,  yet resilient and able  to withstand volatility.  A product mix that can  continue to deliver  financial and social  value over the long term.” 4 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 7 ===== Dear Shareholders, At BHP, we work to bring people and resources together to build a better  world, and we continued to make solid progress on this in FY2024. The tragic loss of a coworker at Saraji in January in a light vehicle incident  underscored why safety must remain our first priority. Following an  investigation, we have identified improvement areas for Saraji and BMA  and work is underway to implement these. We must eliminate fatalities and  serious injuries at our operations.   It was a year of strong overall business performance at BHP. By executing  our strategy, we outperformed our competitors in key areas. We achieved  an annual production record at Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO),  where we also widened our lead as the world’s lowest-cost iron ore  producer. We delivered record production at copper assets Spence  and Carrapateena, and the highest copper production in four years  at Escondida – the world’s largest copper mine. This growth helped  us achieve an underlying attributable profit of US$13.7 billion. We will  distribute dividends totaling 146 US cents per share for the year.   Poised for growth   We continued to advance growth options in the commodities the world  needs to meet the demands of the energy transition and population growth.  We believe we have the balance sheet, technical and operational capability  that will be needed to unlock new supply for the decades to come.   Construction of our Jansen potash project in Canada is ahead of the  original schedule and first production is expected in just over two years.  We have approved Jansen Stage 2, which will make BHP one of the  leading players in the global potash industry by the end of the decade.    We have strengthened our position in copper. The integration of  Prominent Hill and Carrapateena with Olympic Dam has delivered   greater-than-expected synergies. We are exploring options to grow Copper  South Australia’s production beyond 500 kilotonnes per annum (ktpa) of  copper, with further potential up to 650 ktpa. In July 2024, we increased our  early-stage copper options by agreeing to acquire a 50 per cent interest  in the Filo del Sol and Josemaria projects with Lundin Mining in Argentina  and Chile. If approved, this will give us the opportunity to advance one of  the most significant copper discoveries globally in recent decades.   Our project pipeline and focus on continuous improvement in existing  operations leave us well poised for growth across our four commodity pillars  of copper, potash, iron ore and steelmaking coal in the decades ahead.  Winning strategy   Our actions in FY2024 are consistent with our winning strategy, founded  on the three strategic pillars of safety and sustainability, exceptional  performance and winning portfolio. In a cyclical industry, the stability of our  operations and financial performance reflects the resilience and durability  of our business.    The creation of social value is integral to our strategy and the delivery of  long-term shareholder value. When we create social value, we build our  case as the preferred partner for communities, we gain access to more  opportunities, and we attract the best talent.   In the financial year, we increased Indigenous employment globally and  boosted supplier spend with Indigenous businesses by 83 per cent to more  than US$600 million. This was part of a broader 9 per cent increase to  US$3.3 billion in supplier spend by BHP-operated businesses to more than  2,600 small, local and Indigenous businesses. This not only benefits our  operations, but provides crucial support for jobs, businesses and families  in regional communities surrounding them.    We made further progress on our operational decarbonisation plans and  remain on track to meet our operational GHG emissions target of at least  a 30 per cent reduction by FY2030 against an FY2020 baseline.   Refining our portfolio   We continue to focus on building a portfolio of world-class assets in  attractive commodities in stable jurisdictions.   We refined our steelmaking coal portfolio in Queensland with the sale of  the Daunia and Blackwater mines by our joint venture BMA. This strategic  shift positions BMA well for the forecasted strong demand for higher- quality steelmaking coal. Following the transaction, around 90 per cent of  our steelmaking coals are high-grade products attracting premium pricing.    In July 2024, we made the difficult but necessary decision to transition  Western Australia Nickel into a period of temporary suspension.  This reflected significant global oversupply of nickel, which we expect  will continue until the end of the decade. We have offered redeployment  to all frontline workers in other parts of BHP and will continue to support  impacted host communities in a range of ways, including through our  Chief Executive Officer’s review A$20 million Community Fund. We will continue to invest approximately  US$300 million per annum in our Western Australia Nickel facilities to  enable a potential re-start if the global nickel market outlook improves.  We will review the decision by February 2027.    Our people and culture differentiate us   Our strong performance in FY2024 is a testament to our more than 90,000  employees and contractors who work hard to build a better BHP every  day. They are empowered to do so by the BHP Operating System and we  continue to build an inclusive and diverse culture with a performance edge.     During the year we refreshed Our Values, which set the tone for our  culture. Our Values comprise three simple statements. First and foremost,  we must always ‘Do what’s right’ – operating safely and with integrity are  non-negotiable. We also need to constantly ‘Seek better ways’ – listening  to others, seeking out new ideas, and improving on today. And finally,  we must always strive to ‘Make a difference’, which applies not only to  the company and the team, but also to the individual. Every day we have  the opportunity to have a positive impact on performance, those around  us, and the world. Our Values help guide everything we do at BHP.  They reflect both what we stand for and who we aspire to be.   Innovation and technology   BHP is well placed to capitalise on the opportunities afforded by artificial  intelligence (AI) and advanced data analytics given our large-scale,  repeatable processes, and vast amounts of data. We are already starting  to see benefits. The application of AI at our Escondida processing plants  has helped save more than three gigalitres of water – and 118-gigawatt  hours of energy – since FY2022. Machine learning has assisted in the  discovery of new copper deposits in Australia and the United States.   Through our Xplor and BHP Ventures programs we continue to seek new  partnerships and access to game-changing technologies and insight to  help drive sustainable growth for the decades ahead.   In great shape   BHP finished FY2024 in an excellent position. We are well placed to  benefit from the significant global changes happening around us. We have  strategic clarity and exposure to the right commodities. We continue to  build on our excellence in operations and discipline in our capital allocation.  We hold resilient, long-term assets with substantial optionality. This allows  us to make smart choices about how and where we use our balance sheet  to fund growth and generate value.  As we look to FY2025, we will continue to execute our strategy to create  value for our shareholders, community partners and stakeholders, now and  into the future.   Thank you for your continued support.   Mike Henry  Chief Executive Officer We continued to advance   growth options in the  commodities the world needs   to meet the demands of the  energy transition and   population growth.  We believe we have the balance   sheet, technical and operational   capability that will be needed   to unlock new supply for the   decades to come.”  5 Operating and Financial Review Additional Information Financial Statements Governance Contents Overview  ===== PAGE 8 ===== 1  Why BHP Exploration and acquisition We seek to add high-quality Tier 1 interests  through our exploration activities and  early‑stage entry and acquisition options. Closure and rehabilitation We consider closure and rehabilitation  throughout the asset lifecycle to help  minimise our impact and optimise   post-closure value for all stakeholders  and partners. Process and logistics We process and refine ore and seek to  safely manage waste. Our objective is to  efficiently and sustainably transport our  products to customers. Development and mining We strive to achieve the industry’s best  performance in safety, operational  excellence, project management and  allocation of capital. Sales, marketing and procurement We maximise value through our centralised  marketing and procurement organisations,  commercial expertise, understanding of markets  and customer and supplier relationships. We will responsibly manage the  most resilient long-term portfolio  of assets, in highly attractive  commodities, and will grow  value through being excellent  at operations, discovering and  developing resources, acquiring  the right assets and options, and  capital allocation. Through our differentiated  approach to social value, we will  be a trusted partner who creates  value for all stakeholders. Our strategy 6 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 9 ===== The world needs essential metals and minerals to be   produced by companies who set and uphold high ESG standards,   who run their operations safely and efficiently, and who allocate   capital in a consistent and disciplined way. These are the companies   that will succeed. This is BHP.  Our capabilities, track record, scale and the unique way we work through the BHP Operating System enable a culture  of continuous improvement. We aim to grow value for our shareholders, partners and stakeholders through our portfolio of large long‑life quality assets in attractive  commodities and through our focus on social value, which is integral to how we operate.  BHP is positioned to benefit from the changes shaping our planet now and for decades to come as demand for our commodities grows. Our products are vital Population growth, urbanisation and improving living standards are global  trends that underpin strong demand for the commodities we produce. Demand for essential commodities is expected to increase as the world  seeks to decarbonise. Iron ore is needed for making steel to build cities and renewables  infrastructure. Steelmaking coal is needed for the blast furnace process  for making steel. Copper is vital for electrification. Nickel can be used in  electric vehicle batteries. Potash can help with food security and more  sustainable land use. Scale is important As new large low-cost ore bodies become harder to find and develop, the  scale and quality of our assets set us apart. We have some of the largest  resources and lowest-cost assets in the world.  One of our biggest growth levers is productivity and unlocking more  value from our existing assets. We seek to improve productivity through  the capabilities of our people and culture of continuous improvement  driven through the BHP Operating System, and the use of technology  and innovation to extract more from what we do every day and more from  our resources. The scale of our assets provides multiple growth options. We are seeking  to produce more iron ore in Western Australia. We are working to improve  productivity at our steelmaking coal operations in Queensland. We are  advancing multiple growth options in copper in Chile and our recently  established copper province in South Australia. We have sanctioned the  second stage of our Jansen potash project in Canada, which will eventually  double its expected annual production. For more information refer to OFR 5 Social value is embedded in everything we do We are committed to social value: our positive contribution to society. It is  vital for our future and a consideration in the strategic decisions we make. Social value underpins stable operations, reduces risk and opens doors  to opportunities, partnerships, talent and capital. Delivering social value  will help us to continue to generate long-term value for all partners and  stakeholders, including shareholders. For more information refer to OFR 6.2 to 6.5 We do what we say BHP has a track record of doing what we say we will do. We continue to  plan strategically, responsibly, consistently, with a clear focus on being  the best operator, being disciplined in capital allocation and continuing to  generate value and returns for stakeholders. In a cyclical industry, we have delivered an underlying EBITDA profit  margin of over 50 per cent for eight-consecutive years. We have generated  net operating cash flows of over US$15 billion for all but one of the past  15 years. This stability is our hallmark – achieved through robust capital  management and consistent operational performance. Including the final dividend for FY2024 declared, we will have distributed  more than US$42 billion in total in cash dividends to shareholders since  1 July 2021. This includes US$7.4 billion in cash dividends for FY2024. Our total economic contribution in FY2024 was US$49.2 billion.  This includes contributions to suppliers, wages and benefits for more than  90,000 employees and contractors, dividends, taxes and royalties, and  voluntary investment in projects in the communities where we operate. For more information refer to OFR 4 and the   BHP Economic Contribution Report 2024 available at   bhp.com/ECR2024 The future is clear Key commodities we produce or are positioning to produce are vital for  a better world and can help address global challenges, such as climate  change and food security. We are continuing to build an inclusive and diverse workforce of   talented people. We have a strong balance sheet and industry‑leading  operational capability underpinned by the BHP Operating System   and our technical Centres of Excellence. Our track record, long-term stability and commitment   to social value and sustainability set us apart. This combination will help us achieve our aim of   growing value more consistently for our partners   and stakeholders and drive attractive   returns and long-term value for   our shareholders.

Iron ore, which is essential for  making steel needed for construction, including renewables infrastructure. Our  higher-quality steelmaking coal is used in the blast furnace process for making  steel. Nickel can be used in electric vehicle batteries. We are on track to be a major  global producer of potash by the end of the decade. Potash is used in fertilisers  to assist with food security for a growing population and more sustainable land  use. Among our by‑products, we are a major producer of uranium and gold. 1.	 Largest copper mineral resources on a contained metal basis, equity share.

Source BHP data: BHP Annual Report 2024.  2.	 Based on published unit costs of major iron ore producers as reported at 30 June 2024. There may be differences in the manner that third parties calculate or report unit costs data  compared to BHP, which means third-party data may not be comparable with our data. Iron ore Nickel Nickel West production in FY2024 was in line  with the prior year. On 11 July 2024, we announced Western Australia  Nickel, comprising the Nickel West operations  and West Musgrave project would be temporarily  suspended from October 2024. We intend to  review this decision by February 2027. The decision to temporarily suspend Western  Australia Nickel reflects oversupply in the global  nickel market. Forward consensus nickel prices  over the next half of the decade have fallen  sharply reflecting strong growth of alternative  low-cost nickel supply. During the temporary suspension, BHP will  continue to support our workforce and local  communities. BHP will invest approximately  US$300 million per annum following completion  of a transition period to support a potential   re-start of Western Australia Nickel.  The transition period commenced in July 2024.  Operations will be suspended in October  2024 and handover activities for temporary  suspension are expected to be completed by  December 2024. For more information refer to  OFR 5.1 Temporary suspension announced 81.6 kt  2% on FY2023 In July 2024, we agreed to acquire a 50 per  cent interest in the Filo del Sol and Josemaria  copper projects in Argentina and Chile with  Lundin Mining. If approved, this will give us  the opportunity to jointly advance an emerging  copper district with world-class potential. For more information refer to  OFR 5.2 and 5.3 Highest production in over 15 years 1.86 Mt  9% on FY2023 Copper We hold the world’s largest copper mineral  resources.1 We are using technical innovation,  such as new flotation technology, to help lower  energy costs and unlock value. We continue to  pursue our strategy to increase our exposure  to future-facing commodities, including copper,  through exploration, acquisition and early-stage  options. Our copper production rose 9 per cent  in FY2024 to the highest in more than 15 years. Escondida in Chile is the world’s largest copper  mine. It increased production by 7 per cent in  FY2024 compared to FY2023, to 1.12 million  tonnes (Mt) (100 per cent basis). This was  primarily due to a higher concentrator feed  grade as mining progressed into areas of  higher-grade ore as planned following the  implementation of measures to manage  geotechnical events in FY2023. Spence in Chile  delivered another year of record production,  up 6 per cent to 255 kilotonnes (kt). We are  exploring a range of growth options across our  Chilean copper assets, including a potential new  concentrator at Escondida and the application  of leaching technologies at Spence and  Cerro Colorado. We have established a significant resource base  at Copper South Australia by adding Olympic  Dam with Carrapateena and Prominent Hill  from our OZ Minerals acquisition in FY2023.  The successful integration of the former  OZ Minerals assets has delivered increased  production and exceeded our annualised  synergies planned at the time of the acquisition  of OZ Minerals. This has been through actions  such as the processing of Prominent Hill and  Carrapateena concentrate at Olympic Dam  into higher-margin cathode and refined gold,  resulting in annual records for cathode and  gold production at Olympic Dam. Copper South  Australia production was 322 kt in FY2024,  including record production at Carrapateena.  We’re progressing growth options at Copper  South Australia, where our aspiration is to grow  copper production to beyond 500 kt per year.  Given the gold, silver and uranium co-products,  this would be equivalent to over 700 kt per  annum copper equivalent. We had exploration  success in South Australia in FY2024 with OD  Deeps, delivering greater than two kilometres  in strike and more than one kilometre in depth  at over 1 per cent copper grade and an Inferred  Mineral Resource declaration at Oak Dam. 10 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 13 ===== Potash We are developing one of the world’s largest  potash mines in Canada. The Jansen potash  project will increase our product diversification,  customer base and operating footprint, and  expand our business into a future growth market.  The US$5.7 billion Jansen Stage 1 project is  ahead of the original schedule and was over  50 per cent complete by the end of FY2024.  First production from Jansen Stage 1 is expected  in late CY2026, followed by a two-year ramp‑up  period. In October 2023, we announced an  additional investment of US$4.9 billion for Jansen  Stage 2, which will increase Jansen’s total planned  potash production capacity to ~8.5 Mtpa. We have  commenced execution of Jansen Stage 2. Transitioning directly from Jansen Stage 1  to Jansen Stage 2 during the construction  period will bring operational benefits, including  leveraging the experience of our integrated  project team and continued use of our existing  suppliers and contractors.  We are on track to be a major global producer of  potash by the end of the decade. Longer term,  Jansen has the potential for two additional  expansions to reach an ultimate production  capacity of 16 to 17 Mtpa (subject to studies  and approvals). For more information refer to  OFR 5.3  3.	 For CY2023, the GHG emissions intensity of our production of our commodities is estimated to rank in the first quartile for our iron ore, copper and steelmaking coal mines, and the second  quartile for our nickel operations (ahead of all Indonesian-based operations) of global mining operations analysed by CRU. This analysis is based on CY2023 data from CRU (as CRU data  is prepared on a calendar year basis), and includes CRU’s assumptions and estimates of BHP’s operations. We transitioned to using CRU (rather than Skarn Associates) for this analysis  in FY2024 as part of an annual vendor assessment and selection process. For more information on how the GHG emission intensity for our iron ore and steelmaking coal mines has been  calculated and compared refer to the BHP ESG Standards and Databook 2024 available at bhp.com/climate. Major global producer by the end of the decade US$10.6 bn Total approved capital expenditure through Jansen  Stage 1 and Jansen Stage 2 Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO) is  the lowest-cost major iron ore producer  globally2 and has one of the lowest  greenhouse gas (GHG) emission  production intensities of benchmarked iron  ore operations.3  WAIO delivered a second-consecutive  full‑year production record of  287 Mt (255 Mt BHP share), reflecting  strong supply chain performance with  increased capacity unlocked by the  Port Debottlenecking Project 1 and  increased production from South Flank, our  newest and most technologically advanced  mine. These more than offset the impacts  of the continued tie-in activity for the Rail  Technology Programme 1. South Flank  ramped up to full production capacity of  80 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa)   (100 per cent basis) on schedule  during FY2024.  We continue to invest in improvements  in our rail and port operations and are  assessing options to grow our WAIO  production up to 330 Mtpa if market  conditions warrant. These options  include optimal mine and infrastructure  configurations and potentially increased  ore beneficiation. We expect to complete  these studies in CY2025. For more information refer to  OFR 5.1 Second consecutive full-year   production record 260 Mt  1% on FY2023 Steelmaking coal Focusing on higher-quality product 22.3 Mt  23% on FY2023 We continue to focus our steelmaking coal  operations in Queensland on higher-quality  product and have one of the lowest GHG  emission production intensities of benchmarked  export steelmaking coal mines.3 In a challenging  year for BMA, production decreased from the  prior year as a result of increased stripping  to improve supply chain stability and restore  depleted inventory positions, which arose from  extended weather impacts and labour constraints  over recent years, and the divestment of  Blackwater and Daunia on 2 April 2024. We believe a wholesale shift away from the  blast furnace process for steelmaking is  decades in the future. We also believe higher- quality steelmaking coals have potential for  greater upside for quality premiums. This is  because we believe steelmakers will seek  to operate their blast furnaces with stronger,  higher-performance steelmaking coal to lower  overall coal consumption and, over time, to  improve blast furnace process performance  when implementing future GHG emission  reduction technologies. On 2 April 2024, BHP and its joint venture  partner, Mitsubishi Development Pty Ltd,  completed the sale of the Blackwater and  Daunia mines to Whitehaven Coal for  up to US$4.1 billion (100 per cent basis).  Following the sale, around 90 per cent of BMA’s  products will be sold by reference to the Platts  PLV HCC FOB Qld index, the highest quality  steelmaking coal index, up from 64 per cent  prior to the transaction.

We do what we say we will do. This has created stability in  our historical performance that has been a hallmark of BHP  for more than a decade. There are many factors that underpin this historic stability, each of which is  vital. It’s the unique combination of these factors that sets us apart.   Our people We have more than 90,000 employees and contractors globally. We strive  to offer an engaging and supportive workplace, which empowers our  people to find safer and more productive ways of working. We do this by  providing the tools and opportunities in our working environment to allow  our people to perform at their best. Our people are empowered daily in  their work by the BHP Operating System. Our Values Our Values set the tone for our culture, a unique part of our  competitive advantage. They are a declaration of what we stand for.  They guide our decision-making, reinforce our culture and ensure all  our people are steering in the same direction, delivering on our purpose.  In FY2024, Our Values were refreshed to:  Do what’s  right Seek better  ways Make a  difference A sustainable future  starts with safety  and integrity, building  trust with those  around us Listening to learn  and inspiring  challenge is how we  drive progress The accountability to  act, create value and  have impact is on  each of us, every day Our Values help our people move quickly and deliberately when we  encounter challenges and opportunities. Health and safety Fatalities  1 FY2023: 2 Total recordable   injury frequency rate1 4.7  5% from CY2023 High-potential injury   frequency rate   36% from FY2023 Workers exposed to our most material   occupational exposures of diesel   particulate matter (DPM), respirable  silica and coal mine dust   Female employee participation 37.1% at the end of FY2024.   1.9 percentage points since the end of FY2023 and on  track to meet our aspirational goal of a gender-balanced employee workforce  globally by the end of CY2025 Indigenous employee participation2 Australia3  8.3% 8.6% at 30 June 2023 Chile4  10.1% 9.7% at 30 June 2023 Canada5  11.2% 7.7% at 30 June 2023 BHP Operating System The BHP Operating System (BOS) is our unique overarching management  system that enables the right culture, routines, behaviours and leadership  to deliver stable operating excellence and leading safety performance.  It provides us with a competitive edge. BOS drives continuous improvement through the application of BOS tools  and practices. It makes improvement central to everyone’s role, allowing  people to work on the system, not just in it.  BOS helps us continuously focus on leadership development, capability and  engagement, and creates better-planned, more stable work processes. Aligning around our strategy, operating philosophy and principles  for decision-making will make us an even better company – one that  focuses on safety, leads the sector, generates strong returns for our  shareholders, and meets the expectations of our partners, communities  and other stakeholders.  We have deployed BOS across our business. How BOS works Three principles underpin BOS and guide how we  think and behave at BHP Our people know their work and how to  improve it – they need to be given the right  conditions to excel. Our ambition is 100% safety for our people,  100% value for our customers, 0% wasted  expense or effort – our efforts for improvement  never stop. We must know who our customer is and  become obsessed with meeting their needs –  delivering exactly what they need, at the right time  and at the appropriate levels of quality and cost. Serve our   customer Pursue operating   perfection Empower   our people Exceptional performance Operating and financial strength  The strength of our portfolio, our operating excellence and financial rigour  from our disciplined application of the Capital Allocation Framework (CAF)  enables us to deliver strong and consistent returns. We achieved net  operating cash flow of US$20.7 billion in FY2024. Our net operating cash  flow has been more than US$15 billion for all but one of the past 15 years.    In FY2024, through our CAF, we kept our balance sheet strong, delivered  growth and returns for our shareholders, made progress towards our social  value and GHG emission reduction objectives and prioritised capital to  maintain reliable operations.   Operational excellence  Our strong results in FY2024 were driven by performance and discipline  at our operations, which overall performed well. We achieved production  guidance across all commodities in FY2024, with steelmaking coal  achieving the upper end of its revised production guidance. This included  record annual production at WAIO, Spence and Carrapateena, record  cathode and gold production at Olympic Dam, and the highest production  in four years at Escondida. Our focus on cost discipline helped us manage inflationary pressures  effectively. We experienced a global inflation rate of around 4 per cent,  particularly in relation to labour. Our cost discipline allowed us to mitigate  these ongoing cost pressures with unit costs around 2.9 per cent higher  across our major assets. We met unit cost guidance at Escondida, WAIO  and Spence, and revised unit cost guidance at BMA. WAIO extended its lead  over competitors as the lowest cost major iron ore producer globally.  For mining companies, cost differentiation is becoming even more  pronounced. General inflation and labour are expected to continue to  put upwards pressure on costs. The costs of decarbonisation are also  expected to be inflationary and will disproportionately impact companies  with higher GHG emissions intensity. As such, while the marginal cost of  mining production is clearly higher than in the past; in the medium term  there are signs it could go higher. Technology and innovation The use of technology and our focus on innovation, together with  BOS, have helped accelerate continuous improvement – from the  introduction of advanced technologies designed to improve safety and  increase productivity of our operated assets, to reducing water and  energy consumption.  1.

They are also helping lift performance through operational improvements.   Examples of how BHP used AI in FY2024 include:  	 – A digital tool at Escondida used AI to increase revenue by  US$18.9 million in FY2024 by enabling drill and blast teams to select  a more optimal blasting pattern design. The technology also helps  to mitigate coarse ore restrictions at Escondida’s semi-autogenous  grinding (SAG) mills by improving post-blasting fragmentation. We will  use this tool at Spence to assist with stabilising its SAG mill performance  and increase its productivity. 	 – Next generation improvements to the Process Area Set Point  Optimisation (PASPO) were rolled out across BMA sites in FY2024 to  increase production of on-specification steelmaking coal, increasing  revenue by US$15.5 million. For example, the Caval Ridge team  identified an opportunity to increase yield by reducing density variation  while keeping train product ash on specification. We upgraded our global technology system 1SAP ERP to S/4HANA in  FY2024. The modernisation of this core global platform is critical to our  operations, as it is used to: 	 – pay our people and suppliers 	 – sell and deliver our products 	 – better maintain our equipment 	 – accurately report our financial results to the market 	 – above all, enable us to operate more safely, efficiently and reliably Social value We are committed to social value and sustainability and are making  progress in more responsibly providing commodities the world needs  to develop and decarbonise. We believe this commitment can help us  become a partner of choice with communities, governments, suppliers  and our customers. We seek to be a valued partner with the communities  where we operate and the Indigenous peoples we interact with.   In FY2024, we continued to refine our approach to social value. We have  provided progress on our 2030 goals through our 2030 social value scorecard.  For more information on our 2030 social value scorecard   refer to OFR 6.5  Through our commitment to sustainability, we seek to reduce the impact of  our operational activities. We have set a long-term goal to achieve net zero  operational GHG emissions (Scopes 1 and 2 emissions from our operated  assets) by CY2050. We also have a long-term goal of net zero Scope 3  GHG emissions by CY2050. Achievement of this Scope 3 goal is uncertain,  particularly given the challenges of a net zero pathway for our customers in  steelmaking, and we cannot ensure the outcome alone. We manage our operational decarbonisation projects across our operated  assets through our CAF to help us use our capital effectively. We are also working with our suppliers and customers to support their  efforts to reduce GHG emissions. For example, during FY2024 we signed  a framework agreement with Rio Tinto and BlueScope to investigate  the development of an ironmaking electric smelting furnace pilot plant  using Pilbara iron ores that have been pre-processed into direct reduced  iron. This process route could open a pathway to an alternative to the  conventional blast furnace method of steelmaking with the potential to  reduce GHG emissions intensity by 85 per cent and meet near zero  emission steelmaking benchmarks.1 For more information on our GHG emission goals and targets  refer to OFR 6.9 We have set goals in areas such as environment and water stewardship.  To meet the FY2024 short-term milestone for the Healthy environment pillar  of our social value scorecard, we have developed a Group-level framework  for nature-positive plans to achieve our 2030 Healthy environment goal  (BHP Healthy environment goal roadmap).2 Our 2030 Healthy environment  goal is to create nature-positive3 outcomes by having at least 30 per cent of  the land and water we steward4 at the end of FY2030 under conservation,  restoration or regenerative practices. At 30 June 2024, we had 83,012 hectares or 1.62 per cent5 of the land and  water we steward4,6 under nature-positive management practices.7 For more information refer to OFR 6.5   Financial excellence  We use our Capital Allocation Framework (CAF) to assess the most effective and efficient way to deploy capital. Since the CAF’s introduction in  FY2016, we have balanced reinvestment in our business with cash returns to shareholders. Our CAF promotes discipline in all capital decisions.

Based on direct reduced iron electric smelting furnace route (using renewable or other low to zero GHG emissions power). Estimated reduction in GHG emissions intensity is calculated  relative to a baseline reference of 2.2 tonnes of CO2-e per tonne of crude steel, as sourced from IEA Iron and Steel Technology Roadmap (October 2020). For more information refer to our  Value chain GHG emissions – Hydrogen reduction and electric smelting of BHP ores case study on page 26 of our Climate Transition Action Plan 2024, available at bhp.com/CTAP2024.   2.	 The BHP Healthy environment goal roadmap is intended to apply to our operated assets in Australia, Chile and Canada. Due to the acquisition of OZ Minerals and prioritisation of  activities based on risks and impacts, Carrapateena, Prominent Hill, West Musgrave and legacy assets are currently out of scope for the roadmap; with the exception of West Musgrave,  these assets are planned to be incorporated into the roadmap in FY2025. Incorporation of West Musgrave into the BHP Healthy environment goal roadmap will be reviewed following the  decision to temporarily suspend the Western Australia Nickel operations. 3.	 Nature-positive is defined by the TNFD Glossary version 1.0 as ‘A high-level goal and concept describing a future state of nature (e.g. biodiversity, ecosystem services and natural  capital), which is greater than the current state’. We understand it includes land and water management practices that halt and reverse nature loss – that is, supporting healthy, functioning  ecosystems. BHP intends to review this definition in FY2025, in light of the recently revised TNFD Glossary version 2.0 (June 2024) definition of nature-positive.  4.	 This excludes areas we hold under greenfield exploration licences (or equivalent tenements), which are outside the area of influence of our existing mine operations. 30 per cent will be  calculated based on the areas of land and water that we steward at the end of FY2030.  5.	 1.62 per cent is calculated based on the areas of land and water that we stewarded (excluding areas we hold under greenfield exploration licences (or equivalent tenements) and subject   to footnote 6) at 30 June 2024 – which was approximately 5,125,935 hectares; an increase of approximately 18,750 hectares compared to approximately 5,107,185 hectares at   30 June 2023. For more information on the restatement of FY023 figures refer to OFR 6.10. 6.	 While some of the land related to the Daunia and Blackwater mines is pending transfer following BMA’s divestment of these mines on 2 April 2024, these areas are no longer under BMA’s  control or operated for BMA’s benefit so have been excluded from the areas of land and water we stewarded at 30 June 2024. 7.	 Nature-positive management practices refer to an area under stewardship that has a formal management plan that includes conservation, restoration or regenerative practices. For more  information refer to the BHP ESG Standards and Databook 2024, available at bhp.com/ESGStandards2024. 13 Overview Additional Information Financial Statements Governance Contents Operating and Financial Review  ===== PAGE 16 ===== 3  Positioning for growth With our clear strategy and our laser-like focus on creating  and sustaining the right portfolio of the best assets in attractive  commodities with enhanced growth optionality, BHP is well  placed to capitalise on the changes shaping our world. As the  global population grows and urbanises and the world pursues  decarbonisation and electrification, we are positioning our  portfolio and pursuing multiple growth options to increase our  exposure to these megatrends.  Unlocking growth at our assets  One of our biggest near-term growth levers is from improving productivity  at our existing assets and unlocking more of their potential. WAIO was designed with an initial capacity of 240 Mtpa. In FY2024 it  produced a record 287 Mt (100 per cent basis). We are implementing  initiatives to grow WAIO production to more than 305 Mtpa over the  medium term. This is expected to be through South Flank, which reached  full production capacity in FY2024, the continued debottlenecking of  our port and rail systems, the rollout of autonomous haulage trucks, and  ongoing productivity enhancements. We are studying options to further  grow annual production up to 330 Mt over the medium to long term, with  these studies expected to be completed in CY2025. Escondida has significant resource potential and we are progressing a  range of studies, including potentially replacing the original Los Colorados  concentrator. We are also looking at different leaching technologies that  could help us extract more copper while potentially using less energy  and water, reduce or eliminate the need for tailings dams, and enable  production of cathode-finished product that does not require smelting. Growing our position in potash Potash is a fertiliser and enables more efficient and sustainable farming.  With the world’s population continuing to grow and rising concerns around  food security and land use, potash is a future-facing commodity that  presents opportunities for growth.  At the end of FY2024, Jansen Stage 1 was tracking ahead of the original  schedule and more than 50 per cent complete. Production is expected  to commence in late CY2026, followed by a two-year ramp-up period.  When Jansen Stage 1 reaches full production, planned production will be  approximately 4.15 Mtpa. During FY2024, BHP approved Jansen Stage 2, which will double  planned production to around 8.5 Mtpa at full capacity. Jansen Stage 2  is an important milestone that underscores our confidence in potash and  marks the next phase of BHP’s growth in Canada. We believe Jansen will  deliver long-term value for shareholders and the local community, and will  position BHP as one of the leaders in the global potash industry. We have  commenced execution of Jansen Stage 2, with first production expected  in FY2029. Copper South Australia: Consolidating a significant  resource base We have established a significant resource base at Copper South Australia   by combining OZ Minerals’ two South Australian mines, Prominent Hill and  Carrapateena, with Olympic Dam and the Oak Dam deposit. With Copper South Australia, we are focused on developing an asset  with greater scale and simplicity. Copper South Australia produced 322 kt  of copper in FY2024 and we are pursuing potential pathways to expand  this to more than 500 kilotonnes per annum (ktpa) through increases in  mine production rates and improved mining methods, the expansion of  smelting and refining capacity, the application of BOS, the development of  exploration assets and greater by-product production.   Exploration efforts progressed at the Oak Dam copper deposit located  65 kilometres southeast of Olympic Dam and at OD Deeps, which is  below Olympic Dam. The Copper South Australia province is expected to  produce copper, gold and uranium oxide for decades to come. For more information refer to OFR 5.2 Creating and accelerating longer-term options BHP Ventures   BHP Ventures is our dedicated venture capital unit. It looks for game- changing technologies via emerging companies to help drive ongoing and  more sustainable growth within BHP and provides us with a portfolio of  new growth options for the decades ahead.  BHP Ventures complements the innovation already underway within BHP  by forging new partnerships and creating fresh opportunities to strengthen  our portfolio and support the decarbonisation of our operated assets and  decarbonisation opportunities in our value chain.  For our partners, BHP Ventures provides an opportunity to collaborate  with us.  New investments in FY2024 included SiTration, which is developing a  silicon membrane-based technology for metal extraction, and ZwitterCo,  which is developing membrane solutions for the treatment of water.  BHP continued to support existing portfolio companies Boston Metal and  Electra through technical knowledge exchanges and the supply of iron ores  for testing in relation to technologies that have potential to contribute to our  Scope 3 emissions medium-term goal for steelmaking and our long-term  net zero goal. BHP also continued to test early-stage leaching technologies  from Jetti Resources and Ceibo as part of broader copper leaching studies.  Think & Act Differently Think & Act Differently is BHP’s internal team set up to find and accelerate  the best mining technology solutions to support our ambitions to deliver  commodities the world needs in new ways. It is focused on opening  new and accelerated pathways to market through partnerships, rapid  experimentation and systems thinking. It aims to de-risk a portfolio of over  100 initiatives, from small scale experiments to on-site demonstrations.    We are seeking to advance technologies that can unlock resource growth,  particularly relating to copper, and build capability across the mining value  chain to find new ways to understand ore bodies and responsibly extract  and process resources. Current areas of work include leaching, ore body  knowledge and accelerated minerals recovery.  BHP Exploration During FY2024, we advanced our global programs focusing on   early-stage exploration opportunities in Australia, Canada, Chile,   Peru, Sweden, Serbia and the United States. This effort involved concept  evaluation work through prospect testing.    We fully integrated the OZ Minerals exploration portfolio, significantly  expanding our land holdings and enabling us to develop an important  province in South Australia with significant copper potential.  In Canada, we continued our partnership with Midland Exploration Inc.  through our prospect generation exploration alliance. In the United States, we entered an alliance with Ivanhoe Electric Inc., with  BHP to provide initial funding of US$15 million over three years to explore  for copper and other critical minerals across areas of interest in Arizona,  New Mexico and Utah. In Australia, we commenced a partnership with Red Ox Copper Pty Ltd,  exploring for copper in Northern Queensland. In Europe, we acquired Ragnar Metals Sweden AB for A$9.8 million,  gaining ownership of the Tullsta nickel project. Similarly, we entered into  early-stage exploration alliances with Kingsrose Mining Ltd across areas of  interest in Finland and Norway, and with Tutume Metals in Botswana.  Also in FY2024, we withdrew from the Elliott Farm-in and joint venture  agreement with Encounter Resources Limited in Australia. 14 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 17 ===== Growth through exploration, focused on copper and nickel BHP Xplor BHP Xplor, launched in FY2023, is a global accelerator program designed to support early-stage mineral exploration companies in finding critical resources  needed for the energy transition. Its aim is to identify and nurture the next generation of explorers, empowering them to fast track their geologic concepts for  potential long-term partnership. The program supports technical, business and operational facets to equip participant companies with the necessary tools  and guidance to become investment ready. To date, agreements have been concluded with three companies from the inaugural FY2023 cohort for follow-on investment, due to their region of interest,  potential technical opportunity, team capability and strategic alignment. In FY2024, six companies were chosen from a pool of over 500 applications to take  part in this year’s program.

WAIO has been the lowest cost  iron ore producer globally for over four years now and this year further  extended its lead. This exceptional cost performance allows the business  to generate strong cash flows. We invested US$1.2 billion sustaining  capital to support our medium-term goal of producing >305 Mtpa, and  we are assessing options to grow production up to 330 Mtpa if market  conditions warrant.  In potash, we approved an investment of US$4.9 billion for Jansen Stage 2,  which when combined with Jansen Stage 1, will increase our total planned  potash production capacity to ~8.5 Mtpa, representing ~10 per cent of the  estimated market when fully ramped up. Jansen Stage 1 is progressing  well, and is over 50 per cent complete.  During the year we recognised a US$2.7 billion impairment of our Western  Australia Nickel operations and a US$3.8 billion charge related to the  Samarco dam failure. These exceptional items were partially offset by a  US$0.7 bn (post-tax) gain on disposal of the Blackwater and Daunia mines. Ensuring shareholders continue to benefit from our consistent and reliable  performance, we’ve announced a final dividend of 74 US cents per share.  Together with the shareholder dividend for the first half of 72 US cents  per share, the total cash dividend to shareholders for FY2024 will be  US$7.4 billion, which represents a 54 per cent payout ratio. Looking forward, we expect to increase our capital and exploration  expenditure as we unlock productivity, decarbonise our assets, and  deliver growth in future-facing commodities. We expect to spend around  US$10 billion on capital and exploration in FY2025. The majority of this  will be directed to improvement and growth, as we progress Jansen, our  Chilean and South Australia copper assets and growth in the Pilbara.  We have a disciplined approach to capital allocation, which ensures we  invest for value. Our resilient balance sheet and the financial discipline  embedded through our CAF, provide us the financial strength and the  flexibility to fund our growth and deliver healthy returns to shareholders. We continue to deliver value for all our stakeholders. BHP’s total direct  economic contribution in FY2024 was US$49.2 billion. This includes  payments to suppliers, wages and benefits for more than 90,000  employees and contractors, dividends, taxes, royalties and voluntary  investment in social projects across the communities where we operate. In FY2024, our tax, royalty and other payments to governments totaled  US$11.2 billion. During the last decade, we paid US$95.1 billion  globally in taxes, royalties and other payments, including approximately  A$107.1 billion in Australia. Our global adjusted effective tax rate in FY2024  was 32.5 per cent. Once royalties are included, our FY2024 rate increases  to 41.7 per cent. We are proud of our financial and operational performance and the  value we have continued to generate for our shareholders, partners and  other stakeholders.  Thank you for your continued support.   Vandita Pant  Chief Financial Officer Dear Shareholders, I am pleased to report on BHP’s FY2024 financial results. Firstly, I want to say that it is a privilege and an honour to have been  appointed your Chief Financial Officer in March, and to continue the great  work of my predecessor David Lamont. Having been with BHP for more  than eight years, as Chief Commercial Officer and before that as Group  Treasurer and Head of Europe, it’s unquestionably clear to me that our  incredible assets, winning strategy, Capital Allocation Framework (CAF)  and superior operational capability truly set BHP apart from its competitors.  BHP delivered another strong set of results in FY2024, enabled by  the continued disciplined execution of our strategy. Our underlying  attributable profit was 2 per cent higher at US$13.7 billion due to solid  operational performance and higher commodity prices in key commodities.  Underlying EBITDA increased by 4 per cent to US$29 billion and  underlying EBITDA margin remained at 54 per cent, the eighth consecutive  year we have achieved a margin greater than 50 per cent – significantly  ahead of our nearest competitors. Our return on capital employed, at  27 per cent, was also very strong.  We performed well in areas within our control. Production volumes were  in line with last year, and our operational excellence, productivity initiatives  and cost discipline allowed us to mitigate the effects of inflation. While we  experienced a global inflation rate of 4 per cent, predominantly driven by  higher labour costs, unit costs across our major assets increased less  than 3 per cent, and we met our original unit cost guidance for all assets  except BMA. This year we generated more than US$20 billion of net operating cash  flows which allowed us to reduce net debt to US$9.1 billion, invest in our  business and maintain healthy returns to shareholders. We have consistently  delivered a high baseline of cash flow, having generated net operating  cash flows above US$15 billion for all but one of the past 15 years. We’ve  achieved this due to the quality of our portfolio and our focus on operational  excellence and cost discipline – despite market and operating conditions  varying greatly over these years. This stability is a hallmark of BHP.  We invested US$9.3 billion in line with our CAF. This included  US$5.9 billion in organic development, of which ~US$2.7 billion  was on copper projects and ~US$1.1 billion at Jansen, together with  ~US$0.5 billion of exploration spend primarily at Copper South Australia;  and US$3.0 billion of maintenance and decarbonisation expenditure. In copper, we delivered a second consecutive year of 9 per cent production  growth, and expect to deliver a further 4 per cent increase in FY2025.  During the year we narrowed 20 project studies across Chile to four main  pathways across existing and new facilities. At Spence, concentrator plant  modifications were completed and are delivering expected improvements  in throughput and recovery. In Copper South Australia, the successful  integration of Prominent Hill and Carrapateena has resulted in us exceeding  the annualised synergies planned for FY2024 at the time of the OZ  Minerals acquisition, and we are executing a number of exciting growth and  exploration projects.

Underlying attributable profit allows  the comparability of underlying  financial performance by excluding  the impacts of exceptional items.  Underlying EBITDA is used to  help assess current operational  profitability excluding the impacts  of sunk costs (i.e. depreciation from  initial investment). It is a measure  that management uses internally  to assess the performance of  the Group’s segments and make  decisions on the allocation of  resources.  Net operating cash flows  provide insights into how we are  managing costs and increasing  productivity across BHP. Underlying return on capital employed is an  indicator of the Group’s capital efficiency. It  is provided on an underlying basis to allow  comparability of underlying financial performance  by excluding the impacts of exceptional items.  4.3 Financial results The following table provides more information on the revenue and expenses of the Group in FY2024.

Attributable profit  of US$7.9 billion includes an exceptional loss of US$5.8 billion (after  tax), compared to an Attributable profit of US$12.9 billion, including  an exceptional loss of US$0.5 billion (after tax) in the prior period.  The FY2024 exceptional loss includes a US$2.7 billion non-cash (after tax)  impairment at Western Australia Nickel (WAN) due to oversupply in the  global nickel market that has seen a sharp decline in forward nickel prices  in the short to medium term, escalation in capital costs, and changes to  development plans including the Group’s decision, announced on 11 July  2024, to temporarily suspend Nickel West operations and the West  Musgrave project at WAN. The FY2024 exceptional loss also includes  US$3.8 billion (after tax) relating to Samarco dam failure impacts, partially  offset by the gain on divestment of Blackwater and Daunia coal assets of  US$0.7 billion (after tax).  For more information on Exceptional items refer to  Financial Statements note 3 ‘Exceptional items’  Revenue of US$55.7 billion increased by US$1.8 billion, or 3 per cent from  FY2023. This increase was mainly due to higher average realised prices for  iron ore and copper combined with higher sales volumes, partially offset by  lower average realised prices for thermal coal and nickel. Higher sales volumes were achieved at WAIO supported by record  production reflecting strong supply chain performance, at Copper SA from  the successful integration of OZ Minerals (OZL) following the acquisition in  FY2023, at Escondida due to higher concentrator feed grade and at New  South Wales Energy Coal (NSWEC) from improved weather and labour  availability. These were partially offset by lower sales volumes at BMA as  a result of increased stripping to improve supply chain stability and restore  depleted inventory positions which arose from extended weather impacts  and labour constraints over recent years, and the divestment of Blackwater  and Daunia on 2 April 2024. For information on our average realised prices   and production of our commodities refer to OFR 9   Other income of US$1.3 billion increased by US$0.9 billion, or 226 per cent  from FY2023 primarily due to the divestment of Blackwater and Daunia. Total expenses excluding net finance costs of US$36.8 billion  increased by US$4.9 billion, or 15 per cent from FY2023. This primarily  reflected a higher impairment expense of US$3.8 billion of WAN due  to the deterioration in the short and medium-term outlook for nickel.  Higher external contractor services expenses of US$1.0 billion was mainly  due to the full-year contribution of Prominent Hill and Carrapateena  since their acquisition in FY2023, impacts of inflation across the Group,  additional tailings work at Spence, higher maintenance at Escondida  and higher stripping and contractor costs in line with higher volumes  at NSWEC. Loss from equity accounted investments, related impairments and expenses  of US$2.7 billion increased by US$3.3 billion from a profit of US$0.6 billion  in FY2023 predominantly reflects the change in the assessment of the  estimated costs to resolve all aspects of the Federal Public Prosecution  Office Claim and the Framework Agreement obligations. For more information on the total impact of the Samarco dam failure  provision and impairment charges connected with equity accounted  investments refer to Financial Statements note 3 ‘Exceptional items’  and Financial Statements note 13 ‘Impairment of non-current  assets’ respectively         Net finance costs of US$1.5 billion were in line with FY2023 primarily  driven by higher market interest rates, offset by a reduction in closure and  rehabilitation provision discounting due to lower global inflation rates and  higher capitalised interest mainly at Potash.   For more information on net finance costs refer to  Financial Statements note 23 ‘Net finance costs’   Total taxation expense of US$6.4 billion decreased by US$0.6 billion, or  9 per cent from FY2023 primarily due to a tax benefit of US$1.1 billion in  relation to the impairment of WAN partially offset by higher tax in line with  higher profits from higher average realised prices. For more information on income tax expense refer to  Financial Statements note 6 ‘Income tax expense’  Principal factors that affect Underlying EBITDA The following table and commentary describe the impact of the principal factors¹ that affected Underlying EBITDA for FY2024 compared with FY2023. US$M Year ended 30 June 2023 27,956 Net price impact:    Change in sales prices 1,476 Higher average realised prices for iron ore and copper partially offset by lower average realised prices for  thermal coal and nickel.    Price-linked costs   108 Lower coal and nickel royalties largely offset by higher iron ore royalties in line with price movements. 1,584 Change in volumes 10 Higher sales volumes were achieved at WAIO supported by record production reflecting strong supply  chain performance including record production at South Flank following ramp up to full capacity in FY2024,  at Escondida due to higher concentrator feed grade and at NSWEC from improved weather and labour  availability. These were offset by lower sales volumes at BMA as a result of increased stripping to improve  supply chain stability and restore depleted inventory positions, which arose from extended weather impacts  and labour constraints over recent years.  Change in controllable cash costs    Operating cash costs (655) Higher costs at WAIO primarily as we ramped up South Flank and increased production, at NSWEC from  higher stripping and contractor costs to support higher production, at Escondida reflecting higher maintenance  and at WAN due to increased third-party ore purchases following delivery issues in FY2023.    Exploration and business development (118) Higher exploration spend for drilling activities at Oak Dam at Copper SA. (773) Change in other costs:    Exchange rates 253 Impact of movements in the Australian dollar and Chilean peso against the US dollar.    Inflation  (686) Impact of inflation on the Group’s cost base.    Fuel, energy, and consumable  price movements 487 Predominantly lower diesel and acid prices.    Non-cash  (301)    One-off items 316 Primarily non recurrence of FY2023 review of employee allowances and entitlements, and OZL acquisition costs. 69 Ceased and sold operations (510) Lower contribution from the Blackwater and Daunia mines related to divestment in April 2024. New and acquired operations 528 At Copper SA from the successful integration of OZL following the acquisition in FY2023. Other items  152 Includes increased profit from Antamina driven by higher average copper realised prices and VAT refund  received in relation to previously divested Petroleum operations.

Year ended 30 June 2024 US$M 2023 US$M 2022 US$M Net operating cash flows from Continuing operations 20,665 18,701 29,285 Net operating cash flows from Discontinued operations  –  – 2,889 Net operating cash flows 20,665 18,701 32,174 Net investing cash flows from Continuing operations (8,762) (13,065) (4,973) Net investing cash flows from Discontinued operations  –  – (904) Net cash completion payment on merger of Petroleum with Woodside  –  – (683) Cash and cash equivalents disposed on merger of Petroleum with Woodside  –  – (399) Net investing cash flows (8,762) (13,065) (6,959) Net financing cash flows from Continuing operations (11,669) (10,315) (22,734) Net financing cash flows from Discontinued operations  –  – (33) Net financing cash flows (11,669) (10,315) (22,767) Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 234 (4,679) 2,448 Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents from Continuing operations 234 (4,679) 1,578 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents from Discontinued operations  –  – 1,952 Net cash completion payment on merger of Petroleum with Woodside  –  – (683) Cash and cash equivalents disposed on merger of Petroleum with Woodside  –  – (399) Net operating cash inflows from Continuing operations of US$20.7 billion increased by US$2.0 billion. This is primarily due to lower tax and royalty  related taxation finalisation payments in FY2024 relating to FY2023 profits, compared to payments in FY2023 relating to FY2022 profits.  Net investing cash outflows from Continuing operations of US$8.8 billion decreased by US$4.3 billion. This decrease primarily reflects the non- recurrence of the US$5.9 billion acquisition of OZL completed in FY2023 in conjunction with the proceeds received in FY2024 related to the divestment  of BHP’s interest in Blackwater and Daunia coal operations to Whitehaven Coal of US$1.1 billion, partially offset by higher capital expenditure of  US$2.1 billion including for Jansen and West Musgrave. For more information on exceptional items relating to the divestment of Blackwater and Daunia and a breakdown of capital and exploration expenditure   on a commodity basis refer to Financial Statements note 3 ‘Exceptional items’ and OFR 9 respectively   Net financing cash outflows from Continuing operations of US$11.7 billion increased by US$1.4 billion. This increase reflects a net movement in  repayments/proceeds of interest bearing liabilities of US$7.1 billion mainly due to the repayment of the OZL acquisition facility in FY2024 (US$5.0 billion)  and higher other bond issuances compared to FY2023. These were partially offset by lower dividends paid to BHP shareholders of US$5.6 billion.  For more information refer to Financial Statements note 21 ‘Net debt’ Underlying return on capital employed (ROCE) of 27.2 per cent decreased by 1.6 percentage points (FY2023: 19.9 percentage point decrease)  reflecting an increase in average capital employed attributable to the impact of the OZL acquisition in FY2023. Reductions in capital employed related to  the impairment of WAN and the divestment of Blackwater and Daunia are largely offset by capital expenditure in the period.      For more information on ROCE refer to OFR 10  4.4 Debt and sources of liquidity Our policies on debt and liquidity management have the following objectives: 	 – a strong balance sheet through the cycle 	 – diversification of funding sources 	 – maintain borrowings and excess cash predominantly in US dollars Interest bearing liabilities, net debt and gearing At the end of FY2024, Interest bearing liabilities were US$20.7 billion (FY2023: US$22.3 billion) and Cash and cash equivalents were US$12.5 billion  (FY2023: US$12.4 billion). This resulted in Net debt of US$9.1 billion, which represented a decrease of US$2.0 billion compared with the Net debt  position at 30 June 2023. The reduction is primarily due to US$20.7 billion operating cash flows generated combined with US$1.1 billion proceeds from  the divestment of the Blackwater and Daunia mines, which were partially offset by capital and exploration expenditure of US$9.3 billion and dividend  payments of US$9.1 billion. Gearing, which is the ratio of Net debt to Net debt plus Net assets, was 15.7 per cent at 30 June 2024, compared with  18.7 per cent at 30 June 2023. For more information on Net debt and gearing refer to Financial Statements note 21 ‘Net debt’ and OFR 10 During FY2024, gross debt decreased by US$1.6 billion to US$20.7 billion as at 30 June 2024. The decrease reflects the repayment of the US$5.0 billion  OZL acquisition facility in September 2023 combined with the repayment of US$734 million of 3.85 per cent USD senior notes that matured in September  2023 and €560 million of EUR senior notes that matured in May 2024, largely offset by the issuance of US$4.75 billion of US bonds in September 2023. At the subsidiary level, Escondida repaid US$0.3 billion of debt and received proceeds from debt of US$0.4 billion in the period. 20 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 23 ===== Funding sources In September 2023, the Group issued five tranches of USD bonds comprising US$850 million 5.25 per cent bonds due CY2026, US$700 million   5.1 per cent bonds due CY2028, US$900 million 5.25 per cent bonds due CY2030, US$1.5 billion 5.25 per cent bonds due CY2033 and US$800 million   5.5 per cent bonds due CY2053.

In addition to the Group’s uncommitted debt issuance programs, we hold the following committed standby facility: Facility available 2024 US$M Drawn 2024 US$M Undrawn 2024 US$M Facility available 2023 US$M Drawn 2023 US$M Undrawn 2023 US$M Revolving credit facility1 5,500 – 5,500 5,500 – 5,500 Total financing facility 5,500 – 5,500 5,500 – 5,500 1.	 The facility is due to mature on 10 October 2026. The committed US$5.5 billion revolving credit facility operates as a back-stop to the Group’s uncommitted commercial paper program.  The combined amount drawn under the facility or as commercial paper will not exceed US$5.5 billion. As at 30 June 2024, US$ nil commercial paper was drawn (FY2023: US$ nil),  therefore US$5.5 billion of committed facility was available to use (FY2023: US$5.5 billion). A commitment fee is payable on the undrawn balance and interest is payable on any drawn  balance comprising a reference rate plus a margin. The agreed margins are typical for a credit facility extended to a company with the Group’s credit rating.

The commodities produced by our Minerals Australia assets are  transported by rail and road to port and exported to our global customers or by rail to domestic customers. 5  Our assets Western Australia Iron Ore Overview Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO) is an integrated system of four  processing hubs and five open-cut operational mines in the Pilbara region  of northern Western Australia, connected by more than 1,000 kilometres of  rail infrastructure and port facilities. WAIO’s Pilbara reserve base is relatively concentrated, allowing  development through integrated mining hubs connected to the mines and  satellite orebodies by conveyors or spur lines. This approach seeks to  maximise the value of installed infrastructure by using the same processing  plant and rail infrastructure for several orebodies. Ore is crushed, beneficiated (where necessary) and blended at the  processing hubs – Mt Newman operations (which has our beneficiation  plant), Yandi, Mining Area C (our largest operating iron ore hub processing  ore from Area C and South Flank) and Jimblebar – to create lump and fines  products that are transported along the Port Hedland–Mt Newman rail line  to the Finucane Island and Nelson Point port facilities at Port Hedland. There are four main WAIO joint ventures (JVs): Mt Newman JV, Yandi JV,  Mt Goldsworthy JV (which includes the South Flank mining area) and  Jimblebar JV. BHP’s interest in each is 85 per cent, with Mitsui and  ITOCHU owning the remaining 15 per cent. The joint ventures are  unincorporated, except Jimblebar JV. BHP, along with Mitsui, ITOCHU and POSCO are also participants in the  POSMAC JV. BHP’s interest in POSMAC is 65 per cent. The ore from the  POSMAC JV is sold to the Mt Goldsworthy JV. All ore is transported on the Mt Newman JV and Mt Goldsworthy JV  rail lines. The Nelson Point port facility is owned by the Mt Newman JV  and the Finucane Island facility is owned by the Mt Goldsworthy JV.  On 7 September 2021, BHP received regulatory approval to increase  our export capacity at WAIO’s Port Hedland operations, in stages, up to  330 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) (100 per cent basis). We are currently  studying expansion alternatives for growth up to 330 Mtpa with the  feasibility study expected to be completed in CY2025. Our near-term focus remains on stable production of 290 Mtpa of iron ore.  Successful tie-in of capital projects, including the port debottlenecking  project, is expected to enable growth in excess of 305 Mtpa in the  medium term. Key developments in FY2024 WAIO achieved record production of 255 million tonnes (Mt) (253 Mt  FY2023) or 287 Mt (285 Mt FY2023) on a 100 per cent basis, reflecting  strong supply chain performance with increased capacity unlocked by the  Port Debottlenecking Project 1 and increased production at South Flank.  South Flank completed ramp up to full production capacity of 80 Mtpa  (100 per cent basis) in FY2024 as planned, which contributed to WAIO  achieving record lump sales for the year. Autonomous haulage deployment continues as planned. The Shiploader Automation Project has continued to progress with the  automation completed on two shiploaders and the third shiploader nearing  completion. Together with autonomous haulage rollouts at South Flank and  Newman West, these initiatives are expected to deliver safety, production  and cost improvements as well as new job and development opportunities.  The Port Debottlenecking Project 1 was commissioned in December 2023  and has enabled higher production volumes and contributed to record  sales volumes in FY2024. The project remains on track to be completed  in CY2024. In February 2024, BHP approved US$943 million in capital expenditure  for the development of the Western Ridge Crusher Project. This project  is expected to deliver an average of 25 Mtpa providing around 12 years  of product for WAIO to replace part of the production from depleting  orebodies around Newman. First ore is targeted in CY2026.   Iron ore In FY2024, WAIO achieved record spend with Traditional Owners and  Indigenous businesses representing a 69 per cent increase on the  previous year to A$465 million of which A$237 million was spent with  68 Traditional Owner businesses.

BMA’s mines are open cut, except for the Broadmeadow underground  longwall operation. BMA has access to infrastructure, including a modern,  multi‑user rail network, and owns and operates its own coal-loading  terminal at Hay Point, near Mackay.  Key developments in FY2024 BMA production of 22.3 Mt (44.6 Mt on a 100 per cent basis) decreased  from the prior year as a result of increased stripping to improve supply  chain stability and restore depleted inventory positions, which arose from  extended weather impacts and labour constraints over recent years, and  the divestment of Blackwater and Daunia on 2 April 2024. Production was  also impacted by an extended longwall move and geotechnical faulting  at Broadmeadow during H1 FY2024, and the temporary suspension  of operations following the fatality of a team member at Saraji.  Blackwater and Daunia produced 5 Mt (10 Mt on a 100 per cent basis)  in FY2024 prior to their divestment. In April 2024, BMA’s owners, BHP and Mitsubishi Development, divested  the Daunia and Blackwater mines to Whitehaven Coal, an ASX-listed  company. Whitehaven Coal paid a combined US$2.0 billion cash  consideration on completion plus a preliminary completion adjustment  of US$44.1 million for working capital and other agreed adjustments  (100 per cent interest basis). The total consideration for the transaction  includes earnout and adjustments and may be up to US$4.1 billion plus  the final completion adjustment amount. Goonyella continued to safely increase autonomous productivity and  ultra-class truck fleet performance in FY2024 – delivering an annualised  production hours increase of 7 per cent, contributing to a 6 per cent  increase in truck and shovel stripping volumes at Goonyella Riverside, as  we’ve continued to adapt and unlock the efficiencies of the system.  In October 2023, BMA successfully commissioned a replacement berth  structure and shiploader at Hay Point Coal Terminal resulting in improved  resilience for significant weather and major cyclone events and enabling  the port’s future and long-term capability. BMA operations largely lie within the Native Title Determination area  of the Barada Barna people. BMA has been working closely with the  Barada Barna Aboriginal Corporation (BBAC) to negotiate a project‑wide  Indigenous Land Use Agreement. The agreement was approved and  signed by BBAC and BMA and is expected to be approved by the  Queensland Government in early FY2025. This agreement demonstrates  a refreshed approach to agreement structures and establishes a process  to obtain and maintain Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) across  the life of the operation. It provides a fit-for-purpose benefits package  intended to provide intergenerational benefit for Barada Barna people  through financial compensation, provision of housing, as well as in the  areas of employment, education and contracting opportunities.   Coal Collinsville Mackay Bowen BMA Hay Point  Coal Terminal Peak Downs Dysart Saraji Moranbah Broadmeadow Goonyella Riverside Caval Ridge Queensland, Australia BMA Mine Rail BMA Terminal BHP Mitsubishi  Alliance (BMA) 23 Overview Additional Information Financial Statements Governance Contents Operating and Financial Review  ===== PAGE 26 ===== 5 Our assets continued Western Australia Nickel Overview  Nickel West (BHP ownership: 100 per cent) is a fully integrated nickel  business located in Western Australia, with three streams of concentrate.  It comprises open-cut and underground mines, concentrators, a smelter  and refinery. Nickel West owns the majority of tenements hosting Nickel  Sulphide Mineral Resources in the Agnew-Wiluna belt, Western Australia. Disseminated sulphide ore is mined at the Mt Keith open-pit operation and  Mt Keith Satellite mine (Yakabindie) and crushed and processed on-site  to produce nickel concentrate. Nickel sulphide ore is mined at the Cliffs  and Leinster underground mines and processed through a concentrator  and dryer at Leinster. A concentrator plant in Kambalda processes ore and  concentrate purchased from third parties. The three streams feed the Kalgoorlie nickel smelter, which uses a flash  furnace to produce nickel matte. The Kwinana nickel refinery then turns  this into nickel powder, briquettes and nickel sulphate. The West Musgrave Project (BHP ownership: 100 per cent; acquired as  part of OZ Minerals) is a greenfield nickel and copper project located on  Ngaanyatjarra Country in the West Musgrave Ranges of Western Australia,  approximately 1,300 kilometres northeast of Perth and 1,400 kilometres  northwest of Adelaide, near the intersection of the borders of Western  Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory. Key developments in FY2024 On 11 July 2024, BHP announced Western Australia Nickel would  be temporarily suspended from October 2024. We intend to review  the decision to temporarily suspend Western Australia Nickel by  February 2027. The decision to temporarily suspend Western Australia Nickel follows  oversupply in the global nickel market. Forward consensus nickel prices  over the next half of the decade have fallen sharply reflecting strong growth  of alternative low-cost nickel supply.   Nickel Mt Keith West  Musgrave  Cliffs Leinster Mt Keith Satellite  (Yakabindie)  Albany Ravensthorpe Kambalda  Concentrator Newman Fremantle Geraldton Perth Kwinana Refinery Kalgoorlie Smelter Western  Australia Nickel West Port Highway Western Australia   Nickel New South Wales Energy Coal Overview  New South Wales Energy Coal (NSWEC) (BHP ownership: 100 per cent)  comprises the Mt Arthur Coal open-cut energy coal mine in the Hunter  Valley. It has access to infrastructure in the Hunter Region, including a  multi-user rail network and coal loading terminal access at the Port of  Newcastle through Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group (BHP ownership:  28 per cent) and Port Waratah Coal Services. On 16 June 2022, we announced we would retain NSWEC in our portfolio,  seek the relevant approvals to continue mining beyond the current consent  that expires at the end of FY2026 and proceed with a managed process to  cease mining at the asset by the end of FY2030. Continuation of mining to  the end of FY2030 is intended to provide the time to work with our people  and the local community on an equitable change and transition approach  as well as the time to plan and execute the necessary works to deliver a  positive legacy from BHP mining in the Hunter Valley. Key developments in FY2024 Production increased due to strong operating performance across the year  as improved weather and labour availability conditions enabled an uplift in  truck productivity and record annualised truck hours. We also supported  regional coal-fired power stations by delivering 1.3 Mt in line with New  South Wales Government Coal Directions (Directions). The Directions  ceased on 1 July 2024, with the change in royalty rates for open-cut mines  increasing 2.6 percentage points, from 8.2 per cent to 10.8 per cent.  In FY2024, we renegotiated a contract with Thiess Mining Services for six  years to provide contract mining services at the Mt Arthur South Operation. The application to continue mining for an additional four years from  FY2026 to FY2030 was lodged with the New South Wales Government in  September 2023 and is currently under assessment, with a determination  expected in the first half of CY2025. BHP will invest approximately US$300 million (A$450 million) per annum  following completion of a transition period to support a potential re-start  of Western Australia Nickel. The transition period commenced in July  2024. Operations will be suspended in October 2024 and handover  activities for temporary suspension will be completed by December 2024.  We will continue to support our workforce and local communities during  the temporary suspension, including the establishment of a A$20 million  Community Fund. We continue to progress plans to cease mining at the asset in FY2030,  which includes the completion of progressive rehabilitation commitments  during FY2024. We undertook significant engagement with our workforce  and community in FY2024 as we worked to consider alternate mine land  re-use outcomes for the site.

It comprises underground mining and surface operations and is a fully  integrated processing facility from ore to metal. Ore mined underground via sub-level open stoping is hauled by an  automated train system to crushing, storage and ore hoisting facilities or  trucked directly to the surface. Olympic Dam has a fully integrated metallurgical complex with a grinding  and concentrating circuit, a hydrometallurgical plant incorporating solvent  extraction circuits for copper and uranium, a copper smelter, a copper  refinery, including an electro-refinery and an electrowinning-refinery,   and a recovery circuit for precious metals. Carrapateena (BHP ownership: 100 per cent; acquired as part of  OZ Minerals) is an underground copper, gold and silver mine located on  Kokatha Country in the Gawler Craton, South Australia, approximately   180 kilometres by road southeast of Olympic Dam and 160 kilometres  north of Port Augusta. Underground mining at Carrapateena is by  sub‑level caving. Conventional crushing, grinding and flotation produces  copper concentrate.  Prominent Hill (BHP ownership: 100 per cent; acquired as part of  OZ Minerals) is an underground copper, gold and silver mine located  on Antakirinja Matu-Yankunytjatjara Country in the Gawler Craton, South  Australia, 200 kilometres northwest of Olympic Dam. Prominent Hill  was first developed as an open-pit mine, however, mining activities  have progressed underground via sub-level open stoping since 2012.  Conventional crushing, grinding and flotation produce copper concentrate.  The Oak Dam Project (BHP ownership: 100 per cent) is a greenfield  copper, gold, silver and uranium deposit located on Kokatha Country in the  Gawler Craton, South Australia. Key developments in FY2024 Copper South Australia achieved production of 322 kilotonnes (kt) of  payable copper, gold production of 370 thousand troy ounces (ktoz) and  3.6 kt of uranium.   Olympic Dam achieved a record cathode production outcome under  BHP operatorship of 216 kt, primarily driven by record mine and smelter  performance. Record ore mined was achieved at 10.8 Mt (10.6 Mt FY2014)  and record concentrate smelted was achieved at 508.9 kt (507.9 kt  FY2023). Strong smelter performance at Olympic Dam was supported by  12.6 kt of concentrate transfers from Prominent Hill and Carrapateena, for  processing to higher margin cathode. Record gold bullion production was  also delivered in FY2024 at 207 ktoz (186 ktoz FY2023).  The Olympic Dam underground mine continues to develop further into the  Southern Mine Area, with approximately 70 per cent of total ore production  currently from this part of the mine. Average copper grade remained  strong at 2.01 per cent. The short-term focus is on optimising operational  performance and debottlenecking existing facilities to further improve  production performance.   Copper 5.2 Copper South Australia Copper South Australia comprises surface processing and underground mining operations in one of the world’s most  significant copper, gold, silver and uranium basins. Copper South Australia was formed following our acquisition of OZ  Minerals in May 2023 and refers to Olympic Dam, and Carrapateena and Prominent Hill operations, which were acquired  from OZ minerals, and the Oak Dam exploration project. The underground mining and conventional crushing operations of  Carrapateena and Prominent Hill produce copper concentrate and are located in close proximity to the mining and integrated  crushing, grinding, concentrating, smelting and refining operations of Olympic Dam, which produces copper cathode, gold  and silver bullion, and uranium oxide concentrate. The commodities produced by Copper South Australia are transported by  road and rail to our domestic customers and via the Adelaide and Whyalla ports to be exported to our global customers. Resource drilling at Oak Dam continued, with up to 12 deep directional  diamond drill rigs on the exploration licence, informing an Inferred Mineral  Resource declaration. Drilling at OD Deeps in FY2024 was executed  through up to 11 diamond rigs that explored beneath the Iron Oxide Copper  Gold (IOCG) orebody at Olympic Dam. Results from this drilling were  released as part of the Q2 FY2024 BHP Operational Review. Carrapateena achieved a record production outcome of 68 kt of payable  copper production (60 kt in FY2023). Crusher Station 2 was successfully  commissioned in Q3 FY2024 enabling higher productivity from the  sub‑level cave and record ore mined of 5.2 Mt in FY2024 (4.6 Mt FY2023)  enabled milling throughput to increase to record rates of 5.2 Mt (4.7 Mt in  FY2023). The bottom half of the Carrapateena orebody is being developed  into a block cave, with the aim of unlocking the mine’s potential to be a  multigenerational, low quartile cash cost producing operation and progress  continued in FY2024 with the development of the decline below the current  sub-level cave. In FY2024, Prominent Hill produced 50 kt of payable copper (54 kt in  FY2023). Record ore to surface production was achieved at 4.5 Mt  (4.4 Mt in FY2023) as development of the underground mine progresses,  supported by record underground development of 17.2 kilometres  (14.7 kilometres in FY2023). The Prominent Hill Operations Expansion  to extend mine life and increase copper production continues works  to construct and commission the 6.5 Mtpa ore capacity Wira Shaft.  Shaft works advanced and the shaft sink is approximately 35 per cent  complete at a current depth of approximately 450 metres. A funding agreement with the South Australian Government was  signed in Q3 FY2024 for a study on the Northern Water Supply Project.  Infrastructure South Australia will be undertaking the study for construction  of a multi-user coastal desalination plant in the Upper Spencer Gulf to  reduce reliance on the Great Artesian Basin.

Escondida’s two pits feed three concentrator plants, as well as two  leaching operations (oxide and sulphide). Key developments in FY2024 Escondida copper production increased by 7 per cent to 1,125 kt primarily  due to higher concentrator feed grade of 0.88 per cent, up from 0.82 per  cent in FY2023, as mining progressed into areas of higher-grade ore as  planned following the implementation of measures to manage geotechnical  events in FY2023. This was partially offset by planned lower cathode  production, as a result of prioritising concentrator throughput in prior years.  Deployment of autonomous trucks began in the Escondida Norte pit in the  second half of FY2024 and will ramp up to approximately 50 autonomous  trucks over the next three years.  In FY2024, the largest capacity cable-powered shovel available in the  market commenced operations at Escondida, the first in Latin America  and third in the world. This and further planned high-capacity shovel  deployments will unlock further efficiency in the truck loading process  enabling incremental system performance and lower unit cost. Escondida successfully completed negotiations for a new collective  agreement with the Union N°1 of Operators and Maintainers, effective for  36 months from 2 August 2024. Pampa Norte Overview Pampa Norte (BHP ownership: 100 per cent) consists of two assets in the  Atacama Desert in northern Chile – Spence and Cerro Colorado.  Spence produces copper cathodes and copper concentrate, with  by‑products including gold, silver and molybdenum. Cerro Colorado produced copper cathodes up until the asset entered  temporary care and maintenance in December 2023. Key developments in FY2024 Spence copper production increased by 6 per cent to 255 kt (240 kt  FY2023), driven by improved concentrator performance and feed grades.  Record concentrate production was partially offset by lower cathode  production, in line with an expected decline in stacked feed grade.  In March 2024, Spence achieved fully autonomous mine haulage  operations (ahead of the Q4 FY2024 target date) and has deployed a  total of 33 autonomous trucks. The concentrator plant modification, which commenced in August 2022,  was completed in June 2024. In December 2023, Spence achieved gender balance across its total  workforce and leadership roles ahead of BHP’s aspirational goal to  achieve a minimum of 40 per cent female representation by the end of  FY2025. During FY2024, Spence successfully completed negotiations  for a new collective agreement with Union 2 of Supervisors, effective for  36 months from 1 December 2023 and with Union 1 of Operators and  Maintainers effective for 36 months from 1 June 2024. As disclosed in the Q2 FY2024 Operational Review, changes to the  original Spence tailings storage facility (TSF) design were approved  and are currently in execution. As we progress execution, we continue  to closely monitor the previously identified anomalies to ensure safe    Copper 5.3 Minerals Americas The Minerals Americas asset group includes operated assets, projects and interests in non-operated joint ventures   in Canada, Chile, Peru, the United States and Brazil.

Antamina is operated independently by Compañía  Minera Antamina S.A. Key developments in FY2024 Antamina copper production increased by 4 per cent to 144 kt (BHP share)  as a result of record concentrator throughput offsetting lower planned  feed grades. Zinc production was 17 per cent lower at 103 kt (BHP share)  reflecting planned lower feed grades. In FY2024, Peruvian authorities approved Antamina’s Modification of the  Environmental Impact Assessment (MEIA), extending the life of Antamina  from CY2028 to CY2036.  Resolution Copper Overview Resolution Copper (BHP ownership: 45 per cent), located in the US State   of Arizona, is one of the largest undeveloped copper projects in the   world and has the potential to become one of the largest copper   producers in North America. Resolution Copper is operated by Rio Tinto  (55 per cent ownership).  Key developments in FY2024 During FY2024, Resolution Copper continued the engineering and  permitting phase of the project. The project is subject to a Final  Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS), which is a federal permitting  process led by the US Forest Service. The US Forest Service published  a FEIS in January 2021, which was rescinded in March 2021 to allow  additional environmental analysis and consultation with Native American  Tribes. The US Forest Service has indicated there is no timeline for  republication of the FEIS, which is subject to three lawsuits filed against  the US Forest Service on behalf of Native American Tribe members and  non-government organisations.

Jansen’s large resource provides the opportunity to develop the project  in stages, with Jansen Stage 1 (Jansen S1) expected to produce  approximately 4.15 Mt of potash per annum on completion, and first  production is expected in late CY2026. Approval of the 4.36 Mtpa Jansen  Stage 2 (Jansen S2) has increased planned production to approximately  8.5 Mtpa, with further brownfield expansions up to 8 Mtpa (approximately  4 Mtpa per stage). BHP holds mineral leases covering around 9,600 square kilometres in the  Saskatchewan potash basin. Key developments in FY2024 Jansen S1 is ahead of the original schedule and was 52 per cent complete  as at 30 June 2024. During FY2024, we successfully commissioned  Jansen’s permanent power substation, while also advancing steelwork  and equipment installation for surface and underground. Port construction  transitioned from ground improvement to civil and concrete works. In October 2023, BHP approved an investment of US$4.9 billion for  Jansen S2, following completion of the feasibility study, in line with plan.  Execution of Jansen S2 commenced and is expected to take approximately  six years, with first production targeted for FY2029, followed by a  three-year ramp-up period.

Three 400-kilometre pipelines connect the mine site to the pelletising  facilities. Samarco is operated independently by Samarco Mineração  S.A. Samarco’s main product is iron ore pellets, which are independently  marketed by Samarco and sold to customers around the world.  Samarco’s operations were suspended in November 2015 after the Fundão  dam failure. Since resuming operations in December 2020, 80 per cent  of the tailings generated are filtrated and dry stacked, and 20 per cent  are deposited in a confined pit enabling Samarco to operate without a  conventional tailings dam structure. Key developments in FY2024 Samarco increased iron ore pellets and ore fines production in FY2024  by 5 per cent to 4.7 Mt (BHP share). Samarco is currently operating at  31 per cent of its total 26 Mtpa (100 per cent basis) production capacity  and has shipped more than 29 Mt (100 per cent basis) of pellets and fines  since the resumption of operations in December 2020. In June 2023,  Samarco Board of Directors approved investment to increase production  to approximately 60 per cent of its full capacity through restarting the  second concentrator and third pelletising plant, expanding the existing  filtration plant and increasing the mine fleet. Project execution is on track  with first production expected in early CY2025. In December 2023, Samarco completed a restructure of its debts  under the Judicial Reorganisation process, which included payments  to employees and suppliers and the issue of new unsecured debt to  Samarco’s financial creditors. The restructure provides Samarco with a  stable financial position to continue to rebuild its operations and strengthen  its ability to meet its remediation and compensation obligations related  to the Fundão dam failure. This also benefits neighbouring communities  through job creation, investment and taxes.

Decommissioning works  for the smaller of the two tailings dams, the Germano Pit dam, were completed  during FY2023 and formally approved by state authorities in FY2024.  The progressive decommissioning of the remaining upstream tailings dam  structure, the Germano Main dam, is on track for completion by FY2029.  These structures have been certified as stable by independent third parties  and are compliant with local stability and monitoring requirements. In addition,  Samarco is now fully compliant with the Global Industry Standards on Tailings  Management (GISTM) requirements. Samarco is continuing broader studies  to review solutions to operate without tailings dams beyond FY2030.

For more information on BHP’s approach to and definition of  sustainability refer to OFR 6 and Additional information 10.4 6.1 Safety Protecting the safety and wellbeing of our workforce and the communities  where we operate is of the highest importance at BHP and is underpinned  by Our Values.  In January 2024, a valued contracting colleague, Luke O’Brien, was fatally  injured at our BMA Coal operations in Queensland in a vehicle-related  event. The investigation findings were shared internally with relevant  stakeholders to broaden and inform operational learning and improvement.  Our investigation into the previous year’s fatal event, involving Nathan  Scholz at Olympic Dam, is being finalised while external review processes  are ongoing.  These tragic events reinforce the need to continue to deepen our  understanding of the causes of fatal incidents so we can strengthen our  controls. We continue to focus proactively on integrating safety in the way  work is performed through our BHP Operating System (BOS) and strive to  improve the quality of our global Field Leadership Program and uplift safety  leadership capability across our organisation.  We believe a positive workplace culture built on care and trust will enable  us to understand more about the work conditions that increase risk to our  workforce and influence how work is executed. We also believe learning  from those who perform the work and are closest to the risks gives us  greater insight into how we can improve fatal risk control verification.  This approach recognises that work is complex due to the interactions that  occur between people, equipment/tools, processes, systems and culture,  and how they influence one another can impact safety outcomes. Leaders play an instrumental role in shaping our organisation’s culture.  Our General Managers Integrated Leadership Forum is an example of how  we are growing organisational capability and embedding BOS principles.  The forum promotes strong safety leadership discussions, reinforcing ‘felt  leadership’, collaboration and connection as we seek better ways to learn  and improve together.  Our safety performance  In FY2024 we recorded:1  	 – one fatal incident involving a vehicle, where a valued colleague  undertaking contract work lost their life 	 – a 36 per cent decrease in the high-potential injury frequency rate from  FY2023. The highest number of events with the potential for one or  more fatalities was related to vehicle and mobile equipment incidents.  We closely monitor high-potential injury trends and focus on identifying  the contributing factors and influencing conditions to help inform fatality  risk control improvements  	 – a 5 per cent increase in total recordable injury frequency (TRIF) from  FY2023. The highest number of recordable injuries related to slips, trips  and falls for employees and contractors. The second-highest number  of injuries for employees related to being hit by a moving object and for  contractors related to being caught between objects 	 – an increase in field leadership activities compared to FY2023  performance, at a frequency rate of 9,868 activities per million hours  worked with over 1.8 million activities completed. We understand the  importance and value of sustaining the quality of these engagements  and we continue to promote coaching, a key element of our scheduled  work routines, as an important tool for achieving this. The field  leadership coaching rate was 42 per cent for Layered Audits and Critical  Control Observations, remaining on par with the previous year This section includes FY2024 safety data and information relating to  the former OZ Minerals operations that form part of our Copper South  Australia asset and the West Musgrave Project (acquired as part of  BHP’s acquisition of OZ Minerals on 2 May 2023) unless expressly  stated otherwise.

Combined employee and contractor frequency per 1 million hours worked. As we learn year on year, we continue to look for opportunities to improve  the application of the following programs and systems as outlined in the  sections below: 	 – Fatality Elimination Program – asset-based fatality risk control  implementation plans aimed at eliminating fatalities at our operations  by having effective controls in place 	 – Field Leadership – enabling a culture of care, standard setting and  supporting risk control verification 	 – Contractor Management – helping to protect the health and safety of our  contractors is an important element of asset-based health and safety  management systems  Fatality Elimination Program  It is paramount that we continue to learn, improve and focus on  opportunities to verify and strengthen our critical risk control framework  to more effectively manage and prevent fatality risks. We developed and introduced the Fatality Elimination Program (FEL)  program in 2020. The FEL program requires our assets to implement  fatal risk controls across their respective material safety risk profiles.  The FEL program remains a high priority across BHP, with an intended  completion of asset FEL control implementation plans in FY2025.  Asset implementation plan progress against the FEL program is measured  and tracked by the Executive Leadership Team and BHP scorecard to  ensure visibility at the highest level. Post FY2025, ongoing asset control  implementation and improvements will be managed via the existing risk  evaluation process. We will continue to evolve our approach to safety risk management and  our understanding of what conditions and factors influence the cause of  incidents and the verification and validation of fatal risk controls. In FY2024: 	 – On average, assets achieved over 90 per cent compliance for  FEL program controls implemented according to the plan for this  financial year.  	 – We continued implementation of the five‑year fatality elimination  roadmap, including the recommended sequencing of strengthened  controls based on effort, cost and near-miss reduction impact. 	 – We continued to undertake data analysis and insights into our high- potential near-miss and actual events, moving from three-monthly to  six-monthly reviews, to identify more meaningful themes over a longer  sampling period. This included a continued focus on the relevant risks,  controls and conditions that may increase the likelihood of incidents. 29 Overview Additional Information Financial Statements Governance Contents Operating and Financial Review  ===== PAGE 32 ===== 6 Sustainability continued 	 – We identified ongoing FEL program fatal risk control verification and  improvement opportunities via regional-focused assurance activities.  	 – We continued to review the Fatal Risk Control Management Framework  to improve how we manage single-fatality occupational safety risk, with  vehicle and mobile equipment remaining our highest risk. This ongoing  work involves deepening our organisational understanding of risk and  what causes incidents, improved performance standards and the quality  of our fatal risk control verification and assurance programs.  Field Leadership Program Leaders spending time in the field fosters a culture of care, which helps  to maintain safe operations. Our global Field Leadership Program  encourages the workforce to provide feedback to their leaders about safety  issues and concerns, and may also include sharing insights into safer ways  of working. It involves leaders having quality two-way conversations with  workers in the field and drives a common approach to improving health,  safety and environment (HSE) performance. The program helps verify  that critical safety controls are in place, being applied and are effective in  managing risks that have the potential to result in fatalities. The global field leadership tools include Layered Audits, Critical Control  Observations, Planned Task Confirmations and Take Time Talks, and are  supported by coaching routines.  In FY2024 we continued to: 	 – improve the quality of field leadership activities by increasing training  and coaching, and delivering field leadership engagements across all  levels of the organisation  	 – conduct field leadership activities to support the verification of risks that  have the potential to result in injuries or illnesses and fatalities across  our operated assets  	 – embed the global field leadership procedure, which is designed  to increase the effectiveness of field leadership activities across  the business  Contractor management Our commitment to safety includes helping to protect the many thousands  of contractors who represent a significant part of our total workforce. Our approach to contractor management is intended to make it safer and  easier for contractors to work with us and designed to support an inclusive,  respectful and caring workplace culture. We have an asset-focused  approach to contractor management, with our contract owners playing a  significant role in helping us improve our partnerships with BHP service  providers. Contract owners work collaboratively with contractors to deliver  work safely under the conditions of their contract and in accordance with  our mandatory minimum requirements for contractor management and the  respective asset safety management plans and systems.  In FY2024 we: 	 – simplified our mandatory minimum requirements for contractor  management under an asset-focused model 	 – undertook internal assurance and audit activities at an asset level  	 – Transitioned the Integrated Contractor Management (ICM) project,  which included facilitating contractor mobilisation to an asset-led model For more information on safety refer to bhp.com/safety 6.2 Our sustainability approach The way we produce our commodities and how we responsibly manage  our sustainability-related impacts is critical to our future. Our stakeholders  and partners are increasingly focused on our sustainability performance  and use it as a key metric in assessing BHP and our industry.  We define our approach to sustainability through our purpose and  Our Values, which are governed through our Global Standards.  These standards describe our mandatory minimum performance  requirements and provide the foundation for sustainability performance  at our operated assets and in our functions. Our social value framework expands on and deepens our long-standing  commitment to sustainability. For information on our approach to social value, including the  aspirational goals and associated metrics we have set for ourselves,  refer to OFR 6.5 For information on our governance of sustainability, including the  FY2024 improvement project for our internal Group-wide standards,  refer to OFR 6.3 There are a number of voluntary global sustainability frameworks,  standards, benchmarks and initiatives that we seek to comply with.  We continue to report against the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)  Standards, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Mining  and Metals Standards and the recommendations of the Taskforce on  Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in addition to engaging  on consultations relating to the International Sustainability Standards  Board (ISSB) standards. During FY2024, the trend towards mandatory  sustainability-related reporting frameworks increased, and we continue to  monitor these developments for their potential application to BHP, including  the proposed Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards (ASRS),  the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the EU  Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD).  For information on our engagement with climate-specific regulatory  developments refer to OFR 6.9 In FY2024, we continued our commitment to a number of responsible  production and sourcing standards, which require self-assessment and  third-party verification of management systems and performance at an  asset, operation or facility level. These standards, such as the International  Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) Performance Expectations,  Towards Sustainable Mining and the Copper Mark, require disclosure  of our performance against detailed requirements across a broad range  of sustainability topics. Details of the voluntary sustainability standards that we have reported  against for FY2024 are set out in the BHP ESG Standards and  Databook 2024.  The BHP ESG Standards and Databook 2024 is available   at bhp.com/ESGStandards2024 Our Modern Slavery Statement 2024 is prepared under the Australian  Modern Slavery Act 2018 and UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and outlines  our management of modern slavery risks. In May 2024, BHP Canada Inc.  published its first modern slavery statement under Canada’s newly enacted  Fighting Against Forced Labour and Child Labour in Supply Chains Act for  the financial year 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023. The BHP Group Modern Slavery Statement 2024 is available at   bhp.com/MSS2024 Treatment of former OZ Minerals and divestment of  Daunia and Blackwater coal mines This Report includes FY2024 sustainability-related data and information  relating to the former OZ Minerals operations that form part of our Copper  South Australia asset and the West Musgrave Project (acquired as part  of BHP’s acquisition of OZ Minerals on 2 May 2023), unless expressly  stated otherwise in the relevant section. Prior year sustainability-related  data and information has not been adjusted and restated unless expressly  stated otherwise. Former OZ Minerals Brazil sustainability-related data  and information has been excluded from this Report unless otherwise  expressly stated. Where OZ Minerals Brazil data is included as required to  meet legal and regulatory requirements or as necessary to meet applicable  voluntary standards and benchmarks, that data has been prepared in  accordance with former OZ Minerals standards due to ongoing strategic  review of these assets by BHP.

This included updates across the suite of sustainability-related Global  Standards (previously Our Requirements standards) relating to Climate  Change, Environment, Community and Indigenous Peoples and the  introduction of a new Social Value and Sustainability Global Standard.  These improvements seek to make our requirements and our ways of  working easier for our people to understand and apply.  External versions of key sustainability-related elements of these  Global Standards are available at bhp.com/about/operating-ethically/ corporate-governance Our management-level Sustainability and ESG Steering Committee   (ESG SteerCo) undertakes review of a range of cross-functional and  strategic issues relating to key sustainability and ESG topics. Issues under  the remit of the ESG SteerCo are driven by regular assessment of  materiality and relative priority and determined in line with BHP’s social  value framework pillars. In FY2024, the membership of the ESG SteerCo  included the Chief Legal, Governance and External Affairs Officer, the  Chief Operations Officer, the Chief Commercial Officer, the Chief Financial  Officer and the Presidents of Minerals Americas and Minerals Australia  from the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) as well as sustainability and  ESG leaders within BHP. Matters considered by the ESG SteerCo may  also be subject to review or approval by the ELT and the Board or its  Committees, in accordance with their remits. The ESG SteerCo met four times during FY2024. They discussed topics  including our community and human rights impact and opportunity  assessments, nature-positive plans to support progress against our 2030  Healthy environment goal, environmental performance, sustainability  standards strategy and implementation, and preparation of our Climate  Transition Action Plan 2024. Our approach to sustainability Our purpose underpins  everything we do  and is central to our  sustainability approach. Through our purpose, Our Values,  strategy and operating model,  we set the direction for the way  we do business. We build strong  foundations through meeting  our compliance obligations and  operating within our social licence.  We manage this through our Global  Standards, which set the mandatory  minimum performance standards for  BHP, our ongoing opportunity and  threat management and meeting  the sustainability standards that  we commit to. Safe, inclusive and future-ready workforce Decarbonisation Indigenous partnerships Responsible supply chains Healthy environment Thriving, empowered communities Building on strong foundations, we aspire to create social value for  society that is purposeful, proactive, mutually beneficial and respectful. In June 2022, we launched our social value framework, focused on  the six pillars of Decarbonisation, Healthy environment, Indigenous  partnerships, Safe, inclusive and future-ready workforce, Thriving,  empowered communities and Responsible supply chains.  Each pillar is anchored to an aspirational 2030 goal and  underpinned by  a set of metrics to measure performance  and milestones to track progress: To bring people and  resources together  to build a better world Purpose led Strong foundations Social value 31 Overview Additional Information Financial Statements Governance Contents Operating and Financial Review  ===== PAGE 34 ===== 6 Sustainability continued 6.4 Material topics for sustainability reporting Annual sustainability materiality assessment Each year we determine which sustainability topics are considered most  material to our business, partners and stakeholders for the purpose of  our sustainability-related reporting (which may differ from the materiality  standards applied by other reporting regimes) by undertaking an impact  materiality assessment in alignment with the recommendations of the GRI.  These topics are referred to as our material sustainability topics. The findings  of this assessment help us determine the information our stakeholders are  seeking and therefore the material sustainability topics for disclosure in  OFR 6. In FY2024 we have consolidated the material topics within OFR 6  compared to FY2023 and we have reported on value chain sustainability and  tailings storage facilities within OFR 6.4, sexual harassment within OFR 6.6,  and digital security and data privacy within OFR 8.1. Our materiality assessment considers our potential and actual positive and  negative impacts by an assessment of a broad range of inputs, including  BHP’s material risk profile (refer to OFR 8), information recorded in our  internal event management system, our social value framework, topics  raised at our Annual General Meeting (AGM) and industry standards  and guidance. Our assessment aims to capture our external partners’  and stakeholders’ perspectives through incorporating consideration of  issues raised at our AGM and investor roundtables, industry sustainability  standards and guidance, sustainability-related regulatory focus areas, and  relevant media articles about our impacts. Sustainability-related impacts  can arise from our direct operational activities, such as managing tailings  storage facilities, or result from activities within our value chain, such  as procuring goods and services from our suppliers. We aim to address  this in our materiality assessment by considering a broad range of inputs  and perspectives. Our material sustainability topics are reviewed by the  Sustainability Committee annually.  For more information on our materiality assessment for sustainability  reporting refer to bhp.com/sustainability The material sustainability topics identified in this assessment are shown  against our social value pillars, as illustrated in the table on page 33  together with the sections of OFR 6 that address these topics and the most  relevant risk factors as described in OFR 8.1, and are largely consistent  with FY2023.  For more information on the process by which we identify and manage  risk at BHP and our risk factors, which include sustainability-related  risks, refer to OFR 8 Respecting human rights We recognise we have the potential to cause, contribute to or be directly  linked to human rights impacts through our operations and supply chain  primarily relating to workplace health and safety, labour rights, activities of  security providers, land access and use, water and sanitation, community  wellbeing, and Indigenous peoples’ rights relating to culture, identity,  traditions and customs.  Our Human Rights Policy Statement and relevant standards outline our  commitment and approach to respecting human rights and the principles  by which we conduct our human rights due diligence. This involves taking  a rights-based approach for our own operations and for modern slavery- related risks in our supply chain to identify and assess actual and potential  impacts, considering how impacts may affect people, integrating and  acting upon the findings, monitoring effectiveness, and communicating  how actual and potential impacts are addressed. In FY2023, BHP developed and commenced implementation of a globally  consistent methodology for our community and human rights impact and  opportunity assessments (CHRIOAs), which identified potential impacts  and risks to local communities where we operate. The methodology design  incorporated consideration of relevant human rights in accordance with  our Human Rights Policy Statement, views from our stakeholders and the  United Nation Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs)  approach to identifying and prioritising salient human rights issues.  During FY2024 an external human rights expert reviewed the approach  and provided feedback on the CHRIOA process to further strengthen our  approach to identifying potential human rights impacts which we will seek  to incorporate in FY2025. The methodology is described in more detail in  OFR 6.11.  Responsible sourcing and  production standards performance We recognise there are sustainability-related opportunities and impacts  across our value chain. BHP has voluntarily committed to the adoption of  a set of external standards for the responsible production and sourcing of  minerals and metals, as outlined in OFR 6.2. Our performance is assured  against these standards by an independent third party and this allows us  to more transparently demonstrate to our stakeholders our intent to be a  responsible actor within the mining and metals industry and within global  value chains for our products. This also helps us align with sustainability- related requirements set out by national mining associations, industry  associations, commodity exchanges and relevant emerging regulations. Relevant Australian operated assets continued to progress implementation  of the Towards Sustainable Mining framework, as part of the three-year  implementation phase and in preparation for public reporting by the end  of CY2025.  Our Escondida and Spence operations in Chile and Olympic Dam operations  in Australia were previously assured against The Copper Mark Criteria  Guide (reference 24 January 2020) and continue work to prepare for their  next assessments. The Copper Mark is a voluntary assurance framework  that independently assesses participants against 32 performance criteria  across environmental, social and governance dimensions.  During FY2024, Escondida, Spence, Olympic Dam and Nickel West (which  produced brands listed on the London Metal Exchange (LME)) successfully  completed third-party verification for the FY2023 period against the Joint  Due Diligence Standard (JDDS) as an OECD-aligned and LME-approved  standard. For Escondida, Spence and Olympic Dam, JDDS certificates were  issued under the broader Copper Mark certification while Nickel West was  issued a standalone JDDS certificate by The Copper Mark. Our Responsible Minerals Program (RMP) is our minerals and metals supply  chain due diligence program that applies to minerals and metals that we  source from third parties (either for feedstock or third-party trading purposes).  The RMP has been designed to align with the OECD’s Due Diligence  Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected  and High-Risk Areas. We are currently undertaking a project to develop and  integrate an expanded scope of environmental risks that will seek to align  the due diligence undertaken within the RMP with the OECD’s Handbook on  Environmental Due Diligence in Mineral Supply Chains. Under the Responsible supply chains pillar of our social value framework, we  seek to create sustainable, ethical and transparent supply chains together  with our partners. One of the FY2024 short-term milestones within the  Responsible Supply Chains pillar outlined in OFR 6.5 that we met was to  determine ethical supplier improvement plans with partners, where required.  The Ethical Supply Chain and Transparency (ESCT) team within Compliance  reviews audit reports prepared by our third-party audit provider and monitors  corrective action taken by suppliers in response to audit findings. For more information on our supplier due diligence approach refer to  the Summary of FY2024 audits in the BHP Group Modern Slavery  Statement 2024 available at bhp.com/MSS2024 For more information on our Responsible Minerals Program refer  to our Responsible Minerals Program Report 2024 available  at bhp.com/-/media/documents/environment/2024/240827_ BHPResponsibleMineralsProgramReport2024 For more information on our approach to value chain sustainability refer  to bhp.com/sustainability/value-chain-sustainability  Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management As an ICMM member, BHP has committed to achieving alignment with the  Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) for all BHP- operated tailings storage facilities (TSFs). BHP is focused on safety and the  integrity of TSFs at our operated assets to protect people and the environment.  In August 2023, we disclosed an overview of our conformance against the  GISTM for our TSFs with a GISTM classification of Very High or Extreme  rated facilities as at 31 July 2023 (excluding the four TSFs introduced to the  BHP portfolio by the acquisition of OZ Minerals in May 2023), based on a  self-assessment. Our August 2024 public disclosure is an update of the 2023  disclosure, and also includes the results of third-party validation of 10 of these  TSFs and the remainder will be included in future disclosures. In accordance with the timeline for members of the ICMM, work towards  GISTM conformance has been progressed for the 49 remaining BHP- operated TSFs and we plan to disclose an overview of our conformance  in August 2025. Further detail is reported in the GISTM public  disclosure document.

Since then, we have worked to embed social  value into our decision-making through processes and systems, such as: 	 – carrying out social value assessments for our operated assets to identify  social value priorities ahead of the annual planning cycle 	 – utilising our non-economically quantifiable impact (NEQI) framework  to systematically identify, consistently evaluate and transparently  present actual and potential social value impacts for consideration  in our investment decisions where applicable We provide progress on our 2030 goals through our social value  scorecard. The scorecard is intended to evolve over time as our plans  mature and to keep pace, as appropriate, with our internal and external  environment. Our performance in FY2024 against the scorecard and our  new FY2025 milestones are provided on page 35 to demonstrate our  progress towards our 2030 goals. For more information on how the metrics and milestones support  progress towards our 2030 goals and the methods we use to measure  progress refer to the BHP ESG Standards and Databook 2024  available at bhp.com/ESGStandards2024 Social investment  Guided by our social value framework, our social investment aims to make  a meaningful contribution to addressing the sustainable development  challenges of most relevance to our business, partners and stakeholders. In FY2024, our voluntary social investment totalled US$136.7 million.  This investment consisted of US$102.4 million in direct funding for   initiatives in line with our social value framework, US$15.2 million to   non-operated joint venture social investment programs, and US$1.8 million  under the BHP Matched Giving Program. Administrative costs to facilitate  social investment activities totalled US$12.5 million and US$6.4 million  supported the operations of the BHP Foundation.  For more information on our social investment, including case studies  and performance against our global social investment indicators, refer to  bhp.com/sustainability/approach/social-investment For more information on the BHP Foundation refer to   bhp‑foundation.org These footnotes refer to the next page 1.	 With widespread adoption expected post 2030. We have revised the language used in  our medium-term goal for steelmaking to provide greater clarity and reflect the range of  steelmaking process routes that now form part of our strategy. This is due to technology  advances as well as the evolution of our strategy. For more information refer to the BHP  Climate Transition Action Plan 2024 available at bhp.com/CTAP2024.  2.	 For the definition of the terms used to express these positions, including ‘target’, ‘goal’,  ‘net zero’, ‘carbon neutral’ and ‘operational GHG emissions’ refer to Additional information  10.4. For more information on the essential definitions, assumptions and adjustments for  our targets and goals refer to Metrics, targets and goals in OFR 6.9.  3.	 Nature-positive is defined by the TNFD Glossary version 1.0 as ‘A high-level goal and  concept describing a future state of nature (e.g. biodiversity, ecosystem services and  natural capital) which is greater than the current state’. We understand it to include land and  water management practices that halt and reverse nature loss – that is, supporting healthy,  functioning ecosystems. BHP intends to review this definition in FY2025, in light of the  recently revised TNFD Glossary version 2.0 (June 2024) definition of nature-positive. 4.	 Excluding areas we hold under greenfield exploration licences (or equivalent tenements),  which are outside the area of influence of our existing mine operations. 30 per cent will be  calculated based on the areas of land and water that we steward at the end of FY2030. For  more information refer to the BHP ESG Standards and Databook 2024 available at bhp.com/ sustainability. For an overview of the operational area (i.e. disturbed area) and non-operational  area within our own operational footprint that is the boundary of our 2030 Healthy environment  goal, and their size and relativity to one another refer to the infographic in OFR 6.10. 5.	 For our FY2024 key metric, while some of the land related to the Daunia and Blackwater  mines is pending transfer following BMA’s divestment of these mines on 2 April 2024,  these areas are no longer under BMA’s control or operated for BMA’s benefit so have  been excluded from the areas of land and water we stewarded at 30 June 2024. 6.	 Cultural diversity in our workforce will be measured based on our substantive progress  towards reflecting the cultural diversity of the societies where we operate. 7.	 Baseline year and performance data adjusted; for the adjustments we make, refer to  Climate‑related metrics, targets and goals beginning on page 52 in OFR 6.9. 8.	 CY2008 was selected as the baseline year for this goal to align with the base year for the  International Maritime Organisation’s CY2030 emission intensity goal and its corresponding  reasoning and strategy. Baseline and performance data have been adjusted to only include  voyages associated with the transportation of commodities currently in BHP’s portfolio due to  the data availability challenges of adjusting by asset or operation for CY2008 and subsequent  year data. GHG emissions intensity calculations currently include the transportation of copper,  iron ore, steelmaking coal, energy coal, molybdenum, uranium and nickel. Baseline and  performance data have also been adjusted for a methodology change to use maritime transport  emission factors from EU Regulation 2023/1805, after The British Standards Institution EN 16258  standard (the source of the emission factors we previously used) was withdrawn in CY2023. 9.	 Excluding in-kind contributions. 10.	Area under stewardship that has a formal management plan that includes conservation,  restoration or regenerative practices. 1.62 per cent is calculated based on the areas of  land and water that we stewarded at 30 June 2024, as per footnote 4. For more information  refer to the BHP ESG Standards and Databook 2024, available at bhp.com/sustainability. 11.	Natural capital accounts are a way to measure the amount, condition and value of  environmental assets in a given area. They help describe changes in ecosystems and  how these impact wellbeing and economies.  12.	Point in time data at 30 June 2024. 13.	8.3 per cent refers to Indigenous employee participation at Minerals Australia operations. Total  Indigenous employee participation in Australia, including non-operational roles (1.9 per cent),  was 7.5 per cent at 30 June 2024. 14.	11.2 per cent refers to Indigenous employee participation at the Jansen potash project  and operation in Canada. 15.	10.1 per cent refers to Indigenous employee participation at Minerals Americas  operations in Chile.  16.	Since publishing our FY2023 scorecard, we have updated the methodology we use  to track our ‘Progress to plan’ key metric and this change is reflected in our FY2024  performance against this metric. We had previously intended the metric would be  Indigenous partner-measured (using a traffic light score) on satisfaction in relation to the  milestones agreed in relevant partnerships, as co-designed in our regional Indigenous  Peoples Plans. This update clarifies our intention to report on ‘Progress to plan’ in  relation to our progress against the current or planned regional Indigenous Peoples  Plans in Australia, Canada and Chile. The updated methodology for this metric aligns  with the reporting methodology for the finalised regional plans, including the Australian  Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) published in May 2023 and the Canada Indigenous  Partnerships Plan (CIPP) approved in June 2024 and published in August 2024, both of  which will report on progress against the milestones co-designed in each plan. Australia is  the only region with data available to report on its first year of progress against the RAP in  FY2024, therefore the social value scorecard metric for Australia is considered ‘on track’  for FY2024. The first progress report for Canada on our co-designed CIPP will be made  in our Annual Report 2025. We are still developing our regional Indigenous Peoples Plan  for Chile. We have retained the Indigenous partner-measured methodology for measuring  the ‘Present relationship health’ key metric. For more information refer to OFR 6.12 and the  BHP ESG Standards and Databook 2024 available at bhp.com/ESGStandards2024.  17.	Indigenous partners who participated in the relationship health check project in FY2024  considered and provided feedback on social, cultural and commercial aspects of their relationship  with BHP and provided a rating on a 0-10 scale on the present health of their relationship with BHP  – 0 is very poor, 5 is average, and 10 is very good. For more information refer to OFR 6.12. 18.	Reduction in life-altering injury or illness includes life-altering or long-term permanent  disabling injuries and illnesses as defined by BHP’s Risk Framework. Since we commenced  measuring our life-altering injury and illness metric, we have learned that a longer  measurement period is required for analysis to allow for the classification of more chronic  conditions. Therefore, it will not be reported on in this Report or included as a key metric in  the social value scorecard in FY2025. This reflects a change from what we proposed in our  FY2023 social value scorecard and so we have retained this metric in our FY2024 scorecard  (without reporting against it) to explain the change in approach. The two main illness and  injury types that influence life-altering injury or illness for BHP are musculoskeletal cases and  noise-induced hearing loss cases, both of which we report on in OFR 6.7.  19.	Co-design requires meaningful engagement and contribution to the plan from a variety of  interested stakeholders. For an overview of our approach to co-design and co-creation  (terms which we use interchangeably) refer to OFR 6.11.  20.	This includes contribution to suppliers, wages and benefits for employees, dividends,  taxes, royalties and voluntary social investment. For more information refer to the BHP  Economic Contribution Report 2024. 21.	Net Promoter Scores (NPS) show respective feedback from our customers and suppliers,  and measure the willingness of our customers/suppliers to recommend BHP to others.  NPS is used as a proxy for gauging overall satisfaction.  22.	This milestone was achieved by developing a Group-level framework for nature-positive plans  to achieve the 2030 Healthy environment goal (BHP Healthy environment goal roadmap). 23.

We aim to attract and retain the best people  and our distinctive way of working through the BHP Operating System  (BOS) seeks to empower our people to bring the best of themselves to  improve their work every day.  Our Values set the tone for our culture and are a unique part of our  competitive advantage. Our Values are a declaration of what we stand for  and are designed to guide our behaviour and decision-making, as we work  together in the pursuit of delivering on our purpose. In today’s dynamic,  uncertain world, anchoring our decision-making to a clear set of values  remains as important as ever. In FY2024, we engaged with employees,  partners and other stakeholders as we sought to redefine Our Values in  a way that builds upon our rich history, while also reflecting BHP today.  Our refreshed Values were launched in May 2024. They are simple and  designed to enable our people to be ready to move quickly and deliberately  to create and act on opportunities and navigate challenges as they arise.  Our refreshed Values are: Do what’s  right Seek better  ways Make a  difference A sustainable  future starts with  safety and integrity,  building trust with  those around us.  Listening to learn  and inspiring  challenge is how  we drive progress. The accountability  to act, create value  and have impact  is on each of us,  every day.  Developing our capabilities and an enabled culture We invest in the development of our people to build capability and drive  stronger performance.  In support of work to deliver the capabilities for today and tomorrow,  BHP’s FutureFit Academy (located in Western Australia and Queensland)  provides a pathway for new employees, some of whom have never worked  in our industry before, to join Minerals Australia through an accredited  maintenance and production traineeship or a trade apprenticeship.  Once trained and qualified, employees move to one of our Australian  assets. The strong partnership between vocational educational institutions  and our FutureFit Academy facilitates the provision of nationally accredited  qualifications and is a unique attraction and retention lever for BHP. The FutureFit Academy is designed as an inclusive learning environment,  welcoming employees who are new to the industry and providing  permanent employment from day one. As at the end of FY2024, our  student cohort included 80 per cent female participation and was made up  of over 20 per cent Indigenous intake.  The FutureFit Academy expanded in FY2024 to provide a larger footprint  in Perth, Western Australia, moving to a purpose-built learning centre  that includes fabrication and auto electrical trades in addition to the  core mechanical fitting and heavy diesel programs. A satellite FutureFit  Academy was also established in Newman, Western Australia, providing  a belt splicing program for experienced students.  Our intern and graduate programs also serve to attract and develop  emerging talent for critical skills we need for the future. In FY2024, we  had 60 first-year university students participate as part of our First- Year Internship Program across Australia. The program aims to boost  enrolments in Australian resource-related tertiary degrees by exposing  science and engineering students to mining careers. In FY2024, an  additional 147 university students joined the BHP Internship Program  for five to 24 weeks to gain experience in their chosen field of study  through on-the-job learning, working on mine sites alongside technical  professionals. Our selected interns have early access to apply for  our annual graduate program intakes. In FY2024, we onboarded 177  employees into our graduate program across Australia, Chile, Canada,  Singapore and the United States, to meet the needs for future skills across  our operations and functions in those regions.  To support our focus to build leader capability and drive stronger  performance, we conduct multi-level leadership development programs.  The Senior Leadership Forum is intended to develop senior leaders  through shared goals and context. In FY2024, this forum was delivered  quarterly with a summit held in late FY2024 to further engage our senior  leaders in relation to our purpose, strategy and operating system, and to  launch the refreshed Our Values. Additionally, we also continue to facilitate  an Integrated Leadership Forum for general managers on a quarterly  basis to align this next critical cohort of leaders. Further, around 2,000  leaders including supervisors, superintendents and managers attended  BHP Distinctive Leaders programs in FY2024, focused on developing their  ability to lead inclusively, ethically and through complexity. We ask our employees and contractors about their experiences working  with BHP via an Engagement and Perception Survey twice a year.  After each survey, our team leaders assess what is working well and what  they can learn from others before taking action to address improvement  areas. Additionally, this survey is used to measure progress against a  wellbeing metric within the Safe, inclusive and future-ready workforce pillar  in our social value scorecard. In March 2024, we had a response rate of  82 per cent of employees, with 24,000 contractors also providing feedback.  We achieved a strong result, with 80 per cent of participants responding  favourably to questions related to their engagement and connection to BHP  and 87 per cent to questions related to their wellbeing.  Inclusion and diversity We believe an inclusive and diverse workforce promotes engagement,  safety and productivity, and is valued by prospective employees as well  as our current workforce.  Our Inclusion and Diversity Position Statement confirms our vision,  commitment and contributions to inclusion, equity and diversity.  Since 2016, we have been embedding flexible working, ensuring our  facilities and equipment are purpose-fit by partnering with our supply chain  partners, and undertaking work to mitigate bias in our systems with the  aim of creating workplaces that are safe and inclusive for a diverse range  of people. Our goal is to attract and retain a workforce that is representative of  society. We do this by implementing measures designed to address the  barriers and impacts of bias and discrimination experienced by people  within underrepresented groups, through listening to their experience and  gaining insights from our engagement surveys and our voluntary self- identification survey, ‘Tell Us About You’. As of February 2024, over 11,000  of our employees had completed the survey. We also recognise pay is a critical mechanism for creating gender equality.  To help mitigate gender pay disparities and prevent the creation of pay  gaps, we continue to drive improvements in our systems and processes  to remove systemic bias. As an example, our recruitment processes  include a ‘blind reward’ process, which is designed to reduce potential  bias in remuneration offers at the time of hire. We use global best practice  methodologies to calculate the pay gap between men and women in  like-for-like or comparable roles. We analyse our pay data and conduct  gender pay equity reviews at least annually. The results of the pay equity  reviews are reported to the BHP People and Remuneration Committee.  Our FY2024 employee remuneration data, including a breakdown by  gender, is available in the ESG Standards and Databook 2024.  Gender balance1 In CY2016, we announced our aspiration to achieve gender balance within  our employee workforce globally by the end of CY2025, which we define as  a minimum 40 per cent women and 40 per cent men. This has also been  included as one of the key metrics we measure progress against our Safe,  inclusive and future-ready workforce pillar in our social value scorecard. We increased the participation of women working at BHP in FY2024 by  1.9 percentage points compared to FY2023, with around 10,500 more  female employees at the end of FY2024 than FY2016. As at 30 June 2024,  women represented 37.1 per cent of our employee workforce. Since we  first set our gender balance aspiration in 2016, BHP has more than  doubled the participation of women (from 17.6 per cent to 37.1 per cent).  We also reached a significant milestone during FY2024 achieving over  40 per cent participation of women in our employee workforce across the  Minerals Americas operations in Chile, and as at 30 June 2024 this was  40.9 per cent.  1.	 Based on a ‘point in time’ snapshot of employees as at 30 June 2024, including employees on extended absence, as used in internal management reporting for the purposes of monitoring  progress against our goals. New hires is based on a 12-month period from 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024. ‘People leaders’ are defined as employees with one or more direct reports. ‘Senior  executives’ are defined as employees in the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) and direct reports to the ELT in grade 15 and above roles. Figures reported do not include employees of  BHP Mitsubishi Alliance’s Blackwater and Daunia operations, sold to Whitehaven Coal during FY2024.  36 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 39 ===== The gender breakdown of new hires in FY2024 was 48.1 per cent men  and 51.9 per cent women. We improved our participation of women in  leadership in FY2024 by 2.0 per cent compared to FY2023. As at 30 June  2024, 31.7 per cent of people leaders were women and of our senior  executives 40.9 per cent were women and 59.1 per cent were men.  For operational teams, a focus on roster and job redesign is designed to  support greater female participation. Our Bamboo flexible work program is  an example of this. Case study – Bamboo flexible work program In FY2024, our Bamboo flexible work program was a finalist in the  Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia Women in  Resources Awards. Founded in 2019 at Newman Operations, the  Bamboo program is a residential gender diversity initiative that  supports the attraction and retention of women in historically male- dominated roles. The Bamboo program is targeting an 80 per cent  female intake from the Newman township, creating an opportunity for  new-to-industry and existing workers to have flexible work options  with reduced shift hours, enabling them to actively maintain a career  in mining production, specifically haul truck operations.

These employees were excluded from data presented in the gender  composition graphs to protect the privacy of those employees. Indigenous employment  Indigenous peoples are critical partners of BHP across our operations.  We recognise, as part of our global Indigenous Peoples Policy Statement,  we can contribute to the economic empowerment of Indigenous peoples  by providing opportunities for employment, training and procurement and  by supporting Indigenous enterprises.  We have set targets to increase Indigenous employment in our Minerals  Australia operations, Minerals Americas operations in Chile and our  Jansen potash project in Canada.

We recognise and acknowledge racism impacts our people’s sense of  identity, value, feelings of respect and psychological safety. We are taking  action to better understand the prevalence of racism at BHP to promote  racial awareness and equity in our workplace, and we recognise there is  more still to do.  We continue to take action to increase awareness of and promote  reporting, response and investigations in relation to racial harassment  matters. In FY2024, across our global operations and offices: 	 – 109 reports of racial harassment were received into BHP’s reporting  channels for raising misconduct concerns. 	 – 42 per cent of the reports received were logged by leaders, on behalf  of others. 	 – 23 investigated cases of racial harassment conduct were established  as having occurred. 	 – Of the 23 established cases, 21 individuals responsible had their  employment terminated (or were removed from site if a contractor)  or resigned. 	 – 19 reports of racial harassment were dealt with by a non-investigative  resolution pathway at the impacted person’s request. Our racial equity working group is led by Chief Financial Officer Vandita  Pant as the executive sponsor and oversees work with a focus on  eliminating racism and striving to create an environment free from  racial discrimination. As part of its work, this group works alongside  our Indigenous engagement teams in Australia, Chile, Canada and the  United States. Throughout FY2024, we continued to progress our work in identifying  and addressing structural barriers to equity, and in building awareness  and capability in our leaders. We also continued to improve our  grievance processes to better support people who tell us when they have  experienced racism. Our work in FY2024 included: 	 – commencing the refresh of a central online platform called RespectHub  including the development of a new virtual assistant RespectChat,  aimed at providing information and tools to our workforce to prevent  and respond to racism, including support options, response pathways  and reporting 	 – launching new chapters of EmBRace (Employees Beyond Race), our  employee resource group focused on discussions around race and  racial diversity. Local chapters have now been set up in Canada and  South Australia, in addition to existing chapters in Western Australia,  Queensland, Singapore and Manila 37 Overview Additional Information Financial Statements Governance Contents Operating and Financial Review  ===== PAGE 40 ===== 6 Sustainability continued 	 – continuing our internal and external global awareness and  communication campaign, the ‘people of BHP’ series, which aims to  celebrate our diversity 	 – recording and launching a four-part podcast series on racial awareness,  with a series of BHP leaders in conversation with external subject  matter experts, to continue to support our people to develop a racially  aware mindset  	 – signing up to the RISE Project run by Diversity Council Australia,  to commence work in FY2025 to implement organisational change  interventions that will help address systemic and organisational   barriers for women from culturally and racially marginalised   (CARM) backgrounds  LGBT+ inclusion Our LGBT+ ally employee inclusion group, Jasper, established in 2017, is a  natural extension of our inclusion and diversity aspirations. Its membership  base grew to around 2,900 at the end of FY2024, with 16 chapters globally. In FY2024, we continued to advocate for LGBT+ inclusion and partner with  charities throughout the communities where we operate, to help our LGBT+  employees develop a strong sense of belonging inside and outside of our  offices and our mine sites.  In FY2024, BHP in Chile was recognised by the Human Rights Campaign  (HRC) with certification under the HRC Equidad CL program as one of the  ‘Best Places to Work LGBTI+ 2024’. The certification in Chile is delivered  by HRC, Pride Connection and Iguales Foundation and is awarded based  on a benchmark assessment of a company’s measurable workplace  equality and inclusion efforts for the LGBTI+ community. Disability To foster a workplace where people with a disability can fully participate  and thrive, during FY2024 we progressed the development of our first  global Disability Action Plan, which is expected to be launched during the  first half of FY2025. The plan seeks to address three strategic pillars –  people, culture, systems – to encourage, recognise and promote an active  commitment to improving accessibility and disability inclusion.  Though we are early in this journey, recognising that everyone has unique  needs and strengths, our ambition is to address and remove barriers so  that people with a disability can equitably participate in our workforce. Employee relations In Australia, the Federal Government has introduced several tranches  of significant industrial relations legislative reforms. In June 2023,  this included the introduction of changes to the enterprise bargaining  framework with multi-enterprise bargaining. During FY2024, the Federal  Government enacted the ‘same job same pay’ policy, enhanced workplace  delegates’ rights and empowered the Fair Work Commission to make  workplace determinations in the case of intractable bargaining. Not all the  legislative reforms have fully commenced operation and we will continue  to monitor how they are applied to further our assessment of impacts  on BHP and our contracting partners, including the potential to increase  labour costs.  In Chile, the 40-hour week regulation was enacted in April 2023 and  requires a gradual implementation over the next five-year period to move  from 45 to 40 working hours per week. During FY2024, implementation  commenced for the collective agreements that were completed, which  now include mandatory shift reductions to 42-hour weeks in April 2026  and 40-hour weeks by April 2028. We continue navigating and monitoring  progress on a number of legal developments that may have implications  for employee relations in Chile, for example, pension reform and branch  negotiation regulation.  During FY2024, Minerals Australia participated in 11 collective bargaining  processes, with seven enterprise agreements completed (with 23 presently  in operation) and four subject to ongoing negotiations as at 30 June  2024. In Minerals Australia, there was one round of collective bargaining  where protected industrial action occurred during FY2024 (BMACo  OCO Enterprise). Minerals Americas participated in four collective bargaining processes  during FY2024, with three completed prior to 30 June 2024 and one  concluded subsequent to 30 June 2024. No protected industrial action  occurred during FY2024 at our Minerals Americas operations in Chile.  Payroll review Review of employee allowances and entitlements In FY2023, we identified and disclosed two issues with certain allowances  and entitlements affecting some current and former employees in Australia.  We self-reported these issues to Australia’s Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO)  and engaged Protiviti, a global assurance firm, to undertake a review of our  payroll systems. We are sorry that this has happened and we are working  to make this right. We continue to progress historical remediation of both issues. We have  a dedicated hotline and secure online portal in place to support impacted  current and former employees and facilitate remediation payments.  We encourage any former employees who think they may be impacted by  these issues to contact us via the hotline or portal.  Refer to our website bhp.com/payroll-review The first issue involves certain rostered employees having leave incorrectly  deducted on public holidays. OZ Minerals was affected by a similar issue  before being acquired by BHP in May 2023. At the end of July 2024,  we had identified approximately 35,500 current and former employees  who are affected by this issue, dating back to 2010. Progress on  remediation includes: 	 – recrediting leave hours to approximately 19,000 current employees,  including employees who had been affected by a similar leave deduction  issue at OZ Minerals, before it was acquired by BHP in May 2023 	 – payments made to approximately 7,500 former employees impacted by  this issue, including those who had been affected during a prior period  of employment at OZ Minerals 	 – ongoing endeavours to connect with approximately 9,000 former  employees who we have identified as eligible for a payment but have not  yet been able to locate with the contact information we have We aim to complete the majority of public holiday leave deduction  payments by the end of FY2025.  The second issue involves current and former employees at Port Hedland  in Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO) who are entitled to additional  allowances due to an error with their employing entity in their employment  documentation. Following detailed analysis, we have identified  approximately 230 current and former employees affected by this issue,  dating back to 2013. We are continuing to pay additional allowances to  affected current employees. We are also progressing payments to affected  current and former employees for historical impacts.  Based on the currently available information, the cost of remediating  the leave issue and the employing entity issue, incorporating on-costs,  including associated superannuation and interest payments (BHP share),  remains in line with the previously recognised US$280 million pre-tax, as  reflected in the Group’s FY2023 financial results.  38 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 41 ===== Improving our payroll systems and processes In FY2023 we engaged Protiviti to conduct a review of BHP’s payroll  systems and framework, including governance, processes, controls and  systems. Protiviti’s review is ongoing. We are progressing a range of work  to improve our global payroll systems and processes, including embedding  stronger governance, controls and processes and continuing to invest  in the right capabilities to meet the needs of our broad operations and  workforce into the future. We expect this work to continue over the next  few years. We will continue to engage with the FWO and other relevant government  agencies as we progress this work. The Board and CEO have taken these issues seriously and a range of  consequences have been implemented for employees in connection  with these issues. Specifically, the Board has determined that the CEO’s  FY2024 CDP outcome will include a 4.3 percentage point reduction to  reflect his ultimate accountability for BHP’s payroll systems. This CDP  reduction for the CEO in FY2024 is US$185,000 and is equivalent to  25 per cent of the CEO’s target annual short term incentive pro-rated  for the portion of the relevant period that he was CEO. For others with  accountability for BHP’s payroll issues (including current and prior  ELT members) there have been reductions determined in the variable  remuneration outcomes ranging between 25 per cent to 100 per cent of  relevant annual target variable pay.   Other consequences have ranged from letters of warning, remuneration  consequences and termination of employment. Further detail is provided in the Remuneration Report. Sexual harassment The safety of our employees and contractors is paramount. Our priority  is to ensure our workplaces are safe and inclusive for all and to enact our  culture of care. This includes the elimination of sexual harassment, which  we recognise is unequivocally unacceptable. We encourage our people  to be active bystanders through education and leadership role modelling  and to report incidents so we can provide appropriate support and more  effectively address and eliminate sexual harassment at BHP. In FY2024, BHP’s strategy to eliminate sexual harassment was  underpinned by the Australian Human Rights Commission Guidelines for  Complying with the Positive Duty under the Sex Discrimination Act 1984  (Cth). Our strategy was also informed by external experts, such as Kristin  Hilton, Kate Jenkins AO along with Queensland University of Technology.  The strategy seeks to prevent sexual harassment by addressing the drivers  and risk factors and enhancing our response to incidents, early intervention  and taking a person-centred response by increasing support and agency  for impacted persons. We acknowledge how sexual harassment interacts or  combines with other psychosocial hazards and we have sought to address  this in the way we approach prevention through holistic risk management.  Risk management  Sexual harassment has been defined as a material health and safety risk at  BHP since CY2018. Our risk management approach includes conducting risk  assessments to identify scenarios in which sexual or gendered harassment  may arise, their potential causes and the controls we can implement to  prevent and reduce harm. This recognises the high intersectionality with other  psychosocial risks, which can increase the likelihood of sexual harassment  occurring and the severity of harm it can cause. We acknowledge there  are factors that contribute to the likelihood of workplace sexual harassment  that are more pronounced in the mining industry. This includes isolated or  remote working locations, a historically male-dominated workforce and  accommodation villages, roles and equipment design as well as factors that  are common across all industries and workplaces.  Our FY2024 focus was on implementing additional prevention controls  informed by our data and organisational learnings across all assets and  offices, including review and recommendations from third-party experts.  Our sexual harassment prevention controls are associated with further  education and maintaining respectful behaviours; leadership and culture;  recruitment processes; security measures at accommodation villages;  contractor and third-party engagement; data transparency and action;  person-centred care for impacted persons; accessible confidential reporting;  trauma-informed response and investigations, including multiple resolution  options and pathways; and appropriate and proportionate disciplinary action. Culture, knowledge and leadership  We are committed to fostering a positive culture that is safe, respectful and  inclusive for all workers (employees and contractors) and supports gender  equality and diversity at all levels and across all areas. Gender balance is a  key protective factor for sexual harassment prevention and BHP aspires to  have a gender-balanced employee workforce by end of CY2025.  In FY2024, we continued to engage and empower our entire workforce to take  action as active bystanders by enhancing their capabilities to identify and call  out disrespectful behaviour through scenario-based learning. BHP strives to  ensure leaders understand their obligations to prevent sexual harassment and  are visibly committed to safe, respectful and inclusive workplaces through  setting clear expectations and role modelling respectful behaviours.  Support and reporting We encourage our workforce to report any concerns relating to potential  sexual harassment, including by providing centralised and confidential  reporting tools and mandatory reporting requirements for line leaders.  Impacted persons are offered a range of support options throughout and  beyond the process to resolution. Investigations of reports of sexual harassment are conducted by our  specialised Response and Investigations team, which is independent from  our other business units. This team includes experts trained in a person- centred, trauma-informed approach to help place the impacted person  at the centre of decisions made during the investigation process and to  minimise the risk of further harm to that individual. Alternatively, resolution pathways can be used in certain cases.  This process only occurs where the resolution pathway is proportionate  to the nature of the conduct and with the agreement of the impacted  person. The resolution pathways include supported conversations with  respondents, additional training, monitoring or awareness raising on BHP’s  expectations of respectful behaviours in the workplace. We continue to  monitor and review the use of our resolution pathways to assess whether  they are meeting the needs of impacted people and to improve reporting to  support organisational lessons learned. Measuring We measure our progress against our initiatives and key metrics for sexual  harassment prevention and response, such as training completion, risk  management, control implementation and effectiveness, engagement  results and misconduct reporting data, and are committed to continually  improving our approach. De-identified information and trend analysis data  on the number of complaints, nature of complaints, resolution pathways,  outcomes and timelines are provided to senior leadership and the Board to  raise awareness and support continuous improvement of how we prevent  and mitigate the impacts of sexual harassment at BHP.  For more information on how we are improving our approach  to the prevention of and response to sexual harassment refer to   bhp.com/sustainability/safety‑health/sexual‑harassment Reports of sexual harassment There were 417 reports of sexual harassment in FY2024. These behaviours  are unacceptable and we are working to eliminate them at BHP by increasing  awareness and promoting reporting, response and investigations in relation  to these matters. Since October 2020, BHP managers and leaders have  been required to enter any misconduct concerns raised directly with them  into BHP’s misconduct reporting channels1 (with the impacted person  remaining anonymous if requested). In FY2024, 42 per cent of sexual  harassment reports received into BHP’s misconduct reporting channels  were logged by managers or leaders on behalf of their direct reports. During FY2024, across BHP’s global operations (including off site) and  offices, 100 investigated cases of sexual harassment2 conduct were  established as having occurred through an investigation.3  Of the 100 established cases: 	 – 1 involved a sexual assault 	 – 22 involved sexualised and indecent touching 	 – 32 involved sexually aggressive comments, stalking, grooming or  image‑based harassment 	 – 45 involved other forms of sexual harassment, including sexualised  conversations or jokes 1.	 BHP’s channels to raise misconduct concerns comprise an online portal and 24-hour multilingual call service. Reporting channels are confidential and accessible to all, including external  partners and stakeholders and the public, to report conduct that may be unethical, illegal or inconsistent with Our Code of Conduct. 2.	 Sexual harassment is, as defined in the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth), an unwelcome sexual advance, unwelcome request for sexual favours or other unwelcome conduct of a sexual  nature, in circumstances where a reasonable person would have anticipated the possibility that the person harassed would be offended, humiliated and/or intimidated. Sexual harassment  encompasses a range of conduct, including displaying sexually graphic images, sexually suggestive comments, suggestive or inappropriate looks, gestures or staring, non‑consensual  touching or acts of a sexual nature and sexual assault. We note the definition of sexual harassment may vary in different jurisdictions. 3.	 The calculation is based on reports closed in FY2024, containing one or more established allegations. Not all reports resulted in a finding. This can occur if there is insufficient information,  the respondent is not able to be identified or was previously terminated, or the impacted person did not wish to proceed. This figure includes cases opened in FY2024 and prior to FY2024  that were closed during the reporting period. When referring to cases closed during FY2024 this excludes cases that were still open at the end of the reporting period. 39 Overview Additional Information Financial Statements Governance Contents Operating and Financial Review  ===== PAGE 42 ===== 6 Sustainability continued 	 – 103 individuals responsible had their employment terminated (or were  removed from site if a contractor) or resigned In addition to the matters listed above, in FY2024 60 reports of sexual  harassment were dealt with by way of non-investigative resolution  pathways, instead of an investigation being conducted. In addition  to non‑investigative resolution pathways, there are cases of sexual  harassment that cannot be investigated due to insufficient information or  the wishes of the impacted person. Examples include anonymous reports  and non-participation of the impacted person. However, all cases are  assessed for safety and impacts as part of preliminary investigative actions  and all participants (if identified) are offered support irrespective of whether  the matter can be formally investigated. For more information on how we are improving our approach  to the prevention, response, support and measuring of sexual  harassment refer to bhp.com/sustainability/safety‑health/ sexual‑harassment 6.7 Health We set mandatory minimum standards to identify, assess and manage  health risks and their potential impacts, and monitor the health of our  employees and contractors.  Occupational exposures  BHP follows the hierarchy of controls to reduce occupational exposures to  as low as reasonably practicable. Our mandatory minimum performance  requirements for risk management and our Risk Framework support the  identification and management of occupational exposures. Where there is  a potential for our employees and contractors to be exposed to chemical  and physical hazards in workplace atmospheres, we implement controls  intended to prevent, minimise, and/or mitigate the likelihood and severity  of potential associated health impacts. These actions may include the use  of respiratory protective equipment until appropriate, higher-order controls  have been identified, implemented and verified to consistently reduce  exposure below occupational exposure limits. Occupational exposure limits  indicate the level of permissible exposure for a length of time (usually eight  hours) to a chemical or physical hazard that is not likely to affect the health  of a worker. Occupational exposure limits for our most material exposures  are set according to the latest scientific evidence.  Exposure data in this Report in all cases is presented without considering  protection from the use of personal protective equipment where required,  as outlined in our Health Global Standard.  In FY2024, for our most material exposures of diesel particulate matter  (DPM) and respirable silica, we had a 46 per cent reduction in the  number of employees and contractors potentially exposed compared  to our FY2023 exposure profile. More specifically, we have recorded a  23 per cent reduction in the number of employees and contractors with  potential exposure to DPM and 54 per cent reduction in the number of  employees and contractors potentially exposed to respirable crystalline  silica. When exposure reduction is considered over the last six years, we  have achieved a 78 per cent reduction to our most material exposures.  We continue to have zero employees and contractors routinely exposed  to coal mine dust above the occupational exposure limit. We are currently  undertaking a baseline exposure monitoring program at the former  OZ Minerals Australian assets and will provide a comparable exposure  profile in FY2025. Exposure reduction trend over time1,2,3,4 1,200 400 800 1,600 2,000 0 FY2020 FY2021 FY2022 FY2023 FY2024 Coal mine dust exposures Silica exposures DPM (Diesel) exposures We are committed to having no AL4 (fatalities and life-threatening  illnesses) events and a reduction in life-altering injuries and illnesses.  Due to the latency between initial exposure and diagnosis of disease  for our most material airborne contaminant exposures, we must  demonstrate ongoing exposure reduction and effectiveness of controls,  where exposures may remain elevated. In FY2023, reduction plans  were developed at the asset level across operations for implementation  with priority afforded to the asset’s most material exposures.  The implementation of these exposure reduction plans commenced  in FY2024 and will continue to be a focus in FY2025.  Welding fume exposure control has been a particular focus for several  assets across BHP throughout FY2024. Additional controls, including  on-torch extraction systems and portable local exhaust ventilation systems  have been implemented at Olympic Dam. Control effectiveness testing  has been carried out by the local Occupational Hygiene team, indicating  a 50 per cent reduction in welding fume exposure since September 2022.  Due to the success of this project, additional similar controls are now being  trialled in some of our other operations, including WAIO, at Mining Area C,  Jimblebar and Mt Whaleback. Occupational exposure hazard awareness and training is provided  at induction and periodically, including during fit testing for hearing  protection and respiratory protective devices. Wherever workers take  part in occupational exposure assessment programs, they receive  written feedback on their results and anonymised data is provided to  line management.  We have implemented real-time monitoring at several of our Minerals  Australia and Minerals Americas operated assets to support further  exposure reduction of silica and DPM. Fixed-position monitors identify  dusty conditions in real time enabling immediate controls, such as  increased ventilation or water sprays, to be deployed. Data from portable  monitors is made available at the end of shifts, rather than when results of  samples sent to the laboratory for analysis become available. This enables  prompt action to be taken if real-time monitoring demonstrates an  increasing trend in potential exposure. Occupational illness The reported occurrence of occupational illness for employees in FY2024  was 270, which was 3.77 per million hours worked. This represented a  13 per cent decrease in incidence compared with FY2023, which was  4.35 per million hours worked. For our contractor workforce, the reported  occupational illness in FY2024 was 216, which was 1.79 per million hours  worked, representing a 10 per cent decrease in incidence compared with  FY2023, which was 1.99 per million hours worked. As noted in our FY2024 performance against our social value scorecard  provided in OFR 6.5, BHP is committed to reducing life-altering injury or  illness and we continue to track the number of life-altering injuries and  illnesses internally. Since we commenced measuring our life altering  injury and illness metric, we have learned that a longer measurement  period is required for analysis to allow for the classification of more  chronic conditions. Therefore, it will not be reported on in this Report or  included as a key metric in the social value scorecard in FY2025. The two  main illness types that influence the number of life-altering illnesses are  musculoskeletal cases and noise-induced hearing loss cases, both of  which we continue to report on annually. Information relating to injuries   can be found in section 6.1. Musculoskeletal illness is the predominant occupational illness category for  BHP employees and contractors, representing 68 per cent of our workforce  illnesses in FY2024. These conditions include damage to bones, joints,  ligaments, tendons and soft tissues, caused by repetitive heavy work,  muscular strain, or maintaining poor postures for extended periods of time.  Noise-induced hearing loss represents 8 per cent of occupational illnesses  in FY2024. Employees and contractors exposed to noise levels above  the defined workplace exposure limits in our Health Global Standard  participate in hearing conservation programs, which include a periodic  hearing test and hearing protection fit testing. We have established design  recommendations that seek to eliminate or reduce high or prolonged noise  exposures by focusing on noise source.  1.	 Data excludes divested operations as follows: BHP Mitsui Coal (sale completed on 3 May  2022) and BHP’s oil and gas portfolio (merger with Woodside completed on 1 June 2022).  Prior years’ data (FY2020 to FY2022) has been re-stated to exclude these operations.  Divested BMA assets, Daunia and Blackwater (divested on 2 April 2024) are included in  FY2024 data up until the date of divestment.  2.	 Occupational exposures data excludes Projects. 3.	 Occupational exposure data excludes assets acquired as part of the OZ Minerals  acquisition. We are currently undertaking baselining of exposure data to provide  comparable exposure profile in FY2025.  4.	 As of FY2021, the occupational exposure limit for Coal was reduced to 1.5 mg/m3  compared to 2.0mg/m3 in previous years. 40 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 43 ===== Heat stress contributed to 4 per cent of our reported occupational illnesses  in FY2024. Elevated temperatures and strenuous activity place some of  our workforce at an increased risk of heat illness. High-risk work groups  are identified, and a range of controls are in place to manage heat stress.  In FY2024, a new heat awareness online learning module was released for  workers across Minerals Australia to provide workers with the knowledge  to identify signs of heat illness and how to manage the risks associated  with working in the heat. Hydration testing has also been made available  at several operations with high heat risk.  Recognising climate change may exacerbate existing temperature  related risks, in FY2024 we piloted an approach at Olympic Dam to  better understand and quantify the potential impact of heat stress on  our workforce under different future climate scenarios. Modelling was  based on climate data and temperatures within the underground mine  to determine potential productivity and health impacts caused by heat  stress under different scenarios. The findings of this assessment will  assist in the identification of additional controls that may be required  to ensure our workforce can perform their roles safely under changing  climatic conditions. Coal mine dust lung disease In FY2024, 21 cases of coal mine dust lung disease (CMDLD)1 were  reported to the Workers’ Compensation Regulatory Services.2 Of the  13 accepted claims in FY2024, two were current BHP employees, while  the remaining 11 were former employees. For cases involving current  employees, we offer counselling, medical support, and redeployment options  where relevant. Former employees are eligible for workers’ compensation  insurance and associated care is managed externally to BHP.  We have controls in place across all our relevant operated assets with the  goal of ensuring none of our employees and contractors are exposed to  respirable CMD above the occupational exposure limit (OEL). We continue  to identify and progress projects, such as real-time dust monitoring, to  facilitate our recognition and action when the working environment may  present a health hazard and seek to implement high order controls such as  engineering controls to eliminate or reduce exposures rather than continued  reliance on lower order controls such as respiratory protection. We have  observed consistent control of CMD exposures with no employees or  contractors potentially exposed to CMD above the OEL since FY2021. Physical and mental health The physical and psychological health and wellbeing of our workforce  is of paramount importance as we continue to work towards enhancing  the inclusivity and future-readiness of our employees and contractors.  In FY2024, we continued efforts to make meaningful and positive  improvement to employee health and wellbeing by building stronger  relationships via our active collaborations with industry partners.  We engaged with initiatives such as the ‘Minding Mining Minds’ (MMM)  which aims to develop tools and evidence-based models and share  learnings across industry, the Building Safe and Respectful Workplaces  (BSRW) which aims to help eliminate disrespectful behaviour in the  resources industry including sexual harassment, bullying and racism and  we have an active partnership with the Global Business Collaboration for  better mental health.  Our focus internally has been on embedding our learnings. In FY2024,  we embedded the BSRW principles into our global onboarding. A Global  Wellness Committee was also established, bringing together asset and  corporate office Wellness Committees into a global forum to collaborate  on initiatives, implement strategic improvements and share learnings.  The Committee aims to build mental health literacy, increase awareness  and benefit overall physical and mental wellbeing, and has maintained  a strong ongoing participation in global health campaigns, such as BHP  Mental Health Month, RUOK? day and Movember.  In FY2024, the Group Health team introduced the Women Can initiative to  promote women’s physical and mental health. The Women Can initiative  ran during March, aiming to lift the profile and importance of women’s  health and wellbeing. Through prestart education packs, personal shares  and panel discussions held with senior female leaders, including our Chief  People Officer, and Group HSS Officer, BHP provided education and an  opportunity for safe and impactful conversations on the importance of  self-care, health screening, menopause and providing a safe and inclusive  workplace. During this campaign, BHP formed a formal partnership  with Menopause Friendly Australia and is working towards achieving  accreditation as a menopause friendly employer where we aim to raise  awareness, educate staff and engage in training and policy and process  change to address women’s health and menopause in the workplace. Psychosocial risk management We continue to integrate psychosocial hazard identification and  management into the way we work. Our employees and contractors  are encouraged to identify and call out disrespectful behaviours that  may contribute to psychological harm, including bullying and sexual  harassment, as well as other psychosocial hazards. Our Psychosocial Risk Assessment Program was established in FY2023  and initially focused on our operated assets. In FY2024, we completed  psychosocial risk assessments across our global functions. From this work  we have developed an organisation-wide psychosocial risk profile across  five evidence-informed BHP-specific Psychosocial Hazard Domains – in  interpersonal; traumatic; physical (distance and fatigue); organisational and  job-inherent hazards. We will deploy these Hazard Domains to categorise  and rank psychosocial hazards and identify controls for our most significant  psychosocial hazards.   In FY2024, we developed and commenced the introduction of the BHP  Psychosocial Health Index, which we will complete in FY2025. This is an  assessment tool and confidential platform for employees and contractors to  provide feedback on how they experience the physical and psychological  aspects of their work environments, the social aspects of their job and the  design and management of work, together with an associated measure  of physical and mental health that helps us determine where harm may  be occurring.  As part of our Psychosocial Risk Assessment Program, we have also  expanded our support options, including providing additional pathways for  employees and contractors to seek information and support on preventing  and managing psychosocial hazards when they occur. We also expanded  and simplified our tools and guidelines in FY2024, centralising them in one  easily accessible hub and enabled ‘in the moment’ interactive support via  a new digital tool.  Support for employees affected by family and domestic violence BHP has a Family and Domestic Violence Assistance Program, which was  updated in FY2024, that aims to provide employees with support for their  health, safety, wellbeing and independence if they are experiencing family  and domestic violence.  As part of the program, employees can access up to 10 days’ additional  paid leave if they are affected by family and domestic violence or  supporting someone who is.  Support also includes emergency accommodation, emergency financial  help and access to safety and security plans. These supports consider  safety measures, such as transport to and from work, changing location of  work, setting up new phone numbers, screening/blocking calls and emails,  and supporting access to legal advice.  6.8 Ethics and business conduct Our conduct Our Code of Conduct (Our Code) is designed to help us make the right  decisions every day and deliver on our purpose to bring people and  resources together to build a better world. It applies to everyone who works  for us, with us or on our behalf. To assist our employees and contractors  understand how Our Code applies, regular training is undertaken.  Breaching Our Code can result in serious consequences and depending  on the severity of the breach this could include counselling, warnings and  even termination of employment. We encourage people to speak up where  a decision or action is not in line with Our Code or Our Values. BHP requires reports of business conduct concerns to be treated with  appropriate confidentiality and has policies in place intended to prohibit  any kind of retaliation against people who make or may make a report, or  who cooperate with an investigation. These may also include reports made  to regulators. We consider all forms of retaliation to be misconduct and  grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including termination. We have a  number of key policy and process documents to support a safe to speak up  culture, including our BHP Whistleblower Policy. Our Code is available in five languages and accessible at   bhp.com/about/operating-ethically/our-code#/ Our BHP Whistleblower Policy sets out additional information,  including protections available to persons who make eligible disclosures  under Australian law and accessible at bhp.com/-/media/documents/ ourapproach/operatingwithintegrity/taxandtransparency/240523_ bhpwhistleblowerpolicy 1.	 CMDLD is the name given to the lung diseases related to exposure to coal mine dust and includes coal workers’ pneumoconiosis, silicosis, mixed dust pneumoconiosis and chronic  obstructive pulmonary disease. 2.	 Cases reported to Workers’ Compensation Regulatory Services are not an indication that the CMDLD was related to work. BHP evaluates each case for work-relatedness and where  identified, the case will be included in occupational illness reporting. 41 Overview Additional Information Financial Statements Governance Contents Operating and Financial Review  ===== PAGE 44 ===== Reports received are assessed by the Ethics and Investigations team to  determine an appropriate response, which may include an investigation  or other resolution. In assessing the appropriate response, BHP applies  a proportionate and person-centred approach to the report considering all  participants. People impacted by reports of sexual harassment and racism  are offered specialised support by the Ethics Support Service, which  enables people impacted to have input into BHP’s response. The impacted  person’s preferences as well as the type and severity of the alleged  misconduct are considered in determining the appropriate response,  which may include an investigation, training, facilitated conversations and  line leader intervention. Quarterly reporting on the most serious reports is  provided to senior leaders and the Risk and Audit Committee, which has  representation of Board members, and includes reported case metrics,  outcomes and insights. The reporting supports leadership awareness and  informs priorities for ongoing improvement. Feedback is obtained regularly  from stakeholders, including case participants, external experts and  management, to continually improve our response to reports.  In FY2024, 5,087 reports regarding business conduct were received  directly into BHP’s channels to raise misconduct concerns.¹ Out of the  total misconduct reports, 25 per cent were raised by leaders on behalf of  someone else. There continues to be a great focus on health and wellbeing  in the workplace, and we have seen a 6 per cent decrease of bullying and  harassment cases from 3,067 in FY2023 to 2,870 in FY2024. Of the business conduct reports received, 41 per cent were made  anonymously.1 Of the total business conduct reports closed during  FY2024, 41 per cent contained one or more established allegations.2,3 Business conduct concerns raised in FY20241,4 	 Harassment and bullying (2,870) 56.4% 	 Health, safety or environment breach (640) 12.6% 	 Sexual harassment (417) 8.2% 	 Fraud (401) 7.9% 	 Discrimination (321) 6.3% 	 Cybersecurity, data privacy or   intellectual property breach (195) 3.8% 	 Other* (134) 2.6% 	 Racial harassment (109) 2.2% *	 Other: This includes issues such as Retaliation for speaking up; Deficiencies in a  business conduct investigation; Failure to Report Code of Conduct Breach; Attempting  to identify an anonymous reporter; Improper political or governmental conduct;  Human rights or modern slavery; Ask a question; Trade control breach; Inappropriate  investigator conduct in business conduct investigation; Consensual relationship with  power imbalance.   Employees and contractors can raise their concerns through a number of  channels (including anonymously) or through leaders. Anyone, including  external partners, stakeholders and the public, can lodge a concern in the  form of a report, either online in our channels to raise misconduct concerns  or via the 24-hour, multilingual call service.  Anti‑corruption  We continue our commitment to contribute to the global fight against  corruption in the resources industry. Our commitment to anti‑corruption  is embodied in Our Charter and Our Code. As part of this commitment, we prohibit authorising, offering, giving or  promising anything of value directly or indirectly to anyone to influence  them in their role, or to encourage them to perform their work disloyally  or otherwise improperly. We also prohibit facilitation payments, which  are payments to government officials for routine government actions.  Our people must take care that third parties acting on our behalf do not  violate anti‑corruption laws. Disciplinary action, including dismissal or  termination of contractual relationships, may follow from a breach of  these requirements.  To manage corruption risk, we work to achieve optimal resource allocation  to areas of our business with the highest exposure to corruption risks.  The identification, assessment and management of corruption risks  associated with growth opportunities remains a significant area of focus for  our Compliance function, via a sub-team dedicated to supporting functions  that are responsible for initiating transactions and growth opportunities in  countries with higher corruption risks.  Activities that potentially involve higher exposure to corruption risk require  review or approval by our Compliance function, as documented in our  anti‑corruption compliance framework. In FY2024, we continued conducting  monitoring focused on verifying the operation of anti-corruption controls in  relation to higher risk relationships and activities, including the provision of  community donations and sponsorships, identification and management of  corruption risks relating to government officials and community leaders in  the context of local procurement, and sole source procurement decisions. We regularly review our anti-corruption framework for compliance with  the requirements of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery  Act, the Australian Criminal Code and the applicable laws and regulatory  developments of all places where we do business. These laws are  consistent with the standards of the OECD Convention on Combating  Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.  Our Compliance function is independent of our assets and regions and  reports to the Chief Legal, Governance and External Affairs Officer.  Our Chief Compliance Officer also reports quarterly to the Risk and Audit  Committee on compliance issues and meets at least annually with the Risk  and Audit Committee Chair. The Compliance function also participates in anti-corruption risk  assessments in respect of our operated assets or functions, our interests in  non-operated assets and new business opportunities that we consider are  exposed to material anti-corruption risks. In FY2024, the function provided  input into 27 anti-corruption risk assessments. Building employee awareness remains critical to the effective management  of corruption risk across BHP. Anti-corruption training is required to  be provided to all employees and contractors as part of mandatory  regular training on Our Code. Our Compliance function also regularly  communicates and engages with identified higher-risk roles and provides  additional risk-based anti-corruption training for employees, contractors  and employees of some of our business partners and community partners.  In FY2024, we revised our anti-corruption electronic learning module  to incorporate new scenarios designed to reinforce understanding and  support learning. The new e-learning module is expected to be made  available in early FY2025.  For more information on ethics and business conduct refer to  bhp.com/ethics Transparency and accountability We support initiatives by governments of the countries where we  operate to publicly disclose the content of our licences or contracts  for the development and production of minerals that form the basis of  our payments to government, as outlined in the Extractive Industries  Transparency Initiative (EITI) Standard.  Other initiatives include our work with Transparency International chapters,  representation on the Board of the EITI, financial support for and Steering  Committee membership of the Bribery Prevention Network (in Australia)  and funding of the BHP Foundation, including its Natural Resource  Governance Global Program.  We believe knowing who ultimately controls and benefits from a company  helps to reduce risk and strengthen accountability. In FY2024, we  continued our active and public support for ultimate beneficial ownership  transparency. We maintained information on how we use beneficial  ownership information as part of our anti-corruption due diligence on  investments, partners, contractors and suppliers. We also continued to  make clear via published statements, including in Our Code and web  content, that we do not partner or contract with entities that are assessed  as presenting a high corruption risk that decline to provide beneficial  ownership information as part of our due diligence process. In parallel  with these steps, we continued to publish our list of entities in which BHP  Group Limited’s effective interest is 100 per cent and certain entities in  which BHP Group Limited’s effective interest is less than 100 per cent,  including all controlled subsidiaries operating in the mining sectors, all  mining operations joint ventures generating material revenue for BHP  (and available information in relation to the other legal owners in these  joint ventures) and entities in which we hold a partial interest (with some  exclusions – refer to bhp.com/sustainability/ethics-business-conduct).  These efforts are complementary to the BHP Foundation’s partnership  with EITI and Open Ownership to support governments to transform the  availability and use of beneficial ownership data for effective governance in  the extractive sector. 6 Sustainability continued 1.	 This excludes reports not containing a business conduct concern and excludes reports logged by leaders on behalf of others. 2.	 The calculation is based on reports closed in FY2024, containing one or more established allegations. Not all reports resulted in a finding. This can occur if there is insufficient information,  the respondent is not able to be identified, was previously terminated, or the impacted person did not wish to proceed. This figure includes cases opened in FY2024 and prior to FY2024  that were closed during the reporting period. When referring to cases closed during FY2024, it excludes cases that were still open at the end of the reporting period. 3.	 As the established rate reflects the number of cases established out of all business conduct concerns closed during the reporting period, the parameter has been updated to better reflect  the cases that are considered business conduct concerns at closure (i.e. the investigation category). Additionally, calculating the established rate based on investigation category provides  a more stable measure since case attributes can vary whilst the investigation is underway and unlikely to change once the investigation has concluded and case is closed. 4.	 FY2024 data includes all former OZ Minerals assets in Australia and Brazil. 42 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 45 ===== 6.9 Climate change We believe the warming of the climate is unequivocal, human influence is  clear and physical climate-related impacts are unavoidable. We recognise  the role we play in supporting the net zero transition the world must make.  For our full position on climate change refer to bhp.com/climate Climate‑related governance Climate change and climate transition planning is a material governance and  strategic issue for our Board and management. Additional details concerning  our climate-related governance for FY2024 have been made in our Climate  Transition Action Plan (CTAP 2024).  Our CTAP 2024 was approved by the Board, with its development and  ongoing implementation governed by the Board and its Committees  and management.  Our Board, Committees and management structure and roles as  they apply to climate-related matters, the skills and experience  of the Board and management and remuneration incentives for  management are disclosed in Enabling delivery – Our governance on  page 50 and Enabling delivery – Our management, remuneration and  organisational capability on page 51 of our CTAP 2024 available at  bhp.com/CTAP2024 For information on the role and composition of the Board and its  Committees and each Committee’s key activities in FY2024, including  in relation to climate-related matters, as well as the Board skills matrix,  the process for Board evaluation and director training, induction and  development, refer to our Corporate Governance Statement 3, 4 and  5 on pages 99 to 106, later in this Report Our disclosures and approach to reporting Climate Transition Action Plan In August 2024, we published our second Climate Transition Action  Plan, which sets out our strategic approach and plans for achieving our  operational and value chain greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets  and goals, as well as our response to climate-related risks (threats and  opportunities). This follows on from our first CTAP, which we published  in CY2021. Our CTAP 2024 is primarily a forward-looking plan and set of actions,  while this Report discloses in: 	 – This OFR 6.9: Progress in FY2024 against our climate change strategy,  GHG emissions targets and goals, commitments and key metrics  	 – Governance: An overview of governance structures, activities and  remuneration incentives, including those that relate to our climate  change strategy (additional detail concerning our governance around  climate-related risks is set out in our CTAP 2024) 	 – Financial Statements: Potential financial statement impacts, where  material or relevant, of the assumptions, plans and actions of our climate  change strategy and the consideration of climate-related risks in the  assessment of significant areas of judgement and estimation required  for the presentation of the financial statements  Our CTAP 2024 is available at bhp.com/CTAP2024 Given the global nature of our business, customers and supply chain,  the development of our CTAP 2024 considered the goals of the Paris  Agreement and the commitments and policy settings of relevant key  jurisdictions at this time. Our global headquarters are located in Australia,  which has a Long‑Term Emissions Reduction Plan and legislated national  targets to reduce Australia’s net GHG emissions to 43 per cent below  CY2005 levels by CY2030, and to achieve net zero GHG emissions  by CY2050. We continue to monitor and take into consideration the evolving policy and  regulatory landscape applicable to our operations as part of the periodic  review by management and the Board of the appropriateness of and our  progress towards our GHG emissions targets and goals.

The ‘Navigating our disclosures’ table on the previous page sets  out the TCFD’s recommended disclosures, grouped under the four  recommendations and where our aligned disclosures can be found   within this Report and our CTAP 2024.  Because our CTAP 2024 is our primary publication this year for  disclosing significant detail on our climate change plan for the climate  transition and our climate change strategy, we have included certain  TCFD‑recommended disclosures in our CTAP 2024 to enable them to be  read in that broader context. We do not repeat them in this Report to avoid  duplication. TCFD recommended disclosures for FY2024 that have been  published in our CTAP 2024 are: 	 – TCFD Strategy recommended disclosures (a) and (b): Our detailed  strategy and areas of focus for reducing operational GHG emissions  (Scopes 1 and 2 emissions from our operated assets), including our  industry collaboration and our material sources of operational GHG  emissions (i.e. electricity, diesel and fugitive methane emissions).

For FY2024, despite an increase from FY2023 (explained  later), our operational GHG emissions were 32 per cent lower against our  FY2020 baseline (baseline year and performance data adjusted; for more  information on the adjustments we make, refer to Climate-related metrics,  targets and goals on pages 52 to 59, later in this OFR 6.9). We have not  used carbon credits or applied offsetting in our assessment that we are  on track to meet our medium-term target.  	 – We achieved 100 per cent renewable electricity use at our Chilean  operations in CY2023 and are on track to achieve the same in CY2024.  In FY2024, we started our market engagement to deliver up to  500 megawatts (MW) of off-grid renewable electricity generation and  battery storage for WAIO.  	 – We announced our collaboration with Rio Tinto to share outcomes of the  first stage of CAT 793 and Komatsu 930 battery-electric haul truck trials  planned to occur at mine sites in Western Australia’s Pilbara region in  CY2024 and CY2026 respectively. 	 – We met our FY2024 social value scorecard Decarbonisation pillar  milestone to ‘commence the construction of a boiler diesel displacement  solution’ by progressing our Escondida boiler project through to  execution, with expected operations starting in CY2025. Once this  project is operational, and together with its counterpart project at  Spence, it is expected to displace up to 30 million litres of diesel per year  by using a zero GHG emissions heat source (combining a thermo-solar  and electric boiler solution).  	 – We partially met our FY2024 social value scorecard Decarbonisation  pillar milestone to ‘deliver equipment for proof-of-concept trials for  electrified rail and excavator solutions’ by starting our operational trial of  a Liebherr R9400 electric excavator at WAIO, the first in BHP’s fleet and  one of the first to be trialled in Australia. We also completed the design  of electrical infrastructure for our future electric truck trials and started  installation of charging infrastructure for our future electric locomotive  trials. These are important activities to enable our progress towards  diesel displacement and the electrification of vehicles and mining  equipment. We rated the milestone as only partially met due to delays.  We anticipate we will fully meet this milestone in FY2025 and do not  expect this to affect achievement of our medium-term target. Operational GHG emissions (Scopes 1 and 2 emissions   from our operated assets) Medium‑term   target:  Reduce operational GHG emissions (Scopes 1 and 2  emissions from our operated assets) by at least 30 per cent  by FY2030 from an FY2020 baseline.

Our view is that our pathway in coming years is  complicated by a number of factors, including projected organic changes  (i.e. arising from our existing business) in our production of commodities  and the current lack of available technology solutions to support more rapid  GHG emission reductions (particularly for diesel displacement). Our plan  to achieve our medium-term target accounts for these factors and we will  continue to look for opportunities to help see the emerging technologies we  need to reach technological readiness and commercial viability, to support  progress towards our long-term net zero goal. For FY2024, our total operational GHG emissions (unadjusted inventory)  increased by 2 per cent from FY2023 and our total operational energy  consumption increased by 4 per cent from FY2023. This was largely driven  by an increase in electricity and distillate/gasoline consumption from  former OZ Minerals sites in Copper South Australia, where we accounted  for a full 12 months in FY2024, compared to only two months in FY2023  (as we acquired OZ Minerals on 2 May 2023). There may be differences  between our annual total operational GHG emissions inventory (unadjusted  inventory) and the GHG emissions we measure for the baseline year,  reference year and performance for our operational GHG emissions  medium-term target and long-term net zero goal, resulting from different  approaches to the treatment of divestments, acquisitions and methodology  changes based on the purpose for which the data is being reported. For more information on the calculation of our annual total operational  GHG emissions data and total operational energy consumption data,  refer to Climate-related metrics, targets and goals on pages 52 to 59,  later in this OFR 6.9 For CY2023, the GHG emissions intensity of our production of our  commodities is estimated to rank in the first quartile for our iron ore,  copper and steelmaking coal mines, and the second quartile for our nickel  operations (ahead of all Indonesian-based operations) of global mining  operations analysed by CRU. This analysis is based on CY2023 data from  CRU (as CRU data is prepared on a calendar year basis), and includes  CRU’s assumptions and estimates of BHP’s operations. We transitioned  to using CRU (rather than Skarn Associates) for this analysis in FY2024 as  part of an annual vendor assessment and selection process.  For more information on how GHG emissions intensity of our production  of our commodities has been calculated and compared, refer to the BHP  ESG Standards and Databook 2024 available at bhp.com/climate Pathway to our medium-term target and long-term  net zero goal  The projected pathway to our medium-term target, as shown in the chart  below, is expected to set us up well for greater GHG emission reductions  after FY2030 through the following actions: 	 – procuring renewable and other low to zero GHG emissions electricity 	 – working to minimise the increase in operational GHG emissions from  organic production growth and new operational sites 	 – accelerating development and reducing risk exposure to diesel  displacement solutions through testing and sequenced deployment 	 – pursuing solutions to abate fugitive methane emissions Our plan is to meet our medium-term target through structural GHG  emissions abatement instead of offsetting. We will not use regulatory  carbon credits (i.e. those used for compliance under regulatory schemes  such as the Safeguard Mechanism in Australia) to meet our medium-term  target. In addition, in our projected pathway, we have not planned to use  voluntary carbon credits to meet our medium-term target. However if  there is an unanticipated shortfall in our pathway, we may need to use  voluntary carbon credits1 that meet our integrity standards to close the  performance gap.  Our potential pathway to our operational GHG emissions long-term net zero  goal beyond FY2030, as disclosed in our CTAP 2024, requires us to: 	 – displace diesel via electric mining equipment/vehicles (e.g. haul trucks,  locomotives, excavators, shovels) 	 – procure additional renewable and other low to zero GHG emissions  electricity to support the increased amount of electricity required for  electric mining equipment/vehicles 	 – minimise fugitive methane emissions to the greatest extent technically  and commercially viable, through enhanced application of existing or  emerging technology For our potential pathway to our operational GHG emissions   long-term net zero goal refer to the CTAP 2024 available at   bhp.com/CTAP2024 Projected pathway to our medium-term target for operational GHG emissions (Scopes 1 and 2 emissions from our operated assets)2  Operational GHG emissions (million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2-e)) (adjusted for acquisitions, divestments and methodology changes) 12 4 8 0 16 –32% Diesel Electricity Organic growth Range of uncertainty Other sources FY2020 Electricity Other changes FY2024 Organic growth Electricity Diesel Other  sources FY2030 1.	 We define regulatory carbon credits to mean carbon credits used to offset GHG emissions for regulatory compliance in our operational locations (such as the Safeguard Mechanism  in Australia). We define voluntary carbon credits to mean carbon credits generated through projects that reduce or remove GHG emissions outside the scope of regulatory compliance  (including Australian Carbon Credit Units not used for regulatory compliance). 2.	 Future GHG emission estimates are based on current annual business plans. Includes former OZ Minerals Australian assets and plans. Excludes Blackwater and Daunia (divested on   2 April 2024). FY2020 to FY2024 GHG emissions data has been adjusted for acquisitions, divestments and methodology changes. ‘Other changes’ refers to changes in GHG emissions  from energy consumption other than electricity. ‘Organic growth’ represents increase in GHG emissions associated with planned activity and growth at our operations. ‘Other’ refers to  GHG emissions from fugitive CO2 and methane emissions, natural gas, coal and coke, fuel oil, liquefied petroleum gas or other sources. GHG emissions calculation methodology changes  may affect the information presented in this chart. ‘Range of uncertainty’ refers to higher risk options currently identified that may enable faster or more substantive decarbonisation, but  which currently have a relatively low technology readiness level or are not yet commercially viable. 45 Overview Additional Information Financial Statements Governance Contents Operating and Financial Review  ===== PAGE 48 ===== 6 Sustainability continued Many of the technologies we will need to achieve our long-term net zero  goal for our operational GHG emissions are not yet ready to be deployed.  A pathway between our medium-term target in FY2030 and our long-term  net zero goal in CY2050 will require a significant technological step change  in safety, reliability, productivity, availability and economics. In the BHP Annual Report 2023, we published our operational GHG  emissions projected pathway to FY2030 and potential pathway between  FY2031 and CY2050. Incorporating the outcomes of our most recent  annual planning process, our operational GHG emissions projected (to  FY2030) and potential (beyond FY2030) pathways to our long-term net  zero goal has been updated for FY2024, with the primary changes being: 	 – a decrease in diesel GHG emissions abatement due to new  and unforeseen challenges experienced by original equipment  manufacturers, resulting in less certainty of technology and   commercial readiness of diesel displacement options 	 – an increase in the range of uncertainty due to less certainty of  technology and commercial readiness of diesel displacement options,  as well as our enhanced understanding of the challenges presented  by a change to our operations as complex and far‑reaching as large- scale electrification Additionally: 	 – our Jansen potash project’s heightened focus on operational  readiness for first production has deferred certain studies on low  to zero GHG emission energy options and GHG emission reduction  technologies until after first production commences (expected in late  CY2026). We continue to pursue commercial solutions with our partners  to reduce operational GHG emissions for Jansen. 	 – the planned FY2024 drilling program at BMA, which will assist in  obtaining a deeper understanding of methane quality and quantity (in  both magnitude and density), will now commence during FY2026/27.  Certain methane management studies have been completed at BMA  that identified some changes to the longer-term characterisation of its  methane gas profile and combined with investigations of other technical  and operational factors, these findings will inform the development of  a more targeted methane measurement, management and mitigation  strategy for our open-cut mines. These changes are not expected to have any material impact on our ability  to meet our operational GHG emissions medium-term target.  Based on what we know today, we estimate we can reduce our gross  operational GHG emissions by up to around 85 per cent against FY2020  levels by CY2050 (adjusted for acquisitions, divestments and methodology  changes) without the use of offsetting. We will continue to look for  opportunities to help see the emerging technologies we need to reach  technological readiness and commercial viability. For more information on our strategy and areas of focus to enable us to  achieve our operational GHG emissions medium-term target and long- term net zero goal refer to Operational GHG emissions on pages 10 to  18 of our CTAP 2024 available at bhp.com/CTAP2024 Capital allocation Capital allocation towards operational GHG emissions reduction initiatives  is considered as part of the maintenance capital category within our  Capital Allocation Framework. For FY2024, our capital (incremental) and  operating expenditure on initiatives associated with operational GHG  emission reductions was US$61 million. For more information on actual and planned expenditure to support  operational GHG emission reductions refer to Financial Statements note  16 ‘Climate change’ on pages 162 to 165 in this Report Value chain GHG emissions (Scope 3 emissions) Value chain Approach For FY2024, our reported Scope 3 emissions inventory (unadjusted inventory) increased by 2 per cent from FY2023. This was largely driven by reported  GHG emission increases in Category 1 ‘Purchased goods and services  (including capital goods)’ and Category 10 ‘Processing of sold products’  (specifically iron ore processing to crude steel). Our reported Scope 3  emissions inventory remains dominated by the processing of our iron ore  and steelmaking coal products (83 per cent) and, to a lesser extent, from the  combustion of energy coal (10 per cent), with additional contributions including  the GHG emissions associated with our direct suppliers (4 per cent) and the  shipping of our products (2 per cent).  We project the planned closure of our Mt Arthur Coal mine by FY2030  would result in Scope 3 emissions in Category 11 (which covers GHG  emissions from the end use of products sold by the reporting company,  such as the combustion of energy coal) becoming an insignificant source  in our reported Scope 3 emissions inventory. As explained in our CTAP 2024, we do not anticipate significant reductions  in our reported Scope 3 emissions inventory in the near term. This is  partly due to the way we currently estimate certain Scope 3 emissions  categories, which is generally not supplier- or customer-specific and  therefore would not reflect the GHG emission reductions they achieve.  We are seeking ways to improve the availability of data and have included  this as part of our strategy. We have had some early successes with data  availability for shipping and our use of the Veracity data platform for carbon  accounting. Our aim remains to progressively improve our capability to  measure Scope 3 emissions, particularly for GHG emissions from our  customers’ processing of iron ore and steelmaking coal to produce steel  which falls within Category 10, ‘Processing of sold products’. There may be differences between our annual reported Scope 3 emissions  inventory (unadjusted inventory) and the GHG emissions we measure for  the baseline year, reference year and performance for our value chain  GHG emissions medium-term goals and long-term net zero targets and  goal, resulting from different GHG emissions boundaries and/or different  approaches to the treatment of divestments, acquisitions and methodology  changes based on the purpose for which the data is being reported. In FY2024, we adjusted the data for our value chain GHG emissions  targets and goals baseline year, reference years and annual performance  for methodology changes and, for the first time, material acquisitions and  divestments (for our material Scope 3 emissions categories). The primary  impact was to our FY2020 reported Scope 3 emissions inventory, which  reduced from 413.6 MtCO2-e (unadjusted inventory) to 352.0 MtCO2-e  (adjusted for acquisitions, divestments and methodology changes). For more information on the calculation of our annual reported Scope 3  emissions inventory, and on the adjustments we have made to the data  for the baseline years, reference years and annual performance for our  value chain GHG emissions medium-term goals and long-term net zero  targets and goal refer to Climate-related metrics, targets and goals on  pages 52 to 59 in this OFR 6.9 Our strategy to support reduction of GHG emissions in our value chain has  four primary focus areas:  1.	Support the development and adoption of GHG emissions intensity  reduction technologies in steelmaking  2.	Enhance the quality of the iron ore and steelmaking coal we produce (as the  GHG emissions intensity of conventional blast furnace steelmaking can be  reduced by improving the quality of the iron ore and steelmaking coal used)  3.	Encourage direct suppliers to pursue net zero for their operational GHG  emissions (Scopes 1 and 2 emissions) 4.	Support the development and adoption of GHG emission reduction  technologies in shipping These focus areas have been set with consideration of the scale of GHG  emissions in our value chain, the level of impact we can achieve with  stakeholders and industry, and the alignment to our portfolio strategy. For FY2024, our capital and operating expenditure on initiatives associated  with value chain GHG emission reductions was US$33 million. For more information on actual and planned expenditure to support value  chain GHG emission reductions refer to Financial Statements note 16  ‘Climate change’ on pages 162 to 165 in this Report For more information on our committed funding and estimated co- investments by us and others to support value chain GHG emission  reductions refer to Value chain GHG emissions on pages 19 to 30   in our CTAP 2024 available at bhp.com/CTAP2024 Operational GHG emissions from our non-operated joint venture interests  are reported in our Scope 3 emissions inventory under Category 15  ‘Investments’ and are an immaterial source of Scope 3 emissions when  compared to our FY2024 reported Scope 3 emissions inventory. We see  our role in non-operated assets as primarily to encourage and seek to  influence them through their respective governance structures to reduce  their operational GHG emissions, as well as sharing decarbonisation  knowledge and experience where appropriate. 46 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 49 ===== Steelmaking Performance and highlights 	 – We met our FY2024 social value scorecard Decarbonisation pillar  milestone to ‘complete a pilot scale electric smelting furnace design  study’ with the global engineering firm Hatch. This study firmed up the  technical scope, risks and costs and underpinned our decision to take the  technology forward with industry partners. 	 – We started a joint study for the development of an electric smelting  furnace pilot facility in Australia, pooling our knowledge and project  resources with our study partners BlueScope and Rio Tinto.​ 	 – We commissioned carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS)  pilot equipment and commenced industrial trials capturing CO2 from  blast furnace gas at Ghent steelworks in Belgium, in collaboration with  ArcelorMittal and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.  	 – We signed two partnership project agreements with leading Chinese  steelmakers Baowu and HBIS to trial production and smelting of iron ore  pellets and direct reduced iron utilising BHP iron ores.​ 	 – We produced electrically smelted iron from BHP iron ores using  hydrogen reduction and electric smelting technologies at laboratory  scale at the BHP Centre for Sustainable Steelmaking Research  (University of Newcastle, Australia) and conducted batch trials at 100 kg  scale at Aachen University in Germany. 	 – We engaged with 92 per cent of our direct iron ore and steelmaking  coal sales customers on GHG emission reduction pathways and carbon  accounting methodologies. Longer-term industry pathways and strategy We support the steelmaking sector and our customers to develop solutions  to reduce the GHG emissions intensity of steel production. We do this  through a mix of collaborative partnerships and consortiums, research,  investments through BHP Ventures (our dedicated venture capital unit),  and emissions data calculation standardisation and transparency. We use our conceptual ‘steel decarbonisation framework’ as a foresight  tool. It consists of the four process routes which, in our view, offer the  greatest potential for developing into near zero emission steelmaking1  with sufficient flexibility, scalability and efficiency to support widespread  adoption. The four process routes are described by the core ironmaking  furnace or reactor used (i.e. blast furnace, electric arc furnace, electric  smelting furnace and electrolysis). We now have projects with 48 industry partners – including nine  steelmaking customers representing 20 per cent of reported global steel  production according to recent World Steel Association data, 16 research  institutes and 11 technology companies (both start-ups and vendors).  Our CTAP 2024 provides more detail of potential longer-term industry  pathways and our strategy and actions, including case studies of  our projects. For more information on potential industry pathways and our strategy  and actions to support the reduction of steelmaking GHG emissions  intensity in our value chain and our plan to achieve our medium-term  goal refer to Value chain GHG emissions – Steelmaking: Our Scope  3 emissions goal to support capability for GHG emissions intensity  reduction on pages 24 and 25 of our CTAP 2024 available at   bhp.com/CTAP2024 Direct suppliers Performance and highlights We continued to engage with and encourage our top 500 direct suppliers  to set their own operational GHG emissions (Scopes 1 and 2 emissions)  targets or goals to align with our long-term target to achieve net zero by  CY2050 for the operational GHG emissions of our direct suppliers, with  engagement made across 78 per cent of those top 500 suppliers to date. Industry pathways and strategy Each year we spend billions of dollars on goods and services from  thousands of suppliers. Our strategy targets the top 500 direct suppliers  by spend, which contributed to 78 per cent of our FY2024 total spend  on suppliers. Our strategy encompasses three areas of focus – selective purchasing,  supportive engagements and measurement and monitoring.  Our CTAP 2024 provides more detail of potential longer-term industry  pathways and our strategy and actions.

This is due to technology advances as well as the evolution of our strategy.  Value chain GHG emissions (Scope 3 emissions) – Direct suppliers Long‑term   net zero target:  Achieve net zero by CY2050 for the operational  GHG emissions (Scopes 1 and 2 emissions) of   our direct suppliers. Performance, adjusted MtCO2-e FY2020 FY2021 FY2022 FY2023 FY2024 0 5.0 10.0 15.0 20.0 11.6 14.3 47 Overview Additional Information Financial Statements Governance Contents Operating and Financial Review  ===== PAGE 50 ===== 6 Sustainability continued Shipping Performance and highlights 	 – We are on track to meet our medium-term goal to support 40  per cent GHG emissions intensity reduction of BHP-chartered  shipping of BHP products by CY2030 from a CY2008 baseline year.  For FY2024, the GHG emissions intensity of BHP-chartered shipping  was 42 per cent below CY2008 (baseline year and performance  adjusted; for more information on the adjustments we make refer  to Climate-related metrics, targets and goals on pages 52 to 59 in  this OFR 6.9). We believe it will be possible to at least maintain, if  not reduce, GHG emissions intensity in the coming years, although  this will be challenging because of our expanding business activity  and the associated dependence on the availability of GHG emission  reduction solutions. 	 – We completed the retrofit of a wind assisted propulsion system (a  flettner rotor) on M/V Koryu with our customer and partner Pan Pacific  Copper and Norsepower. This vessel will be used for delivery of our  copper concentrates from Chile to Japan. We intend to report the GHG  emission reductions achieved by this in FY2025. 	 – We met our FY2024 social value scorecard Decarbonisation pillar  milestone to ‘engage the market to introduce additional lower/zero GHG  emission BHP-chartered vessels through industry partnerships’ by  progressing our expression of interest for an ammonia value chain (the  supply of, and a vessel’s use of, low to zero GHG emission ammonia as a  marine fuel) and consolidating our position in the market. Our next steps  are to continue working with shortlisted participants across technical,  commercial and supply assurance aspects with an intention to deploy  these vessels on our iron ore trade route in the latter half of this decade.  	 – Our expression of interest for an ammonia value chain aims to set  up a potentially viable pathway to meet our First Movers Coalition  commitment that, by CY2030, 10 per cent of our total products shipped  to our customers using our time charter vessels will be using zero  GHG emission fuels. This commitment is subject to the availability  of technology, supply, safety standards and the establishment of  reasonable thresholds for price premiums. Industry pathways and strategy The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has set levels of ambition  for the international shipping sector that aim to progressively reduce GHG  emissions and reach net zero GHG emissions by or around CY2050. In the 2020s, the largest GHG emission reduction opportunities for  international shipping are expected to come from improved operational  and technological energy efficiency, including voyage optimisation and  energy savings devices. Use of technologically ready lower GHG emission  alternative fuels (e.g. biofuels, liquified natural gas) are still dependent on the  availability of supply in shipping routes and their commercial viability.  In the longer term, switching to low to zero GHG emission fuels that are  currently technologically not ready (e.g. ammonia produced with low to  zero GHG emissions, civil nuclear technologies for commercial vessel  propulsion) is expected to be a significant lever. As one of the world’s largest dry bulk charterers, we play an important  role in supporting the international shipping sector to meet or exceed  the GHG emission reduction ambitions set by the IMO. Our strategy  encompasses three areas of focus – efficiency improvements, lower GHG  emission and low to zero GHG emission alternative fuels, and improved  carbon accounting.  Our CTAP 2024 provides more detail of longer-term industry pathways and  our strategy and actions. For more information on potential industry pathways and our strategy  and actions to support the reduction of shipping GHG emissions in our  value chain and our plan to achieve our medium-term goal and long- term net zero target refer to Value chain GHG emissions – Shipping:  Our Scope 3 emissions goal to support GHG emissions intensity  reduction and net zero target on pages 29 and 30 of our CTAP 2024  available at bhp.com/CTAP2024 Climate‑related risk management How we identify and manage climate‑related risk At BHP, we take an enterprise approach to risk management and operate  under one Risk Framework for all risks, including climate-related risks  (threats and opportunities). Our Risk Framework requires the identification  and management of risks to be embedded in business activities and  provides requirements and guidance on the tools and processes  to manage current and emerging risks. Our mandatory minimum  performance requirements for risk management and the Climate Change  Global Standard set the minimum requirements to manage climate-related  risks and apply across our operated assets and functions, and to decision- making processes for sales, marketing and procurement.  To support the identification and management of climate-related risks  at BHP, we monitor and interpret external signals, events and trends  associated with transition risk and physical climate-related risk, which  may include existing and emerging scientific, policy, legal and regulatory,  reputational, and market developments.  Risk owners of climate-related risks must assess physical and transition  climate-related risks, considering potential impacts, including to safety,  productivity and cost across operated assets, value chains, infrastructure  and services, and host communities.  The Climate Change Global Standard also sets mandatory minimum  requirements for assessing physical climate-related risks (refer to Physical  climate-related risks and adaptation in this OFR 6.9, for our progress to  date), as well as for asset-level climate change plans and the value chain  climate adaptation plan owned by our Commercial function. A number  of these assessments and plans are still underway, and they are also  regularly reviewed and revised to ensure continued relevance.

The MFL is the estimated impact to BHP in a worst-case  scenario without regard to probability and assuming all controls are  ineffective. This supports us to prioritise and understand the significance of  climate-related risks in relation to other risks. For more information on how we manage risk (including climate-related  risk) and our risk factors refer to OFR 8 on pages 73 to 82 in this Report We recognise a changing climate can influence or exacerbate risks across  our risk profile, including those associated with asset integrity, pricing of  inputs, access to markets, changes to regulation and access to funding.  Decisions on the prioritisation of actions to manage climate‑related threats  or pursue climate-related opportunities are made consistent with our  standard risk management, planning and investment processes applicable  to all risks identified under our Risk Framework. Using a consistent  approach allows us to consider climate-related risks across our business  to focus our actions on those that are material and integrate management  of them into our core activities and business plans. We continue to embed  climate-related risk across our risk profile and to improve the controls  required to manage threats or enhance opportunities. We also continue  to review our climate-related risk profile periodically, seeking to identify,  assess and manage new or evolving climate‑related risks. Climate‑related risks In setting and monitoring the delivery of our strategy, we consider  identified climate-related risks (threats and opportunities), both physical  and transition (as applicable and to the extent their potential impacts are  sufficiently understood) across the following time horizons:  	 – short‑term (zero to two years), aligning with our two‑year budget process 	 – medium‑term (two to five years), defining supportive actions and  initiatives that sit outside of our two‑year budget process in order to  support our long‑term strategy 	 – long‑term (five to 30 years, or longer in certain cases), given our supply,  demand and pricing forecasts and our scenarios for portfolio analysis  extend to CY2050 and in some cases beyond Climate‑related risks are broadly categorised as:  	 – Transition risks, which arise from existing and emerging policy,  regulatory, legal, technological, market and other societal responses  to the challenges posed by climate change and the transition to a net  zero economy  For detailed disclosures on the management of transition risks  refer to Transition to a net zero economy on page 50 in this OFR 6.9,  and in Portfolio on pages 31 to 38 in our CTAP available at   bhp.com/CTAP2024 	 – Physical risks, which refer to acute risks that are event‑driven (including  increased severity and frequency of extreme weather events) and  chronic risks resulting from longer‑term changes in climate patterns  For detailed disclosures about the studies we are undertaking  to assess our exposure to physical climate-related risks refer  to Physical climate-related risks and adaptation on page 51  in this OFR 6.9 Relevant BHP Group risk  factors (refer to OFR 8 for  more information) Climate-related risk Potential influence of   climate-related issues on   BHP Group risk factors over time1 Short-term   (0 to 2 years) Medium-term   (2 to 5 years) Long-term   (5 to at least  30 years) Transition risk Operational events 	 – Technological solutions to reduce GHG emissions Low Low to  medium High Significant social or  environmental impacts 	 – Engaging in or association with activities with actual or perceived adverse  climate-related impacts 	 – Failure to meet evolving stakeholder expectations 	 – Political, regulatory or judicial developments Low Low to  medium High Low‑carbon transition 	 – Low to zero GHG emission technologies or changes in customer preferences  altering demand for our products 	 – Perceptions of climate-related financial risk reducing access to capital and/or  insurance for BHP or our customers or suppliers 	 – Reputational damage and litigation 	 – Adverse market, legal or regulatory responses  Low Low High Adopting technologies and  maintaining digital security 	 – Technological solutions to reduce GHG emissions Low Low High Optimising growth and  portfolio returns 	 – Failure to achieve expected commercial objectives due to climate-  related impacts Low Low High Accessing key markets 	– Legal or regulatory changes, with respect to carbon-intensive industries and exports Low Low High Inadequate business resilience 	 – Geopolitical, global economic, regional or local developments or adverse events Low Low High Physical risk Operational events 	 – Extreme weather and other climate-related events that may impact production Low Low Medium Significant social or  environmental impacts 	 – Failure to adequately identify or to appropriately manage physical   climate-related risks Low Low to  medium Medium Inadequate business resilience 	 – Acute and chronic physical climate-related impacts, event-driven and   longer-term changes in climate patterns Low Low Medium 1.	 The estimated potential (i) change to the level of influence of relevant climate-related issues and their associated risk factors on BHP’s existing risk exposure and/or (ii) degree to which  they may exacerbate existing risks within our risk profile, based on currently available information and noting that some assessments are preliminary and/or incomplete (particularly in  relation to physical climate-related risk) and may change significantly. Climate change and climate-related risks have the potential to influence or exacerbate risks across our operations and functions and are required to be  considered and, where applicable, integrated in accordance with our Risk Framework into our asset risk profiles to be managed across each of these time  horizons (see the table above). The linkage of these time horizons to our planning processes and activities and strategy formation informs our decision- making and enables us to take appropriate and timely risk management actions. For more information on BHP’s Risk Framework, how we manage climate-related risks and the potential  impact to BHP operations refer to OFR 8 on pages 73 to 82 in this Report 49 Overview Additional Information Financial Statements Governance Contents Operating and Financial Review  ===== PAGE 52 ===== 6 Sustainability continued Transition to a net zero economy Our portfolio’s resilience We continue to seek to maximise our exposure to products that enable and  support decarbonisation and electrification, urbanisation and a growing  population, and to minimise the risk that capital may be stranded in a  rapidly decarbonising world. To support this outcome, we consider a range  of inputs, including our 1.5°C scenario, when testing the resilience of our  portfolio and making investment decisions.  Our CTAP 2024 analyses our portfolio’s resilience in our new 1.5°C  scenario and describes key input assumptions, analytical methods, outputs  and sensitivities we used in or derived from this scenario. We use our planning range (our long-term forecast of demand, supply and  price across our commodities) for operational planning. It is comprised of  three unique, independent planning cases: a ‘most likely’ base case, and  an upside case and downside case that provide the range’s boundaries.  These three cases reflect proprietary forecasts for the global economy  and associated sub-sectors (i.e. energy, transport, agriculture, steel) and  the resulting market outlook for our core commodities. The assessments  of future states are not explicitly climate scenarios designed to test the  resilience of our portfolio to different global climate action trajectories.  However, in all three future state estimates, while the global gross domestic  product assumptions and pace and drivers of decarbonisation policy and  technology diffusion vary, most developed economies reach net zero  around CY2050, with other developing economies reaching net zero in  CY2060 and CY2070. The modelled output of our planning range results  in global CO2 emission pathways implying a projected global temperature  increase of around 2°C by CY2100.  Our planning range’s demand, supply and price forecasts for key  commodities are used to inform data inputs into our operational modelling  and drive operational planning. Our planning range is also used for  strategy formation and investment decisions. We use our 1.5°C scenario to derive commodity price sensitivities to  assess potential impacts on portfolio value compared with our base case  valuations using our planning range. Our modelling indicates our portfolio  remains resilient under our 1.5°C scenario. The value of our copper, potash  and nickel assets increases relative to the base case of our planning  range, and offsets the effect to our portfolio from some downside risk to  steelmaking coal. The net present value of our portfolio under our 1.5°C  scenario is approximately the same as under the current base case of our  planning range, indicating we would be resilient in an accelerated transition  to a 1.5°C outcome. Western Australia Nickel’s temporary suspension  (see below) has not altered our scenario analysis, which includes nickel  in our portfolio. As described elsewhere in this Report, as well as in our CTAP 2024,  we continue to reposition our portfolio towards commodities that can  enable and support megatrends, such as global decarbonisation and  electrification. Our actions to enable and support include BMA’s divestment  of the Blackwater and Daunia mines as a further step to concentrate our  coal portfolio on the higher-quality (grade) coals increasingly preferred by  steelmaking customers and the acquisition of OZ Minerals in FY2023 to  support the creation of a South Australia copper basin. We expect such  actions to further enhance the overall resilience of our portfolio over time. In July 2024, we announced our Nickel West operations and West  Musgrave project (Western Australia Nickel) would be temporarily  suspended from October 2024. Over the longer term, our 1.5°C scenario  and the base case of our planning range see nickel demand growing in  response to the transition. However, the decision to temporarily suspend  operations follows oversupply in the global nickel market. At the time of our  announcement, forward consensus nickel prices over the next half of the  decade had fallen sharply reflecting strong growth of alternative low-cost  nickel supply. For more analysis of our portfolio’s resilience in our new 1.5°C scenario  and more information about the three planning cases in our planning  range and their use refer to Portfolio on pages 31 to 38 of our CTAP  2024 available at bhp.com/CTAP2024 For key assumptions and metrics for our new 1.5°C scenario and a  comparison with other 1.5°C scenarios refer to Additional information –  Our 1.5°C scenario assumptions and the signposts we monitor   on page 61 and Additional information – Our 1.5°C scenario   compared to benchmarks on page 62 of our CTAP 2024 available   at bhp.com/CTAP2024 For disclosures related to potential financial statement impacts in our  new 1.5°C scenario refer to Financial Statements note 16 ‘Climate  change’ on pages 162 to 165 in this Report Impact on our business, strategy and capital alignment  and allocation The final (or sufficiently resolved) results of our climate-related risk  assessments across our short-, medium- and long-term time horizons  (as described on the previous page 49), as well as our 1.5°C scenario,  are considered and integrated into our strategy and as a sensitivity in our  capital allocation processes. This enables us to test the extent to which our  business and capital allocation are aligned with a rapidly decarbonising  global economy.  We are undertaking our studies of physical climate-related risks to  progressively identify, assess and quantify the potential future impacts to  site operations, productivity and estimated cost for our operated assets.  Once the results of the risk quantification studies for our operated assets  are completed, we propose to use the results to inform updates to our  risk profile, including new risk management activities, inform corporate  planning, identify areas where we should focus our assessment of new or  strengthened controls or adaptation responses, and assess the financial  and social value of adaptation measures.

For our qualitative and quantitative disclosures related to carbon  pricing refer to Financial Statements note 16 ‘Climate change’ on  pages 162 to 165 in this Report Equitable change and transition We seek meaningful, long‑term, mutually beneficial relationships that  respect local cultures. We aim to support the development of diversified  and resilient local communities and economies that contribute to wellbeing  that continues beyond the life of our operated assets. For information on the work we are undertaking to leave a positive  legacy from our mining in the Hunter Valley as we move towards  the planned closure of Mt Arthur Coal refer to Equitable change  and transition on pages 46 to 48 of our CTAP 2024 available at   bhp.com/CTAP2024 Climate policy advocacy We believe governments around the world should adopt and progress  policies aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement to limit the increase  in the global average temperature by CY2100 to well below 2°C above  pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C.  We commit to conducting our climate policy advocacy consistent with  these goals in our direct advocacy and our indirect advocacy. Our Climate  Policy Principles show how we intend this commitment to be translated  into action. Our Climate Policy Principles, the approach we take to our direct and  indirect advocacy, and our latest advocacy disclosures are available at  bhp.com/sustainability/climate-change/advocacy-on-climate-policy and  bhp.com/about/operating-ethically/industry-associations For more information on our policy advocacy refer to Climate policy  advocacy on pages 39 to 41 of our CTAP 2024 available at   bhp.com/CTAP2024 50 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 53 ===== Physical climate‑related risks and adaptation	 A changing climate can exacerbate and create physical climate‑related  risks, which include: 	 – Acute physical climate-related risks: Extreme climatic events, such  as floods, cyclones and heatwaves, that may be more severe or more  frequent because of a changing climate 	 – Chronic physical climate-related risks: The incremental worsening of  conditions, such as the gradual increase in the number of extreme heat  days over the years, or rising sea levels The mining sector is exposed to both acute and chronic physical  climate-related risks because of its remote outdoor operations with  labour and physical capital exposed to the elements, and because of  its dependency on global value chains. The long lives of mining assets  mean they could encounter deteriorating conditions in later decades.  Geographically dispersed sites and value chains increase the diversity of  physical climate-related impacts we could encounter.  We are undertaking studies to assess our exposure to physical climate- related risks that draw on science-based climate data. We are working   to complete these studies and continue verification and review of results   in FY2025. Our approach to evaluating our operational physical climate- related risks is illustrated in the ‘Our approach to physical climate-related  risk’ diagram on this page. Climate modelling  We commissioned WTW (one of our insurance advisors) to develop a  climate dataset covering our operated assets and some key value chain  locations, to develop a more holistic understanding of the potential  parameters of our physical climate-related risk exposure and how it may  change over time. This climate dataset is based on the publicly available Shared  Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) scenarios used by the Intergovernmental  Panel on Climate Change, and includes latest generation (Coupled Model  Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)) and CMIP5 climate models,  applied to our operated assets. The dataset covers more than 20 climate- related hazards potentially relevant to our global operations, such as average  temperature, extreme precipitation, and cyclones, which can represent  physical climate-related risks. Alongside this we apply local observational  climate data and other sources of climate projections. This approach allows  us to develop a localised view of potential impacts, including changes in  rainfall patterns, average and maximum temperatures and sea level rise. The climate dataset includes a baseline (CY2001 to CY2020) and  projections for three future time horizons (CY2026 to CY2045, CY2046 to  CY2065, CY2066 to CY2085) for the following Intergovernmental Panel on  Climate Change SSP-based GHG emission scenarios:1 	 – Low‑case: Estimated average global temperature increase of 1.8°C by  CY2100 (SSP1‑2.6)  	 – Mid‑case: Estimated average global temperature increase of 2.7°C by  CY2100 (SSP2‑4.5) 	 – High‑case: Estimated average global temperature increase of 4.4°C by  CY2100 (SSP5‑8.5)  The table ‘Potential physical climate-related risks at our operated assets  and in their value chains’ on this page shows the physical climate-related  risks that our studies to date indicate could have potential impact for our  operated assets (including via impacts in our value chain). The first stage  of our analysis looks at our operated assets that are currently producing  (excluding NSWEC and former OZ Minerals sites) and our Jansen potash  project. We plan to include currently producing former OZ Minerals sites  and to expand and adapt our approach to incorporate our legacy assets  and NSWEC in FY2025. Our approach to physical climate-related risk  Climate data projections: Use of climate data and  projections for different scenarios and time horizons Safety, productivity and cost impacts:  Applying internal models to assess potential  impacts to safety, cost and productivity Financial impacts and value-at-risk: Incorporating  assessment results into internal planning models to  understand potential financial impacts and value-at-risk Incorporating into business planning,  risk management and capital allocation:  Embedding consideration of physical climate-related  risk (including value-at-risk) into business planning,  risk management, and capital allocation, as required Operational site impacts: Engineering assessments  to understand the potential direct impact of  climate-related events on our sites 1.

However, we do not currently use these as our core metrics for the assessment and management of climate‑related risks. For more information on our social value and sustainability‑related goals, metrics and milestones refer to OFR 6 Sustainability   beginning on page 29 in this Report The role of our commodities in the transition We continue to engage with investors, industry and standard setters to explore ways of establishing clear methodologies for classification and measurement  of ‘green revenue’1 and associated capital expenditure within the resources sector. We note that, at present, there are still divergent and evolving views  globally on what constitutes green revenue, with no clear definition or expectations for other sustainability indicators for the resources sector. Traceability of end use for many commodities, such as copper and nickel, remains a challenge as they undergo multiple stages of processing and have  a diverse range of end uses. Given this continued uncertainty, we have presented multiple classifications of certain of our commodities to reflect a view  on their actual or potential contribution to the transition to a net zero economy.  The classification we have given to our commodities (described in the table below) is intended to be an indicative approach pending clear and resolved  methodologies for identifying key transition materials that contribute to the transition to a net zero economy and the calculation of the revenues they  generate. We also acknowledge the classification focuses on the theme of enabling the transition to a net zero economy to mitigate climate change,  and broader sustainability indicators in relation to how these commodities are produced are also important to consider. Classification Definition Commodities Climate Action 100+ Net Zero Standard for Diversified Mining, September 2023 Key transition materials  Copper, nickel FTSE Russell’s Green Revenues Classification System, v1.1, January 2024 Key raw minerals and metals Uranium BHP Future-facing commodities2  Copper, nickel, potash We believe steelmaking materials like iron ore and steelmaking coal also have an important role to play in the global transition to net zero. We expect the  blast furnace with carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) to be an important part of the journey towards the end-state objective of widespread  near zero emission steel, and it requires higher-quality steelmaking coal as an input. External analysis, such as the International Energy Agency’s net  zero by 2050 scenario,3 supports this view. Our view on steelmaking materials and their role in the transition to net zero is described in Portfolio – Steelmaking, iron ore  and steelmaking coal in our 1.5°C scenario on pages 37 and 38 of our CTAP 2024 available at bhp.com/CTAP2024 1.	 ‘Green revenue’ is a label referenced externally, including by standard setters and in investor-led benchmarks, which is intended as a measure of the extent to which products and services  contribute to the transition to a net zero, resource efficient and socially inclusive economy.

We will not use regulatory carbon credits (i.e. those used for compliance under regulatory  schemes such as the Safeguard Mechanism in Australia) to meet our target. In our projected pathway, we have not planned to  use voluntary carbon credits to meet our medium-term target, but if there is an unanticipated shortfall in our pathway, we may use  voluntary carbon credits that meet our integrity standards to close the performance gap. Long‑term net zero goal: Planned, to close the performance gap beyond our current estimate of up to around an 85 per cent gross  operational GHG emissions reduction against FY2020 levels by CY2050 without the use of carbon credits for offsetting Measurement approach Scope 1 emissions are calculated using emission factors and methodologies required under mandatory local regulatory programs  where BHP operates, including the National Greenhouse Energy and Reporting (NGER) scheme for Australian operations, Green  Tax legislation (referencing Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emission factors) for Chilean operations and  Canadian Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (referencing IPCC emission factors) for our Jansen potash project. In the absence of  mandatory local regulatory programs, the Australian NGER scheme emission factors and methodology is used. Scope 2 emissions  are calculated using the market-based method using electricity emission factors sourced directly from the supplier where available, as  evidenced by Renewable Energy Certificates and/or supplier-provided documentation. Where supplier-specific emission factors are  not available, a default location-based emission factor for electricity, as published in local regulations or industry frameworks, is used. Key adjustments made  to baseline year or  reference year and  subsequent data Baseline year (for our target) and reference year (for our goal) and performance data have been adjusted for divestment of our  interest in BMC (completed on 3 May 2022), divestment of our Petroleum business (merger with Woodside completed on 1  June 2022), BMA’s divestment of the Blackwater and Daunia mines (completed on 2 April 2024), our acquisition of OZ Minerals  (completed on 2 May 2023) and for methodology changes (use of IPCC Assessment Report 5 (AR5) Global Warming Potentials and  the transition to a facility-specific GHG emission calculation methodology for fugitives at Caval Ridge and Saraji South). Performance, adjusted FY2020: 13.6 MtCO2‑e FY2021: 13.8 MtCO2‑e FY2022: 10.2 MtCO2‑e FY2023: 9.1 MtCO2‑e FY2024: 9.2 MtCO2‑e Target or goal setting  method Medium‑term target: Our target is measured on a cumulative GHG emission basis against an overall carbon budget. The target  percentage reduction was established in FY2020 by applying the same rate of reduction to BHP’s GHG emissions as the rate  at which the world’s GHG emissions would have to contract in order to meet the Paris Agreement goal to hold global average  temperature increase to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels (known as the ‘absolute contraction method’). Long‑term net zero goal: Our goal was developed with the ambition to achieve net zero for our operational GHG emissions by  CY2050. Our progress against this goal will be measured on an absolute basis.  Target or goal derived  using a sectoral  decarbonisation  approach Medium‑term target: No, our target was derived using the absolute contraction method specified earlier. At the time of setting the  target, there were no mining sector‑specific pathways for jurisdictions where we operate. Long‑term net zero goal: No, however our goal is consistent with the global net zero ambition. Process for reviewing  the setting of the target  or goal The Board approves BHP’s significant social, community and sustainability policies (upon recommendation from the Nomination  and Governance Committee), including those related to climate change and climate transition planning, public sustainability goals  and targets (including for GHG emission reductions). We review our GHG emissions targets and goals as part of the periodic  development of an updated CTAP, or more frequently if required. Process for monitoring  progress towards the  target or goal Monitored on an annual basis through our business planning processes, which forecast operational GHG emissions and identify  planned, proposed or potential GHG emission reduction projects out to CY2050. As part of this process, an internal GHG emissions  target is set for the relevant financial year and monitored through our annual reporting processes, with progress reviewed by  management and the Board as part of publication of our annual reporting disclosures. Our target is also monitored on a six-monthly  basis through our social value scorecard framework, with progress reviewed by management and the Board as part of publication of  our half-year results (as well as annual reporting disclosures), or more frequently if required. Third-party validation  of our target or goal No, but we obtain reasonable assurance over our externally reported performance against our target and goal. Carbon budget for  target/goal period Medium‑term target: 126.9 MtCO2-e (FY2020 to FY2030). This reflects a linear reduction between our baseline year and the target  year. In the interim years before FY2030, we periodically refer to our carbon budget to assess our cumulative GHG emissions  against our carbon budget to FY2030. This enables us to determine if we are on track to achieve our medium-term target or whether  we anticipate potential use of voluntary carbon credits to close any performance gap by FY2030 (which we do not currently anticipate). Long‑term net zero goal: For the period FY2020 to FY2030, refer to the carbon budget for our target. We do not currently use a  carbon budget for the period beyond FY2030.  Expected progression Progress towards our target and net zero goal is expected to be non-linear and will be affected by organic changes in our production  of commodities. 56 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 59 ===== Value chain GHG emissions (Scope 3 emissions) medium-term goals definitions assumptions, adjustments and additional key details Description Steelmaking medium‑term goal: Support industry to develop steel production technology capable of 30 per cent lower GHG emissions  intensity relative to conventional blast furnace steelmaking, with widespread adoption expected post-CY2030.

Shipping medium‑term goal: Average gCO2-e per deadweight tonne per nautical mile (gCO2-e/dwt/nm), weighted based on IMO  defined vessel size ranges utilised by BHP during the time period, using a well-to-wake CO2-e emission factor from EU Regulation  2023/1805. Key adjustments made  to baseline year and  subsequent data Steelmaking medium‑term goal: Not applicable Shipping medium‑term goal: Baseline year and performance data have been adjusted to only include voyages associated with the  transportation of commodities currently in BHP’s portfolio due to the data availability challenges of adjusting by asset or operation  for CY2008 and subsequent year data. GHG emissions intensity calculations currently include the transportation of copper, iron ore,  steelmaking coal, energy coal, molybdenum, uranium and nickel. Baseline year and performance data have also been adjusted for a  methodology change to use maritime transport emission factors from EU Regulation 2023/1805, after The British Standards Institution  EN 16258 standard (the source of the emission factors we previously used) was withdrawn in CY2023.

Tracked based on the funding (US$) we commit in collaborative partnerships and  venture capital investments with the aim to support industry to develop steel production technology capable of 30 per cent lower  GHG emissions intensity relative to conventional blast furnace steelmaking. Shipping medium‑term goal: Set as a point in time, i.e. with the specific date of ‘by CY2030’ for our goal to support a 40 per cent GHG  emissions intensity reduction of BHP-chartered shipping of BHP products, while reflecting the challenges and uncertainty and our  inability (as BHP alone) to ensure Scope 3 emission reductions. As a result, the goal is not based on a trajectory and does not imply a  specific carbon budget, and so Scope 3 emissions may fluctuate (with some increases and/or non-linear decreases) during the period  before the goal date. Goal derived  using a sectoral  decarbonisation  approach Steelmaking medium‑term goal: Not applicable Shipping medium‑term goal: No, although our goal is generally consistent with the IMO’s CY2030 emissions intensity goal for the  international shipping sector and we selected CY2008 as our goal’s baseline year to align with the base year for the IMO’s CY2030  goal and its corresponding reasoning and strategy. Process for reviewing  the setting of the goal The Board approves BHP’s significant social, community and sustainability policies (upon recommendation from the Nomination and  Governance Committee), including those related to climate change and climate transition planning, public sustainability goals and  targets (including for GHG emission reductions).

Offsetting We anticipate offsetting by our customers, suppliers and other third parties will play a role in meeting our long-term net zero goal  (and potentially our long-term net zero targets), particularly for residual GHG emissions in steelmaking which are not currently  expected to reach zero by CY2050. Where third parties offset their GHG emissions that appear in our reported Scope 3 emissions  inventory, we plan to recognise and report the net GHG emissions after offsetting. Carbon credits sourced by third parties in our  value chain and associated with GHG emissions that appear in our reported Scope 3 emissions inventory would need to be high- integrity before we recognised that offsetting in our reporting. 6 Sustainability continued 58 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 61 ===== Measurement approach Value chain long-term net zero goal: Description of the calculation methodology used for each Scope 3 emissions category can be  found in the BHP GHG Emissions Calculation Methodology 2024, available at bhp.com/climate Shipping long-term net zero target: Vessel- and voyage-specific GHG emissions calculated using maritime transport emission  factors from EU Regulation 2023/1805.

We are supportive of global efforts to halt and  reverse nature loss in the coming decade, following adoption of the  Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework during the Conference  of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in December 2022.  We recognise that to help enable the energy transition, critical minerals  production will need to increase, and it will be essential that this production  meets high standards of environmental stewardship. BHP’s business, our  suppliers and customers, Indigenous peoples and the local communities  where we operate, all depend on and enjoy nature and the ecosystem  services it provides. We acknowledge the nature of our operations and our  environmental performance can impact the natural environment, including  the provision of ecosystem services.  Our Environment Global Standard outlines the minimum requirements  for managing our environmental risks and complying with our  environmental obligations using environmental management systems  aligned to ISO14001. We are working to enable these systems to better  support our approach to environmental management and performance.  The Environment Global Standard also describes our requirement to  apply the mitigation hierarchy (avoid, mitigate, rehabilitate, compensatory  actions) in our approach to managing environmental risks. Our Risk  Framework supports how we seek to identify, assess and manage  environmental risks, as well as our strategic decision-making. For more information on BHP’s approach to water stewardship,  biodiversity and land, including associated strategies refer to the  following sections and bhp.com/water and bhp.com/biodiversity  Nature-related goal and targets We have set, and are now focusing on the steps required to achieve, our  2030 Healthy environment goal and our context-based water targets (refer  to the Fresh water and oceans section later in OFR 6.10) that are designed  as part of our contribution towards the global efforts to reduce and/or  reverse nature loss. Our 2030 Healthy environment goal, announced in 2022, is to create  nature-positive1 outcomes by having at least 30 per cent of the land  and water we steward2 under conservation, restoration or regenerative  practices by the end of FY2030. Our focus is on areas of highest  ecosystem value, both within and outside our own operational footprint,   in partnership with Indigenous peoples and local communities. Our 2030 Healthy environment goal was developed in anticipation of the  Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. We focus our activities  in support of achieving this goal on the large areas of non-operational  land we steward, as this land offers the greatest opportunity for us to  apply conservation, restoration or regenerative practices at a larger scale.  Our Healthy environment goal and the mitigation hierarchy are considered  as part of the factors we use to inform management approaches for our  operational and non-operational areas.  To meet the FY2024 short-term milestone for the Healthy environment pillar  of our social value scorecard, we have developed a Group-level framework  for nature-positive plans to achieve the 2030 Healthy environment goal  (BHP Healthy environment goal roadmap).4 We intend to assess the  potential opportunities identified in the BHP Healthy environment goal  roadmap to inform business decisions designed to enable BHP to progress  towards our 2030 Healthy environment goal.  As at 30 June 2024, we had 83,012 hectares or 1.62 per cent5 of the land  and water that we steward2,7 under nature-positive management practices3  compared to 79,718 hectares or 1.56 per cent at the end of FY2023.6   The FY2024 area under nature-positive management practices3 has  increased by 3,295 hectares (or 4.13 per cent) since FY2023.  The increase in area under nature-positive management practices in  FY2024 compared to FY2023 is due to: the inclusion of areas under  nature-positive management practice at the former OZ Minerals operation  Carrapateena and the West Musgrave project, not included in our FY2023  reporting; an additional regulatory conservation area at one of BMA’s  assets in FY2024; and BMA’s divestment of the Blackwater and Daunia  mines,7 resulting in these areas, including some areas reported in FY2023  as under nature-positive management practices,3 being excluded from the  land and water we steward.2 The calculation for the area under nature-positive management practices  includes areas under regulatory and voluntary conservation and  restoration, and regenerative agriculture. A breakdown of this can be found  in the BHP ESG Standards and Databook 2024. We plan to continue to  assess, validate and disclose material information regarding the Healthy  environment goal calculation methodology, in consideration of evolving  external frameworks and stakeholder expectations. For more information on our Healthy environment goal methodology  and natural capital metrics framework, how the BHP Healthy  environment goal roadmap was developed using a targeted version  of the TNFD’s LEAP approach, and examples of areas under  nature‑positive management practice refer to bhp.com/environment For more information on our 2030 goals refer to OFR 6.5 For more information on how we manage risk refer to OFR 8 6 Sustainability continued Nature’s four realms – land, ocean, fresh  water and atmosphere What do we mean by nature  and its associated terms? 	 – The Recommendations of the Taskforce on Nature-related   Financial Disclosures (TNFD Recommendations), which were  finalised in September 2023, describe nature as having four major  components or realms: land, fresh water, ocean and atmosphere –   each of which interact with people and society. Biodiversity is  a characteristic of all four realms. At BHP, we are continuing to  evolve our sustainability-related reporting to align with this concept  of nature. 	 – BHP adopts the definitions as outlined in the TNFD Glossary  version 1.0 for the following key nature-related terms: Nature,  Nature-positive, Natural Capital, Biodiversity, Realm, Ecosystem  function and Ecosystem services. We intend to review these  definitions in FY2025, in light of the recently revised TNFD Glossary  Version 2.0 (June 2024). 	 – Biodiversity is an essential characteristic of adaptable, resilient  and functional ecosystems, which provides society with ecosystem  services on which we rely – clean water, fresh air, productive soils,  pollination, climate regulation and climate physical risk mitigation;  and services through which we enjoy recreation, amenity, spiritual  connection and wellbeing.  For definitions refer to Additional information 10.4 and the   TNFD’s version 1.0 glossary at tnfd.global/publication/glossary/ Atmosphere Society Land Fresh   water Ocean 60 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 63 ===== Nature‑related risk and impact management Our approach to biodiversity and nature recognises the five key drivers  of nature loss (changes in land and sea use, direct exploitation of natural  resources, pollution, climate change, invasive species), as outlined by the  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Our primary approach to preventing or minimising our adverse  impacts to nature (including air, fresh water and oceans, land and  biodiversity) within our operational footprint is to apply the mitigation  hierarchy. For an example of how we apply the ‘avoid’ pillar, refer to our  environmental-related commitments below. For more information on governance of sustainability  topics, including nature, refer to OFR 6.3 Our environmental-related commitments are: 	 – We do not explore or extract resources within the boundaries of  World Heritage listed properties. 	 – We do not explore or extract resources adjacent to World Heritage  listed properties, unless the proposed activity is compatible with  the outstanding universal values for which the World Heritage  property is listed. 	 – We do not explore or extract resources within or adjacent to  the boundaries of the International Union for Conservation of  Nature (IUCN) Protected Areas Categories I to IV, unless a plan  is implemented that meets regulatory requirements, takes into  account stakeholder and partner (including Indigenous peoples)  expectations and contributes to the values for which the protected  area is listed. 	 – We do not operate where there is a risk of direct impacts to  ecosystems that could result in the extinction of an IUCN Red List  Threatened Species in the wild. 	 – We do not dispose of mined waste rock or tailings into a river or  marine environment. 	 – We do not use aqueous film forming foams (AFFF) containing   per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) at our operated  assets. We replace with fluorine free foam products. The requirement to apply the mitigation hierarchy, our environmental- related commitments and other Group-wide approaches to environmental  management are set out in our Environment Global Standard and in  mandatory minimum performance requirements for risk management.  We released an updated Environment Global Standard in April 2024 and  key changes include: 	 – an increased focus on risk and impact management: i.	 extends requirements for identifying and assessing nature‑related  risks to include those within BHP’s supply chain ii.	 requires consideration of impacts and dependencies, physical risks,  systemic risks and transition risks when assessing nature‑related risk iii.	 emphasises application of the mitigation hierarchy when  identifying, assessing and implementing environment‑related controls 	 – a new requirement to develop and implement asset-level nature- positive activities and to include these activities within the BHP Healthy  environment goal roadmap 	 – a new environmental-related commitment to cease use of aqueous film  forming foams (AFFF) that contain per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances  (PFAS) (a key FY2024 action to reduce our impact associated with one  of the five major drivers of nature loss, pollution)  	 – enhanced rehabilitation planning commitments We are prioritising managing our nature-related risks (including impacts,  dependencies, threats and opportunities) within the land and waters we  steward. In FY2024, BHP commissioned work to improve our process for  how we understand and manage nature-related risk in the value chain. In FY2024, BHP also introduced a new Global Land Use Permitting (GLUP)  system. GLUP is a global software solution developed inhouse to support  the internal end-to-end compliance requirements of our Land Use Permit  process, which is a key control to manage land use disturbance risks  and support application of the avoid and minimise steps of the mitigation  hierarchy. This solution was designed to support the Land Use Permit  owners and contributors to better understand their obligations and how to  manage BHP’s risk to cultural heritage, environment and biodiversity through  a simple, transparent and collaborative global technology system.  For more information on the updated list of nature-related impacts  and dependencies that have been evaluated as part of the  development of the BHP Healthy environment goal roadmap refer to  bhp.com/environment For more information on the water‑related risks (including impacts,  dependencies, threats and opportunities) we take to seek to prevent,  mitigate or enhance them refer to bhp.com/water For our overarching approach to risk management refer to OFR 8  For more information on our environmental approach refer to the  Environment Global Standard and our nature‑related management  and governance processes at bhp.com/environment Fresh water and oceans Water is integral to what we do and vital to the longevity of BHP. We depend  on access to water and cannot operate without it. Our Water Stewardship  Position Statement outlines our vision for a water secure world by 2030, an  aim consistent with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6,   and considers ecosystem health, cultural and spiritual values, human  rights, communities, Indigenous peoples and economic growth among  other factors. Our position statement is supported by our Water Stewardship  Strategy, which focuses on understanding and managing water-related risk,  disclosure, contributing to the resolution of shared water challenges, valuing  water and sharing innovations and learning.  Water data and accounting relies on a variety of data sources, including from  water modelling, direct measurement and estimation techniques based on  available known methodologies (e.g. estimation of evaporation from water  storages). Recognising that the water models, water balances and assumptions  used in our water accounting approach contain inherent uncertainty; and in line  with our commitment to continuous improvement; we continue to review the  assumptions and refine our methodology of our water accounts and data. These footnotes refer to previous page 1.	 Nature-positive is defined by the TNFD Glossary version 1.0 as ‘A high-level goal and concept describing a future state of nature (e.g. biodiversity, ecosystem services and natural  capital) which is greater than the current state’. We understand it includes land and water management practices that halt and reverse nature loss – that is, supporting healthy, functioning  ecosystems. BHP intends to review this definition in FY2025, in light of the recently revised TNFD Glossary version 2.0 (June 2024) definition of nature positive. 2.	 This excludes areas we hold under greenfield exploration licences (or equivalent tenements), which are outside the area of influence of our existing mine operations. 30 per cent will be calculated based  on the areas of land and water that we steward at the end of FY2030.  3.	 Nature-positive management practices refer to an area under stewardship that has a formal management plan that includes conservation, restoration or regenerative practices. For more  information refer to the BHP ESG Standards and Databook 2024, available at bhp.com/sustainability. 4.	 The BHP Healthy environment goal roadmap is intended to apply to our operated assets in Australia, Chile and Canada. Due to the acquisition of OZ Minerals and prioritisation of  activities based on risks and impacts, Carrapateena, Prominent Hill, West Musgrave and legacy assets are currently out of scope for the roadmap; with the exception of West Musgrave,  these assets are planned to be incorporated into the roadmap in FY2025. Incorporation of West Musgrave into the BHP Healthy environment goal roadmap will be reviewed following the  decision to temporarily suspend the Western Australia Nickel operations. 5.	 1.62 per cent is calculated based on the areas of land and water that we stewarded (excluding areas we hold under greenfield exploration licences (or equivalent tenements) and subject to  footnote 7) at 30 June 2024 – which was approximately 5,125,935 hectares; an increase of approximately 18,750 hectares compared to approximately 5,107,185 hectares at 30 June 2023.  6.	 FY2023 values are a restatement of our previously reported 1.3 per cent and 82,132 hectares. The restatement from 82,132 to 79,718 hectares under nature-positive management  practices for FY2023 is due to a change in our methodology and associated definitions; with FY2023 values being reported based on GRI Biodiversity 2016 304-3 definitions.   The restatement from 1.3 per cent to 1.56 per cent area under nature-positive management practices3 is primarily due to approximately 1.5 million hectares of greenfield exploration  licences, which are located outside the area of influence of our existing mine operations, being incorrectly assigned to ‘the land and water we steward’2 component of the Healthy  environment goal calculation in FY2023.  7.	 While some of the land related to the Daunia and Blackwater mines is pending transfer following BMA’s divestment of these mines on 2 April 2024, these areas are no longer under BMA’s  control or operated for BMA’s benefit so have been excluded from the areas of land and water we stewarded at 30 June 2024. 61 Overview Additional Information Financial Statements Governance Contents Operating and Financial Review  ===== PAGE 64 ===== 6 Sustainability continued 1.

BHP plans to review the suitability of the existing Olympic Dam WRSA and  CBWTs during FY2025, following the creation of the Copper South Australia asset, inclusive of Olympic Dam, Carrapateena and Prominent Hill. We expect to review the need to revise or  create CBWTs when there are substantial changes to our portfolio or one of our projects moves into the operational phase. The Western Australia Nickel context-based water targets do  not include the West Musgrave Project. In FY2024, seawater continued to be our largest source of water withdrawal (58 per cent in FY24 compared to 52 per cent in FY2023);  groundwater (a mixture of high- and low-quality water) remained our most significant non-seawater source (23 per cent in both FY2024  and FY2023). The volumes withdrawn in FY2024 represent approximately 28 gigalitres (GL) or 7 per cent reduction in water withdrawal compared to  FY2023. This was primarily due to a reduction in high-quality Type 2 surface water (precipitation and run-off) withdrawal from our BMA and  NSWEC assets, attributable to a decrease in rainfall at those operational areas. Total water withdrawals from operated assets located in high or very high water-stressed areas (as determined by WWF Water Risk Filter)  was 33,330 megalitres (ML) (9 per cent of total withdrawals for BHP operated assets) compared to 35,340 ML (and 9 per cent) in FY2023;  and consisted of 81 per cent high-quality (Type 1 and 2) water compared to 69 per cent in FY2023. This is primarily due to increased   Type 2 water withdrawal at Pampa Norte, which is sourced from third-party desalinated water (i.e. the original source of this water is   Type 3). Over the same period, Pampa Norte’s Type 3 water withdrawal from third-party surface water decreased from approximately  6,090 ML to approximately 3,350 ML. This is in line with Pampa Norte’s water strategy and context-based water target milestones to cease  operational use of terrestrial water sources from water scarce areas. In FY2024 the significant decrease in water re-use and recycling at Pampa Norte was primarily due to a change in the methodology for calculating  reused and recycled water, using measured values in calculations instead of estimations. Key:      Ocean-related performance update       Fresh water-related performance update       Recycled water-related performance We continue to seek opportunities to source our water from lower-grade  sources rather than use high-quality water resources from the catchments  where we operate. Key insights from our FY2024 water performance are  outlined above.1  In FY2024, we commenced review and refinement of our water accounts  and model at our Western Australia Nickel asset, completing a review at  Mount Keith. Updates to Leinster’s water model are planned to be rolled  out in FY2025. The continuation of this program will be subject to review,  and there is no current plan to disclose water data from West Musgrave  in the future, following the announcement of temporary suspension of  operations at Western Australia Nickel. In FY2025, we also intend to  align Prominent Hill and Carrapateena to ICMM’s Water Reporting, Good  Practice Guide (2nd Ed) and the Minerals Council of Australia’s Water  Accounting Framework, to enable disclosure of water data from these  operations from FY2026.  Context-based water targets  In our Water Stewardship Position Statement, we committed to develop  context-based water targets (CBWTs). These targets were informed by  BHP’s view of water-related risks in the relevant catchment and by the  shared water challenges identified in the Water Resource Situational  Analysis (WRSA). A WRSA is a holistic assessment and summary of the  sustainability, governance, and social, cultural, spiritual, environmental  and economic values of water (fresh or marine) within a defined  catchment area, which provides a rounded understanding of the shared  water challenges and collective action opportunities for the catchment.  The CBWTs aim to improve our internal BHP water management  and contribute to collective benefit and shared approaches to water  management in the regions where we operate. Our CBWTs support  BHP’s 2030 Healthy environment goal and are expected to contribute  to the protection or restoration of water-dependent ecosystems in the  vicinity of our operated assets. The CBWTs are underpinned by a series  of milestones and we delivered all asset-level CBWT2 FY2024 short-term  milestones except one at West Australia Nickel, as summarised on the  next page. In FY2024, we engaged third parties (e.g. universities) to undertake a  WRSA at NSWEC, including to review publicly available information and  engage with partners and stakeholders (e.g. communities, Indigenous  groups, policymakers and other private corporations within our catchment  areas). Shared water challenges were identified through a WRSA.  NSWEC’s WRSA was released in August 2024. CBWTs for NSWEC and  one of our legacy assets are planned to be released in FY2025. Beyond BHP’s footprint, we made voluntary contributions to support  environmental resilience across the regions where we operate, including  through thought leadership and action on the ground. For example,  in FY2024: 	 – We continued to collaborate with the University of Notre Dame to  develop a framework for corporations and policymakers to consider the  human right to water to support social equity and reduce corporate risk.  During FY2024, work continued to make the framework more practical  by developing decision support tools and case studies. 	 – We continued to progress with the Groundwater Modelling Decision  Support Initiative (GDMSI) with partner organisations Rio Tinto and  Flinders University to help promote the application of advances in  groundwater modelling for environmental and water management  decisions. During FY2024, the initiative reviewed the application of  numerical groundwater modelling in environmental assessments and  delivered a discussion paper on some of the challenges associated with  disclosing and addressing technical uncertainty in decisions. 	 – BMA has been a member of the Fitzroy Partnership for River Health  and Mackay Whitsunday Isaac Healthy Rivers to Reef Partnership since  2020 and 2022 respectively, contributing over A$0.55 million to these  partnerships in FY2024. One of the key goals of these partnerships is to  provide a more complete picture of river and marine health – providing  funding, resources and contributing water quality and ecosystem health  monitoring data through data-sharing arrangements. In FY2024, the  Mackay Whitsunday Isaac Healthy Rivers to Reef ‘Project Blueprint’, water  quality monitoring and engagement in the Whitsundays, was expanded  to include direct Traditional Owner participation. Project Blueprint has  completed over 12 trips and analysed over 360 samples.

We have a Group-level biodiversity strategy that outlines our purpose and  strategic priorities, and is designed to inform operational decision-making  across the full lifecycle of mining operations at our operated assets.  The Group-level strategy provides a clear direction that enables alignment  of asset-level biodiversity and land objectives and supports delivery of  the 2030 Healthy environment goal. The focus areas in the biodiversity  strategy are valuing natural capital, innovation and collaboration, and  nature-related disclosures.  Our work on understanding and managing the value of nature to our  business and to the communities where we operate continues to progress  following the completion of our pilot natural capital accounting (NCA) case  study at our Beenup site in Western Australia in FY2023. Further NCA  piloting was performed in FY2024 at our Olympic Dam operation,  as part of a broader project led by Cooperative Research Centre for  Transformations in Mining Economies (CRC TiME) and CSIRO, with input  from the Australian Government Department of Climate Change, Energy,  the Environment and Water, and other CRC TiME partners. This project  provided inputs to a suite of new resources that has been released to  support the mining industry adopting NCA – a way of accounting for  impacts on nature over the life of projects. The Olympic Dam pilot case  study provided new insights into what is possible using industry data at an  operating asset and revealed the need for a clear underlying rationale to  inform the design of decision-useful natural capital accounts. The BHP Healthy environment goal roadmap includes a preliminary  natural capital metrics framework, which considers the ecological status  and socio-economic value of natural capital assets that we impact and/ or depend on. It was applied in FY2024 to establish the initial metrics that  are intended to be used to measure the impact of BHP’s nature-positive  management practices. Beyond BHP’s footprint, we made voluntary contributions to support  environmental resilience across the regions where we operate, including  through on-ground action. For example: 	 – In FY2024, we finalised our four-year coral reef restoration project with the  Woppaburra Traditional Owners, who are the custodians of Sea Country  adjacent to our BMA operations in the southern Great Barrier Reef.  The project was co-designed by Woppaburra people with some attaining  qualifications in coral aquaculture techniques that have led to employment  opportunities. Our pilot of the Seascape Framework, which is one of the  world’s largest Indigenous created and managed marine conservation  initiatives, continued with Conservation International in Lau, Fiji. 	 – In FY2024, we renewed our fourth extension of the Bush Blitz Project for  a further five years to the end of FY2030. Bush Blitz is Australia’s largest  nature discovery program – a unique multi-million-dollar partnership  between BHP, the Australian Government and Earthwatch Australia to  document plants and animals across the country. Since the program  began in 2009, Bush Blitz has discovered more than 2,100 new species  and has added thousands of species records to what is already known.  Phase 3 of the program, from 1 June 2018 to April 2024, involved  15 field expeditions, which covered 2,966,495 hectares of land and  almost 62 square kilometres of sea, making a major contribution to the  understanding and conservation of Australia’s biodiversity. During   these expeditions, Bush Blitz scientists – supported by BHP employees  and educators serving as field research assistants – discovered  311 species new to science. The surveys also engaged hundreds of  Indigenous rangers, Traditional Owners, park rangers and other land  managers. In particular, Bush Blitz has undertaken research on   Indigenous-managed properties, creating positive cultural exchange   and learning opportunities for rangers and scientists.  	 – Since FY2021, we have partnered with Curtin University on the use  of environmental DNA (eDNA) as a novel biomonitoring tool to enable  the development of ecosystem condition indices. We have supported  five pilot studies that focus on protected species (e.g. the Pilbara olive  python), subterranean conservation research, functional ecology of the  Chilean wetlands of the Altiplano, and studies to develop new assays  that can be used to detect invasive marine species. This work was  extended in FY2024 to include research into sampling eDNA from soil  and air. In terms of impact, the research has produced 22 scientific  publications, supported six post-graduate students, sequenced the  first complete genome of the Pilbara olive python, added 391 marine  sequences to GenBank, and assembled over 150 new mitochondrial  genomes. A Funding Agreement for a further four years of ongoing  eDNA research with Curtin University was signed in FY2024.

Escondida and  Pampa Norte  Cease extraction of terrestrial water  for Cerro Colorado operational use  This milestone was achieved in FY2024. Extraction for operational use ceased December 2023. Nickel West2 Facilitate establishment of a Northern  Goldfields catchment regional water  working group  While activities have been undertaken in line with the intent of the FY2024 short-term  milestone, this milestone has not yet been achieved. The Northern Goldfields  catchment regional water working groups are being established by local native title  holders, and Nickel West actively collaborated in this process throughout FY2024. Olympic Dam  Implement a permanent daily abstraction  limit on Wellfield A at 5ML/d  This milestone was achieved in FY2024. Daily abstraction from Wellfield A remained below 5ML/d throughout FY2024. Western Australia  Iron Ore  Initiate and support a collaborative  scoping study for a regional water  data sharing solution  This milestone has been achieved in FY2024. Terms of Reference for the Weeli Wolli Catchment Industry Collaboration  group, coordinated by the Chamber of Minerals and Energy, have been agreed.  BHP funding has been committed to support shared environmental analytics  incorporating a catchment scale integrated groundwater database in the Pilbara.  1.	 Some water allocations at BMA are not made available for sale ‘in year’ and are retained for strategic contingency purposes as ‘carry over’. Unutilised ‘carry over’ is subject to ongoing  assessment throughout the year as to what can be made available. At 30 June any unused ‘carry over’ amounts are incorporated into the following financial year’s ‘in year’ water for the  total river scheme’s announced allocations by the Resource Operator.  2.	 The existing commitment to develop an ‘action to improve BHP’s water performance’ CBWT in the future will be reviewed following the decision to temporarily suspend Western Australia  Nickel operations. The Western Australia Nickel context-based water targets do not include the West Musgrave Project. 63 Overview Additional Information Financial Statements Governance Contents Operating and Financial Review  ===== PAGE 66 ===== Land As at 30 June 2024, BHP owned, leased or managed approximately  8,874,555 hectares of land compared to approximately 8,038,027 hectares  as at 30 June 2023. The approximately 836,528-hectare increase is  primarily due to the incorporation of former OZ Minerals Australian land  holdings. Approximately 2 per cent (approximately 144,634 hectares)  of this area has been disturbed for mining operation purposes and  approximately 16 per cent (approximately 22,885 hectares) of land we have  disturbed is currently rehabilitated.  Most of the area we steward is located in Australia and is for non- operational land uses, such as pastoral leases or land set aside for  conservation. BHP’s approach to environmental management is tailored  to different area types in our portfolio. See Figure below for a visualisation  of this.  For more information on our approach to biodiversity and land  management and case studies on activities we are undertaking  to progress towards meeting our biodiversity aims refer to  bhp.com/biodiversity Atmosphere and air quality Clean air is crucial for the health of our people, our host communities and  the surrounding ecosystems. We are actively working to improve air quality  management, with a focus on managing emissions of particulate matter  from our operations.  Our emission of nitrous oxides, particulates and sulphur dioxide is  considered non-material in comparison to global emissions as determined  by the GRI materiality assessment process. We have extensive particulate  monitoring and management programs at some of our operated assets.  We report air emissions (such as nitrous oxides) as part of the BHP ESG  Standards and Databook 2024, available at bhp.com/ sustainability, and  discuss our approach and management to these on our environment  webpage at bhp.com/environment. For more information on our approach to air quality,  refer to the Pilbara Air Quality Program case study at  bhp.com/sustainability/environment 6 Sustainability continued Infographic footnotes:  1.	 Land data is calculated as the total area of land owned, leased or managed by BHP at 30 June 2024. This value includes greenfield exploration licences (or equivalent tenements), which  are outside the area of influence of our existing mine operations. Land associated with the Daunia and Blackwater mines is excluded, as the mines were divested by BMA during the year.  While some of the land related to the Daunia and Blackwater mines is pending transfer following completion on 2 April 2024, it is no longer under BMA’s control or operated for BMA’s  benefit and has been excluded on that basis. 2.	 Note that this was incorrectly stated in the FY2023 Annual Report as ‘operational area – the area we hold for mining’, rather than ‘disturbed area, predominantly for operational purposes’. 3.	 This excludes areas we hold under greenfield exploration licences (or equivalent tenements), which are outside the area of influence of our existing mine operations. 30 per cent will be  calculated based on the areas of land and water that we steward at the end of FY2030. 4.	 Nature-positive is defined by the TNFD Glossary version 1.0 as ‘A high-level goal and concept describing a future state of nature (e.g. biodiversity, ecosystem services and natural  capital) which is greater than the current state’. We understand it includes land and water management practices that halt and reverse nature loss – that is, supporting healthy, functioning  ecosystems. BHP intends to review this definition in FY2025, in light of the recently revised TNFD Glossary version 2.0 (June 2024) definition of nature positive. In FY2024, BHP owned, leased or managed an area of just under 8.9 million hectares1 consisting of: Operational areas Non-operational areas Outside BHP footprint Outside BHP footprint Refers to areas held by others,  including thought leadership  on approaches to assessing  nature-positive4 outcomes Outcome we seek 	 – avoiding and minimising impacts to the  environment and our host communities from  our operational activities 	 – no net loss of biodiversity over mine life cycle 	 – compliance with environmental permits  How we manage 	 – 2030 Social Value goals, incl.

Examples for Lagunillas (Cerro Colorado) and  Monturaqui (Escondida) are described below. Nine fines were issued and paid in FY2024 in relation to environmental  laws and regulations at our operated assets. For more information refer to  the 2024 ESG Standards and Databook. Lagunillas (Cerro Colorado)  In 2021, an individual filed an environmental damage claim against Cerro  Colorado (CMCC) before the First Environment Court of Antofagasta,  alleging CMCC’s water extraction from the Lagunillas aquifer had damaged  the aquifer, as well as a nearby lagoon and wetlands. The substantive  case was heard in FY2022. In November 2023, the Environmental Court  approved the settlement submitted by the parties, concluding that the  environmental remediation measures in the agreement are adequate.  Monturaqui (Escondida) In March 2022, the Chilean Environmental Regulator (SMA) sanctioned  Escondida, concluding it had breached its environmental permit causing  irreparable environmental damage due to its water extraction from   the Monturaqui aquifer. In March 2022, the SMA imposed a fine of  approximately US$8.3 million. In February 2023, Escondida filed an appeal  before the First Environmental Court seeking to annul the SMA decision.  The appeal is pending.  Shortly after the March 2022 SMA decision, two related environmental  damage claims were filed in the First Environment Court of Antofagasta.  Following a hearing in July 2023, the Court is now in a position to render  a ruling on the claims’ merits, which we expect could occur within the next  12 months.  Engagement Beyond our operational activities, we engage across communities,  Indigenous peoples’ representatives, government, industry association  memberships, our customers and suppliers, business and civil society on a  range of topics related to environmental management. Through our engagement in industry associations, we have provided input  into their advocacy with governments on behalf of industry. In FY2024,  our focus within industry has been on streamlining approvals and permits  whilst maintaining environmental standards; recognising environmental,  social and economic factors must be considered in these processes.  Specific examples include: 	 – direct and indirect engagement, via the Minerals Council of Australia,  with the Australian Government on its Nature Positive law reforms,  outlining our alignment with the government’s intent to reform the current  national environmental laws so they achieve the right balance between  better outcomes for the environment and supporting economic growth,  investment and job creation  	 – indirect advocacy via the Chilean Mining Council, in relation to a Bill that  strengthens environmental management instruments, deepening citizen  participation, and providing greater certainty and reduced processing  times. We also advocate for the reduction of processing times without  weakening environmental standards We also partner with others to advance the thinking in our priority areas of  action. As an International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) member,  we have worked with industry peers to develop the ICMM’s nature position  statement with associated commitments, which was adopted by ICMM  members in January 2024.  For more information on the ICMM nature position statement refer to  icmm.com/en-gb/our-principles/position-statements/nature 65 Overview Additional Information Financial Statements Governance Contents Operating and Financial Review  ===== PAGE 68 ===== 6.11 Community Through our business activities and the social, economic and  environmental initiatives that accompany them, we can make a significant  contribution to communities where we operate and to society more broadly.  Our operations can also generate impacts for host communities that  need to be carefully identified, monitored and addressed. This tension  challenges us to look for inclusive, innovative and integrated solutions that  meet the constantly evolving performance expectations that communities  and society hold for us. This means the voice of our community  stakeholders remains a critical input into our short-term response and  our long-term vision around community engagement, partnership  and investment.  In FY2024, we continued to manage relevant risks (threats and  opportunities) and impacts as well as progressed development of  our longer-term strategic approach to community engagement.  This includes an increased focus on seeking to adopt a ‘co-creation’  approach – involving and providing agency for our partners to shape  selected initiatives.  Co-creation Co-creation, or co-design, in essence, is a strategic approach involving  the integration of diverse partners’ resources, knowledge and networks to  resolve complex collective challenges or realise more enhanced outcomes  through collaboration. It places BHP within a larger ecosystem where  stakeholders actively participate in project development and delivery.  Stakeholders act as valuable contributors to each design process and  ideas generated via co-creation become integral to a company’s decision- making process. Throughout this Report we use the terms co-creation and  co-design interchangeably.  For the Thriving, empowered communities (TEC) pillar of the social value  scorecard, BHP’s experience and learning from external sources have  demonstrated that integrating a co-creation approach is an opportunity,  when adopted in the right circumstances, to generate outcomes that are  more valued by Indigenous peoples, communities, governments and civil  society through an enhanced sense of ownership and benefit. There are  also business benefits to this approach, including enhanced social value  outcomes and impact. As such, the TEC pillar focuses on the adoption of the  practice of co-designed targets within the 2030 scorecard. In FY2024, we  increased our focus on co-creation within our general community approach.  This includes commencing the development of criteria that provide guidance  on co-design practices, processes and assessments against the social value  targets within the TEC pillar of our social value framework.  For more information on our social value scorecard, including our   co-creation metrics and milestones, refer to OFR 6.5 Understanding communities Our approach to community engagement and research includes:  	 – Community perception surveys – snapshots of the communities where  we operate and stakeholders’ perspectives on their community priorities  and of sector and BHP performance, completed on a regular basis.  As at 30 June 2024, field work for the latest community perceptions  survey was underway.  	 – Community baseline studies – desktop assessments that provide  quantitative and qualitative data on social, cultural, economic and  political characteristics of the communities where we operate. The most  recent baselines were completed in FY2023 and included all operated  and legacy assets and our exploration regions at that time. The former OZ  Minerals operations will be included in future community baseline studies.  	 – Community and human rights impact and opportunity assessments  (CHRIOAs) – analysis of surveys, baseline studies and community  stakeholder feedback against asset plans to identify and prioritise  potential and actual risks, impacts and opportunities related to  local communities where we operate (see the following section for  more details).  	 – Community engagement and social investment indicators – data  collected related to community engagements (e.g. number of community  concerns and use of operational grievance mechanisms) and social  investment partnerships (e.g. outcome indicators of a particular project)  that provide insights to the communities’ relationships with us. We continue to track and report instances of community concerns,  complaints and grievances received through our operational grievance  mechanisms and other feedback avenues. In FY2024, there were 600  community concerns and complaints received across our operated assets  globally. Of note, 462 of these related to a mass submission of email  communications received in relation to potential impacts of the BMA Caval  Ridge Horse Pit Extension project during the public disclosure period.  The nature of the concerns raised were the same in each submission  and included potential impacts to flora and fauna, impacts on ground and  surface water and the final landform of the project.  6 Sustainability continued 66 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 69 ===== Prioritised community and human rights issues for operating regions identified in CHRIOAs 	 – Climate-related 	 – Cumulative environmental impacts  	 – Social investment 	 – Economic diversification 	 – Education and training 	 – Local employment 	 – Cumulative  environmental impacts  	 – Relationships with  Indigenous peoples 	 – Workforce mental health 	 – Community mental health 	 – Housing availability/ affordability  	 – Education/training/ employment Chile 	 – Climate-related 	 – Physical health and safety 	 – Closure New South Wales 	 – Water access and pollution 	 – Free, prior, informed consent 	 – Access to remedy 	 – Housing availability/ affordability South Australia 	 – Climate-related 	 – Water access and pollution 	 – Free, prior, informed consent 	 – Access to remedy 	 – Dust/noise/air quality 	 – Housing availability/affordability 	 – Closure 	 – Education/training/employment 	 – Cultural heritage management 	 – Workforce mental health 	 – Remuneration Western Australia Queensland 	 – Cumulative  environmental impacts  	 – Limited community infrastructure 	 – Education/training/employment 	 – Cost of living/Inflation 	 – Employment opportunities Canada The majority of remaining concerns and complaints related to operational  issues, such as dust, road and rail impacts, lighting and noise.  Asset complaint volumes remained relatively stable from last year’s  figures with the exception of BMA (attributed to the Horse Pit Extension  project submission as detailed above) and a 57 per cent decrease in  complaints at NSWEC, through the resolution of an ongoing issue with a  single community stakeholder. Ten complaints were made by Indigenous  communities in Chile which we are seeking to address through ongoing  dialogue with those communities. Concerns, complaints and grievances  from communities connected to the former OZ Minerals assets are  expected to be incorporated in the BHP Annual Report from FY2025.  In FY2024, we implemented a new enterprise-wide stakeholder  management system that enables us to maintain improved records  of community engagements and our commitments. This system also  incorporates an updated external facing complaints and grievance portal  designed to improve accessibility for community members to provide direct  feedback to us. We intend to launch the enhanced portal for the system  in FY2025. We also updated our internal standards, designed to provide  improved guidance for community engagement and social performance  leading practice as well as to enhance integration with our existing  business processes, such as asset planning and risk assessments.   For more information on stakeholder concerns reflecting entries  received through our local grievance mechanisms, local stakeholder  engagement and ongoing community research, including community  perception surveys, refer to the BHP ESG Standards and  Databook 2024 at bhp.com/ESGStandards2024 We recognise many of the communities where we operate rely on mining  and associated activities to support their livelihoods. We aim to ensure  change and transitions are equitable and deliberately considered across  the lifecycle of our business and for the communities where we operate. For information on our approach to equitable change and transition,  including equitable change and transition at our Mt Arthur coal mine,  refer to the BHP Climate Transition Action Plan 2024 available at   bhp.com/CTAP2024 Community and human rights impact and  opportunity assessments In FY2024, building on the results of the community and human rights  baseline studies completed for all operated assets and certain exploration  regions in FY2023, we developed and commenced implementation  of a globally consistent methodology for community and human rights  impact and opportunity assessments (CHRIOAs), which identified and  prioritised potential impacts, risks and opportunities related to the local  communities where we operate. The approach was trialled at all our  operated assets (excluding the former OZ Minerals assets) and selected  exploration regions. This enabled identification of the potential community  and human rights impacts and opportunities most prevalent to each region  while also supporting a global view of recurring issues, which can help us  identify potential opportunities for company-wide action or collaboration.  The identified risks, impacts and opportunities are being evaluated and are  expected to be embedded within asset and relevant functions’ FY2025 risk  profiles. The highest priority areas for each operating region are detailed  in the map below, with US legacy assets and Exploration prioritising water  access and pollution as the key CHRIOA priority risk areas. In FY2025,  we plan to further embed the CHRIOA process through the integration of  identified risks (threats and opportunities) into asset risk profiles to enable  action. We also expect to include the former OZ Minerals assets in this  process in future years. As we acquire assets in new areas, we may be exposed to additional  human rights risks.

Across our  Minerals Australia and Minerals Americas activities, BHP operates on or  close to the traditional lands of Indigenous peoples and we have a deep  respect for their distinct cultures, rights, perspectives and aspirations.  BHP is committed to working collaboratively with Indigenous peoples  to develop long‑term partnerships based on trust and mutual benefit as  set out in our Indigenous Peoples Policy Statement. It is through this  commitment that we aim to support reconciliation with Indigenous peoples  and contribute to improved social, economic and environmental outcomes. In FY2024, we developed and introduced procedures for projects and  new operations to identify and assess the severity of potential adverse  impacts to Indigenous peoples’ and to engage and consult Indigenous  peoples to understand how we can seek to avoid and mitigate adverse  impacts, with the intention of substantially addressing potentially impacted  Indigenous peoples’ ambitions and concerns. We have also introduced  new procedures for projects and new operations to engage with and  seek to obtain ‘free, prior and informed consent’ (FPIC) from potentially  impacted Indigenous peoples in accordance with the approach set out in  our Indigenous Peoples Policy Statement. Where gaps exist between the  host government’s laws and regulations about consultation with Indigenous  peoples and BHP’s approach to FPIC, our policies require that BHP apply  the higher standard. All projects and proposed new operations are required  to submit progress reports to senior management across the project  lifecycle to report on progress or any challenges to satisfying BHP’s FPIC  procedures. In FY2025, we aim to continue to strengthen our internal  systems for collecting and reporting on the global management of risks to  Indigenous peoples and FPIC processes with Indigenous peoples. During FY2024, we progressed work in relation to further developing  how we will approach Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property (ICIP)  and Data Sovereignty in line with the principle set out in our Indigenous  Peoples Policy Statement. We plan to continue this work into FY2025,  which we expect to inform the design of our standards and processes for  the collection, access and reuse of cultural information that pertains to  Indigenous peoples. 6 Sustainability continued Incorporate Indigenous voices, values,  knowledge and perspectives BHP will seek out Indigenous voices, values, knowledge and  perspectives in the way we work. We will connect with Indigenous  peoples to better appreciate the historical, legal, social,   environmental, cultural and political landscape where we   operate or seek to operate, and how to better manage   the environment we share.  Strengthen engagement with Indigenous peoples  through dialogue and co-design BHP will engage early and support meaningful dialogue with  Indigenous peoples by sharing knowledge and information both  ways and ensure our processes allow for active participation in  appropriate aspects of the design, implementation and   monitoring of plans that impact Indigenous peoples. BHP’s Indigenous Peoples Policy Statement BHP’s ambition is to create long-term relationships with Indigenous peoples based on trust and mutual benefit. We aim to support reconciliation  with Indigenous peoples and contribute to improved social, economic and environmental outcomes. Through our Policy Statement we will be  guided by the aims of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous peoples as articulated in the Policy Statement’s Principles,  which are summarised below. Seek to obtain the free, prior and  informed consent of potentially affected  Indigenous peoples BHP’s default position will be that a proposed new operation  or capital project should not proceed without consent; and  where consent has not been provided, BHP will escalate senior  management involvement in the process to determine if the new  operation or capital project will proceed.    Respect Indigenous peoples’ cultural and     intellectual property and data sovereignty  BHP acknowledges the value and ownership of information  related to Indigenous cultural heritage and the rights to  information regarding Indigenous peoples’ narratives,  traditions and lore. Regional Indigenous Peoples Plans Principles Indigenous partnerships  Under the Indigenous partnerships pillar of our social value framework, we  have set ourselves the goal of delivering respectful relationships that hear  and act upon the distinct perspectives, aspirations and rights of Indigenous  peoples and support the delivery of mutually beneficial and jointly defined  outcomes (refer to OFR 6.5). We have committed to report annually on  metrics for Indigenous employee representation, Indigenous procurement,  our ‘progress to plan’ against the co-designed Indigenous Peoples Plans in  each region where we operate, and about actions to improve the health of  our relationships with those Indigenous peoples.  Relationship health In FY2024, we completed an inaugural assessment of the health of our  relationships with a range of our Indigenous partners. We engaged global  research firm, Ipsos, to independently gather feedback on a confidential  basis from a number of BHP’s Indigenous partners in Australia, Canada  and Chile where we operate our assets. In total, representatives from 17  of 26 Indigenous partner organisations who were contacted to take part  in the inaugural assessment agreed to participate. All organisations that  were contacted for the inaugural assessment have current agreements with  BHP or are located on or near our operations. The feedback indicated that  relationships had been strained in the past. While BHP is making some  progress in its relationships with Indigenous partners, there is still more to  do to achieve our goal of delivering respectful relationships that hear and  act upon the distinct perspectives, aspirations and rights of Indigenous  peoples and support the delivery of mutually beneficial and jointly defined  outcomes. Recommendations for improvement include more resourcing  and empowerment of BHP’s Indigenous Engagement teams, and greater  involvement for Indigenous partners in BHP decision-making around  employment, procurement and community initiatives to ensure opportunities  are available to Indigenous peoples at the community level. The feedback also  indicated that some Indigenous partners desire a greater level of involvement  from BHP in community engagements, such as in cultural events and informal  meetings. The relationship health results varied across the different countries  covered in the assessment and is broadly summarised as: Canada: The five Canadian Indigenous organisations that participated  reported a positive trajectory in their relationship health with BHP and  expressed the most optimism in their feedback on the future potential of  relationships. Key personnel at BHP were seen to instigate respectful,  meaningful and genuine engagements with Indigenous communities.  This has helped create trust in BHP’s commitment to deliver positive  outcomes through community investments and initiatives. Some areas  of concern included past instances of cultural disrespect and that  proactive steps to understand Indigenous history and culture were not  always consistently applied. In some instances, there was frustration  expressed about communications and transparency, as well as present  68 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 71 ===== levels of Indigenous employment representation. The feedback indicates  desire to see more two-way dialogue with decision-makers established.  Looking to the future, Canadian Indigenous partners expressed a high  degree of optimism at the economic opportunities at the Jansen operation.  To maintain this optimism, partners in Canada seek increased Indigenous  representation in decision-making processes and positions and expect a  stronger focus on training and upskilling so that Indigenous peoples may  increase their employability to work for BHP. Australia: The six Australian Indigenous organisations that participated  indicated there had been an improvement in relationship health from the  past to the present. Many of the improvements in overall relationship  health were attributed to key personnel at BHP who advocate strongly for  Indigenous partners and who conduct their engagements respectfully with  long-term goals of Indigenous advancement in mind. The establishment  of Indigenous Engagement and Cultural Heritage teams and greater  direct engagement from BHP senior leaders in Australia were seen  as improvements. However, the feedback also indicates only marginal  improvement from the present to the future for our relationships in  Australia. Some Indigenous partners reported that relationships can still  feel transactional and lacked continuity. In some instances, there was a  view expressed that BHP could provide more commercial and employment  opportunities to Indigenous partners and improve the accessibility of its  systems and processes. These factors contributed to a less optimistic  outlook about the future state of the relationship compared to the other  jurisdictions. There was a desire expressed by Australian Indigenous  partners to see more Indigenous peoples advancing to more senior roles  in BHP. Partners also expressed a desire to see more social investment  initiatives that benefit more groups. These changes, along with more  frequent engagement with decision-makers, were seen as necessary steps  to build trust and to help move towards more respectful relationships based  on mutual benefit in the future. Chile: The six Chilean Indigenous organisations that participated  indicated they had seen modest improvement in relationship health  from the past to the present and were more optimistic in their view on  the future. Indigenous partners in Chile perceive inadequacies in the  opportunities and operational and environmental protections offered by  the national legal system and they expect BHP to set a higher standard.  There was a perception that BHP had prioritised commercial outcomes in  the past and there had, in some cases, been inadequate recognition and  understanding of Chilean culture and values. Some partners continue to  perceive protections as inadequate in managing environmental impacts  and want to see BHP enhance cultural protections, improve access to  areas that hold cultural meaning and implement measures to minimise  the health impacts of mining on communities. More generally, partners  expressed a desire to see BHP be more proactive in engagement with a  broader range of the community, including those that are not recognised  by Chilean legal structures. Partners believe employment and training  opportunities could be better geared to Indigenous staff and skillsets in the  community to improve levels of Indigenous employment. There appears to  be an openness from Indigenous partners to continue engaging to improve  relationships with BHP in Chile. Relationship health assessment results Past Present Future Aggregate       Australia       Canada       Chile       3.8 5.6 5.2 5.3 4.5 7.2 6.6 9.8 2.7 2.7 5.9 7.3 Each interview was structured around one theme: How would you rate the  overall health of the organisation/entity’s relationship with BHP over three  time periods in considering the past, present and future of the relationship?  Responses were recorded as a rating from zero to 10. Our regional  Indigenous Peoples Plans are being considered in light of the partner  feedback received and to identify areas of focus within the actions set  under those plans. Progress to plan We are making progress with our commitments in the global Indigenous  Peoples Policy Statement and the social value framework to incorporate  ‘Indigenous voices and perspectives’ into co-designed priorities, as set out  in the Indigenous Peoples Plans in each region where we operate. We ‘partially met’ our FY2024 social value scorecard short-term milestone  ‘Indigenous voices and perspectives are incorporated into co-designed  priorities in each region’ as two out of three countries have published a  co-designed regional Indigenous Peoples Plan that has incorporated the  voices and perspectives of Indigenous peoples. Australia published its  Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) in FY2023. Canada approved its Canada  Indigenous Partnerships Plan (CIPP) in FY2024. Chile is still developing its  regional Indigenous Peoples Plan and hopes to publish it in FY2026.  Australia: Minerals Australia released its RAP in FY20231. There were  25 RAP targets that were due to be achieved in FY2024; of this, 21  targets were completed in full and we also completed our reforms to  embed four ongoing RAP targets into standard business requirements.  RAP targets have been embedded in BHP’s business planning process  and performance is measured regularly through a new RAP performance  dashboard with live data and scorecards. The BHP RAP Governance and  Accountability Framework has seen the development of the BHP Australian  Indigenous Peoples Working Group (AIPWG) that is attended by the  Minerals Australia Business President and Chief Legal, External Affairs and  Governance Officer.   Canada: Minerals Americas approved its first Canada Indigenous  Partnerships Plan (CIPP) in FY2024. The plan assists BHP to  operationalise our global Indigenous Peoples Policy Statement and  respond to the Truth & Reconciliation Call to Action 92 for businesses in  Canada. The CIPP signifies the journey towards greater co-creation and  to develop impactful partnerships, deliver on Indigenous employment  and procurement targets, as well as support the wellbeing of Indigenous  peoples through internal cultural awareness training and social investment  activities. Implementation of the CIPP is expected to begin in Q1  of FY2025. Chile: In FY2024, Minerals Americas designed the process for developing  an Indigenous Peoples Plan for Chile and is expected to commence  consultations with Indigenous peoples in FY2025 to start to co-design the  plan. We are aim to publish the plan in FY2026. Indigenous procurement and employee participation  We are making progress against our social value scorecard metrics  for Indigenous employee participation and Indigenous procurement.  Indigenous employment teams developed and implemented Indigenous  workforce initiatives in FY2024 to help provide pathways to employment,  support our Indigenous workforce, build a more culturally capable   non-Indigenous workforce and meet our employment metrics. In Australia,  our Indigenous employment was at 8.3 per cent in FY2024, down from  8.6 per cent in FY2023, and our target is to reach 9.7 per cent by FY2027.  In Chile, our Indigenous employment was at 10.1 per cent in FY2024, up  from 9.7 per cent in FY2023, and we surpassed our target to reach 10 per  cent by FY2025. In Canada, our Indigenous employment was at 11.2 per  cent in FY2024, up from 7.7 per cent in FY2023, and our target is to reach  20 per cent by FY2026. For more information on our employee data and approach refer to  OFR 6.6 In FY2024, we continued to improve engagement with Indigenous  businesses across all our operating locations.2 Compared to FY2023, our  direct global spend with Indigenous businesses increased by 83 per cent to  US$609 million in FY2024 and the number of Indigenous vendors engaged  rose by 20 per cent to 263. Through this effort, we have seen continued  growth in spend with Indigenous businesses across our Australian assets  with FY2024 direct spend of US$458 million up from US$267.5 million in  FY2023 in line with our Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) commitments.  In Canada, spend with Indigenous business partnerships during FY2024  totalled US $151 million continuing the focus on these opportunities since  the sanctioning of Jansen Stage 1.  Footnotes 1.

BHP sought input from Traditional Owners  to co-create the 2023 agenda, and the themes of discussion provided  an opportunity to reflect and speak honestly on BHP’s performance and  delivery in the context of Traditional Owner experiences.  We have undertaken consultation in FY2024 to understand the elements  of an effective and sustainable model for an Indigenous advisory body  in Minerals Australia, and, once developed, the advisory body will shape  BHP’s understanding and implementation of commitments in the RAP, until  the end of FY2027. A Cultural Heritage Standard that was developed in FY2023 by the  Minerals Australia Cultural Heritage team was embedded in all BHP  operated assets in Minerals Australia in FY2024. This Standard considers  leading international and national frameworks and aims to enable mining  activity while simultaneously encouraging the voices of relevant First  Nations/Indigenous peoples to be at the forefront of decision-making  processes on heritage matters through the mining lifecycle.   In FY2024, one new Heritage Agreement and 11 new Cultural Heritage  Management Plans were successfully negotiated with Indigenous  communities. These Cultural Heritage Management Plans mainly covered  existing operations at WAIO and BMA to modernise existing government  approvals. In line with our social value approach, new heritage protection  areas were also agreed through the Cultural Heritage Management Plans  and projects supported with communities to culturally map these places for  knowledge transfer and wider community benefits. Minerals Americas Chile In FY2024, Escondida developed a new Indigenous partnership strategy  which aims to build a stable, long-term relationship, based on trust and  mutual benefits, with the five Indigenous communities of Borde Sur:  Peine, Talabre, Socaire, Camar and Toconao. The strategy is focused  on resolving past grievances, honoring commitments and creating  opportunities for regular and structured dialogue between Escondida and  Indigenous communities that will contribute to improved relationships,  build greater trust and proactively address community concerns.  In FY2024, Escondida updated its Community Relationship Strategy  with the Indigenous community of Peine, which is focused on building  and maintaining a long-term relationship. Meetings have been held with  Peine to help inform the project of progressive closure of the Monturaqui  well field.  Our Cerro Colorado operation is planning the execution of several projects  for the next five to seven years, including: care and maintenance activities,  closure works on the Parca Slope, geo/hydro physical drillings and the  Cerro Colorado Life Extension (CCLE) project. All projects will be executed  on the Cerro Colorado mine site and surrounding territories, which are on  lands that are neighbouring the villages of Parca, Iquiuca, Quipisca and  Mamiña, among others. These areas are under a Chilean state’s special  administrative regime (Área de Desarrollo Indígena) and are subject to  territorial claims by different Indigenous organisations. We are engaging  with Indigenous peoples to include their voices during the study phases for  these projects. Despite experiencing challenges with some engagements,  Cerro Colorado is working on an update of the strategy with Indigenous  communities, aimed at reaching agreements with as many communities/ associations as possible. Canada In FY2024, we started to operationalise two draft milestones in the Canadian  Indigenous Partnership Plan (CIPP) while it was under development.  The recommended review and refresh of our internal Indigenous awareness  training that is delivered to all employees and contractors that work at our  Jansen site is underway and will include Indigenous perspectives in the  Effective Leadership training. Additionally, Human Resources conducted  an external review of the human resources policies to support Indigenous  inclusion. A new employee resource group for Indigenous employees located  in Canada, Indigenous@BHP Canada, was created in FY2024 and has been  meeting regularly to determine how best to support recruitment, retention and  advancement for current and future Indigenous employees.  Legacy assets BHP owns more than 20 former copper, uranium and other mine sites,  called legacy assets, in the US southwest and across Canada. Many of  these sites are in the traditional territories of Native American Tribes and  First Nations. The legacy assets are in a state of closure or post-closure and  focused on tailings and water management, risk mitigation and technical  studies, closure and environmental remediation projects, and general site  care and maintenance. We recognise closure is a long-term process, and  that Indigenous peoples have an interest in seeing the sites returned to as  close to a natural state as possible. BHP engages with Indigenous groups  near our legacy assets and is in varying stages of resetting or establishing  collaborative working relationships and partnerships. Resolution Copper Resolution Copper Mining is owned by Rio Tinto (55 per cent) and BHP   (45 per cent), and managed by Rio Tinto. We acknowledge the Resolution  Copper project area includes areas of cultural significance for Native  American Tribes and their members, and is the subject of ongoing litigation.  Development of the project continues to be studied and remains subject to  regulatory reviews by federal, state and local governments. Resolution Copper  Mining continues to cooperatively engage in these regulatory processes and  has publicly stated its commitment to deepening ongoing engagement with  Native American Tribes and stakeholders to understand and seek to mitigate  potential adverse impacts, while also collaborating to create shared value  opportunities. We are monitoring Resolution Copper Mining’s engagement,  FPIC and agreement-making processes. 70 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 73 ===== What we assured Ernst & Young (‘EY’, ’we’) was engaged by BHP to provide limited assurance over certain sustainability data and disclosures in BHP’s Annual Report, ESG Standards and Databook, and online for the year  ended 30 June 2024 in accordance with the Criteria, as defined in the following table: What we assured (Limited Assurance Subject Matter) What we assured it against (Criteria) BHP’s qualitative disclosures in Section 6 of the Operating and Financial Review  within the BHP Annual Report 2024 	 – Management’s own publicly disclosed criteria BHP’s sustainability policies and standards as disclosed in the ICMM tab in the  BHP ESG Standards and Databook 2024 at bhp.com/sustainability 	 – International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) Mining Principles and relevant Performance Expectations  and mandatory Position Statements (Subject Matter 1 of the ICMM Assurance and Validation Procedure 2023  (ICMM Procedure)) BHP’s identification and reporting of its material sustainability issues, risks and  opportunities described within Section 6 of the BHP Annual Report 2024 and online  at bhp.com/sustainability/approach 	 – ICMM Procedure Subject Matter 2 	 – Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards 2021 GRI 3: Material Topics  BHP’s implementation of systems and approaches to manage its material  sustainability risks and opportunities 	 – ICMM Procedure Subject Matter 3 BHP’s reported performance of its material sustainability issues, risks and  opportunities in Section 6 of the Operating and Financial Review within the   BHP Annual Report 2024 and the BHP ESG Standards and Databook 2024,  referenced above 	 – ICMM Procedure Subject Matter 4 	 – Management’s own publicly disclosed criteria. as informed by the GRI Topic Standards, and the Sustainability  Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Mining and Metals Standard 	 – BHP Scopes 1, 2, and 3 GHG Emissions Calculation Methodology 2024, as informed by the National  Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Measurement) Determination 2008 for scope 1 and scope 2 GHG data,  and the World Resource Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development Greenhouse Gas  Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, including the GHG Protocol: Scope 2 Guidance  and the Corporate Value Chain Scope 3 Accounting and Reporting Standard for scope 3 GHG data Water stewardship reporting, at an operated asset level, in the BHP Annual Report  2024, the BHP ESG Standards and Databook 2024, referenced above, and  supporting disclosures included online at bhp.com/sustainability/environment/water 	 – ICMM guidance and minimum disclosure Standards: Water Reporting: Good practice guide (2nd edition), 2021 In addition, we were engaged by BHP to provide reasonable assurance over the following information in accordance with the noted Criteria, as defined in the following table: What we assured (Reasonable Assurance Subject Matter) What we assured it against (Criteria) Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions as reported in Section 6 of the  Operating and Financial Review within the BHP Annual Report 2024 and the BHP  ESG Standards and Databook 2024, referenced above. 	 – World Resource Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD) Greenhouse  Gas Protocol 	 – BHP’s Scopes 1, 2 and 3 GHG Emissions Calculation Methodology 2024 6.13 Independent Assurance Report to the Management and Directors of BHP Group Limited Our Conclusion: Ernst & Young (‘EY’, ‘we’) were engaged by BHP Group Limited (‘BHP’) to undertake a limited and reasonable assurance engagement as defined by International Auditing Standards over the Limited  Assurance Subject Matter and Reasonable Assurance Subject Matter (defined below) for the year ended 30 June 2024. Our conclusions are as follows: 	 – Limited assurance: Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe the Limited Assurance Subject Matter  for the year ended 30 June 2024 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria (as defined below).   	 – Reasonable assurance: In our opinion, the Reasonable Assurance Subject Matter for the year ended 30 June 2024 is prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria (as  defined below).  Emphasis of Matter: We draw attention to BHP’s methodology for accounting for water performance metrics as disclosed in Section 6.10 of BHP’s Annual Report, and associated ESG Standards and Databook. BHP’s method  reflects current industry-wide practice for water modelling which includes estimation of certain variables which contains inherent uncertainty. Consequently, BHP’s disclosed water performance data,  prepared in accordance with the criteria, is subject to estimation uncertainty which may affect the precision of the data presented. Our conclusion is not modified in respect of this matter. Other than as described in the preceding paragraphs, which set out the  scope of our engagement, we did not perform assurance procedures  on the remaining information included in the BHP Annual Report  2024, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion or conclusion on  this information. The Limited Assurance Subject Matter and the Reasonable Assurance  Subject Matter may be referred to in this report, individually or  collectively, as the case requires, as the ‘Subject Matter’. Key responsibilities  BHP’s responsibility  BHP’s management is responsible for selecting the Criteria, and  ensuring the Subject Matter is prepared, in all material respects, in  accordance with that Criteria. This responsibility includes establishing  and maintaining internal controls, maintaining adequate records and  making estimates that are relevant to the preparation of the Subject  Matter, such that it is free from material misstatement, whether due to  fraud or error. EY’s responsibility and independence For the limited assurance engagement, our responsibility is to  express a conclusion on the Limited Assurance Subject Matter based  on the evidence we have obtained. For the reasonable assurance  engagement, our responsibility is to express an opinion conclusion on  the Reasonable Assurance Subject Matter based on the evidence we  have obtained.   We have complied with the independence and relevant ethical  requirements, which are founded on fundamental principles of integrity,  objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and  professional behaviour.  EY applies Auditing Standard ASQM 1 Quality Management for  Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Reports and  Other Financial Information or Other Assurance or Related Services  Engagements, which requires the firm to design, implement and operate  a system of quality management including policies or procedures  regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards  and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Our approach to conducting the assurance procedures We conducted our assurance procedures in accordance with the  International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board’s International  Standard on Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews  of Historical Financial Information (‘ISAE 3000’) and the Standard  for Assurance on Greenhouse Gas Statements (‘ISAE 3410’) and  the terms of reference for this engagement as agreed with BHP on  22 March 2024.  For the limited assurance engagement, these standards require that we  plan and perform our engagement to express a conclusion on whether  anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that  the Limited Assurance Subject Matter is not prepared, in all material  respects, in accordance with the Criteria, and to issue a report. For the reasonable assurance engagement, these standards require  that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether, in all material respects, the Reasonable  Assurance Subject Matter is presented in accordance with the Criteria,  and to issue a report. For both a limited assurance engagement and a reasonable assurance  engagement, the nature, timing and extent of the assurance procedures  selected depend on our professional judgement, including an  assessment of the risk of material misstatement, whether due to fraud  or error. Description of assurance procedures performed A limited assurance engagement consists of making enquiries, primarily  of persons responsible for preparing the Limited Assurance Subject  Matter and related information, and applying analytical and other  appropriate procedures.  The limited assurance procedures we performed were based on our  professional judgement and included, but were not limited to:  – Interviewing select corporate and site personnel to understand the  reporting process at group, business, asset, and site level, including  management’s processes to identify BHP’s material issues  – Reviewing BHP policies and management standards to determine  alignment with the ICMM’s 10 Sustainable Development principles  and position statements  – Checking the BHP Annual Report 2024 to understand how BHP’s  identified material issues, risks and opportunities are reflected within  the qualitative disclosures – Evaluating whether the information disclosed in the Limited  Assurance Subject Matter is consistent with our understanding of  sustainability management and performance at BHP  – Evaluating the suitability of the Criteria and that the Criteria have been  applied appropriately to the Subject Matter  – Conducting virtual and in-person site procedures at BHP locations  on a sample basis, based on our professional judgement (which we  currently implement on a rotational basis across reporting years), to  evidence site level data collection and reporting to Group as well as  to identify existence and confirm completeness of the sustainability  performance data and statements included within the Subject Matter  – Undertaking analytical procedures of the quantitative disclosures  in the Subject Matter to determine the reasonableness of the  information presented – On a sample basis for qualitative and quantitative statements  within the Subject Matter, based on our professional judgement,  reviewing underlying data to source information and data to  assess completeness of claims, such as process conversations,  review of invoices, incident reports, meter calibration records, and  meter data; re-performing calculations to check accuracy; and  reviewing explanations about the sustainability performance data  and statements – Reviewing other information within the BHP Annual Report 2024  for consistency and alignment to other quantitative and qualitative  information within the Subject Matter – Reviewing BHP media coverage relating to sustainability-related  topics to identify material events that may require disclosure – Checking the water balance for each operated asset inclusive of  understanding the methodologies used to consider consistency with  the Criteria, and reviewing meter and calibration records on a sample  basis, based on our professional judgement. Additional reasonable assurance procedures we performed were based  on professional judgement and included, but were not limited to: – For our reasonable assurance of Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse  gas emissions, on a sample basis, checked the methodologies  used by BHP to consider consistency with the Criteria, considered  completeness of sources obtained from our site procedures,  and checked underlying data to source information to assess  completeness and accuracy of performance data, which included  reviewing invoices, meter calibration records and meter data. We believe that the evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to  provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion and reasonable  assurance opinion. Inherent limitations While we considered the effectiveness of management’s internal  controls when determining the nature and extent of our procedures,  our assurance engagement was not designed to provide assurance on  internal controls.  The greenhouse gas emissions quantification process is subject  to scientific uncertainty, which arises because of incomplete  scientific knowledge about the measurement of greenhouse gases.  Additionally, greenhouse gas procedures are subject to estimation  and measurement uncertainty resulting from the measurement and  calculation processes used to quantify greenhouse gas emissions  within the bounds of existing scientific knowledge. Additional inherent limitations – limited assurance scope Procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in  nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable  assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained  in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the  assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance  engagement been performed. Our procedures were designed to obtain  a limited level of assurance on which to base our conclusion and do not  provide all the evidence that would be required to provide a reasonable  level of assurance. Our procedures did not include testing controls or performing  procedures relating to checking aggregation or calculation of data  within IT systems. Additional inherent limitations – reasonable assurance scope While our procedures performed for our reasonable assurance  engagement are of a higher level of assurance, due to the use of  sampling techniques, it is not a guarantee that it will always detect  material misstatements. Other matters We have not performed assurance procedures in respect of any  information relating to prior reporting periods, including those presented  in the Limited Assurance Subject Matter and Reasonable Assurance  Subject Matter. Our report does not extend to any disclosures or  assertions made by BHP relating to future performance plans and/ or strategies disclosed in the BHP Annual Report 2024, the BHP ESG  Standards and Databook 2024, and supporting disclosures online. Use of our Assurance Report We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this  assurance report to any persons other than the management and  the directors of BHP, or for any purpose other than that for which it  was prepared.  Our assurance procedures were performed over certain web- based information that was available via web links as of the date  of this assurance report. We provide no assurance over changes  to the content of this web-based information after the date of this  assurance report.

Tragically, 19 people died as a result  of the failure. The communities of Bento Rodrigues, Paracatu de Baixo  and Gesteira were flooded and other communities and the environment  downstream in the Doce River basin were also affected.  Samarco restarted its operations at a reduced production level in December  2020 and is currently operating at 31 per cent of its production capacity.  For information on Samarco’s operations refer to OFR 5.3 Our response and support for the Foundation Following the dam failure, BHP Brasil1 has been and remains fully committed  to supporting the extensive ongoing remediation and compensation efforts  of Renova Foundation in Brazil. BHP Brasil’s commitment to collectively  seek solutions for a full, fair and definitive response remains unwavering. In March 2016, a Framework Agreement entered into between Samarco,  Vale, BHP Brasil and relevant Brazilian authorities established the  Renova Foundation, a not-for-profit, private foundation responsible for  implementing 42 remediation and compensatory programs. BHP Brasil,  along with Samarco and Vale, provide support and funding to the Renova  Foundation, including through representation in its governance structures.  As of 30 June 2024, the Renova Foundation has spent R$37 billion  (approximately US$7.7 billion) on remediation and compensation programs,  of which approximately US$2.6 billion has been provided by BHP Brasil. Renova Foundation Compensation and financial assistance The Renova Foundation continues to provide compensation to people  impacted by the dam failure, oversees an extensive community resettlement  program and manages measures to remediate the environment affected. Compensation and financial assistance of approximately R$17.5 billion  (approximately US$3.5 billion)2 as of 30 June has been paid to support  approximately 430,000 people affected by the dam failure. This includes: 	 – Approximately R$12.2 billion (approximately US$2.5billion)2 paid to  approximately 110,000 people under the court-mandated simplified  indemnity system (known as the Novel system). The Novel system was  designed to provide compensation for informal workers who have had  difficulty proving the damages they suffered, such as cart drivers, sand  miners, artisanal miners and street vendors. The court determined the  closure of the Novel system for new entries in September 2023.  	 – Approximately 33,000 people received emergency financial assistance. 	 – Approximately 39,000 people received general damages (including for  loss of life, injury, property damage, business impacts, loss of income  and moral damages) and more than 290,000 people have been paid a  total of approximately R$305.6 million (approximately US$69 million)2  for temporary water interruption. For updates on reparation progress refer to bhp.com/what-we-do/global- locations/brazil/samarco-reparations Resettlement A key priority for the Renova Foundation is the resettlement of the  communities of Novo Bento Rodrigues, Paracatu and Gesteira. For Novo  Bento Rodrigues and Paracatu, priority efforts included construction of  houses and private property, such as small businesses and churches, as  well as infrastructure and public services, including roads, power, water  and sewer networks, health and services centres and schools. At Gesteira,  pursuant to an agreement finalised in May 2023 and ratified by the court,  families and the public authorities have opted to receive compensation  instead of building a new community. As at 30 June 2024, approximately 91 per cent of resettlement cases have  been completed, either via completion of construction (with families moving  in or handover to families in progress) or cash payment for those families  who have opted for this option instead of the other resettlement solutions  offered by the Renova Foundation. More than 260 families are now living  in their new homes in Novo Bento Rodrigues and Paracatu, as well as  other locations.3 Novo Bento Rodrigues and Paracatu are now functioning  communities. Water treatment stations, a health centre, a church, a football  field, as well as multiple businesses are operating, including supermarkets,  restaurants, bars, retail shops and service stations. Additionally,  community-led traditional festivities, such as Carnival and other religious  events, are taking place regularly in both towns.  The resettlements have involved ongoing engagement and consultation  with a large number of stakeholders, including the affected community  members, their technical advisers, state prosecutors, municipal leaders,  regulators and other interested parties. The new towns were designed on land chosen by the communities to be as  close as possible to the previous layout, addressing the wishes and needs  of the families and communities while also meeting permitting requirements.  Each family receives access to an architect to design their house within size  parameters, which is then finalised and built by the Renova Foundation. Mandated COVID-19 workforce restrictions and suspensions of works   on-site from 2020 to 2022, increases to the technical scope for  resettlement of the communities and permitting delays have impacted   the timeline for completion. Ongoing efforts to accelerate completions  while maintaining the safety requirements continued throughout FY2024. For updates on reparation progress refer to  bhp.com/what-we-do/global-locations/brazil/samarco-reparations Other socio-economic programs The Renova Foundation continues to implement a wide range of socio- economic programs in addition to compensation and resettlement programs.  These programs cover health and infrastructure projects in the Doce River  basin, promotion of economic development in the impacted communities and  sewage treatment facilities to further improve the water quality in the Doce River. Regarding infrastructure projects, the Risoleta Neves Hydroelectric  Power Plant (Candonga), which was shut down after the Fundão dam  failure, restarted its operations in the state of Minas Gerais in March 2023.  Additionally, 18 new water pipelines have been built in the Doce River,  including one to serve the population of Governador Valadares, the biggest  city in the river basin, and 19 water treatment supply systems have been  upgraded to provide alternative water sources.  Environmental remediation Since December 2019, the impacted riverbanks and floodplains have  been vegetated, river margins stabilised and in general, water quality and  sediment qualities have returned to historic levels. The Renova Foundation  continues implementing long-term monitoring and compensatory initiatives. The Brazilian Water Agency, a federal body responsible for the  implementation of Brazilian water resources, has classified the water  from the Doce River as Class II, which means the water can be used  for human consumption after conventional treatment, the protection of  aquatic habitats and primary contact recreation, such as swimming, water  skiing and diving, among other things. This is supported by approximately  1.5 million pieces of data generated annually along the Doce River by the  largest watercourse monitoring system in Brazil, which is led by the Renova  Foundation together with six public agencies, including the National Water  and Sanitation Agency. Additionally, according to information provided by  municipalities and water supply institutions, since December 2015 most  of the population in the Doce River basin is using and consuming the river  water after conventional treatment.  To further improve water quality in the Doce River, as compensation,  the Renova Foundation has made R$840 million (approximately  US$174 million) available for sanitation projects to prevent pollution  from untreated sewage, given approximately 270 million cubic metres  of untreated sewage is deposited into the Doce River every year –  approximately six times the volume of non-toxic tailings that was released  from Fundão. Additionally, R$1.7 billion (approximately US$352 million)  was made available for forest recovery. It is intended that in total 40,000  hectares and 5,000 springs will be fully restored in a partnership with  approximately 2,000 rural properties. A ban on fishing activities along the coast of Espírito Santo and a  precautionary conservation restriction preventing fishing for native fish species  in the Doce River in Minas Gerais remain in place. The Renova Foundation  continues to engage with the authorities with the goal of lifting the restrictions. For updates on reparation progress refer to   bhp.com/what-we-do/global-locations/brazil/samarco-reparations Legal proceedings BHP Group Limited, BHP Group (UK) Ltd (formerly BHP Group Plc) and BHP  Brasil are involved in legal proceedings relating to the Fundão dam failure. BHP Brasil, Samarco, Vale and several public authorities have been  engaging in negotiations to seek a definitive and substantive settlement of  certain claims relating to the Fundão dam failure.

Our Risk Framework has four pillars: risk strategy, risk governance, risk process and risk intelligence. Risks associated with the organisations, businesses or assets that we acquire are transitioned to BHP’s Risk Framework as part of integration activities,  which generally involves a transitional period. Risk integration of our OZ Minerals assets (excluding the OZ Minerals Brazil assets which are subject to  ongoing strategic review) remains on track for completion by the end of CY2024. Risk strategy Risk classification  We classify all risks to which BHP is exposed using our Group Risk  Architecture. This is a tool designed to identify, analyse, monitor and  report risk, which provides a platform to understand and manage  risks. Similar risks are considered together in groups and categories.  This is designed to give the Board and management visibility over  the aggregate exposure to risks on a Group-wide basis and support  performance monitoring and reporting against BHP’s risk appetite. Risk appetite  BHP’s Risk Appetite Statements, aligned to our Group Risk  Architecture, are approved by the Board and are a foundational  element of our Risk Framework. They provide guidance to  management on the amount and type of risk we seek to take in  pursuing our objectives. Key risk indicators  Key risk indicators (KRIs) are set by management to help monitor  performance against our risk appetite. They also support decision- making by providing management with information about financial and  non-financial risk exposure at a Group level. Each KRI has a target, or  optimal level of risk we seek to take, as well as upper and lower limits.  Where either limit is exceeded, management will review potential  causes to understand if BHP may be taking too little or too much risk  and to identify whether further action is required. Risk culture  Our risk management approach is underpinned by a risk culture  that supports decision-making in accordance with BHP’s values,  objectives and risk appetite. We use a common foundation across  BHP to build the tools and capabilities required to enable us to  understand, monitor and manage our risk culture. These include the  risk-culture assessments undertaken as part of our internal audit plan. Strategic business decisions  Strategic business decisions and the pursuit of our strategic  objectives can inform, create or affect risks to which BHP is exposed.  These risks may represent opportunities as well as threats. Our Risk  Appetite Statements and KRIs assist in determining whether a  proposed course of action is consistent with BHP’s risk appetite. Our focus when managing risks associated with strategic business  decisions is to enable the pursuit of high-reward strategies. Therefore,  as well as having controls designed to protect BHP from threats, we  seek to implement controls to enable and/or enhance opportunities. Risk governance Three lines model BHP uses the ‘three lines model’ to define the role of different teams  across the organisation in managing risk. This approach sets clear  accountabilities for risk management and provides appropriate  ‘checks and balances’ to support us in protecting and growing value.  The first line is provided by our frontline staff, operational  management and people in functional roles – anyone who makes  decisions, deploys resources or contributes to an outcome is  responsible for identifying and managing the associated risks.  The Risk team and other second-line teams are responsible for  providing expertise, support, monitoring and challenge on risk-related  matters, including by defining Group-wide minimum standards.  The third line, our Internal Audit team, is responsible for providing  independent and objective assurance over the control environment  (governance, risk management and internal controls) to the Board  (including applicable Board Committees) and Executive Leadership  Team. Additional assurance may also be provided by external  providers, such as our External Auditor.  The Risk team and Internal Audit team are led by the Chief Risk  and Audit Officer. This structure facilitates overall effectiveness of  both teams, including through alignment of second- and third-line  assurance activities across BHP, while maintaining the independence  of our Internal Audit team through appropriate safeguards. BHP Board and Committees The Board reviews and monitors the effectiveness of the Group’s  systems of financial and non-financial risk management and internal  control. The broad range of skills, experience and knowledge of  the Board assists in providing a diverse view on risk management.  The Risk and Audit Committee (RAC) and Sustainability Committee  assist the Board by reviewing and considering BHP’s material risk  profile (covering operational, strategic and emerging risks) on a  biannual basis.  Risk management performance is monitored and reported to the  RAC, as well as the Sustainability Committee for health, safety,  environment and community matters, supporting the Board to  challenge and hold management to account. For information on other Board Committee activities  that support risk governance at BHP refer to  Corporate Governance Statement 5 73 Overview Additional Information Financial Statements Governance Contents Operating and Financial Review  ===== PAGE 76 ===== 8 How we manage risk continued 8.1 Risk factors Our risk factors are described below and may occur as a result of our  activities globally, including in connection with our operated and non- operated assets, third parties engaged by BHP or through our value  chain. These risks, individually or collectively, could threaten our strategy,  business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity and reputation.  They could also materially and adversely affect the health and safety of  our people or members of the public, the environment, the communities  where we or our third-party partners and providers operate, or the  interests of our partners and stakeholders, which could in each case lead  to litigation, regulatory investigations or enforcement actions (including  class actions or actions arising from contractual, legacy or other liabilities  associated with divested assets), or a loss of partner, stakeholder and/ or investor confidence. References to ‘financial performance’ include our  financial condition and liquidity, including due to decreased profitability or  increased operating costs, capital spend, remediation costs or contingent  liabilities. BHP may also be exposed to risks that we currently believe to be  immaterial that may materially affect our business if they occur. Each risk factor may present opportunities as well as threats. We take  certain risks for strategic reward in the pursuit of our strategy and purpose,  including to grow our asset portfolio and develop the right capabilities for  the future of our business. Some of the potential threats and opportunities  associated with each of our risk factors are described below, along with the  key controls to manage them. These controls are not exhaustive and many  Group-wide controls (such as Our Code of Conduct, Risk Framework,  mandatory minimum performance requirements for risk management,  health, safety and other matters, dedicated non-operated joint venture  teams and our Contractor Management Framework) help to support  effective and efficient management of all risks in line with our risk appetite.  While we implement preventative and/or mitigating controls designed to  reduce the likelihood of a threat from occurring and minimise the impacts if  it does, these may not always be effective.  Risk process Our Risk Framework requires identification and management of risks  (both threats and opportunities) to be embedded in business activities  through the following process:  	 – Risk identification – threats and opportunities are identified and  each is assigned an owner or accountable individual. 	 – Risk assessments – risks are assessed using appropriate  and internationally recognised techniques to determine their  potential impacts and likelihood, prioritise them and inform risk  treatment options. 	 – Risk treatment – controls are implemented to prevent, minimise  and/or mitigate threats, and enable and/or enhance opportunities. 	 – Monitoring and review – risks and controls are reviewed  periodically and on an ad hoc basis (including where there are  high-potential events or changes in the external environment) to  evaluate performance. 	 – Communication – relevant information is recorded in our enterprise  risk management system to support continuous improvement and  share risk intelligence across the Group. Our Risk Framework includes requirements and guidance on the tools  and processes to manage current and emerging risks. Current risks Current risks are risks that could impact BHP today or in the near  future and comprise current operational risks (risks that have their  origin inside BHP or occur as a result of our activities) and current  strategic risks (risks that may enhance or impede the achievement of  our strategic objectives). Current risks include material and non-material risks (as defined by  our Risk Framework). The materiality of a current risk is determined  by estimating the maximum foreseeable loss (MFL) if that risk were to  materialise. The MFL is the estimated impact to BHP in a worst-case  scenario without regard to probability and assuming all controls,  including insurance and hedging contracts, are ineffective.  For more information on our risk factors refer to OFR 8.1 Our focus for current risks is to prevent their occurrence or minimise  their impact should they occur, but we also consider how to maximise  possible benefits that might be associated with strategic risks (as  described in the Risk strategy section). Current material risks are  required to be evaluated once a year at a minimum to determine  whether our exposure to the risk is within our target range. Emerging risks Emerging risks are newly developing or changing risks that are  highly uncertain and difficult to quantify. They are generally driven by  external influences and often cannot be prevented by BHP. BHP maintains a ‘watch list’ of emerging themes and monitors  associated signals to interpret external events and trends, providing  an evolving view of the changing external environment and how  it might impact our business. We use the watch list and signal  monitoring to support the identification and management of emerging  risks, as well as to inform and test our corporate strategy.  Once identified, our focus for emerging risks is on structured  monitoring of the external environment, advocacy efforts to reduce  the likelihood of the threats manifesting and identifying options to  increase our resilience to these threats. Risk intelligence The Risk team provides the RAC, Sustainability Committee and  senior management with insights on risk management across  BHP. Risk reports may include trends, aggregate exposure and  performance for our most significant risks, updates on the Risk  Framework and risk management priorities, an overview of (and  material changes in) BHP’s material risk profile and updates on  emerging risk themes and signals.  We maintain a risk insights dashboard designed to provide current,  data-driven and actionable risk intelligence to our people at all levels  of the business to support decision-making. This tool empowers the  business to manage risks more effectively, with increased accuracy  and transparency. The Board, RAC and Sustainability Committee also receive other  reports to support the Board to review and monitor the effectiveness  of BHP’s systems of financial and non-financial risk management.  Examples of these include internal audit reports, ethics and  investigations reports, compliance reports and the Chief Executive  Officer’s report.  For more information on our risk factors refer to OFR 8.1 74 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 77 ===== Risk factor: Operational events Risks associated with operational events in connection with our activities globally, resulting in significant adverse impacts on our people, communities,  the environment or our business. Why is this important to BHP? We engage in activities that have previously caused and have the potential  to further cause harm to our people and assets, communities, other  stakeholders and/or the environment, including serious injuries, illness and  fatalities, loss of infrastructure, amenities and livelihood, and damage to  sites of cultural significance. An operational event at our operated or non- operated assets or through our value chain could also cause damage or  disruptions to our assets and operations, impact our financial performance,  result in litigation or class actions and cause long-term damage to our  licence to operate and reputation. Potential physical climate-related  impacts could increase the likelihood and/or severity of risks associated  with operational events. Impacts of operational events may also be  amplified if one event triggers another (for example, a geotechnical  instability event that causes a failure in a nearby tailings storage facility)  or if we fail to respond to any events in a way that is consistent with our  corporate values and partner and stakeholder expectations.  Examples of potential threats 	 – Air, land (road and rail) and marine transportation events (such as  aircraft crashes or vessel collisions, groundings or hydrocarbon release)  that occur while transporting people, supplies or products, including to  or from exploration, operation or customer locations. These locations   may be in or require travel through areas of cultural significance or  remote and environmentally sensitive areas, including in Australia,   South America, Asia, the United States, Canada and Sweden. 	 – Failure of a water or tailings storage facility, such as the tragic failure  of the Fundão dam at Samarco in 2015 or a failure at one of our other  facilities in Australia, Chile, Peru, the United States, Canada or Brazil.  	 – Unplanned fire events or explosions (on the surface or underground).  	 – Geotechnical instability events (such as failure of underground  excavations, which may be subject to greater risk than surface mines,  unexpected large wall instabilities in our open-pit mines, or potential  interaction between our mining activities and community infrastructure  or natural systems), including at our mines in Australia, Chile, Peru, the  United States, Canada or Brazil. 	 – Critical infrastructure, equipment, or hazardous materials  containment failures, other occupational or process safety events or  workplace exposures. 	 – Operational events experienced by third parties, which may also result  in unavailability of shared critical infrastructure (such as railway lines  or ports) or transportation routes (such as the Port Hedland channel in  Western Australia).  	 – An operational event that may adversely affect our people and assets,  communities, other stakeholders and/or the environment, including  serious injuries, illness and fatalities, loss of infrastructure and damage  to sites of cultural significance. 	 – Our operations, workforce, communities, supply chains, customers  and third-party partners and providers may be increasingly exposed to  changes in the frequency, intensity and/or duration of intense storms,  drought, flooding, wildfire and other extreme weather or weather-related  events and patterns (such as extreme heat).  Examples of potential opportunities 	 – Our commitment to our communities, the environment and the safety  and wellbeing of our people may increase operational resilience as well  as partner and stakeholder confidence, enhancing our ability to attract  and retain talent and access (or lower the cost of) capital. 	 – Collaborating with industry peers and relevant organisations on  minimum standards (such as the internationally recognised Flight Safety  Foundation’s Basic Aviation Risk Standard, Global Industry Standard  on Tailings Management, Large Open Pit Project guidelines on open-pit  mining design and management, and the Cave Mining 2040 Consortium  on deep mining design and management) supports improvements to  wider industry management of operational risks and may also identify  opportunities to improve our own practices. Key management actions 	 – Planning, designing, constructing, operating, maintaining and monitoring  surface and underground mines, water and tailings storage facilities, and  other infrastructure and equipment in a manner designed to maintain  structural integrity, prevent incidents and protect our people, assets,  communities, the environment and other stakeholders. 	 – Specifying minimum requirements and technical specifications, such  as for transportation (including high-occupancy vehicles, fixed and  rotary wing aircraft and their operators) and geotechnical (including  characterisation, design, ground control and monitoring), and focusing  on compliance with operating specifications, industry codes and  other relevant standards, including BHP’s mandatory minimum  performance requirements. 	 – Continuing to focus on improving our management of safety risks,  including through investigation and response to the recent fatal incidents  across our operations, and through programs such as the Fatality  Elimination and Field Leadership Programs.  	 – Defining key governance roles, such as a dam owner (an internal BHP  individual who is accountable for maintaining effective governance  and integrity of each tailings storage facility) and providing training and  qualifications for our people. 	 – Inspections, technical reviews, audits and other assurance activities,  such as independent dam safety reviews and geotechnical  review boards. 	 – Maintaining evacuation routes, supporting equipment, crisis and  emergency response plans and business continuity plans.  	 – Incorporating future climate projections into risks associated  with operational events through ongoing assessment of physical  climate‑related risks. FY2024 insights Our exposure to risks associated with operational events remained  broadly stable in FY2024. BHP achieved conformance to the Global  Industry Standard on Tailings Management for ‘Very High’ and  ‘Extreme’ rated facilities in H1 FY2024, supporting our continued  focus to further improve the safety and integrity of all facilities across  our operated and closed assets.

Why is this important to BHP? The long-term viability of our business is closely connected to the  wellbeing of the communities and environments where we have a  presence and our business is subject to increasing, complex and changing  regulatory and stakeholder expectations. At any stage of the asset life  cycle, our activities and operations may have or be perceived to have  significant adverse impacts on communities and environments. In these  circumstances, we may fail to meet the evolving expectations of our  partners and stakeholders (including investors, governments, employees,  suppliers, customers and Indigenous peoples and other community  members) whose support is needed to realise our strategy and purpose.  This could lead to loss of partner or stakeholder support or regulatory  approvals, increased taxes and regulation, enforcement action, litigation  (including class actions), or otherwise impact our licence to operate and  adversely affect our reputation, ability to attract and retain talent, ability to  access capital, operational continuity and financial performance.  Examples of potential threats 	 – Engaging in or being associated with activities (including through non- operated joint ventures and our value chain) that have or are perceived  to have individual or cumulative adverse impacts on nature (including  biodiversity, land, waters and air), climate change, supply chain or  responsible sourcing requirements, human rights or Indigenous peoples’  rights or cultural heritage.  	 – Failing to meet evolving partner or stakeholder expectations in  connection with our alignment with global frameworks and societal  goals, our strategic decisions, legal and regulatory obligations,  acceptability of mining activities, relationships with Indigenous peoples,  community wellbeing and the way we invest in communities or our  approach to nature (including biodiversity, land, waters and air), climate  change, supply chain or responsible sourcing requirements, human  rights, Indigenous peoples’ rights or cultural heritage priorities. 	 – Political, regulatory and judicial developments (such as legislation  to enact policy positions on climate change, nature-related risk or  human rights) could increase uncertainty in relation to our operating  environment, and/or require us to adjust our business plans or strategy.  For example, changes to regulations may require us to modify mine  plans, limit our access to reserves and resources, alter the timing or  increase costs associated with exploration and development of and  production from, or closure and rehabilitation of, our assets, increase  sourcing costs or expose BHP to unanticipated environmental or other  legacy liabilities.  	 – Failing to adequately identify or to appropriately manage physical  climate-related risks and/or nature-related risks to biodiversity  and ecosystems. For example, loss of important biodiversity  and/or ecosystems as a result of operational activities (e.g.  unauthorised clearing of vegetation) could result in land access  restrictions, a decrease in demand for our products or limit our access  to new opportunities.  Examples of potential opportunities 	 – Our support for responsible stewardship of natural resources may  enhance the resilience of the environments and communities where we  operate to threats (including potential physical climate-related impacts  and nature loss).  	 – Strong social performance, including sustainable mining and a focus on  the wellbeing of communities, could generate competitive advantage in  the jurisdictions where we operate.  	 – Our global social value framework and projects funded through social  investment may improve partner and stakeholder relations, enhance  community trust and increase investor confidence and demand for  our commodities.  	 – Greater clarity, transparency and standards associated with regulatory  regimes that support and protect communities and the environment  may increase requirements across our sector, generating competitive  advantage for companies that have already invested in social and  environmental performance.  Key management actions 	 – The Community Global Standard, the Environment Global Standard,  the Climate Change Global Standard and our mandatory minimum  performance requirements for water, closure and legacy management,  and social value and sustainability are designed to set out our targets,  goals, commitments and/or approach to these matters, strengthening  our social, human rights and environmental performance.  	 – Engaging in regular, open and transparent dialogue with partners  and stakeholders to better understand their expectations, concerns  and interests, undertaking research to better understand partner and  stakeholder perceptions, and taking those considerations into account  in planning and execution activities.  	 – Continuing to operationalise our Indigenous Peoples Policy Statement,  including by introducing procedures for projects and assets to identify  and assess potential adverse impacts to Indigenous peoples, and to  engage and consult with them to better understand how we can avoid,  mitigate and/or substantially address any adverse impacts. 	 – Building social value into our decision-making process, along with  financial considerations, including through our social value framework  and 2030 goals.  	 – Building partner and stakeholder trust and contributing to environmental  and community resilience, including through collaborating on shared  challenges (such as climate change and nature), enhanced external  reporting of our operated assets’ potential impacts on nature, and  maximising the value of social investments (including contributing to  climate-related initiatives) through our social investment strategy. 	 – Conducting regular research and impact assessments for operated  assets to better understand the social, environmental, human rights and  economic context. This supports us to identify and analyse potential  partner, stakeholder, community and human rights impacts, including  modern slavery risks and emerging issues. We also complete risk-based  due diligence screening on suppliers through our Ethical Supply Chain  and Transparency program.  	 – Integrating closure into our planning, decision-making and other  activities through the life cycle of our operated assets, as set out in  our mandatory minimum performance requirements for closure and  legacy management.  FY2024 insights Our exposure to risks with potentially significant social or  environmental impacts steadily increased in FY2024 due to  greater external stakeholder expectations for corporate social and  environmental performance, including aspects of climate change and  nature. The intersections between climate change, nature, Indigenous  peoples and human rights are becoming more widely understood  by civil society, contributing to an evolving and increasingly complex  risk landscape. To support effective management of these risks, we  continue to monitor and seek to better understand the intersecting risk  landscape and integrate controls into our management systems.  For more information refer to OFR 6.5 – 2030 goals OFR 6.6 – People OFR 6.9 – Climate change OFR 6.10 – Environment and nature OFR 6.11 – Community OFR 6.12 – Indigenous peoples bhp.com/sustainability 76 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 79 ===== Risk factor: Optimising growth and portfolio returns Risks associated with our ability to position our asset portfolio to generate returns and value for shareholders, including through acquisitions, mergers  and divestments. Why is this important to BHP? We make decisions and take actions in pursuit of our strategy to optimise  our asset portfolio and to secure and create growth options in future-facing  commodities (such as copper, nickel and potash). These may include active  portfolio changes such as the recent sale of the Daunia and Blackwater  mines in Queensland, the acquisition of OZ Minerals and, if completed, the  proposed acquisition of Filo Corp and agreement to form a joint venture  with Lundin Mining. These may also include supporting innovative early- stage mineral exploration companies (including for example through our  accelerator program, BHP Xplor), and maturing and developing organic  growth options across our existing portfolio. A strategy that does not  support BHP’s objectives and/or ill-timed execution of our strategy, or other  circumstances, may lead to a loss of value that impacts our ability to deliver  returns to shareholders and fund our investment and growth opportunities.  It may also result in our asset portfolio being less resilient to climate-related  risks or movements in commodity prices, or inflationary pressures and  other macroeconomic factors. In the short term, adverse movements in  commodity prices may reduce our cash flow, ability to access capital or pay  dividends. A failure to optimise our asset portfolio for structural movements  in commodity prices (including those arising from climate-related risks) over  the long term may result in asset impairments and could adversely affect the  results of our operations, financial performance and returns to investors. Examples of potential threats 	 – Commodity prices have historically been and may continue to be subject  to significant volatility, including due to global economic and geopolitical  factors, industrial activity, commodity supply (including the development  of new resources and supply chain disruptions) and demand (including  inventory levels), technological change, product substitution, tariffs,  interest rate movements and exchange rate fluctuations. Our usual  policy and practice is to sell our products at prevailing market prices  and, as such, movements in commodity prices may affect our financial  performance. Long-term price volatility, sustained low prices or  increases in costs may adversely impact our financial performance  as we do not generally have the ability to offset costs through  price increases.  	 – Failure to optimise our portfolio through effective and efficient  acquisitions, exploration, large project delivery, mergers, divestments or  expansion of existing or acquired assets (including due to sub-optimal  capital prioritisation) may adversely impact our performance and/or  returns to investors.  	 – Failure to identify potential changes in commodity attractiveness and  missed entry or commodity exit opportunities may result in decreased  return on capital spend for, or overpayment to acquire or invest in, new  assets or projects, stranded assets or reduced divestment proceeds. 	 – Failure to achieve expected commercial objectives from assets or  investments, such as cost savings, increased revenues or improved  operational performance (including as a result of inaccurate commodity  price assumptions or resources and reserves estimates), may result  in returns that are lower than anticipated and loss of value. This could  be exacerbated by impacts from factors such as climate-related  risks, supply chain disruptions (for example, disruption in the energy  sector impacting our end-user markets), labour shortages, inflationary  pressures and unfavourable exchange rates, creating operational  headwinds and challenging on-time and on-budget project delivery.  	 – Renegotiation or nullification of permits, inability to secure new  permits or approvals, increased royalties, such as the Queensland  Government’s increase in coal royalty tax in June 2022, fiscal or  monetary policy instability or changes may increase our costs or  adversely impact our ability to achieve expected commercial objectives  from assets or investments, access reserves, develop, maintain or  operate our assets, enter new jurisdictions, or otherwise optimise  our portfolio.    	 – Inability to predict long-term trends in the supply, demand and price of  commodities and optimise our asset portfolio accordingly may restrict  our ability to generate long-term returns from the portfolio. For example,  slowing economic growth in China, political and trade tensions, market  volatility or the global transition to a low-carbon economy may result in  lower demand and prices for some of our products, which may in turn  adversely impact our portfolio returns.  	 – Partnering with companies for growth may also damage our reputation  and lead to increased potential for litigation if those companies or  associated activities are misaligned with our values, standards or  stakeholder expectations, particularly in circumstances in which we do  not operate the asset or have a controlling interest in the venture. Examples of potential opportunities 	 – Acquisition of new resources or acceleration of organic growth options  in future-facing commodities may strengthen and diversify our portfolio  and protect and grow value over the long term. 	 – Ability to predict long-term commodity demand, supply and price trends  may lead to BHP being able to identify and acquire new future-facing  commodities and assets ahead of our competitors or exit from declining  commodities in a timely manner, strengthening our portfolio and leading  to long-term, higher portfolio returns. 	 – BHP may be perceived as a welcome and valued or preferred partner for  the development of new resource opportunities, enabling us to secure  new assets or exploration opportunities to create long-term optionality in  the portfolio. Key management actions 	 – Further developing strategies, processes and frameworks to grow  and protect our portfolio and to assist in delivering ongoing returns to  shareholders, including: 	 – our Capital Allocation Framework, corporate planning processes and  investment management processes  	 – annual reviews (including resilience testing) of portfolio valuations 	 – our exploration, ventures (such as BHP Ventures), accelerators (such  as BHP Xplor) and business development programs, which focus on  replenishing our resource base and enhancing our portfolio (including  creating and securing more options in future-facing commodities) 	 – our long-term strategic outlook and ongoing strategic processes to  assess our competitive advantage and enable the identification of  threats to or opportunities for our portfolio through forecasting and  scenario modelling 	 – monitoring signals to interpret external events and trends, and  designing commodity strategies and price protocols that are reviewed  by management and the Board 	 – our balance sheet and liquidity framework, which is designed to  maintain a robust balance sheet with sufficient liquidity and access to  diverse sources of funding, to enable us to be ready to pursue growth  opportunities as and when they arise  	 – Pursuing a considered approach to new country entry, including further  building our capability to operate in higher-risk jurisdictions, in order to  support portfolio opportunities. 	 – Further developing BHP’s social value proposition to position BHP as a  preferred partner for the development of resource opportunities in line  with the expectations of local communities, host governments and other  global stakeholders. FY2024 insights Our exposure to risks associated with optimising growth and portfolio  returns remained stable in FY2024 as we continued to implement a  growth agenda focused on aligning the portfolio towards future-facing  commodities. In particular, in FY2024 we completed the sale of the  Daunia and Blackwater mines in Queensland to Whitehaven Coal,  approved an investment in stage two of the Jansen potash project  in Canada, and continued to pursue options to build our portfolio in  future-facing commodities. We also made the decision to temporarily  suspend Western Australia Nickel as a result of oversupply in the  global nickel market. Forecast nickel prices for the next half of the  decade have fallen sharply due to strong growth in alternative, low- cost nickel supply.

Why is this important to BHP? Transition risks arise from existing and emerging policy, regulatory, legal,  technological, market and other societal responses to the challenges posed  by climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy. As a world- leading resources company, BHP is exposed to a range of transition risks  that could affect the execution of our strategy or our operational efficiency,  asset values and growth options, resulting in a material adverse impact on our  financial performance, share price or reputation, including increased potential  for litigation. Conversely, transition risks may also present opportunities  for our diverse portfolio and through decarbonisation of our business.  The complex and pervasive nature of climate change means transition risks  are interconnected with and may amplify our other risk factors. Additionally,  the inherent uncertainty of potential societal responses to climate change may  create a systemic risk to the global economy and our business.  Examples of potential threats 	 – Introduction or improvement of low-carbon technologies or changes  in customer preference for products that support the transition to a  low-carbon economy may decrease demand for some of our products,  increase our costs or decrease the availability of key inputs to  production. For example: 	 – Rapid shift to alternative steelmaking technology pathways (including  electric arc furnace (EAF) and direct reduced iron (DRI) steelmaking)  may reduce anticipated demand for our steelmaking coal and may  result in the early closure or divestment of our steelmaking coal mines. 	 – Increased recovery and reuse rates of commodities may reduce  demand for our products. 	 – New battery technologies that use no or less nickel could enter the  market and reduce demand for our nickel products.  	 – Adverse macroeconomic changes, such as a decline in global economic  activity and/or security, could be exacerbated by the transition to a low- carbon economy and reduce anticipated demand for our future-facing  commodities, such as copper and nickel.  	 – Perceptions of climate-related financial risk and/or social concerns  around climate change may result in investors divesting our securities  or changing their expectations or requirements for investment in our  securities, cause financial institutions not to provide financing or other  products (such as insurance cover) to BHP or to our suppliers or  customers, affect our suppliers’ willingness to provide goods or services,  and affect our customers’ wish to procure our commodities. In turn,  these factors could increase our costs and adversely impact our ability  to optimise our portfolio and pursue growth opportunities.  	 – Perceived or actual misalignment of BHP’s climate actions (goals, targets  and performance) with societal and investor expectations, or a failure to  deliver our climate actions, may result in damage to our reputation, reduced  investor confidence, climate-related litigation (including class actions) or  give rise to other adverse regulatory, legal or market responses.  	 – Sub-optimal selection, quality, implementation or effectiveness of  technology and related low-carbon supplies that are intended to  contribute towards the delivery of our climate targets, goals and  strategies, or unavailability of that technology and related low-carbon  supplies (including due to the failure of trials of new technology, a failure  of external equipment manufacturers or suppliers to deliver on schedule  or competition for limited supply) could prevent, limit, delay or increase  costs in achieving our plans for operational decarbonisation. 	 – Changes or ambiguity in laws, regulations, policies, obligations, government  actions and our ability to anticipate and respond to such changes or  accurately interpret the ambiguity, including GHG emission targets and  schemes, restrictive licensing, carbon taxes, carbon offsetting regulations,  border adjustments or the addition or removal of subsidies, may give  rise to adverse regulatory, legal or market responses. For example, the  implementation of regulations intended to reduce GHG emissions in the  steel industry in China could adversely impact demand for our steelmaking  coal or iron ore. In addition, inadequate market supply of credible carbon  credits or price volatility in carbon markets could increase our operating  costs or result in adverse social value or compliance implications.  Inconsistent or developing regulatory regimes globally may increase  the likelihood of an inadvertent failure to or inability to comply with some  regulations and exacerbate the impacts of transition risks. Examples of potential opportunities 	 – Our copper, nickel, iron ore, steelmaking coal and uranium provide  essential building blocks for existing and new renewable energy  infrastructure and alternative power generation and electric vehicles, and  can play an important part in the transition to a low-carbon economy. 	 – Our potash fertiliser options, once operational, have the potential to  promote more efficient and profitable agriculture and help alleviate the  increased competition for arable land, including due to implementation  of nature-based solutions to help address climate change and global  population growth.  	 – Increased collaboration with customers, suppliers and original equipment  manufacturers, such as BHP’s partnerships with ArcelorMittal,  BlueScope, China Baowu, HBIS Group, JFE, POSCO and Tata Steel to  explore technologies to reduce GHG emissions across the steel value  chain, can provide opportunities for the development of new products  and markets.  Key management actions 	 – Establishing public positions on, and mandatory minimum performance  requirements for, managing climate change risks (threats and  opportunities), which are set out in our Climate Change Report 2020,  our Climate Transition Action Plan 2024 and the Environment Global  Standard and the Climate Change Global Standard. 	 – Using climate-related scenarios, as well as our planning cases and  other themes and signposts (such as monitoring policy, regulatory, legal,  technological, market and other societal developments) to evaluate the  resilience of our portfolio, allocate capital and inform our strategy. 	 – Considering transition risks (including carbon prices) when making  capital expenditure decisions or allocating capital through our Capital  Allocation Framework, supporting the prioritisation of capital and  investment approval processes. 	 – Seeking to mitigate our exposure to risks arising from policy and regulation  in our operating jurisdictions and markets by reducing our operational GHG  emissions and supporting GHG emission reductions in our value chain. 	 – Informing investors on progress to date and plans for achieving our  operational and value chain GHG emissions goals and targets, for  example, through investor briefings and publications, including our  Climate Transition Action Plan 2024.  	 – Advocating for the introduction of an effective, internationally aligned  long-term policy framework that can deliver a measured transition to a  low-carbon economy.  FY2024 insights Our exposure to transition risks increased during FY2024 due to  continued societal expectations for accelerated decarbonisation by  companies, significant regulatory developments across the globe  (such as the enhanced Safeguard Mechanism enacted into law  in Australia) and commitment by 130 countries at the 2023 United  Nations Climate Change Conference to triple global renewable energy  generation capacity by 2030. Many jurisdictions (including Australia)  have implemented, are in the process of designing, or are considering,  mandatory climate-related financial reporting regimes (including the  introduction of the Climate-related financial disclosures Bill into the  Australian Parliament) and – in some cases – broader sustainability  reporting requirements. This includes the EU’s Corporate Sustainability  Reporting Directive (CSRD), and a growing number of jurisdictions have  announced an intention to adopt the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure  Standards developed by the International Sustainability Standards Board  (ISSB). There are also increased efforts by some governments to fund  expansion of renewable energy generation and technologies that help  enable the energy transition, which may increase the scale and pace  of the low-carbon transition, and influence the availability of lower GHG  emissions technology options for BHP. These external developments  present both threats and opportunities for BHP as we continue to  increase our portfolio exposure to future-facing commodities.

Why is this important to BHP? We rely on the sale and delivery of the commodities we produce to  customers around the world. Changes to laws, international trade  arrangements, contractual terms or other requirements and/or geopolitical  developments could result in physical, logistical or other disruptions to our  operations in or the sale or delivery of our commodities to key markets.  These disruptions could affect sales volumes or prices obtained for  our products, adversely impacting our financial performance, results of  operations and growth prospects. Examples of potential threats 	 – Government actions, including economic sanctions, tariffs or other trade  restrictions, imposed by or on countries where we operate or into which  we sell or deliver our products may prevent BHP from selling or make it  more difficult for BHP to sell in key markets. 	 – Physical disruptions to the delivery of our products to customers in  key markets, including due to the disruption of shipping routes, closure  or blockage of ports or land logistics (road or rail), armed conflict or  criminality and organised crime. In some cases, physical disruptions  may be driven or intensified by weather and climate variability, including  as potentially exacerbated or affected by climate change. Our operations  are located in remote and environmentally sensitive areas, which may  be particularly exposed to climate-related disruptions. 	 – Legal or regulatory changes (such as new or increased royalties  or taxes; government-mandated price caps; port, export or import  restrictions or customs requirements; shipping/maritime regulatory  changes; restrictions on movements or imposition of quarantines;  or changing environmental restrictions or regulations, including  measures with respect to carbon-intensive industries or imports) and  commercial changes (such as changes to the standards, preferences  and requirements of customers) may adversely impact our ability to sell,  deliver or realise full market value for our products.  	 – Failure to maintain strong relationships with customers or changes to  customer demands for our products may reduce our market share or  adversely impact our financial performance.  	 – Increasing geopolitical tensions (including the Russia-Ukraine and  Middle Eastern conflicts) may adversely affect our strategic and  business planning decisions and/or increase the time it takes us to  manage our access to key markets, particularly if we fail to detect or  anticipate deviations in the geopolitical environment in a timely manner. Examples of potential opportunities 	 – Monitoring macroeconomic, societal, geopolitical and policy  developments and trends may reveal new markets or commodities,  identify opportunities to strengthen secondary markets for existing  products or identify a potential competitive advantage or price premium  for existing products.  	 – Developing strategic partnerships and strong, mutually beneficial  relationships with our customers may enable us to create value. 	 – Building a deep understanding of geopolitical threats and opportunities  and their potential impacts on global trade flows and our business could  enhance our strategy, business planning and response, providing a  potential future competitive advantage. 	 – Identifying the potential for weather and climate variability, including as  potentially exacerbated or affected by climate change, to disrupt delivery  of products and implementing management measures, may increase the  resilience of our operations and value chain.  	 – Monitoring signals and building relationships with and understanding  the perspectives of influential partners and stakeholders may improve  our ability to understand and provide input to policy development, and  to respond to and manage any impacts from policy changes (such as  trade policies). Key management actions 	 – Monitoring and assessing our ability to access key markets, and  maintaining sales plans, product placement and business resilience  strategies and relationships with relevant partners and stakeholders.  	 – Maintaining response plans for various scenarios (including physical  disruptions of logistics) to mitigate disruptions to our ability to access  key markets. 	 – Monitoring geopolitical and macroeconomic developments and trends,  including through signal monitoring and our enterprise-level watch  list of emerging themes, to provide an early indication of events that  could impact our ability to access or offer opportunities in relation to  key markets. 	 – Identifying weather and/or climate-related vulnerabilities and  implementing controls to mitigate disruptions to our ability to physically  access key markets.  	 – Diversifying our asset and commodity portfolio, such as our ongoing  investment in potash through the Jansen potash project, to reduce  exposure to market concentration risks. FY2024 insights Exposure to risks associated with access to key markets remained  broadly stable in FY2024. We continue to observe global armed  conflict, political tensions, ineffective law enforcement and  governance, resource and economic nationalism, social instability,  and environmental deterioration. Although we have limited influence  over changes in our external environment, we continue to focus  on management of these risks, including through diversifying our  portfolio to reduce exposure to market concentration risk. 79 Overview Additional Information Financial Statements Governance Contents Operating and Financial Review  ===== PAGE 82 ===== 8 How we manage risk continued Risk factor: Adopting technologies and maintaining digital security Risks associated with adopting and implementing new technologies, and maintaining the effectiveness of our existing digital landscape (including cyber  defences) across our value chain. Why is this important to BHP? Our business and operational processes are increasingly dependent on the  effective application and adoption of technology, which we use as a lever to  deliver on our current and future operational, financial and social objectives.  This exposes BHP to risks originating from adopting or implementing new  technologies, or failing to take appropriate action to position BHP for the  digital future, which may impact the capabilities we require, the effectiveness  and efficiency of our operations and our ability to compete effectively.  New technology adopted in our business may not perform as anticipated  and may result in unintended impacts on our operations. We may also fail  to maintain the effectiveness of our existing and future digital landscape,  including cyber defences, exposing us to technology availability, reliability  and cybersecurity risks. These could lead to operational events, commercial  disruption (such as an inability to process or ship our products), corruption  or loss of system data, misappropriation or loss of funds, unintended  loss or disclosure of commercial or personal information, enforcement  action or litigation, which could also impact the environment and partners,  suppliers and stakeholders across our value chain. Additionally, an inability  to adequately maintain existing technology or implement critical new  technology, or any sustained disruption to our existing technology may  adversely affect our licence to operate, reputation, results of operations and  financial performance.  Examples of potential threats 	 – Cybersecurity events or attacks on our information or operational  technology systems, including on third-party partners and providers (such  as our cloud service providers), may result in a failure of business-critical  technology systems at one or more of our assets, which may reduce  operational productivity, result in environmental damage, fines, penalties,  litigation, regulatory or governmental investigations, workforce disruption,  prolonged negative media attention and/or adversely impact safety and  financial performance. We have experienced cybersecurity threats in  the past and may experience them in the future and, as our dependence  on information systems, including those of our third-party partners and  providers, grows, we may become more vulnerable to an increasing threat  of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. 	 – Failure to invest in appropriate technologies or to keep pace with  advancements in technology that support the pursuit of our objectives  may adversely impact the effectiveness or efficiency of our business and  erode our competitive advantage. For example, a failure to implement  appropriate technologies that support our assets to produce higher-grade  commodities or less waste from existing resources (such as ongoing  initiatives to incorporate new technologies and data analytics to leaching  processes) could limit our ability to sell our commodities or reduce costs. 	 – Failure to identify, access and secure necessary infrastructure and key  inputs (including electricity, internet bandwidth, data, software, licences  or other rights in intellectual property, hardware and talent) to support  new technology innovations and advanced technologies may adversely  affect our ability to adopt, operate or retain access to those technologies.  This includes Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning, process  automation, robotics, data analytics, cloud computing, smart devices  and remote working solutions. For example, adopting new technology to  reduce GHG emissions using alternative energy sources may require new  infrastructure, while effective implementation of new digital technologies  (such as machine learning) may be heavily dependent on access to data.  In addition, the use of Al and machine learning may increase our exposure  to cybersecurity risks and additional risks relating to the protection of  data, including increased exposure of confidential or otherwise protected  information to unauthorised recipients, which could result in liability under  or termination of our contracts with third parties, misuse of our intellectual  property or other unintended consequences. 	 – Failure to adopt or successfully integrate new technology, technology  enhancements or technology acquired through inorganic growth (such  as through acquisition of a company with different types and standards  of securities, technologies and systems) may result in impacts to our  business and operations. This could lead to operational stoppage  events, commercial disruption (such as an inability to pay or accept  payment), inability to disclose accurately or an inability to adequately  maintain existing technology. 	 – Failure or outage of our information or operational technology systems. Examples of potential opportunities 	 – Applying digital solutions across our operations may unlock greater  productivity and safety performance. For example, using predictive  analytics to enable operations to identify asset condition and efficiencies  may improve safety, production and equipment availability, and reduce  maintenance and other costs. 	 – Technology solutions to reduce GHG emissions may support BHP, our  suppliers and customers in achieving climate action targets and goals.  For example, BHP signed an agreement in December 2023 with HBIS  Group trialling alternative steelmaking technology pathways including  direct reduced iron production designed to lower blast furnace carbon  emissions, with the aim of supporting the global energy transition.  	 – Developing AI in a safe and responsible manner in exploration, mine  planning, remote operation and advanced robotic technologies may  identify or provide access to previously unknown or inaccessible  deposits and development of end-to-end autonomous mining systems. 	 – Using digital simulations and predictive trend modelling may enable us  to optimise the deployment of new technologies, such as automation  and electrification, support early identification of process variances and  faults, and support the marketing of our products to customers. Key management actions 	 – Employing a number of measures designed to protect against, detect  and respond to cyber threats, events or attacks, including BHP’s  mandatory minimum performance requirements for technology and  cybersecurity, cybersecurity performance requirements for suppliers,  cybersecurity resilience programs, an enterprise security framework  and cybersecurity standards, cybersecurity risk and control guidance,  security awareness programs and training to build capability, security  assessments and continuous monitoring, restricted physical access to  hardware and crisis management plans. 	 – Managing localised or project-specific exposure to technology and cyber  risks at the asset, function or project level, including risks associated  with business-critical technology systems. Enterprise-level risks that are  specific to technology, such as those that pose a greater threat to our  wider business and strategic opportunities, are generally managed by  our global Technology team and other relevant stakeholders to support  delivery of our technology strategy. 	 – Maturing a Data Strategy to improve data quality and management of  critical data that enhances our adoption of digital technologies. 	 – Monitoring regulatory changes and collaborating with industry  stakeholders, research partners and policymakers to design company  guidelines (such as our AI Strategy and Framework, and Responsible  AI principles) and to develop, implement and maintain technological  solutions with appropriate guardrails and controls in place that  support compliance with an evolving regulatory environment and meet  societal expectations. FY2024 insights Our exposure increased in FY2024 due to elevated external  cybersecurity threat conditions with high-profile cyber incidents  experienced by other businesses across Australia and abroad.  We continue to monitor and manage the increasing exposure,  including through leveraging next generation technologies.  Our focus is on strengthening the management of cybersecurity risk  and controls across BHP, as well as monitoring third-party events  (including in relation to our third-party partners and providers) that  may impact our business. For more information refer to OFR 2 – What differentiates us OFR 6.9 – Climate change 80 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 83 ===== Risk factor: Ethical misconduct  Risks associated with actual or alleged deviation from societal or business expectations of ethical behaviour (including breaches of laws or regulations)  and wider or cumulative organisational cultural failings, resulting in significant reputational impacts. Why is this important to BHP? Actual or alleged conduct of BHP or our people or third-party partners and  providers that deviates from the standard of ethical behaviour required  or expected of us could result in reputational damage or a breach of law  or regulations. Such conduct includes fraud, corruption, anti-competitive  behaviour, money laundering, breaching trade or financial sanctions,  market manipulation, privacy breaches, ethical misconduct, failure to  comply with regulatory requirements and wider organisational cultural  failings. A failure to act ethically or legally may result in negative publicity,  investigations, public inquiries, regulatory enforcement action, litigation  or other civil or criminal proceedings, other forms of compensation or  remediation, or increased regulation. It could also threaten the validity of  our tenements or permits, or adversely impact our reputation, results of  operations, financial performance or share price. Impacts may be amplified  if our senior leaders fail to uphold BHP’s values or address actual or  alleged misconduct in a way that is consistent with societal, partner and  stakeholder expectations. Our workplace culture may also be eroded,  adversely affecting our ability to attract and retain talent. Risks and impacts  are also heightened by the complex and continuously evolving legal and  regulatory frameworks that apply to the jurisdictions where we operate and  potentially conflicting obligations under different national laws.  Examples of potential threats 	 – Failing to prevent breaches of international standards, laws, regulations  or other legal, regulatory, ethical, environmental, governance or  compliance obligations, such as external misstatements, inaccurate  financial or operational reporting or a breach of our continuous  disclosure obligations. 	 – Corruption (for example, in connection with the acquisition of early- stage options in a country with weaker governance standards), market  misconduct or anti-competitive behaviour, including in relation to our  joint venture operations. 	 – Failing to comply with trade or financial sanctions (which are complex  and subject to rapid change and may potentially result in conflicting  obligations), health, safety and environmental laws and regulations,  native title and other land rights or tax or royalty obligations. 	 – Failing to protect our people from harm (including to mental and physical  health) due to misconduct that takes place in connection with their work,  such as discrimination or sexual harassment. 	 – Failing to uphold BHP’s values or address actual or alleged misconduct  may adversely impact workplace culture and may expose BHP to  regulatory action or litigation, adversely impacting our reputation and  ability to attract and retain talent. Examples of potential opportunities 	 – Our capability to manage ethical misconduct risks may expand portfolio  growth options by providing greater assurance that we can operate  legally and ethically in high-risk jurisdictions. 	 – Managing ethical misconduct risks in line with societal, partner and  stakeholder expectations may distinguish BHP from competitors and  enhance our ability to raise capital, attract and retain talent, engage  with governments and communities in new jurisdictions, obtain permits,  partner with external organisations or suppliers, or market our products  to customers. 	 – Playing a leading role in the management of ethical misconduct risks,  such as sexual harassment risks, may help BHP to increase ethical and  behavioural standards across the resources industry. Key management actions 	 – Setting the ‘tone from the top’ through Our Charter, which is central  to our business and describes our purpose, values and how we  measure success. 	 – Implementing internal policies, standards, systems and processes for  governance and compliance to support an appropriate culture and  prioritise respectful behaviours at BHP, including: 	 – Our Code of Conduct (Our Code) and BHP’s mandatory minimum  performance requirements for business conduct, market disclosure  and other matters 	 – training on Our Code and in relation to anti-corruption, market  conduct, trade sanctions, data privacy and competition laws 	 – ring fencing protocols to separate potentially competing businesses  within BHP  	 – governance and compliance processes, including procurement and  other internal controls, and tailored monitoring of control effectiveness 	 – oversight and engagement with high-risk areas by our Ethics and  Investigations, Compliance and Internal Audit teams, and the Risk  and Audit Committee 	 – review and endorsement by our Compliance team of the highest- risk transactions, such as gifts and hospitality, engagement of  third parties, community donations and sponsorships above  defined thresholds 	 – automated counterparty and transaction screening against lists of  entities subject to trade sanctions 	 – our reporting channels for raising misconduct concerns (comprising  an online portal and confidential 24-hour multilingual call service),  supported by an ethics and investigations framework and central  investigations team 	 – campaigns and sessions held globally by our leaders to set  expectations around racism, sexual harassment and other  disrespectful behaviours, including our ‘Active Bystander’ training that  is designed to empower everyone across BHP to call out disrespectful  and harmful behaviours  	 – Continuing to enforce Our Code via appropriate investigations and  responses, including disciplinary action, in addition to deployment  of appropriate controls to prevent harm (including to mental and  physical health). 	 – Requiring anti-corruption and human rights risks to be considered as  part of our new country entry approval process. FY2024 insights Our exposure to ethical misconduct risks increased in FY2024 due to  heightened trade sanctions risks, including an increase in the volume  and complexity of trade sanctions measures globally. Our Compliance  team continues to focus on control enhancements to manage evolving  threats (such as trade sanctions) and strengthen key anti-corruption  and other compliance controls across the Group, including in relation  to the integration of OZ Minerals. With BHP’s continued focus on  portfolio growth, there is a potential for further increases in exposure  to anti-corruption and other ethical misconduct risks in higher- risk jurisdictions.

Why is this important to BHP? In addition to the threats described in our other risk factors, our business  could experience unanticipated, unforeseeable or other adverse events  (internal or external) that could harm our people, disrupt our operations  or value chain or damage our assets or corporate offices, including  our non-operated assets in which BHP has a non-controlling interest.  A failure to identify or understand exposure, adequately prepare for these  events (including maintaining business continuity plans) or build wider  organisational resilience may inhibit our (or our third-party partners and  providers’) ability to respond and recover in an effective and efficient  manner. This includes a failure to build resilience to physical climate- related risks. Material adverse impacts on our business include reduced  ability to access resources, markets and the operational or other inputs  required by our business, reduced production or sales of or demand for,  our commodities, or increased regulation, which could adversely impact  our financial performance, share price or reputation and could lead to  litigation (including class actions). Examples of potential threats 	 – Geopolitical, global economic, regional or local developments or  adverse events, such as social unrest, strikes, work stoppages,  labour disruptions, social activism, terrorism, bomb threats, economic  slowdown, acts of war or other significant disruptions in areas where we  operate or have interests.  	 – Extreme weather and climate-related events, such as heatwaves,  extreme precipitation and flooding, hurricanes, cyclones and fires.  For example, production at our steelmaking coal asset, BMA, was partly  impacted in H1 FY2024 due to depleted inventory positions that arose  from extended weather impacts on the east coast of Australia.  	 – Other natural events, including earthquakes, tsunamis, wildfires, solar  flares and pandemics.  	 – Potential physical climate-related impacts, such as acute risks that  are event driven (including increased frequency and severity of  extreme weather events) and chronic risks resulting from longer-term  changes in climate patterns. Climate hazards may include changes  in precipitation patterns, water shortages, rising sea levels, increased  storm intensity, prolonged extreme temperatures and increased drought,  fire and flooding. 	 – Failure by suppliers, contractors or joint venture partners to perform  existing contracts or obligations (including due to insolvency), such as  construction of large projects or supply of key inputs to our business   (for example, consumables for our mining equipment).  	 – Failure of our risk management or other processes (including controls)  to prepare for or manage any of the risks discussed in this Risk factors  section may inhibit our (or our third-party partners and providers’)  ability to manage any resulting adverse events and may disrupt our  operations or adversely impact our financial performance or reputation.  This includes unknown pre-existing failures in organisations, businesses  or assets that we acquire through non-organic growth, as well as any  failures that occur during their integration to our business (for example,  due to different standards or systems). Examples of potential opportunities 	 – Risk identification and management supports proactive, focused and  prioritised deployment of resources to reduce exposure to adverse  events. It may be used to inform priorities and strategies across BHP,  supporting a proportionate and cost-effective response, which could  provide a competitive advantage at a regional or global level. 	 – Building wider organisational resilience may enable us to maintain  dividends to shareholders amid adverse external events and make  growth-generating, counter-cyclical investments, as well as to help us  mitigate the impacts of unforeseeable adverse events.  	 – Adaptation to climate change across our operations and in our value  chain could enhance the safety, productivity and climate resilience  of our operated assets, position BHP as a supplier of choice and  enhance our ability to consistently grow value. Support for climate- vulnerable communities and ecosystems may also improve our social  value proposition. Key management actions 	 – Implementing Group-wide controls to enhance business resilience,  including BHP’s mandatory minimum performance requirements for  security, crisis and emergency management and business continuity  plans, and seeking to maintain an investment grade credit rating. 	 – Monitoring our current state of readiness (preparedness, redundancy  and resilience), including through scenario analysis and business  resilience exercises, supporting organisational capability in our  operations, functions and senior management to effectively and  efficiently respond to and recover from adverse events should  they materialise. 	 – Monitoring the external environment, including political and economic  factors, through signal monitoring, our geopolitical monitoring and  public policy frameworks and our enterprise-level watch list of emerging  themes, to support early identification of policy changes or adverse  events for which we may need to increase preparedness. 	 – Identifying security threats that could directly or indirectly impact our  operations and people in countries of interest to BHP. 	 – Further developing and implementing our adaptation strategy with  respect to physical climate-related risks, including requiring operated  assets and functions to identify and progressively assess physical  climate-related risks (including to our value chain) and seeking to build  climate change adaptation into their plans, activities and investments.  	 – Maintaining quality, centralised climate data covering each of our  operating locations so that our people have access to appropriate  data to support climate studies that can be used to inform investment  decisions around enhancing our operational resilience. FY2024 insights Our exposure to risks associated with inadequate business resilience  increased in FY2024. The United Nations Framework Convention  on Climate Change Secretariat’s NDC Synthesis Report (released  in November 2023) noted national climate action plans remain  insufficient to limit global temperature rises to 1.5°C and, according  to the World Meteorological Organisation, CY2023 was the warmest  year on record with further natural disasters and prolonged weather  events experienced across the globe. Additionally, a global rise in  conflict, instability and criminality in CY2023 created new security  challenges. Our Security team continues to monitor the evolving  external security environment to better understand how it can impact  BHP and our industry and how we can manage associated exposure.

FY2023 comparative is not disclosed as Copper South Australia includes Olympic Dam  as well as Prominent Hill and Carrapateena which were acquired on 2 May 2023 as part  of the acquisition of OZL which only contributed to the performance of the business from  the date of acquisition. Key drivers of Copper’s financial results Price overview  Copper prices rose in H2 FY2024, with the LME official cash settlement  price hitting a new record high in May on bullish investor sentiment, fuelled  by expectations of lower interest rates in the United States, possible copper  smelter cuts in China and the LME banning the delivery of Russian metal.  However, copper prices then moderated by the end of FY2024 reflecting  underlying near-term fundamentals with weak Chinese demand and  rising stocks. In the near term, slowing demand growth in China due to  continued weakness in the real estate sector is expected to be partially  offset by more positive trends in power grid spending and consumer durable  goods. We anticipate Europe will be slower to recover from weakness in  manufacturing, while the United States will continue to improve more swiftly  due to a more resilient underlying economy. We now expect CY2024 to be in  marginal surplus, a reflection of softer demand expectations for China and  higher supply. In the medium to longer term, traditional demand (such as  home building, electrical equipment and household appliances) is expected  to remain solid and demand from emerging sectors, such as artificial  intelligence and data centres, should add to this. The decarbonisation  megatrend is also expected to bolster demand. We anticipate that the cost  curve required to meet that demand is likely to steepen as challenges to  the development of new resources progressively increase. This implies that  should deficits occur in this phase, as we expected they will, fly-up pricing  may well occur and in turn this could spur inducement of new, higher cost  supply in the long term.  Production  Total Copper production for FY2024 increased by 9 per cent to 1,865 kt. Escondida copper production increased by 7 per cent to 1,125 kt primarily  due to higher concentrator feed grade of 0.88 per cent, compared to 0.82  per cent in FY2023. The positive impact of the higher grade was partially  offset by planned lower cathode production as a result of prioritising  concentrator throughput in prior years.  Pampa Norte copper production decreased by 8 per cent to 266 kt including  a record 255 kt at Spence and 11 kt at Cerro Colorado. Spence production  increased 6 per cent driven by improved concentrator throughput and  increases in both concentrator feed grade and recoveries, partially offset by  lower cathode production in line with expected decline in stacked feed grade.  Cerro Colorado entered temporary care and maintenance in December 2023.  Copper South Australia copper production increased by 39 per cent to  322 kt from the successful integration of OZ Minerals (OZL) following the  acquisition in FY2023. The processing of Prominent Hill and Carrapateena  concentrate at Olympic Dam resulted in annual records for cathode and  gold production at Olympic Dam. The successful commissioning and ramp  up of Crusher 2 led to record material mined and concentrate produced  at Carrapateena. Antamina copper production increased by 4 per cent to 144 kt, as a result  of record concentrator throughput offsetting planned lower feed grades.  Zinc production was 17 per cent lower at 103 kt, as a result of planned  lower feed grades. Carajás produced 8.4 kt of copper and 5.8 troy koz of gold. Financial results  Copper revenue increased by US$2.5 billion to US$18.6 billion in FY2024  due to higher average realised copper prices and increased sales volumes  following the successful integration of OZL following the acquisition  in FY2023. Underlying EBITDA for Copper increased by US$1.9 billion to  US$8.6 billion. Price impacts, net of price-linked costs, increased  Underlying EBITDA by US$1.4 billion. Higher sales volumes increased  Underlying EBITDA by US$0.6 billion driven by the successful integration  of OZL, higher feed grade at Escondida and record concentrate production  at Spence offset by planned lower cathode volumes at Spence.  Controllable cash costs increased by US$0.2 billion, primarily due to higher  maintenance at Escondida and higher exploration spend at Copper South  Australia (Copper SA) for drilling activities at Oak Dam.  Favourable foreign exchange rate movements increased EBITDA by  US$0.3 billion.  Inflation negatively impacted Underlying EBITDA by US$0.3 billion but  was offset by lower fuel, energy and consumable price movements of  US$0.3 billion. An increase in Non-cash costs of US$0.3 billion related  to lower stripping capitalisation at Escondida and Spence, reflecting the  phase of the respective mine plans. Outlook Total Copper production of between 1,845 and 2,045 kt is expected  in FY2025.  Escondida production of between 1,180 and 1,300 kt is expected in  FY2025, reflecting both an expected increase in concentrator feed grade  and throughput compared to FY2024.  Spence production of between 240 and 270 kt is expected in FY2025.  Copper South Australia production of between 310 and 340 kt is expected  in FY2025. Antamina copper production of between 115 to 135 kt due to mine  sequencing resulting in lower throughput, and zinc production of between  90 and 110 kt is expected in FY2025.  Escondida unit costs in FY2025 are expected to be between US$1.30 and  US$1.60 per pound (at an exchange rate of USD/CLP 842). Spence unit costs in FY2025 are expected to be between US$2.00 and  US$2.30 per pound (at an exchange rate of USD/CLP 842). Copper South Australia unit costs in FY2025 are expected to be between  US$1.30 and US$1.80 per pound (at an exchange rate of AUD/USD 0.66). 83 Overview Additional Information Financial Statements Governance Contents Operating and Financial Review  ===== PAGE 86 ===== 9 Performance by commodity continued 9.2 Iron Ore Detailed below is financial and operating information for our Iron Ore  assets comparing FY2024 to FY2023. Year ended 30 June  US$M 2024 2023 Revenue 27,952 24,812 Underlying EBITDA 18,913 16,692 Net operating assets 13,812 16,956 Capital expenditure 2,033 1,966 Underlying ROCE 83% 67% Total iron ore production (Mt)  260 257 Average realised prices Iron ore (US$/wmt, FOB)  101.04 92.54 Unit Costs 	 WAIO (US$/t) 18.19 17.79 Key drivers of Iron Ore’s financial results Price overview  Iron ore consumption in China was strong in CY2023. In contrast, steel  output continued to contract in developed regions albeit at a slower rate than  previous years. Over the next two years we expect a small improvement in  global steel production with growth led by India and Southeast Asia, with  some additional growth from a recovery in developed regions. After a strong  CY2023, we expect Chinese blast furnace run rates to ease in CY2024,  under pressure from subdued steel margins and the potential for policy- driven production controls. During H2 FY2024, iron ore prices first declined  and then traded in the range of around US$100 to US$120/t. A widening  surplus has emerged with Chinese port inventories rising to elevated levels.  For the balance of CY2024 and into CY2025, we expect supply from low-cost  major iron ore producers to grow while iron ore consumption is experiencing  a modest decline. Our estimate of real-time cost support continues to sit in  the US$80 – US$100/t range on a 62% Fe CFR basis. Should surpluses  persist as we forecast, we would expect some high-cost suppliers may be  driven out of the market over time. How quickly and effectively the Chinese  policies targeted at the property sector stabilise it, and the government’s  approach to regulating steel production, will both be large swing factors for  the remainder of CY2024 and into CY2025. In the medium term, China’s  demand for iron ore is expected to be lower than it is today as it moves  beyond the crude steel production plateau and as the ratio of scrap-based  steelmaking rises. We maintain our view that China’s steel production has  plateaued above 1.0 and this is likely to continue across the mid-2020s.  However, Chinese pig iron production is expected to decline during this  period with more recycled scrap used in steelmaking. We expect demand for  our products in other developing regions in Asia to offset this to a degree.    Production  Total Iron Ore production increased by 1 per cent to a record 260 Mt. WAIO achieved record production of 255 Mt (287 Mt on a 100 per cent  basis), reflecting strong supply chain performance with increased capacity  unlocked by the Port Debottlenecking Project 1 (PDP1) and record  production at South Flank. These more than offset the impacts of the  continued tie-in activity for the Rail Technology Programme 1 (RTP1).  South Flank completed ramp up to full production capacity of 80 Mtpa (100  per cent basis) in FY2024 and following commissioning in December 2023,  ramp up of PDP1 remains on track to be completed in CY2024. Samarco production increased by 5 per cent to 4.7 Mt (BHP share), as a  result of higher concentrator throughput. Financial results Total Iron Ore revenue increased by US$3.1 billion to US$28.0 billion  in FY2024, reflecting higher average realised prices and higher sales  volumes as a result of record production from strong supply chain  performance with increased capacity unlocked by PDP1 and record  production at South Flank.  Underlying EBITDA for Iron Ore increased by US$2.2 billion to  US$18.9 billion primarily due to higher average realised prices, net of  price-linked costs, of US$2.0 billion. Higher sales volumes increased  Underlying EBITDA by US$0.6 billion driven by record production partially  offset by US$0.2 billion of higher controllable cash costs as we ramped  up South Flank and increased production. Other items, such as inflation  and unfavourable foreign exchange rate impacts, were partially offset by  lower fuel, energy and consumable price movements collectively reduced  Underlying EBITDA by US$0.2 billion.  Outlook WAIO production is expected to be between 250 and 260 Mt (282 and  294 Mt on a 100 per cent basis) in FY2025 as the Group ramps up the  planned tie‑in activities for RTP1. WAIO unit costs in FY2025 are expected to be between US$18.00 and  US$19.50 per tonne (based on an exchange rate of AUD/USD 0.66).  Samarco production is expected to be between 5 and 5.5 Mt (BHP share)  in FY2025 with the second concentrator expected to come online during  Q3 FY2025. 9.3 Coal Detailed below is financial and operating information for our Coal assets  comparing FY2024 to FY2023. Year ended 30 June  US$M 2024 2023 Revenue 7,666 10,958 Underlying EBITDA 2,290 4,998 Net operating assets 6,472 7,266 Capital expenditure 646 657 Underlying ROCE 19% 47% Total steelmaking coal production (Mt) 22 29 Total energy coal production (Mt) 15 14 Average realised prices Steelmaking coal (US$/t) 266.06 271.05 Hard coking coal (HCC) (US$/t) 273.03 273.59 Weak coking coal (WCC) (US$/t) 205.54 251.13 Thermal coal (US$/t) 121.52 236.51 Unit Costs BMA (US$/t) 119.54 96.46 Key drivers of Coal’s financial results Price overview Across FY2024 steelmaking coal prices were relatively stable with an overall  slight decline in prices. The demand picture was mixed with strong Indian  steel production growth and recovery in the EU from the lows of CY2023,  offsetting output contractions in both Northeast Asia and North America.  Against this backdrop, Australian supply recovered slower than expectations,  while Mongolian exports continued to surge. Notwithstanding recent supply  side challenges, we still expect a modest recovery of seaborne supply in  the near term. Meanwhile, availability of land borne imports into China and  operational recovery of Chinese domestic mines are key uncertainties.  On seaborne demand, India is expected to maintain its current strong  momentum while OECD importing regions are likely to experience a gradual  pickup in their steel industries. While seaborne supply in the steelmaking  coal market is expected see a marginal surplus in CY2025, the supply of  higher-quality coals is likely to stay relatively tight. Over the longer term, we  expect that higher-quality steelmaking coals, such as those produced by  our BMA assets, will be valued for their role in reducing the GHG emissions  intensity of blast furnaces and, combined with the growth of the steel  industry in hard coking coal importing countries such as India, will have  growing and resilient demand for decades to come. With the major seaborne  supply region of Queensland being currently less conducive to long-life  capital investment as a result of changes to the royalty regime, the scarcity  value of higher-quality steelmaking coals may well also increase over time.    84 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 87 ===== Production Steelmaking coal BMA production decreased by 23 per cent to 22.3 Mt (44.6 Mt on a 100  per cent basis) as a result of increased stripping to improve supply chain  stability and restore depleted inventory positions, which arose from  extended weather impacts and labour constraints over recent years, and  the divestment of Blackwater and Daunia on 2 April 2024. Production was  also impacted by an extended longwall move and geotechnical faulting  at Broadmeadow during H1 FY2024, and the temporary suspension of  operations following the fatality of a team member at Saraji. Blackwater and  Daunia produced 5 Mt (10 Mt on a 100 per cent basis) in FY2024 prior to  their divestment. Energy coal NSWEC production increased by 8 per cent to 15.4 Mt due to strong  operating performance as improved weather and labour availability  enabled an uplift in truck productivity.  Financial results Coal revenue decreased by US$3.3 billion to US$7.7 billion in  FY2024 mainly due to lower average realised prices, lower volumes at  BMA as a result of increased stripping to improve supply chain stability  and the divestment of Blackwater and Daunia, partially offset by higher  volumes at NSWEC due to strong operating performance. Underlying EBITDA for Coal decreased by US$2.7 billion to US$2.3 billion.  Price impacts, net of price-linked costs, decreased Underlying EBITDA by  US$1.5 billion.   Lower sales volumes of US$1.0 billion were due to lower production at  BMA, including the divestment of Blackwater and Daunia, partially offset  by higher production at NSWEC. Inflation negatively impacted Underlying  EBITDA by US$0.1 billion and controllable cash costs increased by  US$0.1 billion from higher stripping and contractor costs to support higher  production at NSWEC.  Outlook  BMA coal production for FY2025 is expected to be between 16.5 and  19 Mt (33 and 38 Mt on a 100 per cent basis), reflecting the divestment of  Blackwater and Daunia and impact of elevated strip ratios as we continue to  improve supply chain stability and re-establish raw coal inventory positions. BMA unit costs in FY2025 are expected to be between US$112 and  US$124 per tonne (based on an exchange rate of AUD/USD 0.66). NSWEC coal production for FY2025 is expected to be between 13 and 15 Mt. 9.4 Other assets Detailed below is an analysis of Other assets’ financial and operating  performance comparing FY2024 to FY2023.  Western Australia Nickel Key drivers of Western Australia Nickel’s  financial results Price overview  The nickel industry moved into significant surplus during CY2023.  Indonesia produced almost 20 per cent of global primary nickel in CY2019,  and that share increased to over 50 per cent by CY2023. This came at a time  of weak traditional stainless steel demand in the OECD, and global battery  value chain destocking. The nickel market weakness has continued into  CY2024 albeit with a brief price rebound in May on supply curtailments and  disruptions in Australia and New Caledonia. On the demand side, electric  vehicle sales remained solid in China, but penetration rates in the OECD  have slowed in parallel with weaker traditional stainless steel demand for  nickel, which caused global visible nickel stocks to rise. These trends are  expected to continue into CY2025 suggesting that the market will remain  in surplus over that period. While voluntary curtailments continue to occur  across the industry, including by BHP, these are still not near the scale that  would be expected to balance the market near term. We estimate that we  are still in a multi-year run of surpluses. Longer term, we see the market  rebalancing in the late 2020s as we continue to believe nickel will be a core  beneficiary of the electrification megatrend. Production  Nickel West production increased by 2 per cent to 81.6 kt, as we produced  a higher proportion of the lower value matte products as a result of  increased maintenance at Kwinana Refinery and severe weather events. Financial results Western Australia Nickel Revenue decreased by US$0.5 billion to  US$1.5 billion in FY2024, reflecting lower average realised prices. Underlying EBITDA for Western Australia Nickel decreased by  US$0.5 billion to a loss of US$0.3 billion. Price impacts, net of price-linked  costs, decreased Underlying EBITDA by US$0.4 billion. Controllable cash  costs increased by US$0.1 billion due to increased third-party ore  purchases following delivery issues in FY2023. Outlook On 11 July 2024, we announced the temporary suspension of operations at  Western Australia Nickel and that operations will be suspended by October  2024 and handover activities for temporary suspension will be completed  by December 2024. BHP intends to review the decision to temporarily  suspend Western Australia Nickel by February 2027.  Potash Potash recorded an Underlying EBITDA loss of US$255 million in FY2024,  compared to a loss of US$205 million in FY2023. Jansen Stage 1 is 52 per cent complete and remains on track for first  production in late CY2026 with a two-year expected ramp up period.  The engineering work and execution of procurement agreements is largely  complete. In FY2024, a longer than usual summer season enabled early  completion of the mill’s foundation. In FY2025, underground and surface  construction works will continue, including structural, mechanical and  electrical activities for the mill areas. The Group also expects to complete  the conversion of the service shaft headframe to a permanent structure.    Jansen Stage 2 execution activity has now commenced and is 2 per  cent complete, with first production expected in FY2029, followed by an  expected three-year ramp-up period. In FY2025, the focus will be on  detailed engineering, procurement for major equipment and construction  packages, and structural steel fabrication.   Price overview  Potash demand has been strong in CY2024, after a sharp rebound in  CY2023, with global potash shipments this year estimated to return to its  previous CY2020 peak level of 72 Mtpa, driven by good affordability and  inventory build-up. In the medium-term existing capacity in the FSU is  expected to trend back to normal operating rates, while new supply could  also come from the region, including some expansion projects potentially  resuming construction. Longer term, we believe that potash stands to  benefit from the intersection of global megatrends: rising population,  changing diets and the need for the more sustainable intensification of  agriculture on the globe’s finite arable land. We consider this compelling  demand picture, rising geopolitical uncertainty and the maturity of the  existing production asset base to provide an attractive entry opportunity in  a lower-risk supply jurisdiction such as Saskatchewan, Canada. 9.5 Impact of changes to commodity prices The prices we obtain for our products are a key driver of value for BHP.

Purchases of property, plant and equipment and  exploration and evaluation expenditure including the  contribution of Discontinued operations. Capital and exploration  expenditure   – Continuing operations Purchases of property, plant and equipment and  exploration and evaluation expenditure. Free cash flow It is a key measure used as part of our Capital Allocation Framework.  Reflects our operational cash performance inclusive of investment  expenditure, which helps to highlight how much cash was generated  in the period to be available for the servicing of debt and distribution to  shareholders.  Reflects our operational cash performance inclusive of investment  expenditure, but excluding the contribution of Discontinued operations. Net operating cash flows less net investing cash flows. Free cash flow   – Continuing operations Net operating cash flows from Continuing operations less  net investing cash flows from Continuing operations. Net debt Net debt shows the position of gross debt less index-linked freight  contracts offset by cash immediately available to pay debt if required  and any associated derivative financial instruments. Liability associated  with index-linked freight contracts, which are required to be remeasured  to the prevailing freight index at each reporting date, are excluded from  the net debt calculation due to the short-term volatility of the index they  relate to not aligning with how the Group uses net debt for decision  making in relation to the Capital Allocation Framework. Net debt  includes the fair value of derivative financial instruments used to hedge  cash and borrowings to reflect the Group’s risk management strategy  of reducing the volatility of net debt caused by fluctuations in foreign  exchange and interest rates. Net debt, along with the gearing ratio, is used to monitor the Group’s  capital management by relating net debt relative to equity from  shareholders. Interest bearing liabilities less liability associated with  index-linked freight contracts less cash and cash  equivalents less net cross currency and interest rate  swaps less net cash management related instruments for  the Group at the reporting date. Gearing ratio Ratio of Net debt to Net debt plus Net assets. Net operating assets Enables a clearer view of the assets deployed to generate earnings by  highlighting the net operating assets of the business separate from the  financing and tax balances. This measure helps provide an indicator of  the underlying performance of our assets and enhances comparability  between them. Operating assets net of operating liabilities, including  the carrying value of equity accounted investments  and predominantly excludes cash balances, loans to  associates, interest bearing liabilities, derivatives hedging  our net debt, assets held for sale, liabilities directly  associated with assets held for sale and tax balances. 95 Overview Additional Information Financial Statements Governance Contents Operating and Financial Review  ===== PAGE 98 ===== Non-IFRS financial  information Reasons why we believe the non-IFRS   financial information are useful Calculation methodology Underlying return on capital  employed (ROCE) Indicator of the Group’s capital efficiency and is provided on an  underlying basis to allow comparability of underlying financial  performance by excluding the impacts of exceptional items. Profit after taxation excluding exceptional items and net  finance costs (after taxation) divided by average capital  employed.  Profit after taxation excluding exceptional items and  net finance costs (after taxation) is profit after taxation  from Continuing and Discontinued operations excluding  exceptional items, net finance costs and the estimated  taxation impact of net finance costs. These are annualised  for a half year end reporting period.  The estimated tax impact is calculated using a prima facie  taxation rate on net finance costs (excluding any foreign  exchange impact).  Average capital employed is calculated as the average of  net assets less net debt for the last two reporting periods. Adjusted effective tax rate Provides an underlying tax basis to allow comparability of underlying  financial performance by excluding the impacts of exceptional items. Total taxation expense/(benefit) excluding exceptional  items and exchange rate movements included in taxation  expense/(benefit) divided by Profit from Continuing  operations before taxation excluding exceptional items. Unit costs Used to assess the controllable financial performance of the Group’s  assets for each unit of production. Unit costs are adjusted for site  specific non-controllable factors to enhance comparability between the  Group’s assets.  Ratio of net costs of the assets to the equity share of sales  tonnage. Net costs is defined as revenue less Underlying  EBITDA and excludes freight, re-allocation of the costs  associated with the employee entitlements and allowance  review in FY2023, and other costs, depending on the  nature of each asset. Freight is excluded as the Group  believes it provides a similar basis of comparison to our  peer group. The re-allocation to assets in FY2024 of the  costs associated with the employee entitlements and  allowances review in FY2023 are excluded in asset unit  costs as these costs were already recognised in Group  and Unallocated in FY2023. Escondida, Spence and Copper South Australia unit costs  exclude:  	 – by-product credits being the favourable impact of  by-products (such as gold or silver) to determine the  directly attributable costs of copper production 	 – royalties, as these are costs that are not deemed to be  under the Group’s control and the Group believes exclusion  provides a similar basis of comparison to our peer group WAIO and BMA unit costs exclude: 	 – royalties, as these are costs that are not deemed to be  under the Group’s control and the Group believes exclusion  provides a similar basis of comparison to our peer group 10.2 Definition and calculation of principal factors The method of calculation of the principal factors that affect the period on period movements of Revenue, Profit from operations and Underlying EBITDA  are as follows: Principal factor  Method of calculation Change in sales prices Change in average realised price for each operation from the prior period to the current period, multiplied by current period  sales volumes. Price-linked costs Change in price-linked costs (mainly royalties) for each operation from the prior period to the current period, multiplied by  current period sales volumes. Change in volumes Change in sales volumes for each operation multiplied by the prior year average realised price less variable unit cost.  Controllable cash costs Total of operating cash costs and exploration and business development costs.  Operating cash costs Change in total costs, other than price-linked costs, exchange rates, inflation on costs, fuel, energy and consumable  price movements, non-cash costs and one-off items as defined below for each operation from the prior period to the  current period. Exploration and evaluation and  business development Exploration and evaluation and business development expense in the current period minus exploration and business  development expense in the prior period. Exchange rates Change in exchange rate multiplied by current period local currency revenue and expenses. Inflation on costs Change in inflation rate applied to expenses, other than depreciation and amortisation, price-linked costs, exploration and  business development expenses, expenses in ceased and sold operations and expenses in new and acquired operations. Fuel, energy and consumable  price movements Fuel and energy expense and price differences above inflation on consumables in the current period minus fuel and energy  expense in the prior period. Non-cash Change in net impact of capitalisation and depletion of deferred stripping from the prior period to the current period. One-off items Change in costs exceeding a pre-determined threshold associated with an unexpected event that had not occurred in the  last two years and is not reasonably likely to occur within the next two years. Asset sales Profit/(loss) on the sale of assets or operations in the current period minus profit/(loss) on sale of assets or operations in the  prior period. Ceased and sold operations Underlying EBITDA for operations that ceased or were sold in the current period minus Underlying EBITDA for operations  that ceased or were sold in the prior period. New and acquired operations Underlying EBITDA for operations that were acquired in the current period minus Underlying EBITDA for operations that  were acquired in the prior period. Share of profit/(loss) from equity  accounted investments Share of profit/(loss) from equity accounted investments for the current period minus share of profit/(loss) from equity  accounted investments in the prior period. Other Variances not explained by the above factors. 10 Non-IFRS financial information continued 96 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 99 ===== 11.1 Company details BHP Group Limited’s registered office and global headquarters are at   171 Collins Street, Melbourne, Victoria 3000, Australia. ‘BHP’, the  ‘Company’, the ‘Group’, ‘BHP Group’, ‘our business’, ‘organisation’, ‘we’,  ‘us’, ‘our’ and ‘ourselves’ refer to BHP Group Limited, and except where the  context otherwise requires, our subsidiaries.

Forward-looking statements are based on management’s expectations  and reflect judgements, assumptions, estimates and other information  available, as at the date of this Report. These statements do not represent  guarantees or predictions of future financial or operational performance  and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors,  many of which are beyond our control and which may cause actual results  to differ materially from those expressed in the statements contained in this  Report. BHP cautions against reliance on any forward-looking statements. For example, our future revenues from our assets, projects or mines  described in this Report will be based, in part, on the market price of the  commodities produced, which may vary significantly from current levels or  those reflected in our reserves and resources estimates. These variations,  if materially adverse, may affect the timing or the feasibility of the  development of a particular project, the expansion of certain facilities   or mines, or the continuation of existing assets. Other factors that may affect our future operations and performance,  including the actual construction or production commencement dates,  revenues, costs or production output and anticipated lives of assets,  mines or facilities include: (i) our ability to profitably produce and deliver  the products extracted to applicable markets; (ii) the impact of economic  and geopolitical factors, including foreign currency exchange rates on  the market prices of the commodities we produce and competition in the  markets in which we operate; (iii) activities of government authorities in the  countries where we sell our products and in the countries where we are  exploring or developing projects, facilities or mines, including increases in  taxes and royalties or implementation of trade or export restrictions;   (iv) changes in environmental and other regulations; (v) political or  geopolitical uncertainty; (vi) labour unrest; (vii) weather, climate variability  or other manifestations of climate change; and (viii) other factors identified  in the risk factors set out in OFR 8.1.  In addition, there are limitations with respect to scenario analysis, including  any climate-related scenario analysis, and it is difficult to predict which,  if any, of the scenarios might eventuate. Scenario analysis is not an  indication of probable outcomes and relies on assumptions that may or  may not prove to be correct or eventuate. Except as required by applicable regulations or by law, BHP does not  undertake to publicly update or review any forward-looking statements,  whether as a result of new information or future events. Past performance cannot be relied on as a guide to future performance. Emissions and energy consumption data  Due to the inherent uncertainty and limitations in measuring GHG  emissions and operational energy consumption under the calculation  methodologies used in the preparation of such data, all GHG emissions  and operational energy consumption data or references to GHG emissions  and operational energy consumption volumes (including ratios or  percentages) in this Report are estimates. There may also be differences  in the manner that third parties calculate or report GHG emissions or  operational energy consumption data compared to BHP, which means  third-party data may not be comparable to our data.  For information on how we calculate our GHG emissions and  operational energy consumption, refer to the BHP GHG Emissions  Calculation Methodology 2024 available at bhp.com/climate This Report is made in accordance with a resolution of the Board.

Corporate Governance Statement continued 102 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 105 ===== 4.2 Director independence  The Board is committed to ensuring that a majority of Directors  are independent.  The Board has adopted a policy that it uses to determine the independence  of its Directors.  The Policy on the Independence of Directors is available at   bhp.com/governance Determination of Director independence  The Board confirms that it considers all current Non‑executive Directors,  including the Chair, to be independent of management and free of any  interest, position or relationship that might influence, or reasonably be  perceived to influence, in a material respect their capacity to bring an  independent judgement to bear on issues before the Board and to act  in the best interests of BHP as a whole rather than in the interests of an  individual security holder or other party.  A determination of independence is carried out upon a Director’s  appointment and re-election, annually, and when any new interests,  positions or relationships are disclosed by a Director. Some Directors hold  or have previously held positions in companies that BHP has commercial  relationships with.  The Board has assessed the relationships between BHP and the  companies in which Directors hold or held positions and has concluded  that the relationships do not interfere with the Directors’ capacity to bring  an independent judgement to bear on issues before the Board, or their  ability to act in the best interests of BHP as a whole. Conflicts of interest In accordance with Australian law, if a situation arises for consideration  where a Director has a material personal interest, the affected Director  takes no part in decision-making unless approval is provided by the  non‑interested Directors. Provisions for Directors’ interests are set out in  the Constitution of BHP Group Limited. 4.3 Board appointments and succession planning BHP adopts a structured and rigorous approach to Board succession  planning to guard against the consequences of unforeseen departures and  facilitate the orderly replacement of current Directors and oversees the  development of a diverse pipeline. This process is continuous, with the aim  of allowing the Board to determine an appropriate balance on the Board  between experience and fresh perspectives, and the Board continues to be  fit for purpose.  As part of this process, Ross McEwan was appointed to the Board in April  2024 and Don Lindsay was appointed to the Board in May 2024 following  the retirements of independent Non-executive Directors, Terry Bowen in  November 2023 and Ian Cockerill in April 2024. Before the Board formally appoints a person or puts a person forward  for election, the Board, with the assistance of external consultants, will  conduct appropriate background and reference checks as to that person’s  character, experience, education and criminal and bankruptcy history.  The Board has adopted a letter of appointment that contains the terms  on which Non‑executive Directors will be appointed, including the  basis upon which they will be indemnified by the Group. The letter of  appointment defines the role of Directors, including the expectations  in terms of independence, participation, time commitment and  continuous improvement. Written agreements are in place for all  Non‑executive Directors. 4.4 Director induction, training and development Upon appointment, each new Non‑executive Director undertakes an  induction program tailored to their needs. Non‑executive Directors also  undertake an induction program when they join a new Committee, which  is tailored to the areas specific to that Committee’s role and the Director’s  previous experience. Following the induction program, Non‑executive Directors participate in  continuous improvement activities through a training and development  program, which is overseen by the Nomination and Governance  Committee to help Directors, individually and collectively, develop and  maintain the skills and knowledge to assist them in performing their role  effectively. The training and development program is periodically reviewed  to maximise effectiveness and to tailor the program to the Directors’ needs  and the Board’s areas of focus. Throughout the year, the Chair discusses development areas with each  Director. Board Committees review and agree their needs for more  briefings. The benefit of this approach is that induction and learning  opportunities can be tailored to Directors’ Committee memberships, as  well as the Board’s specific areas of focus. This approach is also intended  to ensure a coordinated process for succession planning, Board renewal,  training and development and Committee composition. In turn, these  processes are relevant to the Nomination and Governance Committee’s  role in identifying appropriate Non‑executive Director candidates. Examples of activities in the training and development program include: 	 – briefings and development sessions and deep dives to provide each  Director with a deeper understanding of the activities, environment, key  issues and direction of BHP assets, along with broader sustainability,  climate‑related, geopolitical and cybersecurity considerations 	 – training on crisis management 	 – site visits to provide insights into key issues at BHP’s sites and to  provide an opportunity for direct engagement with a cross‑section of  workforce, community members, contractors, Indigenous and First  Nations representatives and other stakeholders 	 – engagement with external experts to discuss views on current and  emerging trends and risks (threats and opportunities) 4.5 Director skills, experience and attributes Overarching statement of Board requirements  At BHP, we know inclusive and diverse teams are safer and more  productive. This is because people in these teams feel safe to speak up,  share their ideas and different points of view, and work together to solve  problems and make better decisions.  The BHP Board is no different and believes its members should comprise  Directors with a broad range of skills and diversity for the Board to:  	 – provide the breadth and depth of understanding necessary to effectively  create long‑term shareholder value  	 – protect and promote the interests of BHP and the creation of social value  	 – ensure the talent, capability and culture of BHP support the long‑term  delivery of our strategy  Attributes and commitment to role  All Directors are expected to comply with Our Code of Conduct, act with  integrity, lead by example and promote the desired culture. The Board believes each Non‑executive Director has demonstrated the  attributes of sufficient time to undertake the responsibilities of the role,  honesty and integrity, and a preparedness to question, challenge and  critique throughout the year through their participation in Board meetings,  and the other activities they have undertaken in their roles.  Skills matrix  The Board, supported by the Nomination and Governance Committee,  reviews the skills and diversity represented by the Directors on the Board  and determines whether the composition and mix of those skills remains  appropriate to achieve BHP’s purpose and strategy.  The Board maintains a skills matrix that identifies the skills and experience  the Board needs for the next period of BHP’s development, considering  BHP’s circumstances and the changing external environment.  The Board skills matrix identifies the future‑facing skills the Board intends  to build, acquire and retain over the medium term in anticipation of its  needs as it pursues its strategy of securing growth options in future‑facing  commodities. The Board skills matrix not only indicates the skills the Board  currently possesses, but also provides an illustration of the new skills  the Board intends to acquire. An external service provider is engaged to  assess the relevant skills and experience of the Directors on the Board set  out in the skills matrix. The Board collectively possesses all the skills and experience set out in  the skills matrix, and each Director satisfies the Board requirements and  attributes discussed above. 103 Operating and Financial Review Overview Additional Information Financial Statements Contents Governance  ===== PAGE 106 ===== Skills and attributes  Number of Directors Mining  Senior executive who has deep operating or technical  mining experience with a large company operating in  multiple countries; successfully optimised and led a suite of  large, global, complex operating assets that have delivered  consistent and sustaining levels of high performance (related  to cost, returns and throughput); successfully led exploration  projects with proven results and performance; delivered  large capital projects that have been successful in terms of  performance and returns; and a proven record in terms of  health, safety and environmental performance and results. 3 Global experience  Global experience gained from working, managing business  units and residing in multiple geographies over an extended  period of time, including a deep understanding of and  experience with global markets, and the geopolitical and  economic environment. 9 Strategy  Senior executive who has had accountability for  enterprise‑wide strategy development and implementation  in industries with long cycles and developing and leading  business transformation strategies. 10 Commodity value chain and customers End‑to‑end value or commodity chain experience –  understanding of consumers and customers, marketing  demand drivers (including specific geographic markets) and  other aspects of commodity chain development. 8 Financial acumen Extensive financial experience and the capability to evaluate  financial statements and understand key financial drivers of the  business, bringing a deep understanding of corporate finance  and internal financial controls. 10 Operating risk Extensive experience with the development and oversight of  complex frameworks focused on the identification, assessment  and assurance of operational workplace health, safety,  environment, climate and community risks. 9 Technology  Recent experience and expertise with the development,  selection, and implementation of leading and business  transforming technology and innovation and responding to  digital disruption. 8 Capital allocation and cost efficiency  Extensive direct experience gained through a senior executive  role in capital allocation discipline, cost efficiency and cash  flow, with proven long‑term performance. 8 Social value, community, and stakeholder engagement Extensive track record of positive external stakeholder  engagement including in relation to community issues and  social responsibility.

BHP’s Inclusion and Diversity Position Statement is available at   bhp.com/careers/inclusion‑diversity and is summarised in OFR 6.6 Our aspiration is to achieve gender balance within our employee workforce  globally by the end of CY2025. We define gender balance as a minimum  40 per cent women and 40 per cent men, in line with the definitions used  by entities such as the International Labour Organization.  The Board is responsible for approving the measurable objectives for  achieving diversity in the composition of the Board, senior executives and  workforce generally and assessing the Group’s progress in achieving  those measurable objectives, which are set out below. The Nomination  and Governance Committee reviews and makes recommendations to the  Board on the diversity and measurable objectives for achieving diversity in  the composition of the Board and reviews the progress in achieving those  measurable objectives. Measurable objectives for FY2024: 1.	Increase female employee representation to 40 per cent by the end  of FY2025 	 Progress in FY2024: In FY2024, the Board approved the objective  to increase the representation of women across the BHP employee  workforce by 3 per cent from the FY2023 objective of 35.2 per cent.  During FY2024, BHP increased the representation of women working  at BHP by 1.9 percentage points, with women now representing  37.1 per cent of the global employee workforce as at 30 June 2024.1 2.	Maintain balanced representation for the Board and senior executives  (defined as ELT and direct reports to the ELT in grade 15 and  above roles) 	 Progress in FY2024: Our Board continued to be gender balanced  in FY2024.  	 Our senior executive ranks remain consistent and represent   40.9 per cent women in FY2024.  For more information on our focus areas for diversity during FY2024  and the respective proportions of men and women on the Board, in  senior executive positions and across the employee workforce refer  to OFR 6.6 More diversity data is available in the BHP ESG Standards and  Databook 2024 available at bhp.com/ESGStandards2024 The Board’s composition reflects gender balance and a diversity of  experience, education and geographic background.  As at 30 June 2024, 40 per cent of Directors are female and the BHP  Board satisfies the target in the UK Listing Rules and the guidance of  having at least 30 per cent of Directors of each gender in accordance  with the ASX Fourth Edition. BHP also satisfies the UK Listing Rule target  of having at least one Director from a minority ethnic background on  the Board.  BHP does not currently satisfy the UK Listing Rule target that at least one  of the senior positions on the Board (which for BHP is the Chair, Chief  Executive Officer and Senior Independent Director) is held by a woman.  The UK Listing Rule target also includes the Chief Financial Officer in the  category of a senior position on the Board. Vandita Pant was appointed as  Chief Financial Officer in March 2024, but, in common with Australian listed  company practice, the Chief Financial Officer is not a Director on the Board  of BHP.

The tables in Additional information 7 set out the information required  under the UK Listing Rules on diversity as at 30 June 2024. The data  presented in these tables was collected by requesting all members of the  Board, ELT and Group Company Secretary self‑report in questionnaires  that include the tables prescribed by the UK Listing Rules. 4.7 Board evaluation  The Board is committed to transparency in assessing the performance  of Directors. The Board conducts regular evaluations of its performance,  the performance of its Committees, the Group Chair, Directors and the  governance processes that support the Board’s work.  The evaluation considers the balance of skills, experience, independence  and knowledge of the Group on the Board, its diversity and culture, and the  operation of governance processes. In FY2024, an internal evaluation was conducted with the assistance  of external service provider, Lintstock. An external Board evaluation  is conducted approximately every three years and was last conducted  in FY2023.  Review of individual Director performance The Board has adopted a policy for all Non‑executive Directors to seek  re‑election annually. The Board uses the results of Director performance  evaluations in considering whether to nominate a Director for re‑election by  shareholders. In FY2024, an assessment was conducted of each Director’s  performance prior to their nomination for re-election with the assistance  of external service provider, Lintstock. Lintstock does not have any other  connection with the Group or individual Directors. The assessment of Directors focused on the contribution of each Director  to the work of the Board and its Committees, and the expectations of  Directors as set out in BHP’s governance framework. In addition, the  assessment focused on how each Director contributes to Board cohesion  and effective relationships with fellow Directors, commits the time  required to fulfil their role and effectively performs their responsibilities.  Directors were asked to comment on areas where their fellow Directors  contribute the greatest value and potential areas for development.  Lintstock provided feedback received to the Chair, which was then  discussed with Directors. Feedback relating to the Chair was discussed  with the Chair by the Senior Independent Director. As a result of these  outcomes, the review supported the Board’s decision to recommend each  Director standing for re-election. Committee assessments  Following an assessment of its work, each Committee concluded that it  had met the requirements under its Charter in FY2024. 5. Board Committees The Board has four standing Committees and has delegated a number  of duties to each Committee to assist the Board in exercising its  responsibilities and discharging its duties. Each Committee’s Charter  sets out the Committee’s roles and responsibilities. These Charters  were reviewed and updated in FY2023 as part of the governance review.  The aim was to review Board and Committee responsibilities and  streamline and modernise the documents in order to best support BHP’s  strategy and purpose.  The updated Charters took effect from 1 July 2023 and are available  at bhp.com/governance BHP’s Board and Committee governance structure facilitates a considered  and integrated approach on key matters, for example: 	 – Climate change is a Board‑level issue. The Board is responsible for  the governance and oversight of climate change issues, including  in relation to our strategic approach, risk management and public  disclosures.

A talent deep dive is conducted by the Board at  least once a year to evaluate these pipelines, including the diversity of  the pipeline.  Senior management succession is viewed from a five‑year perspective  that considers the readiness of successors across time horizons, contexts  and future capability demands. Select Board members are involved  in the interview process for executive‑level appointments one level  below the CEO and occasionally for roles two levels below the CEO.  Appropriate checks are undertaken before appointing a member of the  ELT. BHP has a written agreement with each ELT member setting out the  terms of their appointment.  In December 2023, BHP announced the following changes to the ELT: 	 – Vandita Pant was appointed as the Chief Financial Officer, effective  1 March 2024  	 – Ragnar Udd was appointed as the Chief Commercial Officer, effective  1 March 2024  	 – Brandon Craig was appointed as the President Americas, effective  1 March 2024  	 – Johan van Jaarsveld was appointed as the Chief Technical Officer,  effective 1 March 2024  	 – Catherine Raw was appointed as the Chief Development Officer,  effective 29 April 2024 Laura Tyler (the former Chief Technical Officer) retired from BHP on  29 February 2024 and David Lamont ceased as Chief Financial Officer  on 29 February 2024 and commenced as Senior Executive Officer in  an advisory and projects capacity, reporting directly to the CEO until  February 2025. 6.3 Performance evaluation of executives The performance of executives and other senior employees is reviewed  on an annual basis. The annual performance review process considers  the performance of executives against criteria designed to capture  ‘what’ is achieved and ‘how’ it is achieved. All performance assessments  of executives include how effective they have been in undertaking  their role and what they have achieved against their specified key  performance indicators.  A performance evaluation was conducted for all members of the ELT  during FY2024. For the CEO, the performance evaluation was led by the  Chair of the Board on behalf of all the Non‑executive Directors and was  discussed with the People and Remuneration Committee and considered  by the Board. 7. Shareholders and reporting 7.1 Shareholder and stakeholder engagement BHP shareholder engagement practices  BHP engages regularly with our shareholders to understand their views  and feedback and we have an investor relations program to provide  avenues for effective and timely two‑way communication with investors. We encourage shareholders to make their views known to us.  Shareholders can contact us at any time through our Investor Relations  team, with contact details available at bhp.com. In addition, shareholders  can communicate with us and our registrar electronically. Shareholder engagement practices Direct engagement We engage directly with institutional shareholders and  investor representative organisations around the world  to discuss strategy and governance and to enable our  management, Board and Committees to regularly hear  investor expectations, which can then be used to refine  and develop, and continuously improve, the governance  processes of BHP. We also engage directly with retail  shareholders and their representatives. Engagement on key sustainability themes In addition to our regular investor meetings program, in  FY2024 we held direct engagement sessions with lead  investors, including from Climate Action 100+, Nature Action  100 and Principles for Responsible Investment’s (PRI)  Advance initiative. We also held engagement sessions on  preparation of our Climate Transition Action Plan 2024 to  obtain feedback from investors on our approach. Webcasts and Q&A sessions We provide webcasts and Q&A sessions as  forums to update shareholders on results or other  key announcements. Website  All relevant corporate governance information, including  our Annual Report, is available on our website at bhp.com.  All ASX announcements are promptly posted to the website.  BHP encourages direct contact from shareholders and our  website has a ‘Contact Us’ form for contact with our Investor  Relations team. Anyone who is interested in receiving news  from BHP can subscribe to receive email alerts. Chair and Non‑executive Director investor meetings The Chair and Senior Independent Director regularly  meet with investors to discuss Board priorities and seek  shareholder feedback. The People and Remuneration  Committee Chair also meets with investors and proxy  advisors to discuss remuneration. Annual General Meeting We facilitate and encourage shareholder participation at  our Annual General Meeting (AGM). The meeting provides  an opportunity for all investors to hear about BHP’s  performance and to question and engage with the Board  and vote on the resolutions. The External Auditor is also  available to answer questions at the AGM. Information on our AGM is available at bhp.com/meetings Before the AGM, shareholders are provided with all material  information in BHP’s possession relevant to their decision  on whether to elect or re‑elect a Director. Copies of the  speeches delivered by the Chair and CEO at the AGM are  released to the relevant stock exchanges and posted on  our website. Proceedings at shareholder meetings are webcast live from  our website. Resolutions at general meetings are decided by  a poll rather than by a show of hands.  A summary of proceedings and the outcome of voting on  the items of business are released to the relevant stock  exchanges and posted on our website as soon as they  are available. Corporate Governance Statement continued 108 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 111 ===== Stakeholder engagement The Board considers effective stakeholder engagement a key element  of its governance and oversight role. Our strategy, our 2030 goals, our  purpose and our Risk Appetite Statement reflect the significance of  external partners and stakeholders in decision‑making. There are multiple ways the views of partners and stakeholders, beyond  shareholders, are brought to the Board and its Committees.  Examples of reports that are provided to the Board include Employee  Perception Survey findings, gender pay gap reports and updates from the  CEO and Chief People Officer. In addition, the Risk and Audit Committee  and Sustainability Committee receive reports on engagement with  regulators. The Risk and Audit Committee receives reports on material  litigation and disputes with third parties and misconduct concerns raised  through confidential reporting platforms. The Sustainability Committee  receives updates on Community Perception Survey findings. Stakeholder engagement Site visits Site visits provide an opportunity for Directors  to engage directly with the workforce, partners,  community members, Indigenous and First Nations  representatives and contractors and gain a greater  understanding of the Group’s operations, culture,  material risks and risk management processes, and  other issues relevant to the specific site. Site visits in  FY2024 included to Nickel West and BMA (November  2023), New South Wales Energy Coal (February  2024), Spence (April 2024) and Jansen (June 2024). Workforce Directors also have the opportunity to engage directly  with a cross-section of the workforce at Board and  Committee meetings, at Director briefing sessions and  during visits to our sites and offices.   Presentations and briefings  Presentation materials for briefings and speeches  related to financial results, strategy, decarbonisation  and other key topics are available at bhp.com for  all stakeholders. Events Various events throughout the year, such as retail  shareholder events in Australia and the UK and the  AGM, provide opportunities for engagement with  a range of partners and stakeholders, including  government officials, community members,  Traditional Owners and other Indigenous partners and  non‑government organisations. 7.2 Market disclosure BHP is committed to timely and balanced disclosure of market  sensitive information. BHP’s Market Disclosure and Communications policy sets out the  processes designed to ensure compliance with BHP’s relevant disclosure  obligations and outlines the way in which information is communicated  to shareholders, the investment community and the market. It outlines  how we identify and distribute information to shareholders and market  participants and sets out the role of the Disclosure Committee in managing  compliance with market disclosure obligations.  The Board receives copies of material market announcements promptly  after they have been released.  Where BHP gives a new and substantive investor or analyst presentation,  it releases a copy of the presentation materials to the market ahead of  the presentation. The Market Disclosure and Communications policy is available   at bhp.com/governance  In addition, we have disclosure controls in place for periodic disclosures,  including the Operational Review, our results announcements, debt  investor documents (such as the prospectus for the Euro or Australian  Medium-Term Notes) and Annual Report documents, which must comply  with relevant regulatory requirements.  More information about these verification processes can be found   in the Disclosure Controls for Periodic Disclosure document  available at bhp.com/governance  8. Culture and conduct Code of Conduct We are committed to the highest level of governance and strive to foster a  culture that values and rewards exemplary ethical standards, personal and  corporate integrity and respect for others. The Board, together with management, plays a critical role in setting and  reinforcing the culture of the Group.  Our Code of Conduct is approved by the Board and is based on Our  Values: Do what’s right, Seek better ways and Make a difference. It applies  to all our Directors, senior executives and employees. Our Code of Conduct includes our policies on speaking up and anti‑bribery  and corruption, sets out standards of behaviour for our people and is an  important statement of the culture at BHP.  For more information on our policies on speaking up and our  commitment against corruption refer to OFR 6.8 Our Code of Conduct is available at bhp.com/about/  operating-ethically/our-code/ BHP’s channels to raise misconduct concerns We have mechanisms in place for anyone to raise a query about Our  Code of Conduct or make a report if they feel Our Code of Conduct  has been breached. BHP’s reporting channels to raise misconduct  concerns comprise an online portal and 24-hour multilingual call service.  These channels are confidential and accessible to all employees,  contractors and external partners and stakeholders, including members  of the public, to raise concerns about misconduct that may be unethical,  illegal or inconsistent with Our Code of Conduct. All misconduct concerns  raised through our reporting channels are reviewed and categorised by the  Ethics and Investigations team. Once categorised, reports are assigned  in accordance with internal policy and processes to an investigator, line  leader or appropriate team for resolution. All significant Our Code of  Conduct matters and key trends from investigations are reported to the  Risk and Audit Committee. These are then reported to the Board as part of  its report‑out process.  For more information on ethics and business conduct    refer to OFR 6.8 More information on ethics and business conduct is available   at bhp.com/ethics 109 Operating and Financial Review Overview Additional Information Financial Statements Contents Governance  ===== PAGE 112 ===== 9. Risk management and assurance 9.1 Risk management governance structure Risk governance The Risk and Audit Committee (RAC) oversees and assists the Board in  risk management and reviewing the emerging and principal risks facing  the Group, including financial and non‑financial risks that could threaten  the Group’s business model, future performance, solvency, liquidity or  reputation. This includes business risk, financial reporting risk, insurance  risk, tax risk, technology security and cyber risk, climate risk and ethical  compliance programs. The Board requires the CEO to implement a system  of control for identifying and managing risk. The Risk team is accountable  for this system, known as BHP’s Risk Framework, and also supports,  challenges and verifies risk management activities to give assurance to  management and the Board. The Directors, with support from the RAC,  monitor and, at least annually, will review the effectiveness of the Group’s  systems of risk management and internal control. The RAC, in undertaking  this review, makes a recommendation to the Board on whether the systems  of risk management and internal control continue to be sound and whether  the Group is operating with due regard to the risk appetite set by the Board.  For more information refer to OFR 8 Internal audit The Internal Audit team provides assurance to the Board, CEO and  Executive Leadership Team on whether risk management, internal control  and governance processes are adequate and functioning. The Internal  Audit team is independent of the External Auditor. The RAC evaluates and,  if thought fit, approves the Terms of Reference of the Internal Audit team  and the annual internal audit plan and monitors the effectiveness of the  internal audit activities. The RAC approves the appointment and dismissal of the Chief Audit  Officer (which is currently the Chief Risk and Audit Officer) and assesses  their performance, independence and objectivity. During FY2024, the Chief  Risk and Audit Officer reported directly to the RAC and functional oversight  of the Internal Audit team was provided by the Chief Financial Officer.  Effectiveness of systems of internal control  and risk management  In delegating authority to the CEO, the Board has established CEO limits,  outlined in the Board Governance Document. These limits require the CEO  to ensure there is a system of control in place for identifying and managing  risk in BHP. Through the RAC, the Directors regularly review these  systems for their effectiveness. These reviews include assessing whether  processes continue to meet evolving external governance requirements. The RAC oversees and reviews the internal controls and risk management  systems (including procedures, processes and systems for, among  other things, financial controls, financial reporting, reporting of reserves  and resources, closure and rehabilitation, legal and ethical compliance,  preventing fraud and serious breaches of business conduct, speak-up  procedures, information technology security and cyber risk). Any material  breaches of Our Code of Conduct, including breaches of our anti-bribery  and corruption requirements and any material incidents reported under  our speak-up procedures are reported quarterly to the RAC by the Chief  Compliance Officer. These reports are then communicated to the Board  through the report-out process.  During FY2024, management presented an assessment of the material  risks facing BHP and the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of risk  management. The reviews were overseen by the RAC, with findings and  recommendations reported to the Board. In addition to considering key  risks facing BHP, the Board assessed the effectiveness of internal controls  over key risks identified through the work of the Board Committees.  Having carried out a review during FY2024, the Board is satisfied with the  effectiveness of BHP’s risk management and internal control systems. Environmental and social risks BHP’s risk factors (including material exposure to environmental and social  risks) and how we manage these risks are described in OFR 8. 9.2 External audit and financial reporting Integrity of Financial Statements The RAC assists the Board in assuring the integrity of the Financial  Statements. The RAC evaluates and makes recommendations to the  Board about the appropriateness of accounting policies and practices,  areas of judgement, compliance with accounting standards, stock  exchange and legal requirements and the results of the external audit.  CEO and CFO assurance For the FY2024 full year and half year, the CEO and CFO have provided  a declaration that in their opinion, BHP’s financial records have been  properly maintained and those Financial Statements comply with  accounting standards and applicable regulatory requirements and give  a true and fair view of the financial position and performance of BHP,  and that the opinion was formed on the basis of a sound system of risk  management and internal control, which is operating effectively. The RAC  considered these certifications when recommending the Financial  Statements to the Board for approval. External Auditor The RAC manages the relationship with the External Auditor on behalf  of the Board. It considers the independence and reappointment of the  External Auditor each year, as well as remuneration and other terms of  engagement and makes a recommendation to the Board.  Evaluation of External Auditor and external audit process The RAC evaluates the objectivity and independence of the External  Auditor and the quality and effectiveness of the external audit  arrangements, including through: 	 – reviewing the terms of engagement of the External Auditor 	 – considering the external audit plan, in particular to gain assurance that  it is tailored to reflect changes in circumstances from the prior year and  reviewing the plan during the audit engagement 	 – meeting with the audit partners, particularly the lead audit engagement  partners, throughout the year and without management present 	 – discussing with the audit engagement partners the skills and experience  of the broader audit team 	 – considering the quality of the External Auditor’s performance following  the completion of the audit In addition, the RAC reviews the integrity, independence and objectivity  of the External Auditor and assesses whether there is any element of  the relationship that impairs or appears to impair the External Auditor’s  judgement or independence. The External Auditor also certifies its  independence to the RAC. Non‑audit services Although the External Auditor provides some non‑audit services to the  Group, the objectivity and independence of the External Auditor are  safeguarded through restrictions on the provision of these services with  some services prohibited from being undertaken. Pre‑approved services The RAC has adopted a policy titled Provision of Audit and Other Services  by the External Auditor covering the RAC’s pre‑approval policies and  procedures to maintain the independence of the External Auditor.  The categories of ‘pre‑approved’ services are: 	 – Audit services – work that constitutes the agreed scope of the statutory  audit and includes the statutory audits of BHP and its entities (including  interim reviews). The RAC monitors the audit services engagements and  if necessary, approves any changes in terms and conditions resulting  from changes in audit scope, Group structure or other relevant events. 	 – Audit‑related and other assurance services – work that is outside the  scope of the statutory audit but is consistent with the role of the external  statutory auditor. This category includes work that is reasonably related  to the performance of an audit or review and is a logical extension of the  audit or review scope, is of an assurance or compliance nature and is  work that the external auditors must or are best placed to undertake and  is permissible under the relevant applicable standard.  	 – Tax services – identification of public subsidies and tax incentives and  support regarding tax inspections by tax authorities, but only when  support from the external auditor or audit firm is required by law.  Corporate Governance Statement continued 110 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 113 ===== Activities outside the scope of the categories above are not ‘pre‑approved’  and must be approved by the RAC prior to engagement, regardless of the  dollar value involved. In addition, any engagement for other services with a  value over US$250,000, even if listed as a ‘pre‑approved’ service, requires  the approval of the RAC.  All engagements for non‑audit services, whether ‘pre‑approved’ or not and  regardless of the dollar value involved, are reported quarterly to the RAC.  While not prohibited by BHP’s policy, any proposed engagement of the  External Auditor relating to internal control requires specific prior approval  from the RAC. In addition, while the categories of ‘pre‑approved’ services  include a list of certain pre‑approved services, the use of the External  Auditor to perform these services will always be subject to our overriding  governance practices as articulated in the policy.  In addition, the RAC did not approve any services during the year ended  30 June 2024 pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2‑01 of SEC  Regulation S‑X (provision of services other than audit). Fees paid to BHP’s External Auditor during FY2024 for audit and other  services were US$15.722 million, of which 71 per cent comprised audit  fees (including in relation to SOX matters), 12 per cent for audit‑related  fees and 17 per cent for all other fees. US$10,000 fees were paid in  relation to tax services. For information on the fees paid refer to Financial  Statements note 36 ‘Auditor’s remuneration’. Our Provision of Audit and Other Services by the External Auditor  policy is available at bhp.com/governance Management’s assessment of internal control over  financial reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate  internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a‑15(f) and  Rule 15d‑15(f) under the Exchange Act).  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting  may not prevent or detect misstatements and, even when determined to be  effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial  statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of  effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may  become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of  compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,  including our CEO and CFO, the effectiveness of BHP’s internal control  over financial reporting was evaluated based on the framework and  criteria established in Internal Controls – Integrated Framework (2013),  issued by the Committee of the Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway  Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that  internal control over financial reporting was effective as at 30 June 2024.  There were no material weaknesses in BHP’s internal controls over  financial reporting identified by management as at 30 June 2024. BHP has engaged independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst &  Young, to issue an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control  over financial reporting for inclusion in the Annual Report on Form 20-F as  filed with the SEC.  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting  during FY2024 that materially affected or were reasonably likely to  materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. During FY2024, the RAC reviewed our compliance with the obligations  imposed by SOX, including evaluating and documenting internal controls  as required by section 404 of SOX. Management’s assessment of disclosure controls  and procedures Management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, performed  an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation  of our disclosure controls and procedures as at 30 June 2024.  Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable  assurance that the material financial and non‑financial information required  to be disclosed by BHP, including in the reports it files or submits under  the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarised and reported  on a timely basis. This information is accumulated and communicated to  BHP’s management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow  timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation,  management (including the CEO and CFO) concluded that as at 30 June  2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing that  reasonable assurance.  There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of  disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human  error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures.  Even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide  reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. In the design and evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures,  management was required to apply its judgement in evaluating the  cost‑benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 10. US requirements BHP Group Limited is a registrant with the SEC in the United States. It is  classified as a foreign private issuer and has American Depositary Shares  listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). We have reviewed the governance requirements applicable to foreign  private issuers under SOX, including the rules promulgated by the  SEC and the rules of the NYSE, and are satisfied that we comply with  those requirements. Under NYSE rules, foreign private issuers such as BHP are required  to disclose any significant ways our corporate governance practices  differ from those followed by US companies under the NYSE corporate  governance standards. After a comparison of our corporate governance  practices with the requirements of Section 303A of the NYSE‑Listed  Company Manual followed by US companies, two significant differences  were identified: Rule 10A‑3 of the Exchange Act requires NYSE‑listed companies  to ensure their audit committees are directly responsible for the  appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of the  External Auditor unless the company’s governing law or documents or  other home country legal requirements require or permit shareholders  to ultimately vote on or approve these matters. Under the terms of  our Constitution, our shareholders are ultimately responsible for the  appointment and retention of the External Auditor and are required to  vote on the appointment of the External Auditor from time to time (as  required under Australian law). The RAC remains directly responsible for  the compensation and oversight of the work of the External Auditor. Under Section 303A.08 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual,  shareholders must be given the opportunity to vote on all  equity‑compensation plans and material revisions thereto, with certain  exemptions. Under Australian law, BHP Group Limited is not required  to provide for shareholder votes on all equity‑compensation plans or  revisions thereto. Shareholder approval is required for issues of shares  to Directors and accordingly is sought only for certain incentive awards  to the CEO. The Remuneration Report voted on by shareholders at the  Annual General Meeting describes Board and executive remuneration.  All incentive programs offered to the Board and/or Executives are  intended to comply with our remuneration framework. We have a Securities Dealing policy and procedures that cover the  purchase, sale and other dealings of our securities by Directors, senior  management and employees that seek to promote compliance with  applicable insider trading laws, rules and regulations. 111 Operating and Financial Review Overview Additional Information Financial Statements Contents Governance  ===== PAGE 114 ===== The information presented by the Directors in this Directors’ Report  relates to BHP Group Limited and its subsidiaries. The Operating and  Financial Review (OFR), the Remuneration Report and the ‘Lead Auditor’s  Independence Declaration’ are incorporated by reference into and form  part of this Directors’ Report.  1.  Review of operations, principal activities  and state of affairs A review of the operations of BHP during FY2024, the results of those  operations during FY2024 and the expected results of those operations in  future financial years are set out in the OFR 1‑7, 9 and 11. Information on  the likely developments in BHP’s operations in future years and the  expected results of those operations also appears in that section.  We have excluded certain information from the OFR, to the extent  permitted by Australian law, on the basis that such information relates  to impending developments or matters in the course of negotiation and  disclosure would be seriously prejudicial to the interests of BHP. This is  because such disclosure could be misleading due to the fact it is premature  or preliminary in nature, relates to commercially sensitive contracts, would  undermine confidentiality between BHP and our suppliers and clients, or  would otherwise unreasonably damage BHP. The categories of information  omitted include forward-looking estimates and projections prepared for  internal management purposes, information regarding BHP’s assets and  projects that is developing and susceptible to change, and information  relating to commercial contracts and pricing modules. Our principal activities, including significant changes in the nature of BHP’s  principal activities during FY2024 are disclosed in the OFR.  There were no significant changes in BHP’s state of affairs that  occurred during FY2024 and no significant post balance date events  other than as disclosed in the OFR and Financial Statements note 35  ‘Subsequent events’. No other matter or circumstance has arisen since the end of FY2024  that has significantly affected or is expected to significantly affect  the operations, the results of operations or state of affairs of BHP in  future years. 2. Directors The Directors who served at any time during FY2024 or up until  the date of this Directors’ Report are listed in the Board and Board  Committee attendance table below.

For details of her  qualifications and experience refer to Corporate Governance Statement  4.1. Stefanie Wilkinson has experience in a company secretariat role or  other relevant fields arising from time spent advising other large-listed  companies or other relevant entities.  6. Indemnities and insurance Rule 146 of the BHP Group Limited Constitution requires the company  to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each Officer of BHP Group  Limited against liability incurred in or arising out of the conduct of the  business of BHP or the discharge of the duties of the Officer. The Directors  named in 4.1 of the Corporate Governance Statement, and the Company  Secretary and other Officers of BHP Group Limited have the benefit of this  requirement, as do individuals who formerly held one of those positions.  In accordance with this requirement, BHP Group Limited has entered into  Deeds of Indemnity, Access and Insurance (Deeds of Indemnity) with  its Directors.  Under BHP’s Deed Poll for Indemnification, BHP Group Limited and BHP  Group (UK) Ltd (formerly BHP Group Plc) must, to the extent permitted by  law, indemnify current and former employees of the Group against liability  to third parties incurred in or arising out of the conduct of the business of  the Group or the discharge of the duties of these employees, including  where an employee performs a role at another entity at the request of  the Group. The indemnity is subject to certain limitations and does not  apply where the liability has arisen in circumstances involving dishonesty,  recklessness, wilful misconduct or lack of good faith by the employee  seeking indemnification.  In addition, as part of the arrangements to effect the demerger of South32,  we agreed to indemnify certain former Officers of BHP who transitioned  to South32 from certain claims and liabilities incurred in their capacity as  Directors or Officers of South32. The terms of engagement for certain services include that we must  compensate and reimburse EY for and protect EY against any loss,  damage, expense or liability incurred by EY in respect of third‑party  claims arising from a breach by BHP of any obligation under the  engagement terms.  We have insured against amounts that we may be liable to pay to Directors,  Company Secretaries or certain employees (including former Officers)  pursuant to Rule 146 of the Constitution of BHP Group Limited or that we  otherwise agree to pay by way of indemnity. The insurance policy also  insures Directors, Company Secretaries and some employees (including  former Officers) against certain liabilities (including legal costs) they may  incur in carrying out their duties. For this Directors’ and Officers’ insurance,  we paid premiums of US$17,535,690 excluding taxes during FY2024.  No indemnity in favour of a current or former Officer of BHP Group Limited  or in favour of the External Auditor was called on during FY2024. 7. Dividends A final dividend of 74 US cents per share will be paid on 3 October 2024,  resulting in total cash dividends determined in respect of FY2024  of 146 US cents per share.  For information on the dividends paid refer to Financial Statements  note 19 ‘Dividends’ 8. Auditors A copy of the declaration given by our External Auditor to the Directors in  relation to the auditors’ compliance with the independence requirements  of the Australian Corporations Act 2001 and the Professional Code of  Conduct for External Auditors is set out in Financial Statements 4. No current Officer of BHP has held the role of director or partner of the  Group’s current External Auditor.  113 Operating and Financial Review Overview Additional Information Financial Statements Contents Governance  ===== PAGE 116 ===== 9. Non‑audit services For information on the non-audit services undertaken by BHP’s External  Auditor, including the amounts paid for non-audit services, refer to  Financial Statements note 36 ‘Auditor’s remuneration’. All non-audit  services were approved in accordance with the process set out in the  Policy on Provision of Audit and Other Services by the External Auditor.  No non-audit services were carried out that were specifically excluded  by the Policy on Provision of Audit and Other Services by the External  Auditor. Based on advice provided by the Risk and Audit Committee, the  Directors have formed the view that the provision of non-audit services is  compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors, and  that the nature of non-audit services means that auditor independence  was not compromised. The reason for this view is that the objectivity and  independence of the External Auditor are safeguarded through restrictions  on the provision of these services with some services prohibited from  being undertaken. For more information about our policy in relation to the provision of  non‑audit services by the external auditor refer to ‘External audit and  financial reporting’ in our Corporate Governance Statement 9.2 10. Exploration, research and development Companies within the Group carry out exploration and research and  development necessary to support their activities.

Our approach and framework During FY2024, the People and Remuneration Committee (Committee)  focused on achieving remuneration outcomes that fairly reflect the  performance of BHP and the contribution of our employees while aligning  with the interests of shareholders and other key stakeholders.  The objectives of our remuneration framework are to support the execution  of the Group’s global strategy, encourage and sustain a culture aligned  with the Group’s values and BHP’s purpose and risk appetite, and provide  competitive remuneration, linked to performance, sufficient to attract, retain  and motivate our executives on a global basis. This is critical to delivering  the best outcomes for all BHP shareholders.  FY2024 reflections We delivered strong operational and financial performance in FY2024.  We achieved record production at Spence, Carrapateena and Western  Australia Iron Ore and widened our lead as the lowest cost major iron  ore producer. The safety of our people remains our absolute priority. FY2024 was  overshadowed by the fatality of Luke O’Brien, a team member working  with one of our contracting partners at BMA, who was fatally injured  at the Saraji mine in Queensland. We remain committed to eliminating  fatalities and serious injuries at BHP. In a year where we have reported a  fatality, it is important this has a flow-on impact on our performance-based  remuneration framework outcomes for BHP executives, which reinforces  our unwavering commitment to zero fatalities and serious injuries at BHP.  Appropriately, there has been an impact on remuneration outcomes from  this event.  We continued to make meaningful progress towards a more inclusive  and diverse workforce, which is critical for productive and safer teams.  We increased female participation across the Group to over 37 per cent,  up almost 2 percentage points from last year. In FY2023 we identified and disclosed two issues with certain allowances  and entitlements affecting some current and former employees in Australia.  We self-reported these issues to Australia’s Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO)  and engaged Protiviti, a global assurance firm, to undertake a review of our  payroll systems. The Board and CEO have taken these issues seriously.  A range of consequences have been implemented for employees in  connection with these issues. For the CEO, a reduction has been applied  to his FY2024 CDP outcome (refer further below). FY2024 Cash and Deferred Plan scorecard BHP’s Cash and Deferred Plan (CDP) is an annual cash and equity  incentive scheme, with awards provided as cash and deferred shares that  vest in two and five years. The FY2024 CDP scorecard used to assess  the CEO’s and other ELT members’ annual performance comprised  stretching performance measures based on three elements – safety  and sustainability, financial and personal performance elements. A key  aspect of the CDP is that vesting of the five-year deferred share awards is  underpinned by a holistic review of performance at the end of the five-year  vesting period, including a review of safety and sustainability performance  over the five-year period. Climate change CDP measures also play a meaningful role in the  determination of our remuneration outcomes for our CEO and other ELT  members. Each year since FY2020, climate change scorecard targets  have represented 10 per cent in BHP’s CDP scorecard. Our Climate  Transition Action Plan (CTAP) 2024 provides an update on our climate  strategy and our progress and plan in relation to our GHG emissions goals  and targets.  FY2024 Cash and Deferred Plan outcomes for the CEO The Committee assessed the CEO’s performance against the CDP  scorecard elements, which resulted in a FY2024 CDP outcome of 71.7 per  cent against a target of 100 per cent (and 47.8 per cent of the maximum).  The Board and Committee believe this overall outcome is appropriately  aligned with BHP’s values, the shareholder experience and the interests of  the Group's other key stakeholders. Safety and sustainability measures have a 25 per cent total weighting.  People and Remuneration Committee Chair letter to shareholders There is a 10 per cent measure for significant HSEC events. The outcome  took into account the fatality at the Saraji mine in FY2024 and the 10 per  cent measure for significant HSEC events was reduced to zero in FY2024  for the CEO. For other sustainability measures, good progress was made  against the scorecard’s climate change targets and our outcomes with  respect to Indigenous partnerships was broadly aligned to target. As a  result, the CDP scorecard assessment for the safety and sustainability  measures overall was 15 per cent out of a target of 25 per cent.  For the financial measures, after fully eliminating the impacts of commodity  prices during the year, operating performance at our operated assets was  below the challenging internal targets set at the commencement of the  year, particularly with respect to production volumes, despite achieving  record production at some assets. The CDP scorecard assessment for the  financial measure was 37 per cent out of a target of 50 per cent.  From a personal contribution perspective, the Committee considered  Mike Henry’s performance against his Group measures. These included  projects and initiatives in respect of people, performance and portfolio.  The Committee considered Mike’s performance against his Group  objectives was slightly below expectations and assessed it as 24 per cent  against the target of 25 per cent. This assessment against scorecard objectives gave an FY2024 CDP  outcome for Mike of 76 per cent based on performance during the year.  Subsequent to this assessment, the Board also took into account the  CEO’s ultimate accountability for the operations of BHP, specifically payroll  issues, and made the decision to reduce Mike’s overall FY2024 outcome  by 4.3 percentage points from 76 per cent to 71.7 per cent. The CDP scorecard outcomes for other ELT members and the short-term  incentive pool applicable to the majority of BHP employees below the ELT  level, were, like the CEO, below the 100 per cent target and, for certain  executives, the CDP scorecard outcomes included downward adjustments  reflecting accountability for BHP’s payroll issues.  2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan award The vesting outcome for the 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)  award was 50 per cent. The LTIP performance condition is relative total  shareholder return against two separate index measures – a sector peer  group and the MSCI World Index. BHP outperformed both the sector peer  group and the MSCI World Index requirements for threshold vesting (at  which 25 per cent of the award would vest) but performance was below  the requirements for maximum vesting (at which 100 per cent of the award  would vest).  In considering vesting of the 2019 LTIP award, the Board and Committee  have also conducted their normal holistic review of business performance  over the five years since the award was granted to ensure this level of  vesting was appropriate. More information on the 2019 LTIP vesting  outcome is included in 3.3 FY2024 LTIP performance outcomes and 3.4  Overarching discretion and vesting underpin. Having considered the overall remuneration outcome for the CEO carefully,  the Committee concluded it was a fair reflection of performance and  the experience of shareholders, and the application of any downwards  discretion to the vesting of the LTIP was not warranted. More information  on the overall remuneration outcomes for the CEO for the year, and how  the outcomes are aligned to performance during FY2024, is provided in 3.1  FY2024 remuneration received by the CEO.  Our shareholders will  see that our executives’  remuneration outcomes  are aligned with   our business  performance   during FY2024.”  116 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 119 ===== FY2025 remuneration For FY2025, the Committee determined that the CEO’s base salary  would increase by 4 per cent, effective 1 September 2024. In making  this decision, we have conducted benchmarking and considered the  external market demand for global senior executive talent. We benchmark  the CEO’s and other executives’ remuneration against CEO and senior  executive roles in other global companies of similar complexity, reach and  scale. This detailed benchmarking is intended to ensure BHP’s executive  remuneration remains competitive to attract, motivate and retain key  talented senior executives and is consistent with the global market.  The Committee considers the CEO’s base salary increase to be  appropriate in this context, and it is below the average salary increase  applied for other BHP employees. Other components of the CEO’s total  target remuneration (pension contributions, benefits, CDP and LTIP)  remain unchanged and, where relevant, as percentages of base salary.  A summary of the CEO’s arrangements for FY2025 is set out in the  above table.  The majority of the CEO’s remuneration package continues to be  delivered in BHP equity, not in cash. The CEO’s remuneration is linked  to the performance of the business. In addition, the CEO has a minimum  shareholding requirement of five times pre-tax base salary and this applies  for two years post-retirement. This ensures the CEO’s remuneration  is aligned to the experience of BHP’s shareholders. As at the date of  this Report, the CEO’s BHP shareholding is in excess of his minimum  shareholding requirement. The Committee has also reviewed the base salaries and total target  remuneration packages for other executive key management personnel.  The Committee determined an increase of 8 per cent for the President  Australia, reflecting performance and development in role. Given recent  appointments, no other changes are being made for other executive key  management personnel at this time, and this will be the subject of future  reviews. It is vital that we provide competitive remuneration to attract and  retain highly skilled global executive talent, and our reviews are based on  updated global benchmarking data. Other aspects of other executive key  management personnel remuneration arrangements remain unchanged.  Remuneration outcomes for the Group Chair and  Non‑executive Directors  Fees for the Group Chair and Non-executive Directors are reviewed  annually and are benchmarked against global companies of similar  complexity, reach and scale. Following an assessment of the updated  benchmarking, global market positioning and peer company relativities, a  decision has been made that the Group Chair's fee and the Non-executive  Directors' base fee will increase by 4 per cent with effect from 1 July 2024.  The increases are considered appropriate given current benchmarking  and the expectations, accountabilities and workloads of each of the Group  Chair and Non-executive Directors. Having conducted this review, it was  determined that there would be no change to the fees for other Committee  roles or other allowances. People From 1 July 2023, the remit of the Committee expanded to include  oversight of BHP’s people and culture strategy, the organisation’s  alignment with the Group’s purpose and values, employee engagement,  leadership and talent development.  During the year, we engaged with management on our people policies  and governance, performance management system and the launch and  embedment of Our refreshed Values. Committee members also monitored  culture through Board visits to our sites and offices, management  presentations and by considering trends and results from our Engagement  and Perception Surveys. Our aspiration to achieve gender balance within  our employee workforce globally by the end of CY2025 remains a key  aspect of our broader focus on diversity and inclusion.  Summary We continue to provide a significant component of executive remuneration  as at-risk variable remuneration to align remuneration with performance.  This year, we are confident the outcomes are consistent with the  performance of BHP and the experience of our shareholders, while also  recognising our critical need to attract, motivate and retain our executives  in order to progress our strategic objectives and deliver the best outcomes  for all of our shareholders.  We look forward to ongoing dialogue with and the support of BHP’s  shareholders. As always, we welcome your feedback and comments on  any aspect of this Report.

The Board approves the remuneration framework for the Group Chair, CEO and other members of the ELT on recommendation from the Committee.  The remuneration of Non-executive Directors (excluding the Group Chair) is a matter for the Group Chair and the Executive Director, and is reviewed by  them each year having regard to the remuneration framework. No Director or executive is involved in deciding their own remuneration. The objective of the remuneration framework is to: 	 – support the execution of the Group’s business strategy 	 – encourage and sustain a culture aligned to BHP’s values, purpose and risk appetite, including in relation to non-financial risk 	 – provide competitive remuneration, which is linked to performance, to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled executives on a global basis The Board approves the remuneration arrangements and outcomes for the Group Chair and CEO on recommendation from the Committee. 1.2 People and Remuneration Committee The Board has established the Committee to support and advise the Board on people and remuneration matters, as set out in the Committee Charter  available at bhp.com. Each of the Committee members are independent Non-executive Directors. The current members of the Committee are Christine  O’Reilly (Chair), Ross McEwan, Catherine Tanna and Dion Weisler. The Committee has unrestricted access to members of senior management as appropriate and invites them to attend meetings to provide reports and  updates. However, members of management are not present when decisions are considered or taken concerning their own remuneration. The Committee  can also draw on services from a range of external sources, including independent remuneration advisers. The Committee also receives input from other  Board committees as required, in relation to financial performance and safety and sustainability matters. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board on the remuneration framework for the Group Chair, the CEO and other members of the ELT,  including Executive KMP. The Committee is briefed on and considers prevailing market and economic conditions where our Executive KMP are based,  the competitive environment and the positioning and relativities of pay and employment conditions across the wider BHP workforce. From 1 July 2023, the remit of the Committee expanded to include oversight of BHP’s people and culture strategy, the organisation’s alignment with the  Group’s purpose and values, employee engagement, leadership and talent development. More information on the role and focus of the Committee can  be found in Corporate Governance Statement 5.4, and details of meeting attendances can be found in Directors’ Report 2.  The Committee’s approach is that remuneration outcomes, which are linked to performance, attract, motivate and retain highly skilled executives on  a global basis. Remuneration should be fair to the individual and remuneration levels should accurately reflect the CEO’s and other Executive KMP’s  responsibilities and contributions, while considering the positioning and relativities of pay and employment conditions across the wider BHP workforce.  The Committee also considers shareholder views and those of the wider community when setting this remuneration framework. We proactively engage  with our global institutional and investor representative shareholders regularly to discuss remuneration and governance matters. This feedback assists  Directors to have a deep understanding of current shareholder and other stakeholder views when making remuneration decisions. 1.3 Engagement of independent remuneration advisers The Committee may appoint and instruct expert advisers who are advisers solely to the Committee, including remuneration consultants, to assist  the Committee with advice in relation to the Group’s remuneration strategy, framework and policies. The Committee may meet with external advisers  without management being present. Potential conflicts of interest are taken into account when remuneration consultants are selected and their terms of  engagement regulate their level of access to, and require their independence from, BHP’s management.  PwC was appointed to act as an independent remuneration adviser in FY2016 and is currently the only remuneration adviser appointed by the Committee.  In that capacity, PwC may provide remuneration recommendations in relation to KMP, however, it did not provide any remuneration recommendations  in FY2024. 1.4 Service contracts The terms of employment for the CEO and Executive KMP are formalised in their employment contracts. The current contracts of the CEO and Executive  KMP are not fixed term. BHP may choose to terminate a contract on up to 12 months’ notice. BHP can require an executive to work through the notice  period or may terminate the individual’s contract immediately by paying base salary plus pension contributions in lieu of the notice period. The CEO and  Executive KMP must provide up to 12 months’ notice for voluntary resignation. 1.5 KMP for FY2024 This Remuneration Report describes the remuneration policies, practices, outcomes and governance for the KMP of BHP during FY2024. At BHP,  KMP consists of the Directors (including the CEO), as well as certain members of our ELT who have authority and responsibility for planning, directing  and controlling the activities of the Group directly or indirectly. In FY2024, Brandon Craig and Vandita Pant moved into new KMP roles within the BHP  Group, and David Lamont and Ragnar Udd moved into new non-KMP roles within the BHP Group, all effective 1 March 2024. After due consideration, the  Committee determined the Chief Operating Officer was no longer a KMP role effective 1 March 2024 as, since the successful integration of OZ Minerals  into the BHP Group, the role no longer meets the threshold necessary for classification as KMP. Accordingly, for FY2024, the KMP comprised the  following individuals: 	 – Mike Henry, CEO and Executive Director 	 – Edgar Basto, Chief Operating Officer (from 1 July 2023 to 29 February 2024) 	 – Brandon Craig, President Americas (from 1 March 2024 to 30 June 2024) 	 – David Lamont, Chief Financial Officer (from 1 July 2023 to 29 February 2024) 	 – Vandita Pant, Chief Financial Officer (from 1 March 2024 to 30 June 2024) 	 – Geraldine Slattery, President Australia 	 – Ragnar Udd, President Americas (from 1 July 2023 to 29 February 2024) 	 – All Non-executive Directors – for details of Non-executive Directors, including dates of appointment or cessation (where relevant),   refer to Directors’ Report 2 These individuals have held their positions and were KMP for the whole of FY2024, unless stated otherwise. 1  Remuneration governance 118 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 121 ===== BHP has an overarching remuneration framework for Executive KMP that guides the Committee’s decisions and is designed to support our strategy and  reinforce our culture and values. 2.1 How the remuneration framework is set The four principles that underpin the remuneration framework for Executive KMP are: Market competitive   to attract, motivate   and retain high-quality   and experienced executives Reinforce BHP’s purpose   and support the delivery of our   strategy and behaviours aligned   to Our Values Rewards achievement of  outperformance that balances  long-term sustainability and   risk appetite with shareholder   wealth creation Simple and   transparent 2.2 Remuneration framework operation These principles are the same as those that apply to other employees, however, Executive KMP arrangements have a greater emphasis on and a higher  proportion of remuneration that is at-risk as performance-related variable pay. The table below shows the key components of our remuneration framework: Fixed remuneration CDP LTIP Purpose and link  to strategy Market competitive fixed remuneration is paid  to attract, motivate and retain high-quality and  experienced executives, and provide appropriate  remuneration for these important roles in the Group. The CDP is an annual cash and equity award   that encourages and focuses executives’ efforts  for the relevant financial year on the delivery  of the Group’s strategic priorities, balancing  financial and non-financial performance, to deliver  short-, medium- and long-term success aligned  to our purpose and Our Values, and to motivate  executives to strive to achieve stretch   performance objectives. The LTIP is a long-term equity award  that focuses executives’ efforts on the  achievement of sustainable long-term value  creation and success of the Group (including  appropriate management of business risks). Components Base salary, pension contributions and benefits. Cash and deferred shares. Performance rights. Approach and link to performance Competitive fixed remuneration is aligned to  global complexity, reach and scale, and reflects  executives’ responsibilities, location, skills,  performance, qualifications and experience. Annual variable pay opportunity provided in cash  and two- and five- year deferred shares with  the outcome determined by the assessment of  performance against a balanced scorecard linked  to execution of business strategy. A balanced  scorecard of short-, medium- and long-term  elements including S&S (25% weighting), financial  (50% weighting) and Group and individual  performance measures (25% weighting) are  chosen on the basis that they are expected to have  a significant short-, medium- and long-term impact  on the success of the Group, with appropriate  targets for each measure that will appropriately  motivate executives to achieve outperformance  that contributes to the long-term sustainability of  the Group and shareholder wealth creation. Annual long-term variable pay opportunity  allocated as awards of performance rights,  which are subject to a five-year relative TSR  performance condition. The performance  rights are designed to align executives’  reward with sustained shareholder wealth  creation in excess of relevant comparator  group(s), through the relative TSR  performance condition. Relative TSR has been chosen as an  appropriate measure as it enables an  objective external assessment over a  sustained period on a basis that is familiar   to shareholders. 2  Executive KMP remuneration framework 119 Operating and Financial Review Overview Additional Information Financial Statements Contents Governance  ===== PAGE 122 ===== 2.2 Remuneration framework operation continued  CDP LTIP Assessment of performance A CDP award is determined based on the assessment of each scorecard  measure by the Committee and the Board, with guidance provided by other  relevant Board Committees (including the Sustainability Committee and  Risk and Audit Committee) in respect of S&S, financial and other measures. If performance is below the threshold level for any measure, no CDP award  will be provided in respect of that portion of the CDP award opportunity. The Committee retains discretion to adjust all or part of any CDP award  in the event the Committee does not consider the outcomes to be a true  reflection of the performance of the Group or considers that individual  performance or other circumstances makes this an inappropriate outcome.  This mitigates the risk of unintended award outcomes. Vesting of the LTIP award is dependent on BHP’s TSR relative to the TSR of  relevant comparator group(s) over a five-year performance period. Achievement against each TSR hurdle is assessed by the Committee and  the Board, based on external data reviewed and confirmed by independent  remuneration consultants. BHP’s TSR performance % of the LTIP award that will vest Below the 50th percentile 0% Equal to the 50th percentile 25% Between the 50th percentile and the  weighted 80th percentile Sliding scale between 25%  and 100% Equal to or exceeds the 80th percentile  (outperformance) 100% Where the TSR performance condition is not met, there is no retesting and  awards will lapse.  The Committee retains discretion to lapse any portion or all of the award where  it considers the vesting outcome is not appropriate given Group or individual  performance, or other circumstances apply that makes the vesting outcome an  inappropriate outcome. This mitigates the risk of unintended outcomes. Delivery and vesting CDP awards are provided as cash and two awards of deferred shares, each of  equivalent value to the cash award, vesting in two and five years, respectively. Awards of deferred shares comprise rights to receive ordinary BHP shares  at the end of the deferral periods subject to continued employment with  BHP until the vesting date. Before the awards vest, these rights are not  ordinary shares and do not carry entitlements to ordinary dividends or  other shareholder rights, however, a DEP is provided on vested awards.  The Committee also has a discretion to settle CDP deferred shares in cash. Vesting of five-year deferred shares under the CDP is underpinned by a holistic  review of performance at the end of the five-year vesting period, including a  review of S&S performance, profitability, cash flow, balance sheet health, returns  to shareholders, corporate governance and conduct over the five-year period. LTIP awards consist of rights to receive ordinary BHP shares in the future if  the performance and service conditions are met. Before vesting, these rights are not ordinary shares and do not carry  entitlements to ordinary dividends or other shareholder rights, however, a  DEP is provided on vested awards. The Committee has a discretion to settle  LTIP awards in cash. Vesting of five-year performance rights under the LTIP is underpinned by  a holistic review of performance at the end of the five-year performance  period, including a review of S&S performance, profitability, cash flow,  balance sheet health, returns to shareholders, corporate governance and  conduct over the five-year period. Cessation of  employment On cessation of employment, a ‘good leaver’1 may receive a pro-rated  cash award based on performance for that year. For a ‘good leaver’, their  unvested CDP deferred awards generally remain on foot (wholly or in part)  unless the Committee determines otherwise. If the executive is not a ‘good  leaver’, all unvested CDP deferred awards will lapse. On cessation of employment, for a ‘good leaver’1 their unvested LTIP awards  generally remain on foot and are pro-rated for the portion of the vesting period  served, unless the Committee determines otherwise. These awards are eligible for  vesting in the ordinary course, subject to any applicable performance conditions.  If the executive is not a ‘good leaver’, all unvested LTIP awards will lapse. Malus and  clawback In certain circumstances, including to prevent an executive obtaining an inappropriate benefit, the Committee may determine that some or all awards  (including equity, cash and deferred share awards) are lapsed, forfeited or clawed back. The Committee may also suspend or delay vesting of awards if an  investigation is underway, until the outcome of any investigation is known. BHP also has a Malus and Clawback Policy that applies to all equity awards. 1.	 ‘Good leaver’ treatment may apply where the reason for the cessation of employment with BHP is due to retirement, retrenchment or redundancy, termination by mutual agreement or such  other circumstances that do not constitute resignation or termination for cause. 2.3 Remuneration mix The diagram below provides the scenarios for the potential total remuneration of the CEO and other Executive KMP at different levels of performance. Remuneration mix for the CEO and other Executive KMP Minimum CEO and other Executive KMP 100% Consists of fixed remuneration, which comprises base salary, pension contributions  (10 per cent of base salary) and other benefits (notional 10 per cent of base salary), the  details of which are set out in 5.1 KMP remuneration table.  Target CEO 26% 17% 17% 17% 23% Consists of fixed remuneration, target CDP (a cash award of 80 per cent of base salary  plus two awards of deferred shares each of equivalent value to the cash award, vesting in  two and five years, respectively) and LTIP. The LTIP value in the chart is based on the fair  value of the award, which is 50 per cent of the face value of 200 per cent of base salary for  the CEO and 175 per cent for other Executive KMP. The potential impact of future share  price movements is not included in the value of deferred CDP shares or LTIP awards. Other Executive KMP 27% 18% 18% 18% 19% Maximum CEO 17% 17% 17% 17% 32% Consists of fixed remuneration, maximum CDP (a cash award of 120 per cent of base  salary plus two awards of deferred shares each of equivalent value to the cash award,  vesting in two and five years respectively), and LTIP (in the chart based on the face value  of 200 per cent of base salary for the CEO and 175 per cent for other Executive KMP).  The potential impact of future share price movements is not included in the value of  deferred CDP shares or LTIP awards.   Other Executive KMP 18% 18% 18% 18% 28%     Fixed remuneration    CDP (cash)    CDP (2-year deferred shares)    CDP (5-year deferred shares)    LTIP The maximum opportunity represented above is the most that could potentially be paid for each remuneration component. It does not reflect any intention  by the Group to award that amount. 2  Executive KMP remuneration framework continued 120 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 123 ===== The amount of remuneration actually received by the CEO and other Executive KMP each year under the CDP and LTIP depends on the achievement  of business and individual performance measures. The Board and Committee applies its overarching discretion to determine fair and commensurate  remuneration that reflects the objectives of the remuneration framework and takes into account shareholder expectations and market conditions. 3.1 FY2024 remuneration received by the CEO The table below is a voluntary non-statutory disclosure of the remuneration received by the CEO during FY2024 and FY2023. This table is unaudited  and differs from the audited remuneration calculated in accordance with the Australian Accounting Standards (refer to 5.1 KMP remuneration table and  Financial Statements note 26 ‘Employee share ownership plans’). This table is designed to provide greater transparency for shareholders and reflects  actual remuneration received, with the CDP and LTIP included below representing those amounts that have been received as a consequence of satisfying  performance conditions in the relevant financial year. The difference between the disclosure in the table below and the remuneration disclosed in 5.1 KMP remuneration table relates to the CDP and LTIP.  The remuneration calculated in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards requires the fair value of the CDP and LTIP to be calculated at the time  of grant and to be amortised over the relevant vesting periods regardless of the performance outcome. This may not reflect what the executive receives.  In the table below, the CDP and LTIP values relate to the performance outcomes and actual amount received each year under the CDP (i.e. against the  CDP scorecard) and the LTIP (i.e. based on the LTIP vesting outcome). Details of the components of remuneration are contained in 2 Executive KMP remuneration framework and the values in the table are explained further in  the notes below. US$(’000) Base salary Benefits1 Pension2 CDP3 LTIP4 Total Mike Henry FY2024 1,808 35 181 3,113 3,376 8,513 FY2023 1,742 7 174 3,762 7,645 13,330 1.	 Benefits are non-pensionable and include net movements in leave balances, private health insurance, car parking, fringe benefits tax and personal tax return preparation in  required countries. 2.	 FY2024 and FY2023 pension contributions were provided based on 10 per cent of base salary. 3.	 The values shown are the full CDP value (cash and deferred shares) earned based on performance during FY2024 and FY2023. The FY2024 CDP award will be provided one-third in cash  in September 2024 and two-thirds in deferred shares, with one-third due to vest at the end of FY2026 and one-third due to vest at the end of FY2029 (on the terms of the FY2024 CDP  award). The FY2023 CDP award was provided one-third in cash in September 2023 and two-thirds in deferred shares, with one-third due to vest at the end of FY2025 and one-third due to  vest at the end of FY2028 (on the terms of the FY2023 CDP award). 4.	 The LTIP award values for FY2024 and FY2023 are based on the full awards Mike Henry received in 2019 and 2018, respectively, when he was President Operations Minerals Australia  (prior to becoming and with no proration applied for time as CEO), and 50 per cent of the 2019 awards vesting and 100 per cent of the 2018 awards vesting. The 2019 LTIP award value  in FY2024 is an estimate calculated on the average share price for the month of July 2024 (which will be updated for the actual share price on the vesting date in the 2025 Remuneration  Report); whereas the 2018 LTIP award value in FY2023 was calculated on the actual share price on the vesting date (and updated from the 2023 Remuneration Report in which the value  was an estimate calculated on the average share price for the month of July 2023). A revised remuneration framework took effect from 1 July 2019 and significantly reduced the LTIP grant size for the CEO from 400 per cent of base salary  (on a face value basis) to 200 per cent and a rebalancing to a CDP award with a long-term focus. As a result, the remuneration for Mike Henry reported  above reflects the transition to this structure and includes the full amounts of the CDP award earned during FY2024 and FY2023 (i.e. irrespective that  some elements of the CDP award are deferred) together with the full amounts of pre-existing LTIP awards vesting at the end of FY2024 and the pre- existing LTIP awards vesting at the end of FY2023 that were granted in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The LTIP award sizes granted in 2019 and 2018 were  double the current grant size.  Had the current remuneration framework been in place when Mike’s 2019 and 2018 LTIP awards were granted and a reduced size awarded, the reported  LTIP values would have been US$1.688 million for FY2024 and US$3.827 million for FY2023 (instead of US$3.376 million and US$7.645 million in the  table above). The reported total remuneration would have therefore been US$6.825 million for FY2024 and US$9.512 million for FY2023 (instead of  US$8.513 million and US$13.330 million in the table above). 3.2 FY2024 CDP performance outcomes The Board and the Committee assessed the Executive KMP’s CDP outcomes in light of the Group’s performance in FY2024 and took into account  performance against the measures in each Executive KMP’s CDP scorecard.  For the CEO, the Board's and the Committee's assessment against the CDP scorecard measures resulted in a CDP outcome for FY2024 at 76 per cent  against the target of 100 per cent (or 51 per cent against maximum). As noted in the Chair letter, BHP has self-reported certain payroll issues to the FWO  and is reviewing its payroll systems. The Board has determined that the CEO’s FY2024 CDP outcome will include a 4.3 percentage point reduction from  76 per cent to 71.7 per cent to reflect his ultimate accountability for BHP’s payroll systems. The CEO’s final CDP scorecard outcome for FY2024 is summarised in the following tables, including a narrative description of each performance  measure and the CEO’s level of achievement, as determined by the Committee and approved by the Board. The level of performance for each measure is  determined based on a range of threshold (the minimum necessary to qualify for any reward outcome), target (where the performance requirements are  met) and maximum (where the performance requirements are significantly exceeded).

As it has done for several years, when assessing S&S  performance against the scorecard targets, the Committee seeks guidance from the Sustainability Committee. The Committee has taken a holistic view  of Group performance in critical areas, including considering any additional matters outside the scorecard targets that the Sustainability Committee has  provided and considers relevant.  The performance commentary below is provided against the significant HSEC events (including fatalities) scorecard targets, which were set on the basis  of operated assets only. Significant HSEC events Measure outcome 	 Zero Scorecard targets No significant (actual level 4) health,  safety (including fatalities), environment or  community events during the year. Performance against scorecard targets 	 – In what is clearly a tragic and unacceptable outcome, we lost a colleague in January 2024 at our Saraji coal  mine, which is part of our BHP Mitsubishi Alliance coal operations in Queensland, Australia. Our imperative is to  continue to build our focus on fatality elimination and safety through field leadership, hazard identification and  effective risk management.  	 – The weighting of fatalities is 10 percentage points of the total 25 percentage points allocated to the whole S&S  category. This results in a zero outcome for this measure. 	 – No other significant health, environment or community incidents occurred during FY2024. The performance commentary below is provided against the sustainability scorecard targets, which were set on the basis of operated assets only. Climate change Measure outcome 	 Slightly below target Scorecard targets Reported Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions  at our operated assets in FY2024 are at  10.8 MtCO2-e. Deliver the FY2024 actions in the approved  climate adaptation work program. Performance against scorecard targets 	 – For FY2024, we bettered our operational GHG emissions scorecard target of 10.8 MtCO2-e by 4%, with an  outcome of 10.3 MtCO2-e.1 This was just below the performance which was required for a maximum outcome  of 5% or more below the target. However, having reviewed actual production levels at certain operated assets  compared to budget targets, the outcome for this measure was determined by the Committee to be slightly  below target. 	 – All actions required in the approved climate adaptation work program were delivered during FY2024. Indigenous partnerships Measure outcome 	 Slightly above target Scorecard targets No significant (actual level 4) cultural  heritage events during the year. Achieve significant uplift from FY2023  total global spend on Indigenous,  Traditional Owner and First Nations  vendor procurement and achieve  FY2024 Indigenous employment  participation targets. Performance against scorecard targets 	 – No significant cultural heritage incidents occurred during FY2024. 	 – Indigenous, Traditional Owner and First Nations vendor procurement significantly exceeded targets set with  US$609 million in Indigenous procurement spend in FY2024 (an 83% uplift from FY2023). Our overall FY2024  Indigenous employment participation was slightly behind target. 1.	 The operational GHG emissions outcome is different from our reported figures in 6.9 Climate change and our CTAP 2024. This is primarily due to annualisation (over 366 days) of  production and GHG emissions for Blackwater and Daunia to reflect the FY2024 scorecard methodology. The overall outcome against the total S&S measures for FY2024 was 15 per cent out of the target of 25 per cent, with a zero outcome against a target of  10 per cent for the significant HSEC events measure and an outcome of 15 per cent against a target of 15 per cent for sustainability measures. Financial ROCE is underlying profit after taxation (excluding after-taxation finance costs and exceptional items) divided by average capital employed. ROCE is the  key financial measure against which CDP outcomes for our senior executives are measured and is, in our view, a relevant measure to assess the financial  performance of the Group for this purpose. While ROCE excludes exceptional items, the Committee reviews each exceptional item to assess if it should  be included in the result when determining the ROCE CDP outcome. When assessing management’s performance, we make adjustments to the ROCE result to allow for changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange  movements and other material items (from the levels assumed in setting the targets). This ensures the assessment appropriately measures outcomes that  are within the control and influence of the Group and its executives. Of these adjustments, changes in commodity prices have historically been the most  material due to volatility in prices and the impact on Group revenue and ROCE. As it has done for several years, the Committee seeks guidance each  year from the Risk and Audit Committee when assessing financial performance against scorecard targets. 3 Remuneration for the CEO and other Executive KMP continued 122 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 125 ===== ROCE Measure outcome 	 Below target Scorecard targets For FY2024, the target for ROCE was 20.1%, with a threshold of  17.1% and a maximum of 22.6%. Achievement of the ROCE target will result in a target CDP  outcome. The ROCE target considers the upside opportunities  and downside risks inherent in BHP’s businesses, and is an  outcome the Committee believes would be a level of performance  that shareholders would view positively. The maximum and  threshold are an appropriate range of ROCE outcomes, given  the upside opportunities and downside risks, which represent an  upper limit of stretch outperformance that would represent the  maximum CDP award, and a lower limit of underperformance  below which no CDP award should be made.  The performance range around target is subject to a greater level  of downside risk than there is upside opportunity, mainly due  to physical and regulatory asset constraints. Accordingly, the  range between threshold and target is somewhat greater than  that between target and maximum. For maximum, the Committee  takes care not to create leveraged incentives that encourage  executives to push for short-term performance that goes beyond  our risk appetite and current operational capacity.  Performance against scorecard targets ROCE of 27.2% was reported by BHP for FY2024. Adjusted for the factors outlined below,  ROCE is 18.5%, which is below target. The following adjustments were made to ensure the  outcomes appropriately reflect the performance of management for the year:  	 – The full elimination of the impacts of movements in commodities prices and exchange rates  decreased ROCE by 7.7 percentage points. 	 – Adjustments for other material items made to ensure the outcomes reflect the performance  of management for the year decreased ROCE by 1 percentage point. This was mainly due  to the elimination of the positive effect on reported ROCE outcomes of lower asset values in  the closing balance sheet due to the disposals of the Daunia and Blackwater mines in late  FY2024. This adjustment was necessary to ensure the basis of the ROCE outcome for CDP  purposes was the same as the basis upon which the ROCE target for FY2024 was set.   	 – Having reviewed the FY2024 exceptional items (as described in Financial Statements note  3 ‘Exceptional items’), the Committee determined these should not be considered for the  purposes of determining the FY2024 ROCE CDP outcome and that no further action was  required in respect of exceptional items. The key driver of the FY2024 ROCE outcome of 18.5% being below the target for  FY2024 of 20.1% set at the commencement of the year was that actual production  volumes at several assets during FY2024 were lower than the internal budgets set at the  commencement of the year. The outcome against the ROCE measure for FY2024 was 37 per cent out of the target of 50 per cent. Group measures for the CEO Group measures for the CEO are determined at the start of the financial year and are an important element of effective performance management.  These measures seek to balance financial and non-financial performance requirements and incentivise a high-performance culture. The CEO’s group  measures for FY2024 included contribution to BHP’s overall performance and the management team, and the delivery of key projects and initiatives, as  set out in the table below. People Measure outcome 	 Slightly below target Scorecard targets Increase in female leadership representation by 3  percentage points. Accelerate cultural change by launching refreshed  BHP values, implementing a refreshed performance  management framework and delivery of Operating  Model changes. Progress ELT succession and development activities. Performance against scorecard targets 	 – Female leadership increased in FY2024 by 2 percentage points to 31.7% at 30 June 2024,  compared to 29.7% at 30 June 2023. 	 – Refreshed Our Values were designed and launched, a refreshed performance management  framework is being implemented, and the Operating Model was reviewed, and changes completed. 	 – Succession and development activities completed in accordance with expectations. Performance Measure outcome 	 Slightly below target Scorecard targets Asset operational sites to complete formal BHP  Operating System (BOS) deployment in FY2024 (>90%  schedule adherence throughout). 90% of Sites in  Sustain to demonstrate Assessment on Assessment  improvement in Operational Excellence Indicator (OEI)  scores.

Finalise the development of the CTAP 2024. Implement our Reconciliation Action Plan commitments  in Australia. Performance against scorecard targets 	 – 94% of asset operational sites completed formal BOS deployment in FY2024 (against the target of  >90%). There has been an improvement in OEI scores Assessment on Assessment for 64% of all  Sites in Sustain (against the target of >90%). 	 – Significant progress has been made on the Renova priority programs with 91% of resettlement  cases now completed. Compensation and financial assistance to support approximately 430,000  people affected by the dam failure has been paid as at 30 June 2024. Samarco successfully  concluded its Judicial Reorganisation process with the approval by the courts. The CNJ negotiations  are progressing and judicial proceedings in connection with the dam failure are ongoing. 	 – The CTAP 2024 has progressed according to plan, being approved by the Board and published as  part of the FY2024 Annual Reporting suite of documents. 	 – All FY2024 Reconciliation Action Plan commitments in Australia were achieved, including developing  and embedding an integrated planning, tracking and reporting approach, which is driving accountability  and transparency and has been recognised by Reconciliation Australia as best practice. We have made  progress on Indigenous procurement spend and employment participation, and listening sessions have  been held as part of the Cultural Safety Review and priority improvement identified and underway. Portfolio Measure outcome 	 On target Scorecard targets As agreed by the Board, execute against the strategy  and plan with respect to OZ Minerals integration and  other portfolio activities. Investments in early-stage growth options. Performance against scorecard targets 	 – The OZ Minerals integration program was successfully completed at the end of March 2024. The sale of  the Daunia and Blackwater coal mines to Whitehaven Coal was successfully completed in April 2024. 	 – A number of growth options were progressed, evaluated and approved, and progress was made  with an early-stage investment in FY2024, which provides future growth optionality. Overall, the performance of the CEO against the group measures for FY2024 was assessed as slightly below expectations and warranted an outcome of  24 per cent against the target of 25 per cent. The CDP performance measures for other Executive KMP for FY2024 are similar to those of the CEO outlined above. However, for the other Executive  KMP, the weighting of each performance measure will vary to reflect the focus required from each Executive KMP role. As with the CEO, individual  performance measures are determined at the start of the financial year. These include the other Executive KMP’s contribution to the delivery of projects  and initiatives within the scope of their role and the overall performance of the Group. Individual performance of other Executive KMP was reviewed  against these measures by the Committee and, on average, were considered to have marginally exceeded expectations and warranted an outcome  slightly above target. 123 Operating and Financial Review Overview Additional Information Financial Statements Contents Governance  ===== PAGE 126 ===== 3.2 FY2024 CDP performance outcomes continued The diagram below represents the FY2024 CDP weightings and outcomes against the original scorecard for other Executive KMP.

Vesting is subject to the achievement  of the relative TSR performance conditions and any discretion applied by the Committee (refer to 3.4 Overarching discretion and vesting underpin). For the 2019 LTIP award to vest in full, BHP’s TSR over the performance period from 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2024 must have been at or exceeded the  80th percentile of the Sector Group TSR and the MSCI World Index TSR (World TSR). TSR includes returns to BHP shareholders in the form of share  price movements along with dividends paid and reinvested in BHP (including cash and in-specie dividends). BHP’s TSR performance was positive 92 per cent over the five-year period from 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2024. This is above the 50th percentile of the  Sector Group TSR of positive 86 per cent but below the 80th percentile of the Sector Group TSR of positive 113 per cent, and above the 50th percentile  of the World TSR of positive 58 per cent but below the 80th percentile of the World TSR of positive 117 per cent over the same period. This level of  performance results in 50 per cent vesting for the 2019 LTIP award. The value of the CEO’s vested 2019 LTIP award has been reported in 3.1 FY2024  remuneration received by the CEO. The graph below shows BHP’s performance relative to comparator groups. BHP vs. Sector Group and MSCI World TSR over 2019 LTIP cycle TSR since 1 July 2019 (%) Jun-2019 Jun-2020 Jun-2021 Jun-2022 Jun-2023 Jun-2024 BHP TSR Sector Group 50th percentile TSR Sector Group 80th percentile TSR World (MSCI) 50th percentile TSR World (MSCI) 80th percentile TSR 250%  200% 150%  100%  50%  0    The value of the vested 2019 LTIP award is higher than the value of the vested award at the time it was granted in 2019. The share price has risen  appreciably during the five-year period and there have been strong dividends. Of the value realised, 57 per cent is due to the value at the time the awards  were granted and 43 per cent is due to share price appreciation and dividends. This value increment due to share price appreciation and dividends is  consistent with the experience of shareholders over the period. 3.4 Overarching discretion and vesting underpin The rules of the CDP and LTIP and the terms and conditions of the awards provide the Committee with an overarching discretion to reduce the number of  awards that will vest, notwithstanding that the performance conditions or the relevant service conditions have been met. This overarching discretion is a holistic, qualitative judgement ('look back') and is applied as an underpin test before final vesting is confirmed. It is an  important risk management tool to ensure vesting is not simply driven by a formula or the passage of time that may give unexpected or unintended  remuneration outcomes.  The Committee considers its discretion carefully each year ahead of the scheduled vesting of CDP and LTIP equity awards in August. For the five-year  CDP deferred awards, it considers performance holistically over the five-year period, including a five-year ‘look back’ on S&S performance, profitability,  cash flow, balance sheet health, returns to shareholders, corporate governance and conduct. For the five years from FY2020 to FY2024, the Committee  noted BHP’s continued progress in S&S outcomes (noting, however, the two fatalities in FY2023 and one in FY2024 have been taken into account in  determining CDP outcomes for those years), strong operational performance with improving production and cost performance, and significant returns  to shareholders.  In respect of the vesting of CDP two-year deferred shares (granted in November 2022 in respect of performance in FY2022), the Committee did not  identify any reason to exercise its downwards discretion.  3 Remuneration for the CEO and other Executive KMP continued 124 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 127 ===== In respect of the vesting of the 2019 LTIP five-year performance rights, the formulaic outcome of the 2019 LTIP was 50 per cent vesting.  Having undertaken the ‘look back’ review described above, the Committee concluded the vesting outcome was appropriate given Group and individual  performance, and that no reasons were identified to warrant the exercise of its downwards discretion. There is no upwards discretion available to the  Committee in respect of the 2019 LTIP and the overarching discretion may only reduce the number of awards that may vest.  In FY2023 BHP identified and disclosed two issues with certain allowances and entitlements affecting some current and former employees in Australia.  We self-reported these issues to the FWO and engaged Protiviti, a global assurance firm, to undertake a review of our payroll systems. In August 2023,  ELT members had a negative 3 percentage point impact on the FY2023 CDP outcomes due to the costs of remediating the two employee entitlements  and allowances issues. We also confirmed that we would monitor the outcome of the review and engagement with the regulatory authorities and that this  may impact remuneration outcomes in the future. The Board and CEO have taken these issues seriously. A range of consequences have been implemented for employees in relation to these matters.  In relation to remuneration outcomes, this year the Board has determined that the CEO’s FY2024 CDP outcome will include a 4.3 percentage point  reduction to reflect his ultimate accountability for BHP’s payroll systems. This CDP reduction for the CEO in FY2024 is US$185,000 and is equivalent to  25 per cent of the CEO’s target annual short term incentive pro-rated for the portion of the relevant period that he was CEO. For others with accountability  for BHP’s payroll issues (including current and prior ELT members) there have been reductions determined in variable remuneration outcomes ranging  between 25 per cent to 100 per cent of relevant annual target variable pay. Accountability has been determined based on a number of factors, including  tenure in relevant roles. 3.5 LTIP allocated during FY2024 Following shareholder approval at the 2023 AGM, 125,124 LTIP awards (in the form of performance rights) were granted to the CEO on 8 November  2023. The face value of the CEO’s award was 200 per cent of his base salary of US$1.820 million at the time of grant. The fair value of the awards were  calculated by multiplying the face value of the award by the fair value factor of 41 per cent at the time (as determined by the independent adviser to the  Committee). The 125,124 LTIP awards for the CEO was determined based on the US$ face value of the LTIP awards of US$3.640 million and calculated  using the average share price and US$/A$ exchange rate over the 12 months up to and including 30 June 2023. LTIP awards granted to other Executive  KMP during FY2024 were determined on the same basis as described above for the CEO, except that awards for other Executive KMP had a face value  of 175 per cent of base salary. In addition to the LTIP terms set out in 2 Executive KMP remuneration framework, the Committee determined the following terms for the 2023 LTIP: Performance period 	 – 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2028 Performance conditions 	 – Vesting is conditional on two relative TSR performance measures. 	 – An averaging period of six months will be used in the TSR calculations. 	 – BHP’s TSR relative to the median TSR of the MSCI World Metals and Mining Index (Sector Group TSR) and the MSCI World  Index (World TSR) will determine the vesting of 67% and 33% of the award, respectively. 	 – For each portion of the award to vest in full, BHP’s TSR must be at or exceed the 80th percentile of the Sector Group TSR  or the World TSR (as applicable). Threshold vesting (25% of each portion of the award) occurs where BHP’s TSR equals the  50th percentile (i.e. the median) of the Sector Group TSR or the World TSR (as applicable). Vesting occurs on a sliding scale  between the 50th and 80th percentiles. 3.6 FY2025 remuneration for the CEO and other Executive KMP The remuneration for the CEO and other Executive KMP in FY2025 will be in accordance with the remuneration framework operation and the main  elements are set out in the table below. Base salary CDP LTIP Base salaries are reviewed and benchmarked  annually against external market demand for senior  executive talent to ensure they remain competitive.  Following the review, if the Board and Committee  assess and determine a base salary increase  should apply to the CEO and/or other Executive  KMP, the increase will be applicable from 1  September. For FY2025, the Committee determined that the  CEO’s base salary would increase by 4%, effective  1 September 2024, to US$1.893 million. The  Committee has also reviewed the base salaries  and total target remuneration packages for other  Executive KMP. The Committee determined an  increase of 8% for the President Australia, reflecting  performance and development in role. Given recent  appointments, no other changes are being made for  other Executive KMP at this time, and this will be  the subject of future reviews.  The Board and the Committee set the CDP  scorecard performance categories and measures  each year. For FY2025, the balanced scorecard includes S&S  measures (25% weighting) such as elimination of  significant harm (including safety), climate change  and Indigenous partnerships, a ROCE financial  measure (50% weighting), and Group and individual  measures (25% weighting) relating to projects  and initiatives in respect of people, performance  and portfolio. The specific Group and individual  performance measures vary for Executive KMP  to reflect the focus required from each of them in  their role. Notably, certain S&S, Group and individual  measures have a long-term focus where they are  set with a view to achieving longer-term ambitions.  For example, annual GHG emission reduction  targets reflect the ultimate achievement of BHP’s  medium-term target of at least a 30% reduction in  operational GHG emissions from FY2020 levels  by FY2030, however, progress towards this is not  expected to be linear. As a consequence, vesting  of five-year deferred shares under the CDP is  underpinned by a holistic review of performance at  the end of the five-year vesting period, allowing for  performance against the longer-term ambitions to  be considered. The LTIP award to be granted to the CEO in FY2025  has a maximum face value of US$3.786 million,  being 200% of the CEO’s base salary at the time of  grant. The number of LTIP awards expected to be  granted to the CEO in FY2025 is 127,848 and has  been determined using the share price and US$/A$  exchange rate over the 12 months up to and including  30 June 2024. The granting of this LTIP award is  subject to the approval of shareholders at the 2024  AGM. If approved, the award will be granted following  the AGM (i.e. in or around November 2024, subject  to securities dealing considerations). The LTIP award  granted in FY2025 will use the same performance  and service conditions as the LTIP award granted in  FY2024. LTIP awards granted to other Executive KMP during  FY2025 will be calculated on the same basis as  described above for the CEO, except that awards for  other Executive KMP will have a maximum face value  of 175% of salary.  125 Operating and Financial Review Overview Additional Information Financial Statements Contents Governance  ===== PAGE 128 ===== Our remuneration framework for Non-executive Directors aligns with the Australian Securities Exchange Corporate Governance Council’s Principles and  Recommendations (4th Edition). Non-executive Directors do not have any performance-based at-risk remuneration or receive any equity awards as part of  their remuneration, therefore the totals shown below are total remuneration and total fixed fees. The maximum aggregate fees payable to Non‑executive  Directors (including the Group Chair) were approved by shareholders at the 2008 AGMs at US$3.800 million per annum. This sum includes base fees,  Committee fees and pension contributions. Travel allowances and non-monetary benefits are not included in this limit. 4.1 Remuneration framework of Non-executive Directors The following table shows the components for Non-executive Directors’ remuneration. Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any CDP  or LTIP awards. Descriptions Purpose and link  to strategy Competitive fees and benefits are paid to Non-executive Directors in order to attract and retain high-quality individuals, and to provide  appropriate remuneration for the role undertaken. Fees The Group Chair is paid a single fee for all responsibilities. All other Non-executive Directors are paid a base fee and relevant Committee  membership fees. Committee Chairs and the Senior Independent Director are paid an additional fee to reflect their extra responsibilities.  All fee levels are reviewed annually and any changes are ordinarily effective from 1 July. Annual reviews take into account global  benchmarking and advice provided by external advisers, as required.  Fee levels reflect the size and complexity of the Group and the geographies where the Group operates. The economic environment and  the financial performance of the Group are taken into account. Consideration is also given to salary reviews across the rest of the Group. Where the payment of pension contributions is required by law, these contributions are deducted from the Director’s overall fee entitlements. Benefits BHP is a global organisation and there is a considerable travel burden required of Non-executive Directors to travel to Board meetings  and site visits. Travel allowances are paid on a per trip basis. As a consequence of our prior dual listed company structure, Non-executive Directors are required to prepare personal tax returns in  Australia and the UK, regardless of whether they reside in one or neither of those countries. They are accordingly reimbursed for the  costs of personal tax return preparation in whichever of the UK and/or Australia is not their place of residence (including payment of the  tax cost associated with the provision of the benefit). Letters of appointment The Board has adopted a letter of appointment that contains the terms on which Non-executive Directors will be appointed, including the basis upon  which they will be indemnified by the Group. The Board has adopted a policy under which all Non-executive Directors must seek re-election at the AGM  each year. As a result of requiring re-election each year, Non-executive Directors do not have a fixed term in their letter of appointment. Payments on early termination or loss of office There are no provisions in any of the Non-executive Directors’ appointment arrangements for compensation payable on early termination of their  directorship. A Non-executive Director may resign on reasonable notice. No payments are made to Non-executive Directors on loss of office. 4.2 Non-executive Directors’ remuneration in FY2024 and FY2025 The remuneration for the Non-executive Directors was paid in FY2024 and will be paid in FY2025 in accordance with the remuneration framework set out  above. Fee levels for the Group Chair and the Non-executive Directors are reviewed annually and are benchmarked against peer companies of similar  complexity, reach and scale with the assistance of external advisers (but not by the Committee-appointed independent remuneration adviser). Following an assessment of the updated benchmarking, global market positioning and peer company relativities, a decision has been made that the  Group Chair's fee and the Non-executive Directors' base fee will increase by 4 per cent with effect from 1 July 2024. The increases are considered  appropriate given current benchmarking and the expectations, accountabilities and workloads of each of the Group Chair and Non-executive Directors.  Having conducted this review, it was determined that there would be no change to the fees for other Committee roles or other allowances. The below table sets out the annualised total remuneration and total fixed fees for FY2024 and FY2025 (including the increases from 1 July 2024). Levels of fees and travel allowances for Non-executive Directors (in US$) FY2024 FY2025 Base annual fee 168,000 175,000 Plus additional fees for: Senior Independent Director 53,000 53,000 Committee Chair: Risk and Audit People and Remuneration Sustainability Nomination and Governance 66,000 45,000 45,000 No additional fee 66,000 45,000 45,000 No additional fee Committee membership: Risk and Audit People and Remuneration Sustainability Nomination and Governance 32,500 27,500 27,500 18,000 32,500 27,500 27,500 18,000 Travel allowance:1 In excess of 3 hours and less than 10 hours 10 hours or more 7,000 15,000 7,000 15,000 Group Chair’s fee2 925,000 962,000 1.	 In relation to travel for Board and shareholder meetings, the time thresholds relate to a flight time in excess of three hours to travel to the meeting location (i.e. one-way flight time). Only  one travel allowance is paid per round trip. 2.	 The Group Chair is paid a single fee for all responsibilities (i.e. no base annual fee or Committee fees). 4  Remuneration for Non-executive Directors 126 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 129 ===== 5.1 KMP remuneration table The table below has been prepared in accordance with relevant accounting standards.

Annual cash incentive in this table is the cash portion of CDP awards each Executive KMP earned in respect of performance during each financial year. CDP is provided one-third in cash  and two-thirds in deferred shares (which are included in the share-based payments columns of the table). The cash portion of CDP awards is paid in September of the year following the  relevant financial year. The minimum possible value awarded to each individual is nil, the target is 240 per cent of base salary (80 per cent in cash and 160 per cent in deferred shares) and  the maximum is 360 per cent of base salary (120 per cent in cash and 240 per cent in deferred shares).

Each equity award is a right to acquire  one ordinary share in BHP Group Limited upon satisfaction of the vesting conditions. Our mandatory minimum performance requirements for securities  dealing governs and restricts dealing arrangements and the provision of shares on vesting or exercise of awards. No interests under the Group’s  employee equity plans are held by related parties of Executive KMP. Approval from BHP’s shareholders for the issue of equity awards to the CEO under the CDP and LTIP was obtained under ASX Listing Rule 10.14 at the  2023 AGM. DEP applies to awards provided to Executive KMP under the CDP and LTIP as detailed in 2 Executive KMP remuneration framework. No DEP is  generally payable on MAP awards previously provided to Executive KMP. Executive KMP received or will receive awards under the CDP and LTIP. The terms and conditions of CDP and LTIP awards, including the performance  conditions, are described in 2 Executive KMP remuneration framework.

Where the vesting date is not yet known, the estimated vesting month is shown. Where awards lapsed (if any), the lapse date is shown. If the vesting conditions are met, awards will vest on  or as soon as practicable after the first non-prohibited period date occurring after 30 June of the preceding year, subject to the terms of the award. The year of vesting is the second (CDP  two-year deferred share awards), third (MAP), fourth (MAP) or fifth (MAP, CDP five-year deferred share awards and LTIP) financial year after grant. All awards are conditional awards  and have no exercise period or exercise price; instead, ordinary fully paid shares are automatically allocated upon vesting (subject to a discretion to provide cash in lieu). Where vesting  conditions are not met, the conditional awards will immediately lapse. 2.	 The market price shown is the closing price of BHP shares on the relevant date of grant. No price is payable by the individual to receive a grant of awards. The IFRS fair value of the CDP  and LTIP awards granted in FY2024 at the grant date of 8 November 2023 are as follows: CDP – A$45.95 and LTIP – A$30.33.  3.	 The market price shown is the closing price of BHP shares on the relevant date of vest. 4.	 The gain on awards is calculated using the market price on date of vesting or exercise (as applicable) less any exercise price payable. The amounts that vested for the awards during  FY2024 are as follows: CDP – 100 per cent vested; LTIP – 100 per cent vested; MAP – 100 per cent vested. 5.	 Awards shown as held by Edgar Basto, David Lamont and Ragnar Udd at 30 June 2024 are their balances at the date they ceased being KMP, being 29 February 2024. 6.	 The opening balances of awards for Brandon Craig and Vandita Pant reflect their holdings on the date that each became KMP, being 1 March 2024. 129 Operating and Financial Review Overview Additional Information Financial Statements Contents Governance  ===== PAGE 132 ===== 5.3 Estimated value range of equity awards The current face value (and estimate of the maximum possible total value) of equity awards allocated during FY2024 and yet to vest are the awards as  set out in the previous table multiplied by the current share price of BHP Group Limited. The minimum possible total value of the awards is nil. The actual  value that may be received by participants in the future cannot be determined as it is dependent on and therefore fluctuates with the share price of BHP  Group Limited at the date that any particular award vests or is exercised. Five-year share price, dividend and earnings history The table below provides the five-year share price history for BHP Group Limited, history of dividends paid and the Group’s earnings.  FY2024 FY2023 FY2022 FY2021 FY2020 Share price at beginning of year (A$) 45.26 40.05 48.22 35.82 41.68 Share price at end of year (A$) 42.68 44.99 41.25 48.57 35.82 Dividends paid (A$) 2.35 3.92 10.181 2.07 2.13 Attributable profit (US$ million, as reported) 7,897 12,921 30,900 11,304 7,956 1 The FY2022 dividends paid includes A$5.38 in respect of the in-specie dividend associated with the merger of the Petroleum business with Woodside. The highest and lowest closing share price during FY2024 were A$50.72 and A$41.95, respectively. 5.4 Ordinary shareholdings and transactions The number of ordinary shares in BHP Group Limited held directly, indirectly or beneficially by each individual (including shares held in the name of all  close members of the Director’s or Executive KMP’s family and entities over which either the Director or Executive KMP or the family member has directly  or indirectly, control, joint control or significant influence) is shown below. No shares are held nominally by any KMP or their related parties. These are  ordinary shares held without performance conditions or restrictions and are included in MSR calculations for each individual.

The opening balances for Don Lindsay and Ross McEwan reflect their shareholdings on the date they became Non-executive Directors being 1 May 2024 and 3 April 2024, respectively. 5 Statutory KMP remuneration and other disclosures continued 130 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 133 ===== 5.5 Prohibition on hedging of BHP shares and  equity instruments The Executive KMP may not use unvested BHP equity awards as collateral  or hedge the value of any unvested BHP equity awards or the value of  shares and securities held as part of meeting the MSR. Any securities that have vested and are no longer subject to restrictions,  or not held as part of meeting the MSR, may be subject to hedging  arrangements or used as collateral, provided that prior consent is obtained. 5.6 Share ownership guidelines and the MSR The share ownership guidelines and the MSR help to ensure the interests  of Directors, executives and shareholders remain aligned. The CEO and other Executive KMP are expected to grow their holdings to  the MSR from the scheduled vesting of their employee awards over time.  The MSR is tested at the time that shares are to be sold. Shares may be  sold to satisfy tax obligations arising from the granting, holding, vesting,  exercise or sale of the employee awards or the underlying shares whether  the MSR is satisfied at that time or not. For FY2024: 	 – The MSR for the CEO was five times annual pre-tax base salary. At the  end of FY2024, the CEO met the MSR. 	 – The MSR for other Executive KMP was three times annual pre-tax  base salary. At the end of FY2024, the other Executive KMP met the  MSR except for Brandon Craig, as he was appointed to the ELT and as  Executive KMP on 1 March 2024. 	 – No Executive KMP sold or purchased shares during FY2024, other than  sales to satisfy taxation obligations, except for Mike Henry, who sold  shares due to marital divorce, including reorganisation of holdings, and  Ragnar Udd, who sold shares in order to partially fund the purchase of a  residential dwelling. A two-year post-retirement shareholding requirement for the CEO applies  from the date of retirement, which will be the lower of the CEO’s MSR or  the CEO’s actual shareholding at the date of retirement. Subject to securities dealing constraints, Non-executive Directors have  agreed to apply at least 25 per cent of their remuneration (base fees plus  Committee fees) to the purchase of BHP shares until they achieve an MSR  equivalent in value to one year of remuneration (base fees plus Committee  fees). Thereafter, they must maintain at least that level of shareholding  throughout their tenure. At the end of FY2024, each Non-executive Director  met the MSR except for Don Lindsay and Ross McEwan, as they joined the  Board on 1 May 2024 and 3 April 2024, respectively. 5.7 Transactions with KMP During the financial year, there were no transactions between the  Group and its subsidiaries and KMP (including their related parties)  (2023: US$ nil; 2022: US$ nil). There were no amounts payable by or loans  with KMP (including their related parties) at 30 June 2024 (2023: US$ nil;  2022: US$ nil). A number of KMP hold or have held positions in other companies  (i.e. personally related entities) where it is considered they control or  significantly influence the financial or operating policies of those entities.  There have been no transactions with those entities and no amounts  were owed by the Group to personally related entities or any other related  parties (2023: US$ nil; 2022: US$ nil). This Remuneration Report was approved by the Board on 27 August 2024  and signed on its behalf by: Christine O’Reilly  Chair, People and Remuneration Committee 27 August 2024 131 Operating and

Financial Statements.   1 Consolidated Financial Statements continued 136 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 139 ===== Basis of preparation The Consolidated Financial Statements (Financial Statements) comprise  BHP Group Limited (BHP or the Company) together with its controlled  entities (Group) for the year ended 30 June 2024. BHP Group Limited,  incorporated and domiciled in Australia, is a for-profit company limited by  shares which are publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange.  BHP Group Limited also has an international secondary listing on the  London Stock Exchange (LSE), a secondary listing on the Johannesburg  Stock Exchange and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in  the United States. Prior to 31 January 2022, BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc, an  incorporated UK-listed company, operated together as a single-for-profit  economic entity under a Dual Listed Company (DLC) structure comprising  a common Board of Directors, unified management structure and joint  objectives. On 31 January 2022, BHP unified its corporate structure under  BHP Group Limited.  Directors of BHP have included information in the Financial Statements  they deem to be material and relevant to the understanding of the  Financial Statements. Disclosure may be considered material and relevant  if the dollar amount is significant due to its size or nature, or the information  is important to understand the:  	 – Group’s current year results 	 – impact of significant changes in the Group’s business or  	 – aspects of the Group’s operations that are important to  future performance  The Board of Directors resolved to authorise the issue of the financial  report on 27 August 2024. Basis of preparation and measurement The Group’s Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 30 June 2024: 	 – are a consolidated general purpose financial report 	 – have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of: 	 – the Australian Corporations Act 2001 (Corporations Act 2001) 	 – Australian Accounting Standards and other authoritative  pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board  (AASB) and International Financial Reporting Standards as  issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)  (collectively referred to as IFRS) 	 –  are prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors: 	 – have made an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a  going concern for the 12 months from the date of this report  	 – consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting  in preparing the Group’s Financial Statements 	 – measure items on the basis of historical cost principles, except for the  following items: 	 – derivative financial instruments and certain other financial assets and  liabilities, which are carried at fair value  	 – non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as  held-for-sale or held-for-distribution, which are measured at the lower  of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell 	 – include material accounting policies in the notes to the Financial  Statements, specifically where accounting policy choices have been  made in relation to the recognition and measurement basis used and  are relevant to an understanding of the Financial Statements 	 – apply a presentation currency of US dollars, consistent with the  predominant functional currency of the Group’s operations. Amounts are  rounded to the nearest million dollars, unless otherwise stated, in  accordance with ASIC (Rounding in Financial/Directors’ Reports)  Instrument 2016/191  	 – present reclassified comparative information where required for  consistency with the current year’s presentation 	 – adopt all new and amended standards and interpretations under IFRS  that are mandatory for application in periods beginning on 1 July 2023.  None had a significant impact on the Financial Statements. Refer note  39 ‘New and amended accounting standards and interpretations and  changes to accounting policies’ for details  	 – have not early adopted any standards and interpretations that have been  issued or amended but are not yet effective, other than as outlined in  note 39 ‘New and amended accounting standards and interpretations  and changes to accounting policies’ The accounting policies are consistently applied by all entities included  in the Financial Statements. In assessing the appropriateness of the going concern assumption  over the going concern period, management has stress tested BHP’s  most recent financial projections to incorporate a range of potential  future outcomes by considering BHP’s principal risks. The Group’s  financial forecasts, including downside commodity price and production  scenarios, demonstrate that the Group believes that it has sufficient  financial resources to meet its obligations as they fall due throughout the  going concern period. As such, the Financial Statements continue to be  prepared on the going concern basis. Principles of consolidation A list of significant entities in the Group, including subsidiaries, joint  arrangements and associates at 30 June 2024 is contained in note 30  ‘Subsidiaries’, note 31 ‘Investments accounted for using the equity method’  and note 32 ‘Interests in joint operations’. Subsidiaries: The Financial Statements of the Group include the  consolidation of BHP Group Limited (the Company or parent entity) and  its subsidiaries, being the entities controlled by the parent entity during the  year (and prior to 31 January 2022, BHP Group Plc and its subsidiaries  while the DLC was in effect). Control exists where the Group: 	 – has power over the investee 	 – is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement  with the entity  	 – has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the  activities of the entity The ability to approve the operating and capital budget of an entity and  the ability to appoint key management personnel are decisions that  demonstrate that the Group has the existing rights to direct the relevant  activities of an entity.  The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are  included in profit or loss from the date the Company gains control until the  date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary. When the Group  loses control of a subsidiary, the gain or loss on disposal is recognised in  profit or loss. Where the Group’s interest is less than 100 per cent, the interest  attributable to outside shareholders is reflected in non-controlling interests.  Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a  loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying  amount of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are  adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries.  Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests  are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is  recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Company.  The financial information of subsidiaries is prepared for the same reporting  period as the Group. The acquisition method of accounting is used to  account for the Group’s business combinations. Joint arrangements: The Group undertakes a number of business  activities through joint arrangements, which exist when two or more  parties have joint control. Joint arrangements are classified as either  joint operations or joint ventures, based on the contractual rights and  obligations between the parties to the arrangement: 	 – Joint operations: A joint operation is an arrangement in which the Group  shares joint control, primarily via contractual arrangements with other  parties. In a joint operation, the Group has rights to the underlying  assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement.  This includes situations where the parties benefit from the joint activity  through a share of the output, rather than by receiving a share of the  results of trading. In relation to the Group’s interest in a joint operation,  the Group recognises: its assets and liabilities, including its share of  any assets and liabilities held or incurred jointly; revenue from the sale  of its share of the output and its share of any revenue generated from  the sale of the output by the joint operation; and its expenses including  its share of expenses incurred jointly. All such amounts are allocated  in accordance with the terms of the arrangement, which is usually in  proportion to the Group’s interest in the joint operation. 	 The Group accounts for the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses  relating to its interest in a joint operation in accordance with the IFRS  Standards applicable to the particular assets, liabilities, revenue  and expenses. 137 Operating and Financial Review Overview Additional Information Governance Contents Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 140 ===== 1 Consolidated Financial Statements continued 	 – Joint ventures: A joint venture is a joint arrangement in which the parties that share joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.  A separate vehicle, not the parties, will have the rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. More than an  insignificant share of output from a joint venture is sold to third parties, which indicates the joint venture is not dependent on the parties to the  arrangement for funding, nor do the parties have an obligation for the liabilities of the arrangement. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity  method as outlined below. Associates: The Group accounts for investments in associates using the equity method as outlined below. An entity is considered an associate where  the Group is deemed to have significant influence but not control or joint control. Significant influence is presumed to exist where the Group: 	 – has over 20 per cent but less than 50 per cent of the voting rights of an entity, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that this is not the case or 	 – holds less than 20 per cent of the voting rights of an entity; however, has the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions  affecting the entity The Group uses the term ‘equity accounted investments’ to refer to joint ventures and associates collectively. Under the equity method, an investment in an associate or a joint venture is recognised initially at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s  share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture. When the Group’s share of losses of an associate or a joint  venture exceeds the Group’s interest in that associate or joint venture, the Group discontinues recognising its share of further losses. Additional losses are  recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture. Foreign currencies Transactions related to the Group’s worldwide operations are conducted in a number of foreign currencies. The majority of the subsidiaries, joint  arrangements and associates within each of the operations have assessed US dollars as the functional currency. Subsidiaries, joint arrangements and  associates that have functional currencies other than US dollars are not material to the financial performance or the financial position of the Group. Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the income statement, except for qualifying cash flow hedges (which are deferred to equity) and  foreign exchange gains or losses on foreign currency provisions for site closure and rehabilitation costs (which are capitalised in property, plant and  equipment for operating sites). Significant judgements and estimates The Group’s accounting policies require the  use of judgement, estimates and assumptions.  All judgements, estimates and assumptions  are based on the most current facts and  circumstances and are reassessed on an  ongoing basis. Actual results in future reporting  periods may differ for these estimates under  different assumptions and conditions. Further information regarding the Group’s  significant judgements and key estimates and  assumptions, being those where changes  may materially affect financial results and  the carrying amount of assets and liabilities  to be reported in the next reporting period,  are embedded within the following notes: Note 4  Significant events – Samarco dam failure 6  Taxation 11 Overburden removal costs 11 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 13 Impairment of non-current assets 15 Closure and rehabilitation provisions 22 Leases 29 Business combinations Additional information including sensitivity  analysis, where appropriate, has been  provided in the relevant notes to enhance an  understanding of the impact of key estimates  and assumptions on the Group’s financial  position and performance. Reserve estimates Reserves are estimates of the amount of  product that can be demonstrated to be able  to be economically and legally extracted from  the Group’s properties. In order to estimate  reserves, assumptions are required about  a range of technical and economic factors,  including quantities, qualities, production  techniques, recovery efficiency, production  and transport costs, commodity supply and  demand, commodity and carbon prices and  exchange rates.  Estimating the quantity and/or quality of  reserves requires the size, shape and depth  of ore bodies to be determined by analysing  geological data, such as drilling samples  and geophysical survey interpretations.  Economic assumptions used to estimate  reserves change from period-to-period as  additional technical and operational data  is generated. This process may require  complex and difficult geological judgements  to interpret the data. Reserve impact on financial reporting Estimates of reserves may change from  period-to-period as the economic assumptions  used to estimate reserves change and  additional geological data is generated  during the course of operations. Changes in  reserves may affect the Group’s financial  results and financial position in a number of  ways, including: 	 – asset carrying values may be affected  due to changes in estimated future  production levels 	 – depreciation, depletion and amortisation  charged to the income statement may  change where such charges are determined  on the units of production basis, or where  the useful economic lives of assets change 	 – overburden removal costs recorded on the  balance sheet or charged to the income  statement may change due to changes in  stripping ratios or the units of production  basis of depreciation 	 – closure and rehabilitation provisions may  change where changes in estimated  reserves affect expectations about the  timing or cost of these activities 	 – the carrying amount of deferred tax assets  may change due to changes in estimates of  the likely recovery of the tax benefits 138 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 141 ===== 1.6 Notes to the Financial Statements Performance 1 Segment reporting Reportable segments The Group operated three reportable segments during FY2024, which are aligned with the commodities that are extracted and marketed and reflect the  structure used by the Group’s management to assess the performance of the Group. Reportable segment Principal activities Copper  Mining of copper, uranium, gold, zinc, molybdenum and silver Iron Ore Mining of iron ore Coal Mining of steelmaking coal and energy coal Group and unallocated items includes functions, other unallocated operations including Potash, Western Australia Nickel (which comprises the Nickel  West operations and, following the OZ Minerals Ltd (OZL) acquisition on 2 May 2023, the West Musgrave project), legacy assets and consolidation  adjustments.

Underlying EBITDA includes BHP’s share of profit/(loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method including net finance  costs, depreciation, amortisation and impairments and taxation expense/(benefit).  Exceptional items are excluded from Underlying EBITDA in order to enhance the comparability of such measures from period-to-period and provide  investors with further clarity in order to assess the performance of the Group’s operations. Management monitors exceptional items separately.  Refer to note 3 ‘Exceptional items’ for additional detail. Segment assets and liabilities Total segment assets and liabilities of reportable segments represents operating assets and operating liabilities, including the carrying amount of  equity accounted investments and predominantly excludes cash balances, loans to associates, interest bearing liabilities and deferred tax balances.

Revenue consists of revenue from contracts with customers of US$55,375 million (2023: US$53,910 million; 2022: US$65,504 million) and other revenue  predominantly relating to provisionally priced sales of US$283 million (2023: US$(93) million; 2022: US$(406) million). Recognition and measurement The Group generates revenue from the production and sale of commodities. Revenue is recognised when or as control of the promised goods or services  passes to the customer. In most instances, control passes when the goods are delivered to a destination specified by the customer, typically on board  the customer’s appointed vessel. Revenue from the provision of services is recognised over time as the services are provided, but does not represent  a significant proportion of total revenue and is aggregated with the respective asset and product revenue for disclosure purposes.  The amount of revenue recognised reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services.  Where the Group’s sales are provisionally priced, the final price depends on future index prices. The amount of revenue initially recognised is based on  the relevant forward market price. Adjustments between the provisional and final price are accounted for under IFRS 9/AASB 9 ‘Financial Instruments’  (IFRS 9), separately recorded as other revenue and presented as part of the total revenue of each asset. The period between provisional pricing and final  invoicing is typically between 60 and 120 days. Revenue from the sale of significant by-products is included within revenue.  The Group applies the following practical expedients: 	 – expected consideration is not adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the period between the delivery and when the customer pays for the  promised good or service is one year or less 	 – 	no disclosure is provided for information relating to unfulfilled performance obligations, either due to the expected duration of the contract term being  one year or less, or for longer term contracts, because the entity has a right to consideration (and can recognise revenue) for goods delivered  3 Exceptional items Exceptional items are those gains or losses where their nature, including the expected frequency of the events giving rise to them, and impact is  considered material to the Financial Statements.

Refer to note 4 ‘Significant events – Samarco dam failure’ for further information.  Western Australia Nickel impairment The Group recognised an impairment charge of US$2,675 million (after tax) in relation to the Western Australia Nickel assets. The impairment charge  reflects the oversupply in the global nickel market that has seen a sharp decline in forward nickel prices in the short to medium term, escalation in  capital costs for Western Australia Nickel, and changes to development plans including the Group’s decision, announced on 11 July 2024, to temporarily  suspend Nickel West operations and the West Musgrave project at Western Australia Nickel. Refer to note 13 ‘Impairment of non-current assets’ for  further information. Blackwater and Daunia gain on divestment On 2 April 2024 BHP and Mitsubishi Development Pty Ltd (MDP) completed the divestment of the Blackwater and Daunia mines (which were part of the  BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA)) to Whitehaven Coal. Each of BHP and MDP hold a 50% interest in BMA.  Whitehaven Coal paid a US$100 million deposit on signing of the Asset Sale Agreement on 18 October 2023 and a further US$2 billion cash on  completion plus a preliminary completion adjustment of US$44.1 million for working capital and other agreed adjustments (100% interest basis).  US$1.1 billion in cash remains payable over 3 years after completion and a potential additional amount up to US$0.9 billion in a price-linked earnout may  also be payable over 3 years (100% interest basis). The price-linked earnout is subject to a cap of US$350 million each year and depends on average  realised pricing exceeding agreed thresholds for each of the 3 years following completion on 2 April 2024. The total cash consideration for the transaction could be up to US$4.1 billion plus the final completion adjustment amount (100% interest basis).

Refer to note 4 ‘Significant events – Samarco dam failure’ for further information.  Chilean tax reform On 17 May 2023, the Chilean Lower House approved a Royalty Bill which would implement a 1 per cent royalty on revenues, a margin based tax with  rates ranging between 8 per cent and 26 per cent, and a 46.5 per cent cap to the overall Chilean tax burden of mining companies.  The President of the Lower House formally declared the legislative process complete on 12 June 2023, following receipt of the Chilean President’s formal  confirmation that he had waived his veto power to oppose any of the provisions of the Royalty Bill. On 13 July 2023, the Constitutional Court finalised its  review of certain aspects of the Royalty Bill, relating only to the distribution of proceeds.  Applying judgement, it was determined that the proposed tax rates were substantively enacted prior to 30 June 2023, as the scope of the Constitutional  Court review did not extend to reviewing the tax rates. While the timing of when the Group’s operations will be impacted by the reform depends on existing stability agreements, relevant deferred tax positions  were remeasured by US$283 million in the Group’s FY2023 Financial Statements. 30 June 2022 Year ended 30 June 2022 Gross US$M Tax US$M Net US$M Exceptional items by category Samarco dam failure (1,032) (31) (1,063) Impairment of US deferred tax assets  –  (423) (423) Corporate structure unification costs (428)  –  (428) BHP Mitsui Coal (BMC) gain on disposal 840  –  840 Total (620) (454) (1,074) Attributable to non-controlling interests  –   –   –  Attributable to BHP shareholders (620) (454) (1,074) Samarco Mineração S.A.

Refer to note 4 ‘Significant events – Samarco dam failure’ for further information.  Impairment of US deferred tax assets  The Group recognised an impairment charge of US$423 million (after tax) in relation to deferred tax assets where the recoverability had historically been  reliant on Petroleum earnings in the same tax group. While these tax assets remained with the Group following the merger of the Group’s oil and gas  portfolio with Woodside, the impairment charge reflected the extent of other forecasted future earnings against which the assets can be recovered.  Corporate structure unification costs The Group incurred transaction costs associated with the unification of the Group corporate structure under its existing Australian parent company,  BHP Group Limited, which was completed on 31 January 2022.  BHP Mitsui Coal (BMC) gain on disposal On 3 May 2022 the Group sold its 80 per cent interest in BHP Mitsui Coal Pty Ltd (BMC) to Stanmore SMC Holdings Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary  of Stanmore Resources Limited (Stanmore Resources).  Stanmore Resources paid US$1.1 billion cash consideration at completion plus a preliminary completion adjustment of US$218 million for working capital.  Deferred consideration of US$222 million comprised US$100 million in cash, outstanding at 30 June 2022 and subsequently received on 3 November 2022,  with potential for an additional amount of up to US$150 million (US$122 million discounted) in a price-linked earnout payable in the 2024 calendar year.  143 Operating and Financial Review Overview Additional Information Governance Contents Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 146 ===== 3 Exceptional items continued Details of the gain on disposal is as follows: US$M BHP share of net assets disposed 631 Gross consideration  1,318 Transaction and other directly applicable costs (69) Income tax expense  –  Deferred consideration  222 Gain on disposal  840 4 Significant events – Samarco dam failure On 5 November 2015, the Samarco Mineração S.A. (Samarco) iron ore operation in Minas Gerais, Brazil, experienced a tailings dam failure that resulted  in a release of mine tailings, flooding the communities of Bento Rodrigues, Gesteira and Paracatu and impacting other communities downstream  (the Samarco dam failure). Refer to section on ‘Samarco’ in the Operating and Financial Review. Samarco is jointly owned by BHP Billiton Brasil Ltda (BHP Brasil) and Vale S.A. (Vale). BHP Brasil’s 50 per cent interest is accounted for as an equity  accounted joint venture investment. BHP Brasil does not separately recognise its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of Samarco, but instead  records the investment as one line on the balance sheet. Each period, BHP Brasil recognised its 50 per cent share of Samarco’s profit or loss and  adjusted the carrying value of the investment in Samarco accordingly. Such adjustment continued until the investment carrying value was reduced to  US$ nil, with any additional share of Samarco losses only recognised to the extent that BHP Brasil has an obligation to fund the losses. After applying  equity accounting, any remaining carrying value of the investment is tested for impairment.  Any charges relating to the Samarco dam failure incurred directly by BHP Brasil or other BHP entities are recognised 100 per cent in the Group’s results. The financial impacts of the Samarco dam failure on the Group’s income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement for the year ended 30 June  2024 are shown in the tables below and have been treated as an exceptional item.

The provision related to the Samarco dam failure recognised as at 30 June 2024 is US$6,505 million and reflects the Group’s best estimate of the  potential outflows necessary to resolve all aspects of the Federal Public Prosecution Office BRL$155 billion claim and Framework Agreement obligations  (see below).  Contingent liabilities will only be resolved when one or more uncertain future events occur or related impacts become capable of reliable measurement  and, as such, determination of contingent liabilities disclosed in the Financial Statements requires significant judgement regarding the outcome of  future events. A number of the claims below do not specify the amount of damages sought and, where this is specified, amounts could change as the  matter progresses.  Ultimately, future changes in any matters for which a provision has been recognised or contingent liability disclosed could have a material adverse impact  on BHP’s business, competitive position, cash flows, prospects, liquidity and shareholder returns.  145 Operating and Financial Review Overview Additional Information Governance Contents Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 148 ===== 4 Significant events – Samarco dam failure continued The following table summarises the current status of significant ongoing matters relating to the Samarco dam failure, along with developments during the  financial year, and the associated treatment in the Financial Statements: Item Provision Contingent  liability Samarco dam failure – Framework Agreement On 2 March 2016, BHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale S.A. (Vale) entered into a Framework Agreement with the Federal Government  of Brazil, the states of Espirito Santo and Minas Gerais, and certain other public authorities to establish a foundation (Fundação  Renova) that is developing and executing environmental and socio-economic programs (Programs) to remediate and provide  compensation for damage caused by the Samarco dam failure (the Framework Agreement).  Key Programs include those for financial assistance and compensation of impacted persons and those for remediation of impacted  areas and resettlement of impacted communities.  Uncertainty exists around the scope and cost of the Programs, including as a result of ongoing legal actions in relation to the number  of individuals eligible for compensation and the amount of damages to which they are entitled. Further information on the key areas of  estimation uncertainty is provided in the ‘Key judgements and estimates’ section below. Samarco has primary responsibility for funding Fundação Renova with each of BHP Brasil and Vale having secondary funding  obligations in proportion to their 50 per cent shareholding in Samarco. While Samarco has recommenced operations, Samarco’s  long-term cash flow generation remains highly sensitive to factors including returning to full production capacity, commodity prices  and foreign exchange rates. Further, under the Samarco Judicial Reorganisation (refer to Samarco Judicial Reorganisation (JR) below), Samarco’s funding of  obligations to remediate and compensate the damages resulting from the dam failure, including funding Fundação Renova, is capped  at US$1 billion for the period CY2024 to CY2030. Notwithstanding this cap, and subject to certain conditions, to the extent that  Samarco each year has a positive cash balance after meeting its various obligations, during this period Samarco’s shareholders are  able to direct 50 per cent of Samarco’s year end excess cash balance to fund remediation and compensation obligations.  Execution of the Programs is a key component in the resolution of the reparation process, including the Federal Public Prosecution  Office claim and, therefore, the expected cost of executing the Programs and Samarco’s potential ability to contribute to remediation  and compensation obligations have been considered when determining BHP Brasil’s provision in relation to the Samarco dam failure  at 30 June 2024 (as outlined below). Federal Public Prosecution Office claim BHP Brasil is among the defendants named in a claim brought by the Brazilian Federal Public Prosecution Office on 3 May 2016, seeking  R$155 billion (approximately US$28 billion) for reparation, compensation and moral damages in relation to the Samarco dam failure. Since early CY2021, BHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale have been engaging in negotiations with the Brazilian State and Federal  Government and other public entities to seek a settlement of obligations under the Framework Agreement, the Federal Public  Prosecution Office Claim, and other claims by government entities relating to the Samarco dam failure (the ‘Settlement  Negotiations’). The Settlement Negotiations are ongoing and the outcome is uncertain.  As at 30 June 2023, the Group disclosed a contingent liability in relation to the Federal Public Prosecution Office claim as, given the  status of the claim and ongoing settlement negotiations, it was not possible to reliably estimate the potential outcomes of the claim  beyond the estimated costs of completing the Programs under the Framework Agreement, which are being executed in relation to  financial assistance and compensation of impacted persons, remediation of impacted areas and resettlement of impacted communities. On 25 January 2024, the Federal Court of Brazil issued a decision in relation to the Federal Public Prosecution Office Claim finding  Samarco, Vale and BHP Brasil jointly and severally liable to pay collective moral damages arising from the Samarco dam failure in  the amount of R$47.6 billion (US$8.6 billion) (to be adjusted for interest and inflation). The decision also determined that payment  will only occur when any and all appeals are finally determined. In March 2024, the Federal Court found that the correct historical amount due of collective moral damages is R$46.7 billion (instead  of R$47.6 billion). In April and May 2024, Samarco, Vale, BHP Brasil and various governmental parties appealed the decision. The  appeal process is estimated to take approximately two to five years. The Federal Court issued rulings on 8 May 2024 and 20 May  2024 denying the requests for early enforcement.  On 27 June 2024, the Federal Court dismissed without prejudice certain claims directed at the Companies in the Federal Public  Prosecution Office Claim, on the grounds that they are already covered by previous agreements and decisions (such as the Framework  Agreement). This decision did not dismiss the collective moral damages decision outlined above and is also subject to appeal.  In June 2024, the Public Prosecutors’ Office and the Public Defense Office filed a public civil claim against Samarco, BHP Brasil, Vale  and Fundação Renova for alleged gender discrimination against women in the reparation process. They requested certain changes in  Fundação Renova’s registration program, damages and an injunctive relief to implement emergency measures. On 14 August 2024, the  Federal Court partially granted the injunctive relief request and ordered Fundação Renova to allow the review of the registration of all  women who are either registered or have pending registration applications in Fundação Renova. The decision is subject to appeal. The Group has considered the additional information available from the status of the Settlement Negotiations (including all offers  made by BHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale to date), updates to the estimated costs of executing the Framework Agreement Programs,  the extent to which Samarco may be in a position to fund any future outflows and the judicial decision regarding collective moral  damages to increase the provision related to the Samarco dam failure to US$6,505 million at 30 June 2024. The provision at 30 June 2024 reflects the Group’s best estimate of outflows required to resolve all aspects of the Federal Public  Prosecution Office claim, being reparation, compensation and moral damages, and the Framework Agreement. Significant uncertainty remains around the resolution of the Federal Public Prosecution Office Claim and the Framework Agreement  obligations, and there is a risk that outcomes may be materially higher or lower than amounts reflected in BHP Brasil’s provision for  the Samarco dam failure. Key areas of uncertainty include the terms of any potential future outcome of the Settlement Negotiations, the extent to which  Samarco is able to directly fund any future obligations relating to reparation, compensation and moral damages and the outcomes  of appeals relating to the judicial decision regarding collective moral damages. Further information on the key areas of estimation  uncertainty is provided in the ‘Key judgements and estimates’ section below. BHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale continue to maintain security, as required by a Governance Agreement, ratified on 8 August 2018,  with the security currently comprising insurance bonds and a charge over certain Samarco assets. 1 Consolidated Financial Statements continued 146 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 149 ===== Item Provision Contingent  liability Australian class action complaint BHP Group Limited is named as a defendant in a shareholder class action filed in the Federal Court of Australia on behalf of  persons who acquired shares in BHP Group Limited or BHP Group Plc (now BHP Group (UK) Ltd) in periods prior to the Samarco  dam failure.  The amount of damages sought is unspecified. A trial is scheduled to commence in September 2025. United Kingdom group action complaint and Vale and Samarco’s Netherlands collective action complaint BHP Group (UK) Ltd (formerly BHP Group Plc) and BHP Group Limited (BHP Defendants) are named as defendants in group  action claims for damages filed in the courts of England. These claims were filed on behalf of certain individuals, municipalities,  businesses, faith-based institutions and communities in Brazil allegedly impacted by the Samarco dam failure.  The amount of damages sought in these claims is unspecified. A trial in relation to the BHP Defendants’ liability for the dam failure  is listed to commence in October 2024 and therefore a present obligation in relation to this matter is yet to be determined. In December 2022, the BHP Defendants filed their defence and a contribution claim against Vale. The contribution claim contended  that if the BHP Defendants’ defence is not successful and the BHP Defendants are ordered to pay damages to the claimants, Vale  should contribute to any amount payable. Vale contested the jurisdiction of the English courts to determine the contribution claim,  with those challenges ultimately dismissed in December 2023.  In January 2024, the BHP Defendants were served with a new group action filed in the courts of England on behalf of additional  individuals and businesses in Brazil allegedly impacted by the Samarco dam failure. The new action makes broadly the same  claims as the original action and the amount of damages sought in these claims is unspecified. In March 2024, a collective action complaint was filed in the Netherlands against Vale and a Dutch subsidiary of Samarco for  compensation relating to the Fundão Dam failure. The claim filed in the Netherlands indicates that these claims were filed on behalf of  certain individuals, municipalities, businesses, associations and faith-based institutions allegedly impacted by the Samarco dam failure  who are not also claimants in the UK group action claims referred to above. BHP is not a defendant in the Netherlands proceedings.  In July 2024, the BHP Defendants, BHP Brasil and Vale entered into an agreement – without any admission of liability in any  proceedings – whereby: (i) Vale will pay 50% of any amounts that may be payable by the BHP Defendants to the claimants in the  UK group action claims (or by the BHP Defendants, BHP Brasil or their related parties to claimants in any other proceedings in  Brazil, England or the Netherlands covered by the agreement); and (ii) BHP Brasil will pay 50% of any amounts that may be payable  by Vale to the claimants in the Netherlands proceedings (or by Vale or its related parties to claimants in any other proceedings in  Brazil, England or the Netherlands covered by the agreement). The agreement reinforces the terms of the Framework Agreement  entered into in 2016 which require BHP Brasil and Vale to each contribute 50% to the funding of the Renova Foundation for  compensation of persons impacted by the Fundão Dam failure where Samarco is unable to contribute that funding. The BHP  Defendants withdrew the contribution claim against Vale in England as it is no longer necessary given this agreement.  Criminal charges The Federal Prosecutors’ Office has filed criminal charges against BHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale and certain employees and  former employees of BHP Brasil (Affected Individuals) in the Federal Court of Ponte Nova, Minas Gerais.  BHP Brasil rejects outright the charges against the company and the Affected Individuals and is defending itself from all charges  while fully supporting each of the Affected Individuals in their defence of the charges.  Civil public action commenced by Associations concerning the use of TANFLOC for water treatment The Vila Lenira Residents Association, State of Espirito Santo Rural Producers and Artisans Association, Colatina Velha  Neighbourhood Residents Association, and United for the Progress of Palmeiras Neighbourhood Association have filed a lawsuit  against Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale and others, including the State of Minas Gerais, the State of Espirito Santo and the  Federal Government.  The plaintiffs allege that the defendants carried out a clandestine study on the citizens of the locations affected by the Fundão Dam  Failure, using TANFLOC – a tannin-based flocculant/coagulant – that is currently used for wastewater treatment applications. The  plaintiffs claim that this product allegedly put the population at risk due to its alleged experimental qualities.  The plaintiffs are seeking multiple kinds of relief – material damages, moral damages, loss of profits – and that the defendants  should pay for water supply in all locations where there is no water source other than the Doce River.  On 17 November 2023, the Federal Court dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice considering the Association’s lack of standing to  sue and the defectiveness of the complaint. The Associations filed a motion for clarification and the decision is still subject to appeal. Other claims BHP Brasil is among the companies named as defendants in a number of legal proceedings initiated by individuals, non-governmental  organisations, corporations and governmental entities in Brazilian Federal and State courts following the Samarco dam failure. The  other defendants include Vale, Samarco and Fundação Renova. The lawsuits include claims for compensation, environmental reparation and violations of Brazilian environmental and other laws,  among other matters. The lawsuits seek various remedies including reparation costs, compensation to injured individuals and  families of the deceased, recovery of personal and property losses, moral damages and injunctive relief.  Certain of these legal proceedings are outside the scope of the negotiations currently in progress aimed at resolving all aspects of  the Federal Public Prosecution Office BRL$155 billion claim and Framework Agreement obligations.  In addition, government inquiries, studies and investigations relating to the Samarco dam failure have been commenced by  numerous agencies and individuals of the Brazilian government and are ongoing.  Additional lawsuits and government investigations relating to the Samarco dam failure could be brought against BHP Brasil and  other Group entities in Brazil or other jurisdictions. The outcomes of these claims, investigations and proceedings remain uncertain and continue to be disclosed as contingent liabilities. 147 Operating and Financial Review Overview Additional Information Governance Contents Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 150 ===== 4 Significant events – Samarco dam failure continued Commitments  Under the terms of the Samarco joint venture agreement, BHP Brasil does not have an existing obligation to fund Samarco.  However, BHP Brasil has agreed to fund a total of up to US$925 million for the Fundação Renova programs during calendar year 2024, with  US$194 million being funded in the six month period to 30 June 2024. Any additional requests for funding or future investment provided would be subject  to a future decision by BHP Brasil, accounted for at that time. Samarco judicial reorganisation Samarco filed for Judicial Reorganisation (JR) in April 2021, with the Second Business State Court for the Belo Horizonte District of Minas Gerais, State of  Minas Gerais, Brazil (JR Court), following enforcement actions taken by certain financial creditors of Samarco which threatened Samarco’s operations. The JR was an insolvency proceeding that provided a means for Samarco to restructure its financial debts and establish a stable financial position  to allow Samarco to continue to rebuild its operations and strengthen its ability to meet obligations in relation to reparation, compensation and moral  damages in relation to the Samarco dam failure. Samarco’s operations continued during the JR proceeding. On 28 July 2023, Samarco and one of its supporting creditors jointly filed a consensual Judicial Reorganisation Plan (Consensual Plan) with the JR Court,  which provided, among other things, that the agreements entered into between Samarco and Brazilian public authorities in connection with the Fundão  dam failure will not be impaired by the Consensual Plan and Samarco will continue to have the primary obligation to fund Fundação Renova.  On 1 September 2023, the JR Court ratified the Consensual Plan. Following the ratification, Samarco entered into definitive debt restructure agreements  with its financial creditors to implement the debt restructure, including the exchange of Samarco’s existing financial debt for US$3.6 billion of long-term  unsecured debt that matures in June 2031 and remains non-recourse to Samarco’s shareholders. Further, as part of the agreement Samarco issued  Senior notes to its Shareholders which also mature in June 2031. Samarco has paid the majority of labour claims, suppliers and other non-financial creditors as required by the Consensual Plan.  The debt restructure does not impact Fundação Renova’s ability to undertake the Programs under the Framework Agreement. Samarco continues to  have primary responsibility for funding Fundação Renova and each of BHP Brasil and Vale will continue to have secondary responsibility to fund 50% of  Fundação Renova if Samarco does not meet its funding obligations under the Framework Agreement. Under the Consensual Plan, Samarco’s funding  obligation to remediate and compensate the damages resulting from the dam failure, including funding Fundação Renova, is capped at US$1 billion for  the period CY2024 to CY2030 (Renova Cap). Notwithstanding the Renova Cap, and subject to certain conditions, to the extent that Samarco each year  has a positive cash balance after meeting its various obligations including operating capital requirements, debt service and Renova Cap requirements,  Samarco’s shareholders are able to direct 50% of Samarco’s year end excess cash balance to fund remediation and compensation obligations. BHP Brasil has considered the extent to which Samarco may be in a position to fund any future outflows, when determining the dam failure related  provision at 30 June 2024. Key judgements and estimates Judgements  The outcomes of litigation are inherently  difficult to predict and significant judgement  has been applied in assessing the likely  outcome of legal claims and determining which  legal claims require recognition of a provision  or disclosure of a contingent liability. The facts  and circumstances relating to these cases are  regularly evaluated in determining whether a  provision for any specific claim is required.  Management has determined that a provision  can be recognised at 30 June 2024 to reflect  the estimated costs to resolve all aspects of  the Federal Public Prosecution Office claim  and the Framework Agreement. It is not  yet possible to provide a range of possible  outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential  future exposures to BHP in connection to  the contingent liabilities noted above, given  their status. Estimates The provision for the Samarco dam failure  reflects the Group’s estimate of the costs  to resolve all aspects of the Federal Public  Prosecution Office claim and Framework  Agreement and requires the use of significant  judgements, estimates and assumptions. While the provision has been measured based  on the latest information available, changes  in facts and circumstances are likely in future  reporting periods and may lead to material  revisions to these estimates and there is a  risk that outcomes may be materially higher or  lower than amounts currently reflected in the  provision. However, it is currently not possible  to determine what facts and circumstances may  change, therefore revisions in future reporting  periods due to the key estimates and factors  outlined below cannot be reliably measured. The key estimates that may have a material  impact upon the provision in the next and  future reporting periods include: 	 – the terms of any potential future settlement  agreement seeking a definitive and  substantive settlement of claims relating  to the Samarco dam failure, including  amounts payable, obligations of the parties  to perform ongoing Programs of work in  relation to reparation and compensation,  and the period of time over which any  settlement amounts may be payable. A one  year increase or decrease, in isolation, to  the period over which amounts payable  have been estimated to be settled would  result in a change to the dam failure  provision of approximately US$125 million; 	 – the scope and cost of executing the  Programs under the Framework Agreement,  including as a result of ongoing legal  actions in relation to the number of people  eligible for compensation and the amount of  damages to which they are entitled; 	 – the outcomes of appeals relating to the  judicial decision regarding collective moral  damages, including any appeals that may  be lodged by the Brazilian Federal Public  Prosecution Office; and 	 – the extent to which Samarco is able to  directly fund any future obligations relating  to reparation, compensation or moral  damages. Samarco’s long-term cash flow  generation remains highly sensitive to  factors including its ability to return to full  production capacity, commodity prices and  foreign exchange rates. The provision may also be affected by factors  including but not limited to updates to discount  and foreign exchange rates. A 0.5% increase  in the discount rate would, in isolation, reduce  the provision by approximately US$130 million.  In addition, the provision may be impacted  by decisions in, or resolution of, existing  and potential legal claims in Brazil and other  jurisdictions, including the outcome of the  United Kingdom group action claims, the  Australian class action and the claim filed in  the Netherlands against Vale and a Dutch  subsidiary of Samarco.  Given these factors, future actual cash  outflows may differ from the amounts  currently provided and changes to any of  the key assumptions and estimates outlined  above could result in a material impact  to the provision in the next and future  reporting periods. The following section provides disclosure of  matters to which Samarco (and not the Group)  is a party.  Samarco Dam failure related provision and  contingencies In addition to its provisions in relation to  the Framework Agreement and the Federal  Public Prosecution Office claim as at 30 June  2024, Samarco has recognised provisions of  US$0.4 billion (30 June 2023: US$0.4 billion),   based on currently available information,  in relation to other dam failure related  matters to which BHP Brasil is not a party.  The magnitude, scope and timing of these  additional costs are subject to a high degree  of uncertainty and Samarco has indicated  that it anticipates that it will incur future costs  beyond those provided. These uncertainties  are likely to continue for a significant period  and changes to key assumptions could result  in a material change to the amount of the  provision in future reporting periods. Any such  unrecognised obligations are therefore  contingent liabilities and, at present, it is not  practicable to estimate their magnitude or  possible timing of payment. Accordingly, it is  also not possible to provide a range of possible  outcomes or a reliable estimate of total  potential future exposures at this time. 1 Consolidated Financial Statements continued 148 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 151 ===== Samarco is also named as a defendant in a  number of other legal proceedings initiated by  individuals, non-governmental organisations,  corporations and governmental entities in  Brazilian Federal and State courts following  the Samarco dam failure. The lawsuits include  claims for compensation, environmental  rehabilitation and violations of Brazilian  environmental and other laws, among other  matters. The lawsuits seek various remedies  including rehabilitation costs, compensation  to injured individuals and families of the  deceased, recovery of personal and property  losses, moral damages and injunctive  relief. In addition, government inquiries and  investigations relating to the Samarco dam  failure have been commenced by numerous  agencies of the Brazilian government and are  ongoing. Given the status of proceedings it  is not possible to provide a range of possible  outcomes or a reliable estimate of total  potential future exposures to Samarco. Additional lawsuits and government  investigations relating to the Samarco dam  failure could be brought against Samarco. Samarco has also identified a number of  individually immaterial tax-related uncertainties  which have been reflected, where appropriate,  in the Group’s share of associate and joint  venture contingent liabilities presented in note  34 ‘Contingent liabilities’. Samarco insurance Samarco has standalone insurance  policies in place with Brazilian and global  insurers. Insurers’ loss adjusters or claims  representatives continue to investigate and  assist with the claims process for matters not  yet settled. As at 30 June 2024, an insurance  receivable has not been recognised by  Samarco in respect of ongoing matters. Samarco non-dam failure related  provisions and contingent liabilities The following non-dam failure related matters  pre-date and are unrelated to the Samarco  dam failure. Samarco is currently contesting  aspects of both of these matters in the  Brazilian courts. Given the status of these tax  matters, the timing of resolution and potential  economic outflow for Samarco is uncertain.  Brazilian Social Contribution Levy  Samarco has received tax assessments for  the alleged non-payment of Brazilian Social  Contribution Levy for the calendar years  2007-2014. Based on its assessment of  currently available information as at 30 June  2024, Samarco recognised gross provisions  of US$0.4 billion, US$0.2 billion net of  US$0.2 billion court deposits paid (30 June  2023: gross provisions of US$1.1 billion,  US$0.9 billion net of US$0.2 billion court  deposits paid) and disclosed contingent  liabilities of US$0.2 billion (30 June 2023:  US$0.2 billion). As at 30 June 2024, BHP  Brasil’s 50% share of the impact of the  provision recognised by Samarco is reflected  in the Group’s equity accounting for Samarco.  Brazilian corporate income tax rate  Samarco has received tax assessments, and  disclosed contingent liabilities, for alleged  incorrect calculation of Corporate Income Tax  (IRPJ) in respect of the 2000-2003 and 2007- 2014 income years totalling approximately  US$1.0 billion (30 June 2023: US$1.1 billion). 5 Expenses and other income 2024 US$M 2023 US$M 2022 US$M Employee benefits expense: 	 Wages and salaries 4,633 4,539 4,197 	 Employee share awards 112 97 109 	 Social security costs 5 4 4 	 Pension and other post-retirement obligations 374 339 338 	 Less employee benefits expense classified as exploration and evaluation expenditure (49) (35) (30) Changes in inventories of finished goods and work in progress (289) 301 (774) Raw materials and consumables used 6,536 6,710 5,991 Freight and transportation 2,270 2,299 2,319 External services  5,795 4,768 4,525 Third-party commodity purchases 1,977 1,878 2,959 Net foreign exchange losses/(gains) 23 (197) (326) Fair value change on derivatives1 84 135 (29) Government royalties paid and payable 3,571 3,841 4,014 Exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred and expensed in the current period 399 294 199 Depreciation and amortisation expense 5,295 5,061 5,683 Net impairments: 	 Property, plant and equipment 3,833 73 515 	 Goodwill and other intangible assets 57 2  –  All other operating expenses 2,124 1,764 2,677 Total expenses 36,750 31,873 32,371 (Gain)/loss on disposal of subsidiaries and operations2 (915) (8) (840) Dividend income3 (1) (19) (241) Other income4 (369) (367) (317) Total other income (1,285) (394) (1,398) 1.

Taxation is recognised in the income statement except to the extent  that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income, in which case the tax effect is also recognised in equity or other  comprehensive income. Current tax Deferred tax Royalty-related taxation Current tax is the  expected tax on the  taxable income for the  year, using tax rates  and laws enacted  or substantively  enacted at the  reporting date, and  any adjustments to  tax payable in respect  of previous years. Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts  of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation  of taxable profit, and is accounted for in accordance with IAS 12/AASB 112 ‘Income Taxes’ (IAS 12). Deferred tax is generally provided on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and  liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Financial Statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the  extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences  can be utilised. Deferred tax is not recognised for temporary differences relating to: 	 – initial recognition of goodwill 	 – initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects  neither accounting nor taxable profit, except where the transaction gives rise to equal and offsetting taxable  and deductible temporary differences  	 – investment in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control  the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that they will not reverse in the  foreseeable future Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied when the asset is realised or the  liability is settled, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right  to offset and when the tax balances are related to taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Group  intends to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Royalties are treated as  taxation arrangements  (impacting income  tax expense/(benefit))  when they are imposed  under government  authority and the amount  payable is calculated  by reference to revenue  derived (net of any  allowable deductions)  after adjustment for  temporary differences.  Obligations arising from  royalty arrangements  that do not satisfy these  criteria are recognised  as current liabilities and  included in expenses. International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting previously  published the Pillar Two model rules designed to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the global economy, including the  implementation of a global minimum tax. The Group has a presence in jurisdictions that have enacted or substantively enacted legislation in relation to the  OECD/G20 BEPS Pillar Two model rules.  The enacted or substantively enacted rules apply to income years commencing on or after 1 January 2024 and, on this basis, there is no current tax  impact for the income year ended 30 June 2024. The temporary exception to recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and  liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes has been applied at 30 June 2024, pursuant to the amendments to IAS 12 issued on 23 May 2023 and  27 June 2023 by the IASB and AASB respectively. The Group continues to monitor and evaluate the domestic implementation of the Pillar Two rules in the jurisdictions in which it operates. The Group’s  potential exposure to Pillar Two taxes, based on legislation that is enacted or substantively enacted, is not expected to be material. Uncertain tax and royalty matters The Group operates across many tax jurisdictions. Application of tax law can be complex and requires judgement to assess risk and estimate outcomes.  These judgements are subject to risk and uncertainty, hence there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will alter expectations, which may impact  the amount of tax assets and tax liabilities, including deferred tax, recognised on the balance sheet and the amount of other tax losses and temporary  differences not yet recognised. The evaluation of tax risks considers both amended assessments received and potential sources of challenge from  tax authorities. The status of proceedings for these matters will impact the ability to determine the potential exposure and in some cases, it may not be  possible to determine a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of the potential exposure. Tax and royalty matters with uncertain outcomes arise in the normal course of business and occur due to changes in tax law, changes in interpretation  of tax law, periodic challenges and disagreements with tax authorities and legal proceedings.  Tax and royalty obligations assessed as having probable future economic outflows capable of reliable measurement are provided for as at 30 June 2024.  Matters with a possible economic outflow and/or presently incapable of being measured reliably are contingent liabilities and disclosed in note 34  ‘Contingent liabilities’. Details of uncertain tax and royalty matters relating to Samarco are disclosed in note 4 ‘Significant events – Samarco dam failure’. Key judgements and estimates Income tax classification Judgements: The Group’s accounting policy for taxation, including royalty-related taxation, requires management’s judgement as to the types  of arrangements considered to be a tax on income in contrast to an operating cost. Deferred tax  Judgements: Judgement is required in: 	 – determining the amount of deferred tax assets to be recognised based on the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits; 	 – assessing whether changes in tax regimes or applicable tax rates are substantively enacted at the reporting date;  	 – recognising deferred tax liabilities arising from temporary differences in investments. These deferred tax liabilities caused principally by retained  earnings held in foreign tax jurisdictions are recognised unless repatriation of retained earnings can be controlled and is not expected to occur  in the foreseeable future. In FY2023, judgement was applied in determining the Chilean Royalty Bill was substantively enacted at the reporting date. It was considered that  the process of enactment was complete and the remaining steps for enactment would not change the outcome of the tax rates to be applied in  measuring the deferred tax assets and liabilities. Estimates: The Group assesses the recoverability of recognised and unrecognised deferred taxes, including losses in Australia, the United States  and Canada on a consistent basis. Estimates and assumptions relating to projected earnings and cash flows as applied in the Group impairment  process are used for operating assets. These forecasts are also used to estimate the royalty-related tax rates to apply when the deferred tax assets are realised and deferred tax liabilities  are settled. 151 Operating and Financial Review Overview Additional Information Governance Contents Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 154 ===== 7 Earnings per share 2024 2023 2022 Earnings attributable to BHP shareholders (US$M) –	 Continuing operations 7,897 12,921 20,245 –	 Total 7,897 12,921 30,900 Weighted average number of shares (Million) –	 Basic 5,068 5,064 5,061 –	 Diluted 5,077 5,073 5,071 Basic earnings per ordinary share (US cents) –	 Continuing operations 155.8 255.2 400.0 –	 Total 155.8 255.2 610.6 Diluted earnings per ordinary share (US cents) –	 Continuing operations 155.5 254.7 399.2 –	 Total 155.5 254.7 609.3 Headline earnings per ordinary share (US cents) –	 Basic 195.9 256.1 439.0 –	 Diluted 195.6 255.7 438.1 Refer to note 28 ‘Discontinued operations’ for basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for Discontinued operations.

Following unification of the BHP corporate structure on 31 January 2022, the aggregate weighted average number of ordinary shares of only BHP Group  Limited is considered in the composition of basic earnings per share. The calculation of the number of ordinary shares used in the computation of basic  earnings per share is the weighted average number of ordinary shares of BHP Group Limited outstanding during the period after deduction of the number  of shares held by the BHP Group Limited Employee Equity Trust. For the purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, the effect of 9 million dilutive shares has been taken into account for the year ended 30 June  2024 (2023: 9 million shares; 2022: 10 million shares). The Group’s only potential dilutive ordinary shares are share awards granted under the employee  share ownership plans for which terms and conditions are described in note 26 ‘Employee share ownership plans’. Diluted earnings per share calculation  excludes instruments which are considered antidilutive. At 30 June 2024, there are no instruments which are considered antidilutive (2023: nil; 2022: nil).  1 Consolidated Financial Statements continued 152 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 155 ===== Working capital 8 Trade and other receivables 2024 US$M 2023 US$M Trade receivables 3,687 3,418 Other receivables 1,652 1,324 Total  5,339 4,742 Comprising: 	 Current 5,169 4,594 	 Non-current 170 148 Recognition and measurement Trade receivables are recognised initially at their transaction price or, for those receivables containing a significant financing component, at fair value.  Trade receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less an allowance for impairment, except for  provisionally priced receivables which are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss under IFRS 9.  The collectability of trade and other receivables is assessed continuously. At the reporting date, specific allowances are made for any expected credit  losses based on a review of all outstanding amounts at reporting period-end. Individual receivables are written off when management deems them  unrecoverable. The net carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair values.  Credit risk Trade receivables generally have terms of less than 30 days. The Group has no material concentration of credit risk with any single counterparty and  is not dominantly exposed to any individual industry. Credit risk can arise from the non-performance by counterparties of their contractual financial obligations towards the Group. To manage credit risk,  the Group maintains Group-wide procedures covering the application for credit approvals, granting and renewal of counterparty limits, proactive  monitoring of exposures against these limits and requirements triggering secured payment terms. As part of these processes, the credit exposures with  all counterparties are regularly monitored and assessed on a timely basis. The credit quality of the Group’s customers is reviewed and the solvency of  each debtor and their ability to pay the receivable is considered in assessing receivables for impairment. The 10 largest customers represented 39 per cent (2023: 31 per cent) of total credit risk exposures managed by the Group.  Receivables are deemed to be past due or impaired in accordance with the Group’s terms and conditions. These terms and conditions are determined  on a case-by-case basis with reference to the customer’s credit quality, payment performance and prevailing market conditions. As at 30 June  2024, trade receivables of US$59 million (2023: US$8 million) were past due but not impaired. The majority of these receivables were less than  30 days overdue. At 30 June 2024, trade receivables are stated net of provisions for expected credit losses of US$1 million (2023: US$9 million). 9 Trade and other payables 2024 US$M 2023 US$M Trade payables 5,338 4,893 Other payables 1,426 1,407 Total 6,764 6,300 Comprising: 	 Current 6,719 6,296 	 Non-current 45 4 10 Inventories 2024 US$M 2023 US$M Definitions Raw materials and consumables 2,305 2,106 Spares, consumables and other supplies yet to be utilised in the production  process or in the rendering of services.

Recognition and measurement Regardless of the type of inventory and its stage in the production process, inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is  determined primarily on the basis of average costs and involves estimates of expected metal recoveries and work in progress volumes, calculated using  available industry, engineering and scientific data. These estimates are periodically reassessed by the Group taking into account technical analysis and  historical performance.  For processed inventories, cost is derived on an absorption costing basis. Cost comprises costs of purchasing raw materials and costs of production,  including attributable mining and manufacturing overheads taking into consideration normal operating capacity.  Inventory quantities are assessed primarily through surveys and assays. 153 Operating and Financial Review Overview Additional Information Governance Contents Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 156 ===== Resource assets 11 Property, plant and equipment Land and buildings US$M Plant and equipment US$M Other mineral assets US$M Assets under construction US$M Exploration and evaluation US$M Total US$M Net book value – 30 June 2024 At the beginning of the financial year  8,140 36,654 13,304 13,481 239 71,818 Additions1 27 1,206 795 8,840 58 10,926 Remeasurements of index-linked freight contracts2  – 230  –  –  – 230 Depreciation for the year (637) (4,287) (264)  –  – (5,188) Impairments for the year3 (88) (1,440) (930) (1,365) (10) (3,833) Disposals (1) (15)  –  –  – (16) Divestment of subsidiaries and operations4 (293) (1,093) (23) (44)  – (1,453) Transfers and other movements 417 3,249 (655) (3,815) (51) (855) At the end of the financial year5 7,565 34,504 12,227 17,097 236 71,629 –	 Cost 15,180 86,989 19,900 19,106 1,035 142,210 –	 Accumulated depreciation and impairments (7,615) (52,485) (7,673) (2,009) (799) (70,581) Net book value – 30 June 2023 At the beginning of the financial year  8,079 35,500 8,494 9,031 191 61,295 Additions1 194 1,024 842 6,332 56 8,448 Acquisition of subsidiaries and operations6 88 2,256 4,612 720  –  7,676 Remeasurements of index-linked freight contracts2  –  53  –   –   –  53 Depreciation for the year (586) (4,156) (225)  –   –  (4,967) Impairments for the year3  –  (73)  –   –   –  (73) Disposals (2) (6)  –   –   –  (8) Transfers and other movements 367 2,056 (419) (2,602) (8) (606) At the end of the financial year5 8,140 36,654 13,304 13,481 239 71,818 –	 Cost 15,258 85,394 19,420 14,245 1,029 135,346 –	 Accumulated depreciation and impairments (7,118) (48,740) (6,116) (764) (790) (63,528) 1.

Cost is the fair value of consideration given  to acquire the asset at the time of its acquisition or construction and includes the direct costs of bringing the asset to the location and the condition  necessary for operation and the estimated future costs of closure and rehabilitation of the facility.  Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease  liabilities. Refer to note 22 ‘Leases’ for further details. Right-of-use assets are presented within the category of property, plant and equipment according  to the nature of the underlying asset leased.  Exploration and evaluation Exploration costs are incurred to discover mineral resources. Evaluation costs are incurred to assess the technical feasibility and commercial viability  of resources found. Exploration and evaluation expenditure is charged to the income statement as incurred, except in the following circumstances in which case the  expenditure may be capitalised: 	 – the exploration and evaluation activity is within an area of interest that was previously acquired as an asset acquisition or in a business combination  and measured at fair value on acquisition or 	 – the existence of a commercially viable mineral deposit has been established A regular review of each area of interest is undertaken to determine the appropriateness of continuing to carry forward costs in relation to that area.  Capitalised costs are only carried forward to the extent that they are expected to be recovered through the successful exploitation of the area of interest  or alternatively by its sale. To the extent that capitalised expenditure is no longer expected to be recovered, it is charged to the income statement. Development expenditure When proven mineral reserves are determined and development is sanctioned, capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is reclassified as  assets under construction within property, plant and equipment. All subsequent development expenditure is capitalised and classified as assets under  construction, provided commercial viability conditions continue to be satisfied. 1 Consolidated Financial Statements continued 154 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 157 ===== The Group may use funds sourced from external parties to finance the acquisition and development of assets and operations. Finance costs are  expensed as incurred, except where they relate to the financing of construction or development of qualifying assets. Borrowing costs directly attributable  to acquiring or constructing a qualifying asset are capitalised during the development phase.  In the instance where saleable material is extracted prior to the commissioning of a project/site, sale proceeds are recognised as revenue, with associated  costs also recognised in the income statement. On completion of development, all assets included in assets under construction are reclassified as either  plant and equipment or other mineral assets and depreciation commences.  Other mineral assets Other mineral assets comprise: 	 – capitalised exploration, evaluation and development expenditure for assets in production 	 – mineral rights acquired 	 – capitalised development and production stripping costs Overburden removal costs The process of removing overburden and other waste materials to access mineral deposits is referred to as stripping. Stripping is necessary to obtain  access to mineral deposits and occurs throughout the life of an open-pit mine. Development and production stripping costs are classified as other mineral  assets in property, plant and equipment.  Stripping costs are accounted for separately for individual components of an ore body. The determination of components is dependent on the mine plan  and other factors, including the size, shape and geotechnical aspects of an ore body. The Group accounts for stripping activities as follows: Development stripping costs These are initial overburden removal costs incurred to obtain access to mineral deposits that will be commercially produced. These costs are capitalised  when it is probable that future economic benefits (access to mineral ores) will flow to the Group and costs can be measured reliably.  Once the production phase begins, capitalised development stripping costs are depreciated using the units of production method based on the proven  and probable reserves of the relevant identified component of the ore body which the initial stripping activity benefits. Production stripping costs These are post initial overburden removal costs incurred during the normal course of production activity, which commences after the first saleable  minerals have been extracted from the component. Production stripping costs can give rise to two benefits, the accounting for which is outlined below: Production stripping activity Benefits of stripping activity Extraction of ore (inventory) in current period. Improved access to future ore extraction. Period benefited Current period Future period(s) Recognition and   measurement criteria When the benefits of stripping activities are realised in the form  of inventory produced; the associated costs are recorded in  accordance with the Group’s inventory accounting policy. When the benefits of stripping activities are improved access to  future ore; production costs are capitalised when all the following  criteria are met: 	 – the production stripping activity improves access to a specific  component of the ore body and it is probable that economic  benefits arising from the improved access to future ore  production will be realised  	 – the component of the ore body for which access has been  improved can be identified 	 – costs associated with that component can be measured reliably Allocation of costs Production stripping costs are allocated between the inventory produced and the production stripping asset using a  life-of-component waste-to-ore (or mineral contained) strip ratio. When the current strip ratio is greater than the estimated  life-of-component ratio a portion of the stripping costs is capitalised to the production stripping asset. Asset recognised from   stripping activity Inventory Other mineral assets within property, plant and equipment. Depreciation basis Not applicable  On a component-by-component basis using the units of  production method based on proven and probable reserves. Key judgements and estimates Judgements: Judgement is applied by management in determining the components of an ore body. Estimates: Estimates are used in the determination of stripping ratios and mineral reserves by component. Changes to estimates related to  life-of-component waste-to-ore (or mineral contained) strip ratios and the expected ore production from identified components are accounted for  prospectively and may affect depreciation rates and asset carrying values. Depreciation Depreciation of assets, other than land, assets under construction and capitalised exploration and evaluation that are not depreciated, is calculated  using either the straight-line (SL) method or units of production (UoP) method, net of residual values, over the estimated useful lives of specific assets.  The depreciation method and rates applied to specific assets reflect the pattern in which the asset’s benefits are expected to be used by the Group.  The Group’s proved and probable reserves for minerals assets are used to determine UoP depreciation unless doing so results in depreciation charges  that do not reflect the asset’s useful life. Where this occurs, alternative approaches to determining reserves are applied, to provide a phasing of periodic  depreciation charges that better reflects the asset’s expected useful life.  Where assets are dedicated to a mine lease, the useful lives below are subject to the lesser of the asset category’s useful life and the life of the mine  lease, unless those assets are readily transferable to another productive mine. Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell and therefore not depreciated.  155 Operating and Financial Review Overview Additional Information Governance Contents Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 158 ===== 11 Property, plant and equipment continued Key estimates The determination of useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods involves estimates and assumptions and is reviewed annually.  Any changes to useful lives or any other estimates or assumptions, including the expected impact of climate change and the transition to a lower  carbon economy, may affect prospective depreciation rates and asset carrying values. The table below summarises the principal depreciation  methods and rates applied to major asset categories by the Group.

Refer to note 3 ‘Exceptional items’ for more information. Recognition and measurement Goodwill Where the fair value of the consideration paid for a business acquisition exceeds the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities  acquired, the difference is treated as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortised and is measured at cost less any impairment losses.  Other intangibles The Group capitalises amounts paid for the acquisition of identifiable intangible assets, such as software, licences and initial payments for the acquisition  of mineral lease assets, where it is considered that they will contribute to future periods through revenue generation or reductions in cost. These assets,  classified as finite life intangible assets, are carried in the balance sheet at the fair value of consideration paid (cost) less accumulated amortisation and  impairment charges. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. The estimated useful lives are  generally no greater than eight years. Initial payments for the acquisition of intangible mineral lease assets are capitalised and amortised over the term of the permit. A regular review is  undertaken of each area of interest to determine the appropriateness of continuing to carry forward costs in relation to that area. Capitalised costs are  only carried forward to the extent that they are expected to be recovered through the successful exploitation of the area of interest or alternatively by  its sale. To the extent that capitalised expenditure is no longer expected to be recovered, it is charged to the income statement. Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell and therefore not amortised.  13 Impairment of non-current assets 2024 Cash generating unit Segment Property,  plant and equipment US$M Goodwill  and other intangibles US$M Equity- accounted investment US$M Total US$M Western Australia Nickel Group and unallocated 3,744 56  – 3,800 Other Various 89 1  – 90 Total impairment of non-current assets 3,833 57  – 3,890 Reversal of impairment  –  –  –  – Net impairment of non-current assets 3,833 57  – 3,890 1 Consolidated Financial Statements continued 156 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 159 ===== 2023 Cash generating unit Segment Property,  plant and  equipment US$M Goodwill  and other intangibles US$M Equity- accounted investment US$M Total US$M Other Various 73 2  –  75 Total impairment of non-current assets 73 2  –  75 Reversal of impairment  –   –   –   –  Net impairment of non-current assets 73 2  –  75 Recognition and measurement Impairment tests for all non-financial assets (excluding goodwill) are performed when there is an indication of impairment. Goodwill is tested for impairment  at least annually. Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the  cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs, being the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent  of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. If the carrying amount of the asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset or CGU is  impaired and an impairment loss is charged to the income statement so as to reduce the carrying amount in the balance sheet to its recoverable amount.  Previously impaired assets (excluding goodwill as impairment losses are not reversed in subsequent periods) are reviewed for possible reversal  of previous impairment at each reporting date. Impairment reversal cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of  depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or CGU. Such reversal is recognised in the income statement. There were no  reversals of impairment in the current or prior year.  How recoverable amount is calculated The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or CGU’s fair value less cost of disposal (FVLCD) and its value in use (VIU).  Fair value less cost of disposal  FVLCD is an estimate of the amount that a market participant would pay for an asset or CGU, less the cost of disposal. FVLCD for mineral assets is  generally determined using independent market assumptions to calculate the present value of the estimated future post-tax cash flows expected to arise  from the continued use of the asset, including the anticipated cash flow effects of any capital expenditure to enhance production or reduce cost, and  its eventual disposal where a market participant may take a consistent view. Cash flows are discounted using an appropriate post-tax market discount  rate to arrive at a net present value of the asset, which is compared against the asset’s carrying value. FVLCD may also take into consideration other  market-based indicators of fair value. FVLCD are based primarily on Level 3 inputs as defined in note 24 ‘Financial risk management’ unless otherwise noted. Value in use  VIU is determined as the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continued use of the asset in its present form and  its eventual disposal or closure. VIU is determined by applying assumptions specific to the Group’s continued use and cannot take into account future  development. These assumptions are different to those used in calculating FVLCD and consequently the VIU calculation is likely to give a different result  (usually lower) to a FVLCD calculation. Impairment of non-current assets (excluding goodwill) Impairment of non-current assets relating to the year ended 30 June 2024 are detailed below. Western Australia Nickel  At 30 June 2024, the Group determined that the overall recoverable amount of the Western Australia Nickel CGU to be approximately negative  US$600 million including closure provisions. Considering the recoverable amount of individual assets within the CGU, this resulted in an aggregate  impairment to property, plant and equipment of US$3,744 million and intangible assets of US$56 million in FY2024. The impairment is driven by  oversupply in the global nickel market that has seen a sharp decline in forward nickel prices in the short to medium term, escalation in capital costs for  Western Australia Nickel, and changes to development plans including the Group’s decision, announced on 11 July 2024, to temporarily suspend Nickel  West operations and the West Musgrave project at Western Australia Nickel. The Western Australia Nickel CGU is part of the ‘Group and unallocated  items’ reportable segment.  The post-impairment carrying value of Western Australia Nickel property, plant and equipment is not material. Recoverable amount used for the impairment assessment was determined using a fair value less costs of disposal methodology, applying discounted  cash flow techniques utilising a post-tax real discount rate of 7.5 per cent. The valuation is most sensitive to changes in the long-term nickel price outlook  and foreign exchange assumptions.  There were no material impairments of non-current assets for the year ended 30 June 2023. Impairment test for goodwill The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, as follows: Cash generating unit 2024 US$M 2023 US$M Olympic Dam  – 1,010 OZ Minerals Limited provisional goodwill  – 192 Copper SA 1,154  –  Other 187 187 Total goodwill 1,341 1,389 For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill has been allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of  previous business combinations, which represent the level at which management will monitor and manage goodwill. In previous reporting periods the Olympic Dam goodwill has been tested for impairment as part of the Olympic Dam CGU. In the current reporting period,  and moving forward, the Olympic Dam goodwill has been tested for impairment at the Copper SA level, which comprises Olympic Dam, Carrapateena  and Prominent Hill. 157 Operating and Financial Review Overview Additional Information Governance Contents Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 160 ===== 13 Impairment of non-current assets continued On 2 May 2023, the Group acquired OZ Minerals Limited (OZL) (refer to note 29 ‘Business combination’ for details). In 2024 following the acquisition  of OZL, the Group reorganised its reporting structure and established Copper SA, which comprises the Olympic Dam CGU as well as the acquired  Carrapateena and Prominent Hill CGUs. On completion of the OZL business combination accounting, the OZL goodwill of US$194 million was allocated  as follows: 	 – US$144 million to the Copper SA group of CGUs; and 	 – US$50 million to Western Australia Nickel CGU, which was written off at 31 December 2023 as part of the impairment of Western Australia  Nickel assets. From FY2024, the Olympic Dam goodwill is tested for impairment as part of the Copper SA group of CGUs as this represents the level at which the Group  now monitors and manages the goodwill. Goodwill held by other CGUs is US$187 million (2023: US$187 million). This represents less than one per cent of net assets at 30 June 2024  (2023: less than one per cent). There was no impairment of other goodwill in the year to 30 June 2024 (2023: US$ nil). Copper SA goodwill Impairment test  conclusion  The Group performed an impairment test of the Copper SA Group of CGUs, including goodwill, as at 30 June 2024 and an  impairment charge was not required. How did the  goodwill arise? Goodwill of US$1,010 million and US$144 million in relation to the acquisitions of WMC Resources Ltd (2005) and OZ Minerals Ltd  (2023), respectively. Segment Copper SA is part of the Copper reportable segment. How were the  valuations calculated? FVLCD methodology using DCF techniques has been applied in determining the recoverable amount of Copper SA. Significant  assumptions and  sensitivities The valuation of Copper SA exceeded its carrying amount by approximately US$8.4 billion and is most sensitive to changes in copper  commodity price, production volumes, operating costs and discount rates. It is considered that there are no reasonably possible  changes in these key assumptions that would, in isolation, result in the estimated recoverable amount being equal to the carrying  amount. The valuation applied a post-tax real discount rate of 7.0 per cent.  Key judgements and estimates that have been applied in the FVLCD valuation are disclosed further below. Key judgements and estimates Judgements: Assessment of indicators  of impairment or impairment reversal  and the determination of CGUs for  impairment purposes require significant  management judgement. Indicators of impairment may include changes  in the Group’s operating and economic  assumptions, including those arising from  changes in reserves or mine planning, updates  to the Group’s commodity supply, demand  and price forecasts, or the possible additional  impacts from emerging risks including those  related to climate change and the transition to  a low-carbon economy.  Climate change The Group’s impairment assessments may be  impacted by climate change and the transition  to a low-carbon economy. Further detail is  provided in note 16 ‘Climate change’.  Estimates: The Group performs a recoverable  amount determination for an asset or CGU  when there is an indication of impairment or  impairment reversal.  When the recoverable amount is measured  by reference to FVLCD, in the absence  of quoted market prices or binding sale  agreement, estimates are made regarding  the present value of future post-tax cash  flows. These estimates are made from the  perspective of a market participant and  include prices, future production volumes,  operating costs, capital expenditure, closure  and rehabilitation costs, taxes, risking factors  applied to cash flows and discount rates.  The cash flow forecasts may include net  cash flows expected from the extraction,  processing and sale of material that does not  currently qualify for inclusion in ore reserves.  Reserves and resources are included in the  assessment of FVLCD to the extent that it is  considered probable that a market participant  would attribute value to them. When recoverable amount is measured using  VIU, estimates are made regarding the present  value of future cash flows based on internal  budgets and forecasts and life of asset plans.  Key estimates are similar to those identified for  FVLCD, although some assumptions and values  may differ as they reflect the perspective of  management rather than a market participant.  All estimates require judgements and  assumptions and are subject to risk and  uncertainty that may be beyond the control of  the Group; hence, there is a possibility that  changes in circumstances will materially alter  projections, which may impact the recoverable  amount of an asset or CGU at each reporting  date. With the exception of the Western  Australia Nickel CGU impairment mentioned  above, no indicators of impairment, or  impairment reversal, were identified across the  Group’s remaining CGUs at 30 June 2024. The significant estimates impacting  the Group’s recoverable amount  determinations are: Commodity prices Commodity prices were based on latest  internal forecasts which assume short-term  market prices will revert to the Group’s  assessment of long-term price. These price  forecasts reflect management’s long-term  views of global supply and demand, built upon  past experience of the commodity markets  and are benchmarked with external sources  of information such as analyst forecasts.  Prices are adjusted based upon premiums or  discounts applied to global price markers to  reflect the location, nature and quality of the  Group’s production, or to take into account  contracted prices. Future production volumes Estimated production volumes were  based on detailed data and took into  account development plans established by  management as part of the Group’s long-term  planning process. When estimating FVLCD,  assumptions reflect all reserves and resources  that a market participant would consider  when valuing the respective CGU, which in  some cases are broader in scope than the  reserves that would be used in a VIU test.  In determining FVLCD, risk factors may be  applied to reserves and resources which do  not meet the criteria to be treated as proved. Cash outflows (including operating  costs, capital expenditure, closure and  rehabilitation costs and taxes) Cash outflows are based on internal budgets  and forecasts and life of asset plans.  Cost assumptions reflect management  experience and expectations. Tax assumptions  reflect existing and substantively enacted  tax and royalty regimes and rates applicable  in the jurisdiction of the CGU. In the case of  FVLCD, cash flow projections include the  anticipated cash flow effects of any capital  expenditure to enhance production or reduce  cost where a market participant may take a  consistent view. VIU does not take into account  future development. Discount rates The Group uses real post-tax discount  rates applied to real post-tax cash flows.  The discount rates are derived using the  weighted average cost of capital methodology.  Adjustments to the rates are made for any risks  that are not reflected in the underlying cash  flows, including country risk. 1 Consolidated Financial Statements continued 158 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 161 ===== 14 Deferred tax balances The movement for the year in the Group’s net deferred tax position is as follows: 2024 US$M 2023 US$M 2022 US$M Net deferred tax (liability)/asset At the beginning of the financial year (4,243) (3,007) (1,402) Acquisition of subsidiaries and operations1  – (867)  –  Income tax credit/(charge) recorded in the income statement2,3,4 988 (387) (125) Income tax (charge)/credit recorded directly in equity (6) 6 (42) Divestment of subsidiaries and operations5 (3)  –  (1,439) Other movements (1) 12 1 At the end of the financial year (3,265) (4,243) (3,007) 1.

The profile reflects the undiscounted forecast cash  flows that underpin the provisions. In some instances, the Group has an obligation to rehabilitate and maintain a closed site for an indefinite period.  For the purpose of this analysis, the cashflow period has been restricted to 100 years.  Proportion of the Group’s undiscounted forecast cashflows 2024 % 2023 % In one year or less  3  3 In more than one year but not more than two years 3  4 In more than two years but not more than five years 8  8 In more than five years but not more than ten years 15 14 In more than ten years 71 71 Total 100 100 The Group is required to close and rehabilitate sites and associated facilities at the end of or, in some cases, during the course of production to a  condition acceptable to the relevant authorities, as specified in licence requirements and the Group’s closure performance requirements.  The key components of closure and rehabilitation activities are: 	 – the removal of all unwanted infrastructure associated with an operation 	 – the return of disturbed areas to a safe, stable and self-sustaining condition, consistent with the agreed post-closure land use  Recognition and measurement Provisions for closure and rehabilitation are recognised by the Group when: 	 – it has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events 	 – it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation  	 – the amount can be reliably estimated Initial recognition and measurement Subsequent measurement Closure and rehabilitation provisions  are initially recognised when an  environmental disturbance first  occurs. The individual site provisions  are an estimate of the expected  value of future cash flows required to  close the relevant site using current  standards and techniques and taking  into account risks and uncertainties.  Individual site provisions are  discounted to their present value  using currency specific discount rates  aligned to the estimated timing of  cash outflows.  When provisions for closure and  rehabilitation are initially recognised,  the corresponding cost is capitalised  as an asset, representing part of the  cost of acquiring the future economic  benefits of the operation. The closure and rehabilitation asset, recognised within property, plant and equipment, is depreciated over the life of the  operations. The value of the provision is progressively increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds, resulting  in an expense recognised in net finance costs. The closure and rehabilitation provision is reviewed at each reporting date to assess if the estimate continues to reflect  the best estimate of the obligation. If necessary, the provision is remeasured to account for factors such as: 	 – additional disturbance during the period 	 – revisions to estimated reserves, resources and lives of operations including any changes to expected operating  lives arising from the Group’s latest assessment of the potential impacts of climate change and the transition to a  low-carbon economy 	 – developments in technology 	 – changes to regulatory requirements and environmental management strategies 	 – changes in the estimated extent and costs of anticipated activities, including the effects of inflation and movements in  foreign exchange rates 	 – movements in interest rates affecting the discount rate applied Changes to the closure and rehabilitation estimate for operating sites are added to, or deducted from, the related asset  and amortised on a prospective basis over the remaining life of the operation, generally applying the units of production  method. Costs arising from unforeseen circumstances, such as the contamination caused by unplanned discharges, are  recognised as an expense and liability when the event gives rise to an obligation that is probable and capable of reliable  estimation. Closed sites Where future economic benefits are no longer expected to be derived through operation, changes to the associated closure and remediation costs  are charged to the income statement in the period identified. This amounted to US$38 million in the year ended 30 June 2024 (2023: US$4 million;  2022: US$74 million). 161 Operating and Financial Review Overview Additional Information Governance Contents Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 164 ===== 15 Closure and rehabilitation provisions continued Key estimates Closure cost estimates are generally based on  conceptual level studies early in the operating  life of an asset with more detailed studies and  planning performed as closure risks (including  those related to climate change) are identified  and/or as an asset, or parts thereof, near closure.  As such, the recognition and measurement of  closure and rehabilitation provisions requires the  use of significant estimates and assumptions,  including, but not limited to: 	 – the extent (due to legal or constructive  obligations) of potential activities  required for the removal of infrastructure,  decharacterisation of tailings storage  facilities and rehabilitation activities 	 – costs associated with future  closure activities 	 – the extent and period of post-closure  monitoring and maintenance, including  water management 	 – applicable discount rates 	 – the timing of cash flows and ultimate closure  of operations The extent, cost and timing of future  closure activities may also be impacted by  the potential physical impacts of climate  change and the transition to a low-carbon  economy. Further detail is provided in note 16  ‘Climate change’.  Estimates for post-closure monitoring and  maintenance reflect the Group’s strategies for  individual sites, which may include possible  relinquishment. The period of monitoring  and maintenance included in the provision  requires judgement and considers regulatory  and licencing requirements, the outcomes  of studies and management’s current  assessment of stakeholder expectations.  While progressive closure is performed  across a number of operations, significant  activities are generally undertaken at the end  of the production life at the individual sites, the  estimated timing of which is informed by the  Group’s current assumptions relating to demand  for commodities and carbon pricing, and their  impact on the Group’s long-term price forecasts. Approximately 52 per cent (2023: 51 per cent)  of the Group’s total undiscounted forecast  cashflows are expected to be incurred after  more than 30 years, reflecting the long-lived  nature of many of the Group’s operations which  have remaining production lives ranging from  5-87 years (2023: 1-103 years). The discount  rates applied to the Group’s closure and  rehabilitation provisions are determined by  reference to the currency of the closure cash  flows, the period over which the cash flows will  be incurred and prevailing market interest rates  (where available). The discount rates applied  to the Group’s closure and rehabilitation  provisions were revised during the year to  reflect increases in market interest rates.  The effect of changes to discount rates was a  decrease of approximatively US$336 million  in the closure and rehabilitation provision of  which US$167 million in respect of closed sites  was recognised in the income statement.  While the closure and rehabilitation provisions  reflect management’s best estimates based  on current knowledge and information, further  studies, trials and detailed analysis of relevant  knowledge and resultant closure activities for  individual assets continue to be performed  throughout the life of asset. Such studies  and analysis can impact the estimated costs  of closure activities. Estimates can also be  impacted by the emergence of new closure and  rehabilitation techniques, changes in regulatory  requirements and stakeholder expectations  for closure (including costs associated  with equitable transition), development of  new technologies, risks relating to climate  change and the transition to a low-carbon  economy, and experience at other operations.  These uncertainties may result in future  actual expenditure differing from the amounts  currently provided for in the balance sheet. Sensitivity A 0.5 per cent increase in the discount rates  applied at 30 June 2024 would result in a  decrease to the closure and rehabilitation  provision of approximately US$665 million, a  decrease in property, plant and equipment of  approximately US$457 million in relation to  operating sites and an income statement credit  of approximately US$208 million in respect of  closed sites. In addition, the change would result  in a decrease of approximately US$23 million  to depreciation expense and a US$21 million  increment in net finance costs due to unwind of  discount for the year ending 30 June 2025. Given the long-lived nature of the majority of  the Group’s assets, the majority of final closure  activities are generally not expected to occur  for a significant period of time.  However, a one-year acceleration in  forecast cash flows of the Group’s closure  and rehabilitation provisions, in isolation,  would result in an increase to the provision  of approximately US$231 million, an  increase in property, plant and equipment  of US$148 million in relation to operating  sites and an income statement charge of  US$83 million in respect of closed sites.  16 Climate change The Group recognises that warming of the climate is unequivocal, the human influence is clear and physical impacts are unavoidable. Identifying,  monitoring and assessing the actual and potential impacts of climate change is complex and the Group continues to develop its assessment of the actual  and potential financial impacts of climate-related risks (threats and opportunities), including the transition to a net zero economy and physical risk impacts. The Group’s current climate change strategy focuses on: 	 – building a portfolio to support the megatrends shaping our world, including future-facing commodities (copper, nickel and potash) and steelmaking  materials (iron ore and steelmaking coal) 	 – reducing operational (Scopes 1 and 2 from operated assets) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 	 – investing in low to zero GHG emissions technologies 	 – supporting Scope 3 GHG emissions reductions in the Group’s value chain and promoting product stewardship 	 – managing climate-related risks  	 – working with others to enhance the global policy and market response  Areas of these Financial Statements that may be impacted in connection with this strategy throughout the value creation and delivery cycle of the Group’s  operations, include: Phase Areas of potential Financial Statement impact Exploration and acquisition 	 – Financial impact of portfolio decisions Development and mining /  Process and logistics  	 – Impact of transition risks on asset carrying values 	 – Physical climate-related risks and asset carrying values 	 – Application of carbon pricing assumptions and acquisition of carbon credits 	 – Useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment 	 – Expenditure on operational (Scopes 1 and 2 from operated assets) decarbonisation Sales, marketing and  procurement 	 – Expenditure to support value chain (Scope 3) decarbonisation  Closure and rehabilitation 	 – Timing, scope and expected cost of closure and rehabilitation activities At the date of issue of these Financial Statements, indicators show the appropriate measures are not in place globally to drive decarbonisation at the  pace or scale required to achieve the aim of the Paris Agreement to limit the global average temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.  The significant judgements and key estimates used in the preparation of these Financial Statements reflect the Group’s current planning range (which  implies a projected global average temperature increase of approximately 2°C by CY2100), as described below.  1 Consolidated Financial Statements continued 162 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 165 ===== While not the basis of preparation of these Financial Statements, the  Group continues to perform sensitivity analysis under the Group’s 1.5°C  scenario to consider potential Financial Statement impacts of commodity  and carbon prices in a rapidly decarbonising world. The Group’s 1.5°C  scenario is not a forecast of what is likely to occur.  Future changes to the Group’s climate change strategy or global  decarbonisation trends may impact the Group’s significant judgements  and key estimates, and result in material changes to financial results,  cash flows and the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities in future  reporting periods. Financial impact of portfolio decisions Over recent years, the Group has repositioned its portfolio towards  commodities that can help enable and support the megatrends of  decarbonisation and electrification, urbanisation and population growth.  Refer to note 2 ‘Revenue’, which presents current and prior year  revenue by commodity. Key portfolio changes the Group has made in  FY2024 include: 	 – sanctioning of the Jansen Stage 2 potash investment (following approval  of Jansen Stage 1 in FY2022) 	 – further consolidation of the Group’s steelmaking coal portfolio  to concentrate on the higher-quality (grade) coals (which enable  steelmakers to be more efficient and operate with a lower GHG  emissions intensity) through the divestment of Blackwater and Daunia  mines from the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA) (following the divestment  of the Group’s interest in BHP Mitsui Coal in FY2022) In recent years, the Group also: 	 – completed the acquisition of OZ Minerals in FY2023 to support the  creation of a South Australia copper basin 	 – completed the divestment of the Group’s Petroleum business through its  merger with Woodside in FY2022 	 – divested the Group’s interest in the Cerrejón non-operated energy coal  joint venture in FY2022  Also in FY2022, the Group announced that it would retain New South  Wales Energy Coal (NSWEC) in its portfolio, seek the relevant approvals  to continue mining beyond the current consent that expires at the end of  FY2026 and proceed with a managed process to cease mining at the asset  by the end of FY2030. Following impairments recognised in previous periods, the net  carrying value of NSWEC at 30 June 2024 is approximately negative  US$200 million comprising property, plant and equipment (PP&E) of  approximately US$540 million and closure provisions and other liabilities of  approximately US$740 million. As at 30 June 2024, the potential exposure  to further impairment for NSWEC is limited to the book value of PP&E of  US$540 million, with the forecast cash flows over the proposed operating  period supporting the current carrying value. Further, the useful lives of  NSWEC PP&E do not exceed the remaining proposed operating period.  In July 2024, the Group announced that the Nickel West operations and  West Musgrave project (Western Australia Nickel) would be temporarily  suspended from October 2024. Refer to note 13 ‘Impairment of non-current  assets’ for further details. Impact of transition risks on asset carrying values  Significant judgements and key estimates in relation to the preparation  of these Financial Statements, including asset carrying values and  impairment assessments, are impacted by the Group’s current assessment  of the range of economic and climate-related conditions that could exist  in the world’s transition to a net zero economy, considering the current  trajectory of society and the global economy as a whole. For example, demand for the Group’s commodities may decrease  due to policy, regulatory (including carbon pricing mechanisms), legal,  technological, market or societal responses to climate change, resulting  in a proportion of a cash generating unit’s (CGU) reserves becoming  incapable of extraction in an economically viable fashion. Alternatively,  technological or market developments increasing demand for commodities  in the portfolio that help enable decarbonisation may have a positive  impact on prices for those commodities. The Group has developed three unique planning cases which comprise  the Group’s planning range: a ‘most likely’ base case, used as the basis for  judgements and assumptions in these Financial Statements, and an upside  case and downside case that provide the range’s boundaries. The three cases  reflect proprietary forecasts for the global economy and associated sub- sectors (i.e. energy, transport, agriculture and steel) and the resulting market  outlook for the Group’s core commodities. Given the complexity and inherent uncertainty of long run forecasting,  these pathways are reviewed periodically to reflect new information, with  a process in place to assess the need to update internal long-term price  outlooks for developments in the periods between pathway updates. The Group reflects the planning range and associated price  outlooks in the internal valuations used as the basis for the Group’s  impairment assessments.  The discount rate used in the internal valuations reflects a real post-tax  weighted average cost of capital (WACC), including country and state risk  premia where appropriate, and ranges from 7.0 per cent to 9.5 per cent  across the Group (2023: 7.0 per cent to 9.5 per cent). Cash flow forecasts  used as the basis for impairment testing include asset specific risks,  including climate-related risks such as operational interruptions as a result  of physical climate-related risks, and therefore the Group does not include  a separate climate-related risk adjustment in the Group’s WACC.  Further detail on the Group’s significant judgements and estimates that  inform the planning range and FY2024 impairment assessments, is  included in note 13 ‘Impairment of non-current assets’. In addition to the planning range, and as described below in ‘Paris  Agreement and 1.5°C scenarios’, the Group uses its 1.5°C scenario, which  implies a global average temperature increase of 1.5°C by CY2100, to test  resilience of the Group’s portfolio in a rapidly decarbonising world. Physical climate-related risks and asset carrying values The Group’s operations are exposed to physical climate-related risks.  In FY2024, the Group continued to progress studies of physical climate- related risks to better understand the potential impacts on safety, productivity  and cost, with the work to continue in FY2025. The studies consider potential impacts of acute and chronic risks from  material climate hazards, which differ based on an operated asset’s  geographic region, asset infrastructure and operational processes.  The studies are ongoing and therefore the Group’s consideration  of physical climate-related risks, including factors such as potential  operational interruptions caused by extreme weather events, therefore  includes only the Group’s current best estimates of related potential  financial impacts.  Given the complexity of physical climate-related risk modelling and the  status of the Group’s ongoing physical risk assessment process, the  identification of additional risks and/or the detailed development of the  Group’s response may result in material changes to financial results and  the carrying values of assets and liabilities in future reporting periods.  Application of carbon pricing assumptions and  acquisition of carbon credits The Group’s carbon credits and offsetting strategy is managed at the  Group level. However, investment decisions and asset valuations used for  the purposes of impairment testing consider carbon price assumptions  in relevant regions by applying a carbon price to estimated unmitigated  Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions over the life of the respective operation.   In determining the Group’s strategy and carbon price forecast, factors  including a country’s current and announced climate policies, targets  and societal factors, such as public acceptance and demographics, are  considered.

The Group’s plan is to achieve its FY2030 operational (Scopes 1 and 2 from  operated assets) GHG emissions target through structural abatement, but if  there is an unanticipated shortfall in the pathway to achieve the target, there  may be a need to surrender voluntary carbon credits to close the performance  gap. The Group will not use regulatory carbon credits when determining  whether it has achieved its FY2030 target. The Group may also sell carbon  credits, depending on internal use requirements, or originate carbon credits  through project development or direct investment. Acquired carbon credits are recognised as an asset initially at cost and are  subsequently subject to impairment and/or net realisable value assessments.  Classification of the asset reflects the intended manner of use: 	 – Inventory – where the intended use is uncertain or the carbon credit is  available for trading purposes (either separately or ‘bundled’ with sale of  a commodity); or  	 – Intangible asset – held for regulatory or voluntary surrender  Obligations arising from greenhouse gas emission schemes, such as the  Australian Safeguard Mechanism (which requires its largest industrial facilities  to surrender eligible carbon credits when their Scope 1 GHG emissions  exceed a progressively declining legislated limit, known as the baseline)  are recognised as a liability at the reporting date when the Group has  an obligation.  During FY2024, the Group surrendered approximately US$1 million in  carbon credits (~47,000 tCO2-e) to satisfy Australian assets’ FY2023  Safeguard Mechanism obligations. There were no voluntary surrenders. As at 30 June 2024, the Group recognised: 	 – Approximately US$23 million in carbon credits within intangible assets  (with no carbon credits classified as inventory). 	 – An obligation of US$17 million, representing the FY2024 requirement  to surrender eligible carbon credits under the Safeguard Mechanism.  The Group intends to satisfy this liability through the surrender of carbon  credits in FY2025. Useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment The determination of useful lives of the Group’s PP&E requires judgement,  including consideration of the Group’s climate change strategy, targets and  goals, decarbonisation plans and the possible impact of transition risks on  demand for the Group’s commodities.    Useful lives are reviewed each reporting period, including to ensure they do  not exceed the remaining expected operating life of the operation in which  they are utilised. The remaining lives of the Group’s operations reflect the  Group’s planning range and its underlying climate-related assumptions.    A key component of the Group’s operational decarbonisation strategy  is the displacement of diesel within the Group’s operations, particularly  the haul truck fleet. The Group is supporting the development of new  equipment by original equipment manufacturers, including entering  into partnerships focused on the development and trialling of electric  locomotives and haul trucks.    While technical and commercial development of the technology needed is  progressing, the Group’s operational plans generally assume replacement  of haul trucks, and other diesel powered equipment, at the end of their  useful lives in line with the Group’s regular fleet renewal programs.  For example, a significant proportion of the Group’s existing WAIO mining  fleet is due for replacement prior to the expected availability of battery  electric vehicle solutions. As such, the Group’s decarbonisation plans have  not had a material impact on the estimated remaining useful lives of the  Group’s existing fleet of assets in FY2024. Expenditure on operational (Scopes 1 and 2 from  operated assets) decarbonisation The Group set a medium-term target to reduce its operational GHG  emissions (Scopes 1 and 2 from operated assets) by at least 30 per cent  from the Group’s FY2020 baseline levels by FY2030 and a long-term goal  to achieve net zero operational GHG emissions by CY2050. The FY2020  baseline for the medium-term target and subsequent performance is  adjusted for acquisitions, divestments and methodology changes. While the Group’s operational GHG emissions increased in FY2024,  compared to FY2023, largely as emissions from organic growth exceeded  reductions from decarbonisation activities, the Group remains on track  to meet its FY2030 target. Operational decarbonisation activities during  FY2024 continued to focus on transitioning the Group’s electricity supply  to renewable sources and continuing to progress projects in relation to  displacement of diesel. Expenditure in relation to diesel displacement and  fugitive methane is expected to increase towards the second half of the  decade, with capital expenditure in these areas not material in FY2024. A significant proportion of the Group’s renewable electricity is currently  sourced through power purchase agreements and judgement is required in  determining the appropriate accounting treatment of such arrangements.  Depending on the specific terms and conditions, power purchase  agreements may be recognised as an expense when incurred, a financial  derivative or a lease liability, with an associated right of use asset. In addition to operational expenditure on renewable energy, the Group  recognised the following in relation to power purchase agreements at  30 June 2024:  	 – US$44 million of lease liabilities, with associated right of use assets  (2023: US$ nil) 	 – financial derivatives with a fair value of approximately US$92 million  (2023: US$50 million) Estimated future cash flows for the Group’s assets include amounts  associated with projects aimed at contributing to the achievement of  the Group’s medium-term target and long-term goal. These cash flow  estimates form the basis of the Group’s impairment assessments as  outlined in further detail in note 13 ‘Impairment of non-current assets’. The Group estimates up to US$4 billion (nominal terms) in spend  and commitments over the decade to FY2030 to execute the Group’s  operational decarbonisation plans. This amount incorporates capital  expenditure and lease commitments that were previously expected to  be classified as capital expenditure and reflects the incremental cost  to facilitate the Group’s reduction in operational GHG emissions (e.g.  the additional cost of buying or leasing an electric truck versus the diesel  combustion truck it would replace). Many of the projects planned to commence before FY2030 are likely to  extend beyond the Group’s medium-term target period and are expected to  make a substantial contribution towards the Group’s long-term goal of net  zero operational GHG emissions by CY2050. Significant expenditure on  fleet renewal at certain assets, for example Olympic Dam, is expected to  occur after FY2030. As the Group’s climate response is further integrated into business- as-usual planning, the spending on climate initiatives is expected to  increasingly form part of ordinary course business expenditures. Any change to the Group’s climate change strategy and future cash  flows could impact the expected level of expenditure on operational  decarbonisation and the associated Financial Statement significant  judgements and key estimates.  Expenditure to support value chain (Scope 3)  decarbonisation The Group continues to invest, including through partnership with others, in  potential GHG emissions reduction opportunities in its value chain through  technology innovation and development to support GHG emissions  reductions by steelmaking customers and in the maritime industry. However, while the Group seeks to influence reduction opportunities, Scope  3 emissions occur outside of the Group’s direct control. Reduction pathways  are dependent on the development, and upstream or downstream  deployment of, solutions and/or supportive policy and improvements in  Scope 3 emissions measurement. Where possible, the financial impact of  the Group’s activities in support of the development of Scope 3 emissions  reduction pathways is reflected in these Financial Statements. In FY2024,  this included expenditure of approximately US$30 million to support  collaborative partnerships, consortiums, research and development and  BHP Ventures investments. Given the inherent uncertainty in future technology and policy  advancements, it is not currently possible to reliably estimate or measure  the full potential Financial Statement impacts of the Group’s pursuit of its  Scope 3 goals and targets. Timing, scope and expected cost of closure and  rehabilitation activities The extent, timing and cost of the Group’s future closure activities may  be impacted by potential physical and transition climate-related impacts.  In estimating the potential cost of closure activities, the Group considers  factors such as long-term weather outlooks, for example forecast  changes in rainfall patterns. Closure cost estimates also consider the  impact of the Group’s climate change strategy on the costs and timing  of performing closure activities and the impact of new technology where  appropriately developed and tested. For example, closure cost estimates  largely continue to reflect the use of existing fuel sources for the Group’s  equipment while the Group continues to invest in the development of  alternative fuel sources and fleet electrification. 1 Consolidated Financial Statements continued 164 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 167 ===== The estimated cost of closure activities includes management’s current  best estimate in relation to post-closure monitoring and maintenance,  which may be required for significant periods beyond the completion of  other closure activities and is therefore exposed to potential long-term  climate-related impacts. While reflecting management’s current best  estimate, the cost of post-closure monitoring and maintenance may  change in future reporting periods as the understanding of, and potential  long-term impacts from a changing climate continue to evolve. Given the long-lived nature of the majority of the Group’s assets, the  majority of final closure activities are not expected to occur for a significant  period of time. However: 	 – 	Acknowledging the wide range of potential energy transition impacts  for steelmaking coal demand and the impact of any significant changes  in demand on mine lives, for illustrative purposes only, a one-year  change in the mine life of the Group’s steelmaking coal assets would,  in isolation, change the closure and rehabilitation provisions for those  assets by approximately US$40 million. 	 – 	The Group announced in FY2022 the planned closure of NSWEC  by FY2030. As such, while the provision is subject to estimation and  assumptions, the timing of closure is no longer considered materially  susceptible to potential long-term climate-related transition risks.  Further, while the Group is evaluating the approach to the closure of  NSWEC and potential expenditure relating to an equitable change  and transition for its workforce, the Group continues to engage with its  employees and the community to understand and develop the most  appropriate transition plan. As the Group’s approach is currently under  development with impacted parties, it is not yet supported by a detailed,  formal plan or commitment and therefore no provision relating to equitable  change and transition costs can be recognised as at 30 June 2024.  More detail on the key judgements and estimates impacting the Group’s  closure and rehabilitation provisions is presented in note 15 ‘Closure and  rehabilitation provisions’. Paris Agreement and 1.5°C scenarios The Group acknowledges that there are a range of energy transition  scenarios, including those that are aligned with the goals of the  Paris Agreement, that may indicate different outcomes for individual  commodities. As noted, indicators show the appropriate measures are  not in place globally to drive decarbonisation pathways at a pace or  scale required to limit the global average temperature increase to 1.5°C  above pre-industrial levels (particularly in hard-to-abate sectors, like  steelmaking). However, to the extent governments, institutions, companies,  and society increasingly focus on addressing climate change, the potential  for a non‑linear and/or more rapid transition trajectory increases. Accordingly, in addition to the Group’s planning range, which implies a  projected global average temperature increase of around 2°C by CY2100,  the Group utilises a range of scenarios, including a 1.5°C scenario, when  testing the resilience of its portfolio and major investment decisions.  In FY2024, the Group developed a new 1.5°C scenario, which does  not currently inform the Group’s planning range and intentionally uses  aggressive assumptions around political, technological and behavioural  change, particularly for hard-to-abate sectors, such as steelmaking. It is  designed to specifically test the Group’s current portfolio following changes  to its portfolio since the Group’s previous 1.5°C scenario published in the  BHP Climate Change Report 2020. The Group’s 1.5°C scenario is not a forecast of what is likely to occur and  represents one of many hypothetical pathways for the future based on  different assumptions relating to world-wide economies, including global  energy systems. While the Group does not currently see a 1.5°C outcome  as likely, a 1.5°C scenario is utilised to inform the Group’s understanding of  the potential impacts of an acceleration in global decarbonisation. All 1.5°C  scenarios require steep global annual GHG emission reductions, sustained  for decades, to stay within a 1.5°C carbon budget (i.e. the total net amount  of GHG emissions that can be emitted worldwide to limit global average  temperature increase to 1.5°C by CY2100). The Group continues to monitor global decarbonisation signposts and  updates its planning range, associated price outlooks and cost of carbon  assumptions. If such signposts indicate the appropriate measures are  in place for achievement of a 1.5°C outcome, this will be reflected in the  Group’s planning range. Capital allocation The Group includes a 1.5°C scenario sensitivity in capital allocation processes,  which compares the demand outlook for the Group’s products in the planning  range to that of a rapidly decarbonising global economy, should that eventuate.   Consideration of the Group’s 1.5°C scenario in the capital allocation  process is intended to test resilience of the Group’s portfolio and mitigate  the risk of stranded assets, and associated impairments, should global  measures to achieve a 1.5°C outcome be adopted.   Demand for the Group’s commodities The Group acknowledges that there are a range of possible energy  transition scenarios, including those that are aligned with the aims of  the Paris Agreement, that may indicate different outcomes for individual  commodities. The Group examines the resilience of its portfolio to a 1.5°C  scenario (the Group’s 1.5°C scenario) by considering the impact of the  commodity and carbon prices under that scenario using the Group’s latest  operating plans. There are inherent limitations with scenario analysis and it is difficult to  predict which, if any, of the range of scenarios the Group utilises might  eventuate and none of the scenarios considered constitutes a definitive  outcome for the Group. The Group’s 1.5°C scenario has a distinct impact  on each of its commodities with current trends impacting the degree  of likelihood of future outcomes aligning with different elements of the  scenario. However, based on current trends, it is considered unlikely that  the Group’s 1.5°C scenario would occur. As the electrification megatrend is well underway, there is a higher  likelihood of a positive impact to demand reflected in the Group’s 1.5°C  scenario eventuating for commodities which stand to benefit from this  megatrend, including copper, nickel and uranium.  The Group’s 1.5°C pathway for potash is driven by increasing competition  for land and the need for agricultural productivity.  The long-term commodity prices for potash, copper, nickel and uranium  under the Group’s 1.5°C scenario are favourable to or materially consistent  with the price outlooks from the base case of the Group’s planning range.  Price-only sensitivities using the prices derived from the Group’s 1.5°C  scenario do not indicate an illustrative impairment for those commodities.  However, the global steelmaking sector, like many hard-to-abate sectors,  is not currently seeing the investment, policy settings or technological  progress needed to align with the trajectory in the Group’s 1.5°C scenario.  The Group’s 1.5°C scenario assumes an aggressive decarbonisation  pathway for the steelmaking sector as a result of increased scrap  collection, progression or acceleration of currently challenging, evolving  or early-stage decarbonisation technologies and top-down government  policies. The current signposts do not indicate progress in line with  this trajectory. While GHG emissions intensity of steel production reduces significantly  in the Group’s 1.5°C scenario, underlying demand for steel (including the  proportion from ore-based steel production) remains strong. As such,  the price derived from the Group’s 1.5°C scenario for iron ore remains  materially aligned with the Group’s base case assumptions and does not  indicate an illustrative impairment. The assumptions within the Group’s 1.5°C scenario result in a greater  relative impact to steelmaking coal prices, compared to the base case  assumptions. Under the Group’s base case assumptions within the  planning range, headroom in excess of US$6 billion exists between the  carrying value of the Group’s steelmaking coal assets and their estimated  valuation. In a price-only sensitivity, using the prices derived from the  Group’s 1.5°C scenario, while current headroom would reduce, no  illustrative impairment of the Group’s steelmaking coal assets is indicated.  In addition, to provide further analysis of the risk of potential impairment  in a 1.5°C scenario, the Group has also performed a price-only sensitivity  for steelmaking coal assets under a 1.5°C scenario published by Wood  Mackenzie, a research and consultancy business for the global energy,  power and renewables, subsurface, chemicals and metals and mining  industries. This further analysis acknowledges the wide range of potential  energy transition impacts for steelmaking coal. Under the Wood Mackenzie 1.5°C scenario, reflecting the prices outlined  below, a price-only sensitivity would also reduce the current headroom  on the Group’s steelmaking coal assets, but does not indicate an  illustrative impairment. Price source CY2030 Price (real, US$/tonne) CY2050 Price (real, US$/tonne) Wood Mackenzie Net Zero  (1.5°C) Scenario (June 2024) 180 143 The Group considers that it is currently impracticable to fully assess all  potential Financial Statement impacts in scenario analysis. Accordingly,  these price-only sensitivities reflect different prices while assuming that  all other factors in the asset valuations, such as production and sales  volumes, capital and operating expenditures, carbon pricing and the  discount rate, remain unchanged from those used in the Group’s FY2024  impairment assessments. As such, the sensitivities do not attempt to  assess all potential impacts, including those on asset valuations, that may  arise under a 1.5°C scenario and do not consider any actions the Group  would take in respect of operating and investment plans to mitigate the  cash flow and valuation impacts that may arise in a 1.5°C scenario. 165 Operating and Financial Review Overview Additional Information Governance Contents Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 168 ===== Capital structure 17 Share capital BHP Group Limited BHP Group Plc 2024 shares 2023 shares 2022 shares 2022 shares Share capital issued Opening number of shares 5,065,820,556 5,062,323,190 2,945,851,394 2,112,071,796 Issue of shares 5,710,261 3,497,366 4,400,000  –  Corporate structure unification1  –  –  2,112,071,796 (2,112,071,796) Purchase of shares by ESOP Trusts (5,687,667) (6,442,571) (8,704,669) (63,567) Employee share awards exercised following vesting 5,841,767 6,081,843 8,522,684 77,748 Movement in treasury shares under Employee Share Plans (154,100) 360,728 181,985 (14,181) Closing number of shares 5,071,530,817 5,065,820,556 5,062,323,190  –  Comprising:  	 Shares held by the public 5,070,273,143 5,064,408,782 5,061,272,144  –  	 Treasury shares 1,257,674 1,411,774 1,051,046  –  1.

The Group monitors capital using the net debt balance and the gearing ratio, being the ratio of net debt to net debt plus net assets. The net debt definition includes the fair value of derivative financial instruments used to hedge cash and borrowings which reflects the Group’s risk  management strategy of reducing the volatility of net debt caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates. Under IFRS 16/AASB16 ‘Leases’, certain vessel lease contracts are required to be remeasured at each reporting date to the prevailing freight index.  While these liabilities are included in the Group interest bearing liabilities, they are excluded from the net debt calculation as they do not align with how  the Group assesses net debt for decision making in relation to the Capital Allocation Framework. In addition, the freight index has historically been volatile  which creates significant short-term fluctuation in these liabilities.  2024 2023 US$M Current Non-current Current Non-current Interest bearing liabilities  Bank loans  540 2,070 5,310 2,192 Notes and debentures  848 14,084 1,337 10,482 Lease liabilities 686 2,430 521 2,498 Bank overdraft and short-term borrowings 3  – 5  –  Other 7 50  –   –  Total interest bearing liabilities  2,084 18,634 7,173 15,172 Less: Lease liability associated with index-linked freight contracts 267 244 114 173 Less: Cash and cash equivalents  Cash 8,150  – 7,206  –  Short-term deposits 4,351  – 5,222  –  Less: Total cash and cash equivalents 12,501  – 12,428  –  Less: Derivatives included in net debt  Net debt management related instruments1 (171) (1,224) (113) (1,459) Net cash management related instruments2 (19)  – 36  –  Less: Total derivatives included in net debt  (190) (1,224) (77) (1,459) Net debt  9,120 11,166 Net assets 49,120 48,530 Gearing 15.7% 18.7% 1.

Operational, capital and regulatory requirements are considered in the management of liquidity risk, in conjunction  with short-term and long-term forecast information.  Recognising the cyclical volatility of operating cash flows, the Group has defined minimum target cash and liquidity buffers to be maintained to mitigate  liquidity risk and support operations through the cycle. The Group’s strong credit profile, diversified funding sources, its minimum cash buffer and its committed credit facilities ensure that sufficient liquid funds  are maintained to meet its daily cash requirements.  The Group’s Moody’s credit rating has remained at A1/P-1 outlook stable (long-term/short-term). The Group’s S&P Global’s rating has remained at A-/A-1  outlook stable (long-term/short-term). There were no defaults on the Group’s liabilities during the period. Counterparty risk The Group is exposed to credit risk from its financing activities, including short-term cash investments such as deposits with banks and derivative  contracts. This risk is managed by Group Treasury in line with the counterparty risk framework, which aims to minimise the exposure to a counterparty  and mitigate the risk of financial loss through counterparty failure. Exposure to counterparties is monitored at a Group level across all products and includes exposure with derivatives and cash investments. Investments and derivatives are only transacted with approved counterparties who have been assigned specific limits based on a quantitative credit risk  model. These limits are updated at least bi-annually. Additionally, derivatives are subject to tenor limits and investments are subject to concentration limits  by rating. Derivative fair values are inclusive of valuation adjustments that take into account both the counterparty and the Group’s risk of default. Standby arrangements and unused credit facilities The Group’s committed revolving credit facility operates as a back-stop to the Group’s uncommitted commercial paper program. The combined amount  drawn under the facility or as commercial paper will not exceed US$5.5 billion. As at 30 June 2024, US$ nil commercial paper was drawn (2023: US$ nil).  The facility is due to mature on 10 October 2026. A commitment fee is payable on the undrawn balance and interest is payable on any drawn balance  comprising a reference rate plus a margin. The agreed margins are typical for a credit facility extended to a company with the Group’s credit rating.

A significant proportion by value of the Group’s lease contracts relate to plant facilities, office buildings and vessels. Lease terms for plant facilities and  office buildings typically run for over 10 years and vessels from four to 10 years. Other leases include port facilities, various equipment and vehicles.  The lease contracts contain a wide range of different terms and conditions including extension and termination options and variable lease payments. The Group’s lease obligations are included in the Group’s Interest bearing liabilities and, with the exception of vessel lease contracts that are priced with  reference to a freight index, form part of the Group’s net debt.

Variable lease costs include contracts for hire of mining service equipment, drill rigs and transportation  services. These contracts contain variable lease payments based on usage and asset performance. Recognition and measurement All leases with the exception of short-term (under 12 months) and low-value leases are recognised on the balance sheet, as a right-of-use asset  and a corresponding interest bearing liability. Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments from the lease  commencement date and are subsequently adjusted to reflect the interest on lease liabilities, lease payments and any remeasurements due to, for  example, lease modifications or a change to future lease payments linked to an index or rate. Lease payments are discounted using the interest rate  implicit in the lease or, where the rate is not readily determinable, the interest payments are discounted at the Group’s weighted average incremental  borrowing rate, adjusted to reflect factors specific to the lease, including where relevant the currency, tenor and location of the lease.  In addition to containing a lease, the Group’s contractual arrangements may include non-lease components. For example, certain mining services  arrangements involve the provision of additional services, including maintenance, drilling activities and the supply of personnel. The Group has elected to  separate these non-lease components from the lease components in measuring lease liabilities. Non-lease components are accounted for in accordance  with the accounting policies applied to each underlying good or service received. Low-value and short-term leases are expensed to the income statement. Variable lease payments not dependent on an index or rate are excluded from  lease liabilities, and expensed to the income statement.  Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease  liabilities. The cost will initially correspond to the lease liability, adjusted for initial direct costs, lease payments made prior to lease commencement,  capitalised provisions for closure and rehabilitation and any lease incentives received. The lease asset and liability associated with all index-linked freight contracts, including continuous voyage charters (CVCs), are measured at each  reporting date based on the prevailing freight index (generally the Baltic C5 index). Where the Group is the operator of an unincorporated joint operation and all investors are parties to a lease, the Group recognises its proportionate share  of the lease liability and associated right-of-use asset. In the event the Group is the sole signatory to a lease, and therefore has the sole legal obligation  to make lease payments, the lease liability is recognised in full. Where the associated right-of-use asset is sub-leased (under a finance sub-lease) to a  joint operation, for instance where it is dedicated to a single operation and the joint operation has the right to direct the use of the asset, the Group (as  lessor) recognises its proportionate share of the right-of-use asset and a net investment in the lease, representing amounts to be recovered from the other  parties to the joint operation. If the Group is not party to the head lease contract but sub-leases the associated right-of-use asset (as lessee), it recognises  its proportionate share of the right-of-use asset and a lease liability which is payable to the operator. Key judgements and estimates Judgements: Certain contractual arrangements not in the form of a lease require the Group to apply significant judgement in evaluating whether  the Group controls the right to direct the use of assets and therefore whether the contract contains a lease. Management considers all facts and  circumstances in determining whether the Group or the supplier has the rights to direct how, and for what purpose, the underlying assets are used in  certain mining contracts and other arrangements, including outsourcing and shipping arrangements. Judgement is used to assess which decision- making rights mostly affect the benefits of use of the assets for each arrangement.  Where a contract includes the provision of non-lease services, judgement is required to identify the lease and non-lease components.  Estimates: Where the Group cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, estimation is involved in the determination of the  weighted average incremental borrowing rate to measure lease liabilities. The incremental borrowing rate reflects the rates of interest a lessee  would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, with similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use  asset in a similar economic environment. Under the Group’s portfolio approach to debt management, the Group does not specifically borrow for  asset purchases. Therefore, the incremental borrowing rate is estimated referencing the Group’s corporate borrowing portfolio and other similar  rated entities, adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions of the lease (including the impact of currency, credit rating of subsidiary entering into  the lease and the term of the lease), at the inception of the lease arrangement or the time of lease modification.  The Group estimates stand-alone prices, where such prices are not readily observable, in order to allocate the contractual payments between  lease and non-lease components. 1 Consolidated Financial Statements continued 172 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 175 ===== 23 Net finance costs 2024 US$M 2023 US$M 2022 US$M Financial expenses Interest expense using the effective interest rate method: Interest on bank loans, overdrafts and all other borrowings  1,467 997 491 Interest capitalised at 6.82% (2023: 5.71%; 2022: 2.90%)1 (530) (271) (113) Interest on lease liabilities 181 130 119 Discounting on provisions and other liabilities 1,064 1,293 645 Other gains and losses: Fair value change on hedged loans (214) (803) (1,286) Fair value change on hedging derivatives 188 691 1,277 Exchange variations on net debt  27 9 (99) Other 15 14 16 Total financial expenses 2,198 2,060 1,050 Financial income Interest income  (709) (529) (81) Net finance costs 1,489 1,531 969 1.

Recognition and measurement Interest income is accrued using the effective interest rate method. Finance costs are expensed as incurred, except where they relate to the financing of  construction or development of qualifying assets. 24 Financial risk management 24.1 Financial risks Financial and capital risk management strategy The financial risks arising from the Group’s operations comprise market, liquidity and credit risk. These risks arise in the normal course of business and  the Group manages its exposure to them in accordance with the Group’s portfolio risk management strategy. The objective of the strategy is to support  the delivery of the Group’s financial targets, while protecting its future financial security and flexibility by taking advantage of the natural diversification  provided by the scale, diversity and flexibility of the Group’s operations and activities. As part of the risk management strategy, the Group monitors target gearing levels and credit rating metrics under a range of different stress test scenarios  incorporating operational and macroeconomic factors. Market risk management The Group’s activities expose it to market risks associated with movements in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodity prices. Under the strategy  outlined above, the Group seeks to achieve financing costs, currency impacts, input costs and commodity prices on a floating or index basis.  In executing the strategy, financial instruments are potentially employed in three distinct but related activities. The following table summarises these  activities and the key risk management processes:  Activity Key risk management processes 1	 Risk mitigation On an exception basis, hedging for the purposes of mitigating risk related to specific and significant expenditure  on investments or capital projects will be executed if necessary to support the Group’s strategic objectives. Execution of transactions within  approved mandates. 2	 Economic hedging of commodity sales, operating costs, short-term cash deposits, other monetary items  and debt instruments Where Group commodity production is sold to customers on pricing terms that deviate from the relevant index target and  where a relevant derivatives market exists, financial instruments may be executed as an economic hedge to align the  revenue price exposure with the index target and US dollars. Measuring and reporting  the exposure in customer  commodity contracts and  issued debt instruments. Where debt is issued in a currency other than the US dollar and/or at a fixed interest rate, fair value and cash flow hedges  may be executed to align the debt exposure with the Group’s functional currency of US dollars and/or to swap to a floating  interest rate. Executing hedging derivatives to  align the total group exposure  to the index target. Where short-term cash deposits and other monetary items are denominated in a currency other than US dollars,  derivative financial instruments may be executed to align the foreign exchange exposure to the Group’s functional  currency of US dollars. Execution of transactions within  approved mandates. 3	 Strategic financial transactions Opportunistic transactions may be executed with financial instruments to capture value from perceived market   over/under valuations. Execution of transactions within  approved mandates. Primary responsibility for the identification and control of financial risks, including authorising and monitoring the use of financial instruments for the above  activities and stipulating policy thereon, rests with the Financial Risk Management Committee under authority delegated by the Chief Executive Officer. 173 Operating and Financial Review Overview Additional Information Governance Contents Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 176 ===== 24 Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk  The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its outstanding borrowings and short-term cash deposits from the possibility that changes in interest  rates will affect future cash flows or the fair value of fixed interest rate financial instruments. Interest rate risk is managed as part of the portfolio risk  management strategy.  The majority of the Group’s debt is issued at fixed interest rates. The Group has entered into interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps to  convert most of its fixed interest rate exposure to floating US dollar interest rate exposure. As at 30 June 2024, 97 per cent of the Group’s borrowings were  exposed to floating interest rates inclusive of the effect of swaps (2023: 98 per cent).  The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps in hedge relationships used to hedge both interest rate and foreign currency  risks are shown in the valuation hierarchy in section 24.4 ‘Derivatives and hedge accounting’. Based on the net debt position as at 30 June 2024, taking into account interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps, it is estimated that a  one percentage point increase in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) interest rate will decrease the Group’s equity and profit after taxation by  US$47 million (2023: decrease of US$58 million). This assumes the change in interest rates is effective from the beginning of the financial year and the  fixed/floating mix and balances are constant over the year.  Currency risk The US dollar is the predominant functional currency within the Group and as a result, currency exposures arise from transactions and balances in  currencies other than the US dollar. The Group’s potential currency exposures comprise: 	 – translational exposure in respect of non-functional currency monetary items  	 – transactional exposure in respect of non-functional currency expenditure and revenues  The Group’s foreign currency risk is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.  Translational exposure in respect of non-functional currency monetary items Monetary items, including financial assets and liabilities, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of an operation are restated at the  end of each reporting period to US dollar equivalents and the associated gain or loss is taken to the income statement. The exception is foreign exchange  gains or losses on foreign currency denominated provisions for closure and rehabilitation at operating sites, which are capitalised in property, plant  and equipment.  The Group has entered into cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forwards to convert its significant foreign currency exposures in  respect of monetary items into US dollars. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates are therefore not expected to have a significant impact on equity and  profit after tax. The following table shows the carrying values of financial assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period denominated in currencies other than the  US dollar that are exposed to foreign currency risk: Net financial (liabilities)/assets – by currency of denomination 2024 US$M 2023 US$M AUD (3,850) (4,168) CAD (543) (312) CLP (150) (74) GBP 323 353 EUR 239 217 Other 43 355 Total (3,938) (3,629) The principal non-functional currencies to which the Group is exposed are the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, the Chilean peso, the Pound  sterling and the Euro. Based on the Group’s net financial assets and liabilities as at 30 June 2024, a weakening of the US dollar against these  currencies (one cent strengthening in Australian dollar, one cent strengthening in Canadian dollar, 10 pesos strengthening in Chilean peso, one  penny strengthening in Pound sterling and one cent strengthening in Euro), with all other variables held constant, would decrease the Group’s  equity and profit after taxation by US$17 million (2023: decrease of US$15 million). Transactional exposure in respect of non-functional currency expenditure and revenues Certain operating and capital expenditure is incurred in currencies other than an operation’s functional currency. To a lesser extent, certain sales revenue  is earned in currencies other than the functional currency of operations and certain exchange control restrictions may require that funds be maintained  in currencies other than the functional currency of the operation. These currency risks are managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.  The Group may enter into forward exchange contracts when required under this strategy.  Commodity price risk  The risk associated with commodity prices is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy. Substantially all of the Group’s commodity  production is sold on market-based index pricing terms, with derivatives used from time to time to achieve a specific outcome. Financial instruments with commodity price risk comprise forward commodity and other derivative contracts with net liabilities at fair value of  US$42 million (2023: net liabilities of US$20 million).  1 Consolidated Financial Statements continued 174 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 177 ===== Provisionally priced commodity sales and purchases contracts Provisionally priced sales or purchases volumes are those for which price finalisation, referenced to the relevant index, is outstanding at the reporting  date. Provisional pricing mechanisms within these sales and purchases arrangements have the character of a commodity derivative. Trade receivables  or payables under these contracts are carried at fair value through profit or loss using Level 2 valuation inputs based on forecast selling prices in  the quotation period. The Group’s exposure at 30 June 2024 to the impact of movements in commodity prices upon provisionally invoiced sales and  purchases volumes was predominately around copper. The Group had 428 thousand tonnes of copper exposure as at 30 June 2024 (2023: 314 thousand tonnes) that was provisionally priced. The final price  of these sales and purchases volumes will be determined during the first half of FY2025. A 10 per cent change in the price of copper realised on the  provisionally priced sales, with all other factors held constant, would increase or decrease profit after taxation by US$299 million (2023: US$184 million).  The relationship between commodity prices and foreign currencies is complex and movements in foreign exchange rates can impact  commodity prices. Liquidity risk Refer to note 21 ‘Net debt’ for details on the Group’s liquidity risk.  Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss.  The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily from customer receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits  with banks and financial institutions, other short-term investments, interest rate and currency derivative contracts and other financial instruments. Refer to note 8 ‘Trade and other receivables’ and note 21 ‘Net debt’ for details on the Group credit risk.  24.2 Recognition and measurement  All financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives and trade receivables, are initially recognised at the fair value of consideration paid or received,  net of transaction costs as appropriate. Financial assets are initially recognised on their trade date. Financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value or amortised cost based on: 	 – the Group’s purpose, or business model, for holding the financial asset 	 – whether the financial asset’s contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest The resulting Financial Statements classifications of financial assets can be summarised as follows: Contractual cash flows Business model Category Solely principal and interest Hold in order to collect contractual cash flows Amortised cost Solely principal and interest Hold in order to collect contractual cash flows and sell Fair value through other comprehensive income Solely principal and interest Hold in order to sell Fair value through profit or loss Other Any of those mentioned above Fair value through profit or loss Solely principal and interest refers to the Group receiving returns only for the time value of money and the credit risk of the counterparty for financial  assets held. The main exceptions for the Group are provisionally priced receivables and derivatives which are measured at fair value through profit or loss  under IFRS 9. The Group has the intention of collecting payment directly from its customers in most cases, however the Group also participates in receivables  financing programs in respect of selected customers. Receivables in these portfolios which are classified as ‘hold in order to sell’, are provisionally priced  receivables and are therefore held at fair value through profit or loss prior to sale to the financial institution. With the exception of derivative contracts and provisionally priced trade payables which are carried at fair value through profit or loss, the Group’s  financial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost.  The Group may in addition elect to designate certain financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or to apply hedge accounting where  they are not mandatorily held at fair value through profit or loss. Fair value measurement The carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value is principally calculated based on inputs other than quoted prices that  are observable for these financial assets or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as unquoted prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Where no price  information is available from a quoted market source, alternative market mechanisms or recent comparable transactions, fair value is estimated  based on the Group’s views on relevant future prices, net of valuation allowances to accommodate liquidity, modelling and other risks implicit in  such estimates.  The inputs used in fair value calculations are determined by the relevant segment or function. The functions support the assets and operate under  a defined set of accountabilities authorised by the Executive Leadership Team. Movements in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities may be  recognised through the income statement or in other comprehensive income according to the designation of the underlying instrument.  For financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value, the Group uses the following to categorise the inputs to the valuation method used based on the  lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: IFRS 13 Fair value hierarchy Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Valuation inputs Based on quoted prices (unadjusted)  in active markets for identical financial  assets and liabilities. Based on inputs other than quoted  prices included within Level 1 that  are observable for the financial  asset or liability, either directly (i.e.  as unquoted prices) or indirectly  (i.e. derived from prices). Based on inputs not observable in  the market using appropriate valuation  models, including discounted cash  flow modelling. 175 Operating and Financial Review Overview Additional Information Governance Contents Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 178 ===== 24 Financial risk management continued 24.3 Financial assets and liabilities The financial assets and liabilities are presented by class in the table below at their carrying amounts.

A discounted cash flow approach is used to derive the fair  value of cross currency and interest rate swaps at the reporting date.  3.

In the case of US$532 million (2023: US$534 million) of fixed rate debt not  swapped to floating rate, the fair value at 30 June 2024 was US$538 million (2023: US$538 million). The fair value is determined using a method that can  be categorised as Level 2 and uses inputs based on benchmark interest rates, alternative market mechanisms or recent comparable transactions. For financial instruments that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels  in the fair value hierarchy by reassessing categorisation at the end of each reporting period. There were no transfers between categories during  the period. Offsetting financial assets and liabilities The Group enters into money market deposits and derivative transactions under International Swaps and Derivatives Association master netting  agreements that do not meet the offsetting criteria in IAS 32/AASB 132 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’, but allow for the related amounts to be set- off in certain circumstances. The amounts set out as cross currency and interest rate swaps in the table above represent the derivative financial assets  and liabilities of the Group that may be subject to the above arrangements and are presented on a gross basis. 1 Consolidated Financial Statements continued 176 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 179 ===== 24.4 Derivatives and hedge accounting The Group uses derivatives to hedge its exposure to certain market risks and may elect to apply hedge accounting. Hedge accounting Derivatives are included within financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.  Where hedge accounting is applied, at the start of the transaction, the Group documents the type of hedge, the relationship between the hedging  instrument and hedged items and its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The documentation also  demonstrates that the hedge is expected to be effective.  The Group applies the following types of hedge accounting to its derivatives hedging the interest rate and currency risks of its notes and debentures: 	 – Fair value hedges – the fair value gain or loss on interest rate and cross currency swaps relating to interest rate risk, together with the change in the fair  value of the hedged fixed rate borrowings attributable to interest rate risk are recognised immediately in the income statement. If the hedge no longer  meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the fair value adjustment on the note or debenture is amortised to the income statement over the period to  maturity using a recalculated effective interest rate. 	 – Cash flow hedges – changes in the fair value of cross currency interest rate swaps which hedge foreign currency cash flows on the notes and  debentures are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve. To the extent a hedge is  ineffective, changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement.  When a hedging instrument expires, or is sold, terminated or exercised, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any  cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is amortised to the income statement over the period to the hedged  item’s maturity. When hedged, the Group hedges the full notional value of notes or debentures. However, certain components of the fair value of derivatives are not  permitted under IFRS 9 to be included in the hedge accounting above. Certain costs of hedging are permitted to be recognised in other comprehensive  income. Any change in the fair value of a derivative that does not qualify for hedge accounting, or is ineffective in hedging the designated risk due to  contractual differences between the hedged item and hedging instrument, is recognised immediately in the income statement. The table below shows the carrying amounts of the Group’s notes and debentures by currency and the derivatives which hedge them:  	 – The carrying amount of the notes and debentures includes foreign exchange remeasurement to period-end rates and fair value adjustments when  included in a fair value hedge.  	 – The breakdown of the hedging derivatives includes remeasurement of foreign currency notional values at period-end rates, fair value movements  due to interest rate risk, foreign currency cash flows designated into cash flow hedges, costs of hedging recognised in other comprehensive income,  ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement and accruals or prepayments.  	 – The hedged value of notes and debentures includes their carrying amounts adjusted for the offsetting derivative fair value movements due to foreign  currency and interest rate risk remeasurement.

Some awards are eligible to receive a cash payment, or the equivalent value in shares, equal to the dividend amount that would have been earned on the  underlying shares awarded to those participants (the Dividend Equivalent Payment, or DEP). The DEP is provided to the participants once the underlying  shares are allocated or transferred to them. Awards under the plans do not confer any rights to participate in a share issue; however, there is discretion  under each of the plans to adjust the awards in response to a variation in the share capital of BHP Group Limited. The table below provides a description of each of the plans. Plan CDP  LTIP and MAP Shareplus Type Short-term incentive Long-term incentive All-employee share  purchase plan Overview  The CDP is a plan for Executive KMP and  members of the Executive Leadership Team who  are not Executive KMP.  Generally under the CDP, two thirds of the value of a  participant’s short-term incentive amount is awarded  as rights to receive BHP Group Limited shares at  the end of the vesting period (and the remaining one  third is delivered in cash). Two awards of deferred  shares are granted, each of the equivalent value to  the cash award, vesting between two and five years  respectively. Awards of deferred shares may also  be granted to members of the Executive Leadership  Team as additional retention awards with vesting  periods of up to five years.  The LTIP is a plan for Executive KMP and members of the Executive  Leadership Team who are not Executive KMP, and awards are  granted annually. The MAP is a plan for BHP senior management who are not  Executive KMP. The number of share rights awarded is determined  by a participant’s role and grade. Employees may  contribute up  to US$5,000 to  acquire shares  in any plan year.  On the third  anniversary of  the start of a plan  year, the Group will  match the number  of acquired shares. Vesting  conditions Service conditions only for the two-year award.  Vesting of the four-year awards are subject to  service and individual performance conditions.  Vesting of the five-year awards are subject to  service conditions and also to a holistic review of  performance at the end of the five-year vesting  period, including a five-year view on Safety and  Sustainability performance, profitability, cash flow,  balance sheet health, returns to shareholders,  corporate governance and conduct. LTIP: Service and performance conditions.  From FY2023 BHP’s Total Shareholder Return1 (TSR) performance  relative to two Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) market  indices, the MSCI World Metals and Mining Index (“Sector Group  TSR”) and the MSCI World Index (“World TSR”). The Sector Group  TSR over a five-year performance period determines the vesting of  67 per cent of the awards, while performance relative to the World  TSR determines the vesting of 33 per cent of the awards. For awards  granted prior to FY2023, TSR performance relative to a bespoke  sector peer group and the MSCI World Index determines the vesting  of 67 per cent and 33 per cent of the award, respectively. 25 per cent of the award will vest where BHP’s TSR is equal to the  median TSR of the relevant comparator group(s), as measured over  the performance period. Where TSR is below the median, awards will  not vest. Vesting occurs on a sliding scale when BHP’s TSR measured  over the performance period is between the median TSR of the relevant  comparator group(s) up to a nominated level of TSR outperformance  over the relevant comparator group(s), as determined by the Committee,  above which 100 per cent of the award will vest. MAP: Service conditions only. Service conditions  only.

For LTIP awards granted prior to unification and where the five-year performance period ends after unification, the TSR at the start of the performance period is based on the weighted  average of the TSRs of BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc and the TSR at the end of the performance period is based on the TSR of BHP Group Limited. 179 Operating and Financial Review Overview Additional Information Governance Contents Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 182 ===== 26 Employee share ownership plans continued Employee share awards  2024 Number of awards at the beginning of the financial year Number of awards issued during the year Number of awards vested and exercised Number of awards  lapsed Number of awards at the end of the financial year Weighted average remaining contractual life (years) Weighted average share price at  exercise date CDP awards 968,581 532,680 219,701 70,071 1,211,489 2.1 A$43.02 LTIP awards  2,558,796 564,431 520,443 177,078 2,425,706 2.2 A$43.02 MAP awards1 6,653,726 2,515,913 2,626,587 555,855 5,987,197 1.2 A$43.33 Shareplus 5,123,851 2,457,307 2,460,834 607,438 4,512,886 1.2 A$44.35 1.

Recognition and measurement The fair value at grant date of equity-settled share awards is charged to the income statement over the period for which the benefits of employee services  are expected to be derived. The fair values of awards granted were estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation methodology and Black-Scholes option  pricing technique and consider the following factors:  	 – exercise price 	 – expected life of the award 	 – current market price of the underlying shares 	 – expected volatility using an analysis of historic volatility over different rolling periods. For the LTIP, it is calculated for all sector comparators and the  published MSCI World Index 	 – expected dividends 	 – risk-free interest rate, which is an applicable government bond rate 	 – market-based performance hurdles 	 – non-vesting conditions Where awards are forfeited because non-market-based vesting conditions are not satisfied, the expense previously recognised is  proportionately reversed.  The tax effect of awards granted is recognised in income tax expense, except to the extent that the total tax deductions are expected to exceed the  cumulative remuneration expense. In this situation, the excess of the associated current or deferred tax is recognised in equity and forms part of the  employee share awards reserve. The fair value of awards as presented in the tables above represents the fair value at grant date.  In respect of employee share awards, the Group utilises the BHP Group Limited Employee Equity Trust. The trustee of this trust is an independent  company, resident in Jersey. The trust uses funds provided by the Group to acquire ordinary shares to enable awards to be made or satisfied.  The ordinary shares may be acquired by purchase in the market or by subscription at not less than nominal value. 1 Consolidated Financial Statements continued 180 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 183 ===== 27 Employee benefits, restructuring and post-retirement employee benefits provisions 2024 US$M 2023 US$M Employee benefits1 1,698 1,749 Restructuring2 45 28 Post-retirement employee benefits3  300 373 Total provisions  2,043 2,150 Comprising: 	 Current 1,677 1,734 	 Non-current 366 416 2024 Employee  benefits US$M Restructuring US$M Post-retirement  employee benefits3 US$M Total US$M At the beginning of the financial year 1,749 28 373 2,150 Charge/(credit) for the year: 	 Underlying 1,375 55 65 1,495 	 Discounting  –  – 21 21 	 Yield on defined benefit scheme assets  –  – (4) (4) 	 Exchange variations (21)  – (45) (66) 	 Released during the year (98) (10) (1) (109) Remeasurement gains taken to retained earnings  –  – (41) (41) Utilisation (1,268) (27) (68) (1,363) Divestment of subsidiaries and operations4  (39)  –  – (39) Transfers and other movements  – (1)  – (1) At the end of the financial year 1,698 45 300 2,043 1.

Recognition and measurement Provisions are recognised by the Group when: 	 – there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events 	 – it is more likely than not that a permanent outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation 	 – the amount can be reliably estimated and measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the cash outflow required to settle the  obligation at the reporting date 181 Operating and Financial Review Overview Additional Information Governance Contents Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 184 ===== 27 Employee benefits, restructuring and post-retirement employee benefits provisions continued Provision Description Employee benefits Liabilities for benefits accruing to employees up until the reporting date in respect of wages and salaries, annual leave and any  accumulating sick leave are recognised in the period the related service is rendered.  Liabilities recognised in respect of short-term employee benefits expected to be settled within 12 months are measured at the  amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. Liabilities for other long-term employee benefits, including long service leave, are measured as the present value of estimated future  payments for the services provided by employees up to the reporting date. Liabilities that are not expected to be settled within 12 months are discounted at the reporting date using market yields of high-quality  corporate bonds or government bonds for countries where there is no deep market for corporate bonds. The rates used reflect the  terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows. In relation to industry-based long service leave funds, the Group’s liability, including obligations for funding shortfalls, is determined  after deducting the fair value of dedicated assets of such funds. Liabilities for short and long-term employee benefits (other than unpaid wages and salaries) are disclosed within employee benefits.  Other liabilities for unpaid wages and salaries related to the current period are recognised in other creditors. Review of employee allowances and entitlements On 1 June 2023, the Group disclosed the identification of two issues with certain allowances and entitlements affecting a number  of current and former employees in Australia. The identified issues relate to rostered employees having leave incorrectly deducted  on public holidays since 2010 (leave issue) and certain employees at Port Hedland being eligible for additional allowances due to an  error with the employing entity in their employment documentation (employing entity issue). The Group self-reported the issues to the  Fair Work Ombudsman in Australia.  Since the date of the announcement, the Group has recredited leave hours to current employees and begun making payments to  former employees who were impacted by the leave issue.   The Group has also commenced making payments to current and former employees for historical impacts of the employing entity  issue in the first quarter of FY2025.  The Group’s best estimate of the remaining cost of remediating the two issues, incorporating on-costs, including associated  superannuation and interest payments (BHP share) is reflected in employee benefit provisions at 30 June 2024.  There remains a risk that other instances of non-compliance requiring remediation may be identified through the Group’s review  processes and associated provisions may be recognised in future reporting periods. Restructuring Restructuring provisions are recognised when:  	 – the Group has developed a detailed formal plan identifying the business or part of the business concerned, the location and  approximate number of employees affected, a detailed estimate of the associated costs, and an appropriate timeline 	 – the restructuring has either commenced or been publicly announced and can no longer be withdrawn Payments that are not expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date are measured at the present value of the  estimated future cash payments expected to be made by the Group. Post-retirement  employee benefits  Defined contribution pension schemes and multi-employer pension schemes For defined contribution schemes or schemes operated on an industry-wide basis where it is not possible to identify assets  attributable to the participation by the Group’s employees, the pension charge is calculated on the basis of contributions payable.  The Group contributed US$368 million during the financial year (2023: US$358 million; 2022: US$324 million) to defined contribution  plans and multi-employer defined contribution plans. These contributions are expensed as incurred. Defined benefit pension and post-retirement medical schemes The Group operates or participates in a number of defined benefit pension schemes throughout the world, all of which are closed to  new entrants. The funding of the schemes complies with local regulations. The assets of the schemes are generally held separately  from those of the Group and are administered by trustees or management boards. The Group also operates a number of unfunded  post-retirement medical schemes in the United States, Canada and Europe.  For defined benefit schemes, an asset or liability is recognised in the balance sheet based at the present value of defined benefit  obligations less, where funded, the fair value of plan assets, except that any such asset cannot exceed the present value of expected  refunds from and reductions in future contributions to the plan. Full actuarial valuations are prepared by local actuaries for all  schemes, using discount rates based on market yields at the reporting date on high-quality corporate bonds or by reference to  national government bonds if high-quality corporate bonds are not available.  Where funded, scheme assets are invested in a diversified range of asset classes, predominantly comprising bonds and equities. 1 Consolidated Financial Statements continued 182 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 185 ===== Group and related party information 28 Discontinued operations On 1 June 2022 (Completion date) BHP completed the merger of the Group’s oil and gas portfolio with Woodside Energy Group Limited (‘Woodside’).  Woodside acquired the entire share capital of BHP Petroleum International Pty Ltd (‘BHP Petroleum’) in exchange for 914,768,948 newly issued  Woodside ordinary shares.  On the Completion Date, the Group paid a fully franked in specie dividend in the form of Woodside shares to eligible BHP shareholders. Eligible BHP  shareholders received one Woodside share for every 5.5340 BHP shares they held on the Group’s register at the record date of 26 May 2022.  As part of completion and in order to reflect the economic effective date of 1 July 2021, the Group made a net cash payment of US$0.7 billion (net of  completion adjustments) to Woodside in addition to US$0.4 billion in cash that was left in the BHP Petroleum bank accounts to fund ongoing operations.  The total cash transfer of US$1.1 billion reflected the net cash flows generated by BHP Petroleum between 1 July 2021 and Completion Date adjusted for  dividends Woodside would have paid on the newly issued Woodside ordinary shares, had the Merger completed on 1 July 2021.  There was no contribution of Discontinued operations to the Group’s profit and cash flows for years ended 30 June 2024 and 30 June 2023.  The Blackwater and Daunia mines, while being divested on 2 April 2024, are not considered to meet the criteria for classification as a Discontinued  operation given their relative size to the Group and the Coal segment. For further information, refer to note 3 ‘Exceptional items’. The contribution of Discontinued operations for the year ended 30 June 2022 is detailed below: Income statement – Discontinued operations 2022 US$M Profit/(loss) after taxation from operating activities 2,496 Net gain on Petroleum merger with Woodside (after tax) 8,159 Profit/(loss) after taxation 10,655 	 Attributable to non-controlling interests  –  	 Attributable to BHP shareholders 10,655 Basic earnings/(loss) per ordinary share (cents) 210.5 Diluted earnings/(loss) per ordinary share (cents) 210.1 The total comprehensive income attributable to BHP shareholders from Discontinued operations was a gain of US$10,596 million for the year ended  30 June 2022.

Exceptional items – Discontinued operations Exceptional items are those gains or losses where their nature, including the expected frequency of the events giving rise to them, and impact is considered  material to the Financial Statements.  There were no exceptional items related to Discontinued operations for years ended 30 June 2024 and 30 June 2023. The Exceptional item related to Discontinued operations included within the Group’s profits for the year ended 30 June 2022 is detailed below.

The tax expense associated with the exceptional item reflects the tax impact of transaction costs and other restructuring related activities undertaken pre-merger. There were no further  tax impacts arising on the net gain on merger of our Petroleum business with Woodside as generated tax losses were either offset with capital gains in other entities in the Group, or not  recognised on the basis that it is not probable that future capital gains will be available against which the Group can utilise the tax losses. 183 Operating and Financial Review Overview Additional Information Governance Contents Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 186 ===== 28 Discontinued operations continued Net gain on disposal of Discontinued operations Details of the net gain on Petroleum merger with Woodside is presented below:  2022 US$M Net assets disposed 10,172 Fair value of Woodside shares1 19,566 Net cash completion payment on merger of Petroleum with Woodside2 (683) Foreign currency translation reserve transferred to the income statement 54 Other provisions and related indemnities recognised at completion (353) Transaction and other directly attributable costs (245) Income tax expense (8) Net gain on Petroleum merger with Woodside 8,159 1.

Business combination during the year ended 30 June 2023 OZ Minerals Limited On 2 May 2023 (Acquisition Date), the Group acquired 100 per cent of the issued share capital of OZ Minerals Limited (OZL) for a net cash consideration  of US$5.9 billion. The terms of the acquisition did not include any contingent consideration.  The Group had 12 months from the acquisition date to make adjustments in the current period to the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and the  resultant value of goodwill with no restatement of comparative information. As at 2 May 2024, the Group finalised the purchase price allocation which has  resulted in a net increase of US$2 million in goodwill from the provisional amount reported at 30 June 2023.  Details of the business combination are as follows:  Final  Fair value US$M Assets Cash and cash equivalents 104 Trade and other receivables1 77 Other financial assets 7 Inventories 329 Property, plant and equipment 7,661 Intangible assets – goodwill 194 Current tax receivable 36 Other assets 25 Total assets 8,433 Liabilities Trade and other payables 242 Interest bearing liabilities 1,111 Deferred tax liabilities2 850 Provisions 258 Total liabilities 2,461 Identifiable net assets acquired 5,972 Total consideration paid3 4 5,972 Cash and cash equivalents acquired (104) Net cash consideration paid 5,868 1.	 This represents the gross contractual amount for trade and other receivables all of which is expected to be collected. 2.	 This primarily represents the difference between the fair value of the mineral rights acquired and the corresponding tax base. 3.	 The Group executed a forward exchange contract to hedge the foreign exchange exposure on the consideration made in AUD. On maturity of the hedging instrument, a hedge loss of  US$35 million was capitalised to the cost of the acquisition. 4.	 The consideration paid by the Group was A$26.50 (at the average hedged exchange rate of AUD/USD 0.6681) per OZL share over 337,314,920 shares and excluded a special dividend of  A$1.75 per OZL share which was paid by OZL to its shareholders immediately prior to acquisition. Goodwill of US$194 million represented the excess of consideration paid above the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities. The goodwill primarily  arises from the deferred tax liability recognised at acquisition due to a difference between the fair value of mineral rights acquired and the corresponding  tax base.  None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.   During 2024, US$1,094 million of goodwill and property, plant and equipment recognised as part of the OZL business combination has been impaired.  Refer to note 13 ‘Impairment of non-current assets’ for information on impairments. 1 Consolidated Financial Statements continued 184 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 187 ===== Key judgements and estimates  Judgements: Judgement is required to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at acquisition date in a business  combination, which could have a material impact on goodwill. Estimates: The Group used the discounted cash-flow method to measure the fair value of mineral rights. Key assumptions used included  commodity prices, production volumes, life of mine, cash outflows (including operating costs, capital expenditure, closure and rehabilitation  costs and taxes), discount rates and risking factors. 30 Subsidiaries Significant subsidiaries of the Group are those with the most significant contribution to the Group’s net profit or net assets.

As the Group has the ability to direct the relevant activities at Minera Escondida Ltda, it has control over the entity. The assessment of the most relevant activity in this contractual  arrangement is subject to judgement. The Group establishes the mine plan and the operating budget and has the ability to appoint the key management personnel, demonstrating that the  Group has the existing rights to direct the relevant activities of Minera Escondida Ltda. 2.	 The Group has an effective interest of 92.5 per cent in BHP Iron Ore (Jimblebar) Pty Ltd; however, by virtue of the shareholder agreement with ITOCHU Iron Ore Australia Pty Ltd  and Mitsui & Co. Iron Ore Exploration & Mining Pty Ltd, the Group’s interest in the Jimblebar mining operation is 85 per cent, which is consistent with the other respective contractual  arrangements at Western Australia Iron Ore. 31 Investments accounted for using the equity method Significant interests in equity accounted investments of the Group are those with the most significant contribution to the Group’s net profit or net assets.

Instead, because the Group has the power to participate in the  financial and operating policies of the investee, this investment is accounted for as an associate. Samarco is jointly owned by BHP Billiton Brasil Ltda (BHP Brasil) and Vale S.A. (Vale). As the Samarco entity has the rights to the assets and obligations  to the liabilities relating to the joint arrangement and not its owners, this investment is accounted for as a joint venture. The Group is restricted in its ability to make dividend payments from its investments in associates and joint ventures as any such payments require the  approval of all investors in the associates and joint ventures. The ownership interest at the Group’s and the associates’ or joint ventures’ reporting dates  are the same. When the annual financial reporting date is different to the Group’s, financial information is obtained as at 30 June in order to report on an  annual basis consistent with the Group’s reporting date.

There are a number of matters, for which it is not possible at this time to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential future exposures, and for which no  amounts have been included in the table above. A contingent liability is a possible obligation arising from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by occurrence or non-occurrence of one  or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group. A contingent liability may also be a present obligation arising from past events  but is not recognised on the basis that an outflow of economic resources to settle the obligation is not viewed as probable, or the amount of the obligation  cannot be reliably measured.  When the Group has a present obligation, an outflow of economic resources is assessed as probable and the Group can reliably measure the obligation,  a provision is recognised. The Group has entered into various counter-indemnities of bank and performance guarantees related to its own future performance, which are in the  normal course of business. The likelihood of these guarantees being called upon is considered remote. The Group presently has tax matters, litigation and other claims, for which the timing of resolution and potential economic outflow are uncertain.  Obligations assessed as having probable future economic outflows capable of reliable measurement are provided at reporting date and matters  assessed as having possible future economic outflows capable of reliable measurement are included in the total amount of contingent liabilities above.  Individually significant matters, including narrative on potential future exposures incapable of reliable measurement, are disclosed below, to the extent that  disclosure does not prejudice the Group. Uncertain tax and   royalty matters The Group is subject to a range of taxes and royalties across many jurisdictions, the application of which is uncertain in some  regards. Changes in tax law, changes in interpretation of tax law, periodic challenges and disagreements with tax authorities, and  legal proceedings result in uncertainty of the outcome of the application of taxes and royalties to the Group’s business.  To the extent uncertain tax and royalty matters give rise to a contingent liability, an estimate of the potential liability is included within  the table above, where it is capable of reliable measurement. Samarco contingent  liabilities The table above includes contingent liabilities related to the Group’s equity accounted investment in Samarco to the extent they are  capable of reliable measurement.

The amendments introduced a temporary exception to the requirements of IAS 12 under which a company does not recognise or disclose  information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the proposed Pillar Two model rules.  At 30 June 2024, having applied the temporary exception in the prior reporting period, the Group is required to disclose the potential impacts of Pillar Two  income taxes. Refer to note 6 ‘Income tax expense’ for more information. Amendment to IAS 1/AASB 101 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ (IAS 1) On 1 July 2023, the Group adopted amendments to IAS 1 that require entities to disclose their material accounting policy information rather than their  significant accounting policies. The amendments did not significantly impact the Group’s Financial Statements. New and amended accounting pronouncements on issue but not yet effective IFRS 18/AASB 18 ‘Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements’ (IFRS 18) On 9 April 2024 and 14 June 2024, the IASB and AASB, respectively, issued IFRS 18 which will replace IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ for  reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027, with early application permitted. IFRS 18 introduces new requirements on presentation within the statement of profit or loss, including specified totals and subtotals. It also requires  disclosure of management-defined performance measures and includes new requirements for aggregation and disaggregation of financial information  based on the identified roles of the primary financial statements and the notes. Further, the classification of interest and dividends within the statement  of cash flows will change for some entities. Management is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 18 on presentation and disclosures in the Group’s  Financial Statements. A number of other accounting standards and interpretations have been issued and will be applicable in future periods. While these remain subject to  ongoing assessment, no significant impacts have been identified to date.  These pronouncements have not been applied in the preparation of these Financial Statements. 193 Operating and Financial Review Overview Additional Information Governance Contents Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 196 ===== In accordance with the requirements of Subsection 295(3A) of the Australian Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), set out below is the consolidated entity  disclosure statement disclosing information in respect of BHP Group Limited and entities it controlled at 30 June 2024.

Ernst & Young Rodney Piltz Partner Melbourne  27 August 2024 199 Operating and Financial Review Overview Additional Information Governance Contents Financial Statements A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation  ===== PAGE 202 ===== 5  Independent auditor’s report to the members  of BHP Group Limited Report on the audit of the financial report Opinion We have audited the financial report of BHP Group Limited (the Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively the Group), which comprises the  consolidated balance sheet as at 30 June 2024, the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated  statement of changes in equity and consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended, notes to the financial statements, including material  accounting policy information, the consolidated entity disclosure statement and the directors’ declaration. In our opinion, the accompanying financial report of the Group is in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including: a.	Giving a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 30 June 2024 and of its consolidated financial performance for  the year ended on that date; and b.	Complying with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), Australian  Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001. Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards (ASAs) and International Standards on Auditing issued by the International  Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for  the audit of the financial report section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of  the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for  Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have  also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our consideration of climate change	 The Group has assessed climate-related risks as threats and opportunities that have the potential to impact the financial statements as outlined in  Note 16 of the financial report. These risks and opportunities include both transition risks and physical risks arising from climate change and the  transition to a low carbon economy (climate change).   Our audit, with the assistance of our climate change specialists, considered the climate-related risks and opportunities that have the potential  to materially impact the basis of preparation, including the key judgements and estimates exercised by the Group in the preparation of the  financial report.  The Group has incorporated its current climate change strategy, including Board approved commitments and actions in the basis of preparation of  the financial report, reflecting the Group’s best estimate of the potential impact to the financial statements as at 30 June 2024. The impacts of climate change are most material to the judgements and estimates involved in the assessment of the carrying value of property, plant  and equipment and the determination of closure and rehabilitation provisions. Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report of the current  year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, but we do  not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in  that context. We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report, including  in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of  material misstatement of the financial report. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below,  provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial report. 200 BHP Annual Report 2024 A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation  ===== PAGE 203 ===== Assessment of the carrying value of property, plant and equipment Why significant    How our audit addressed the key audit matter Refer to Note 11 ‘Property, plant and equipment’ and  Note 13 ‘Impairment of non-current assets’.   Accounting standards require an assessment of  indicators of impairment and impairment reversal  annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment  exist, for each cash generating unit (CGU). The Group’s assessment of indicators of impairment  and impairment reversal included an evaluation of  geo-political risks, regulatory and legislative changes,  macro-economic disruptions, commodity price  forecasts, reserve estimates, forecast operating and  capital expenditure and asset performance. The Group  focused on the CGUs that were the most susceptible to  changes in key input assumptions. The key input assumptions in the Group’s determination  of indicators of impairment or impairment reversal, which  influence whether or not an estimate of the recoverable  amount of a CGU is required were as follows: 	 – Commodity prices: assumptions in relation  to commodity price forecasts are inherently  uncertain. There is a risk that the assumptions are  not reasonable and may not appropriately reflect   changes in supply and demand, including the impact  of climate change. 	 – Reserves: assessing the estimation of reserves is  complex as there is significant estimation uncertainty  in assessing the quantities of reserves, and the  amount that will be economically recovered based  on future production estimates over the asset life,  including the impact of climate change.  	 – Discount rates: given the long life of the  Group’s assets, CGU recoverable amounts  are sensitive to the discount rate applied.  Determining the appropriate discount rate to apply to  a CGU is judgemental. During the year, the Group determined that indicators  of impairment existed for the Western Australia Nickel  CGU, requiring an impairment test to determine  the recoverable amount of the CGU as disclosed in  Note 13 of the financial report.  The Group assessed the recoverable amount of the  Western Australia Nickel CGU using a Fair Value Less  Cost of Disposal methodology (FVLCD), as disclosed  in Note 13 of the financial report.  An impairment charge of US$3,800 million was  recorded for the Western Australia Nickel CGU.  The key input assumptions in the Group’s  determination of the recoverable amount are consistent  to those identified above.   The assessment of the indicators of impairment  or impairment reversal and recoverable amount  of the CGU was considered to be a key audit  matter as it involved significant judgement.  Auditing the recoverable amount of a CGU is complex  and subjective due to the use of forward-looking  estimates, which are inherently difficult to determine  with precision. There is also a level of judgement  applied by the Group in determining the key inputs into  these forward-looking estimates.  The Group’s current climate change strategy continues  to assess climate-related risks, including transition and  physical risks.  The Group’s current understanding of the potential  financial impacts of climate change have been  incorporated into the assessment of indicators of  impairment and impairment reversal, the results of which  are disclosed in Notes 13 and 16 of the financial report.   The primary audit procedures we performed, amongst others, included the following: 	 – We evaluated the design of, and tested the operating effectiveness of, the Group’s  controls over the assessment for indicators of impairment, impairment reversal and the  assessment of the recoverable amount of the Western Australia Nickel CGU.  	 – We performed an analysis for indicators of impairment and impairment reversal, which  included considering the performance of the assets and external market conditions.  Our procedures involved assessing the key inputs such as commodity price forecasts,  discount rates, reserve estimation, operating and capital expenditure, comparable  market data and asset performance.  	 – We evaluated the historical accuracy of prior year’s forecast cash flows by comparing  to current year’s actual cash flows. 	 – We considered the impact of geo-political risks, regulatory and legislative changes and  macro-economic disruptions as part of our evaluation of indicators of impairment and  impairment reversal.  	 – We involved our valuation specialists to assist in evaluating, amongst other matters,  the discount rates applied and commodity price forecasts. 	 – We assessed commodity price forecasts assumed by the Group against comparable  market data. The Group uses internal and external experts to provide geological, metallurgical, mine  planning and commodity price forecast information to support key assumptions in the  assessment of indicators of impairment or impairment reversal and determination of the  recoverable amount. With assistance from our mining reserves specialists, we examined the information  provided by the Group’s experts, including assessment of the reserve estimation  methodology against the relevant industry and regulatory guidance. We also assessed  the qualifications, competence and objectivity of the internal and external experts.  Our procedures to address the recoverable amount of the Western Australia Nickel  CGU included: 	 – Evaluation of whether the methodology applied complied with the requirements of the  relevant Accounting Standards; 	 – Assessment of the commodity price forecasts adopted with reference to broker and  analyst data; 	 – Assessment of the discount rate adopted, with reference to external market data; 	 – Determination of whether cash flow projections for operating and capital expenditure  agreed to approved budgets and forecasts and assessment of the reasonableness of  forecast cash flows against past performance of the CGU;  	 – Assessment of the impacts of climate change as set out in our climate change related  procedures below; 	 – Assessed how a market participant would attribute value under a FVLCD methodology; 	 – Performance of sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of reasonably possible  changes in key assumptions such as commodity price forecasts, discount rates,  production quantities, operating costs and capital expenditure; and 	 – Testing the mathematical accuracy of the impairment model and calculated  recoverable amount.  Climate change related procedures: With the assistance of our climate change and valuation specialists we undertook the  following procedures: 	 – Evaluated how the impact of climate change, as outlined in Note 16 of the financial  report, was reflected in commodity price forecasts and carbon price assumptions.   	 – Assessed how strategies to mitigate transition and physical risks, such as the Group’s  committed expenditure on decarbonisation activities, were reflected into the forecast  cashflows considered as part of the Group’s assessment of indicators of impairment  and impairment reversal. 	 – Assessed the accuracy of the Group’s disclosure regarding climate-related risks that  have the potential to adversely impact long term steelmaking coal pricing and the  carrying value of the Group’s steelmaking coal CGU.  	 – Considered the consistency of Other Information reported by the Group in relation to  its climate change strategy, with the key estimates adopted in the Group’s assessment  of indicators of impairment and impairment reversal and recoverable amount of the  Western Australia Nickel CGU.  	 – Assessed the adequacy of the Group’s climate change disclosures in Note 16 of the  financial report. We assessed the adequacy of the disclosures included in Notes 11 and 13 of the  financial report. 201 Operating and Financial Review Overview Additional Information Governance Contents Financial Statements A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation  ===== PAGE 204 ===== 5  Independent auditor’s report to the members of BHP Group Limited continued Closure and rehabilitation provisions Why significant   How our audit addressed the key audit matter Refer to Note 15 ‘Closure and rehabilitation provisions’.  The Group has closure and rehabilitation obligations to restore and  rehabilitate environmental disturbances created by its operations and  related sites.  These obligations arise from regulatory and legislative requirements  across multiple jurisdictions. The key inputs used to determine the required closure and rehabilitation  provisions are: 	 – Life of the operation or site; 	 – Estimated cost of future closure and rehabilitation activities;  	 – Timing of the closure and rehabilitation activities;   	 – Discount rates; and 	 – Current regulatory and legislative requirements.   As a result of these inputs and the evaluation of climate-related risks  and strategies, closure and rehabilitation provisions have a high degree  of estimation uncertainty with a wide potential range of reasonably  possible outcomes. Closure and rehabilitation provisions were considered to be a key audit  matter as the estimation of these provisions is complex, involves a high  degree of judgement including the impacts of climate change and often  requires specialist expertise to estimate the costs required to satisfy  closure and rehabilitation obligations. The Group’s current understanding of the potential financial impacts of  climate change have been incorporated into the related estimates, to the  extent they can be reliably measured, in the determination of the closure  and rehabilitation provisions, the results of which are disclosed in Notes  15 and 16 of the financial report. The primary audit procedures we performed, amongst others, included  the following: 	 – We evaluated the design of, and tested the operating effectiveness  of, the Group’s controls related to the determination of closure and  rehabilitation provision estimates.  	 – We evaluated the Group’s legal and regulatory obligations for  closure and rehabilitation, life of operation, future rehabilitation costs,  discount rates and timing of future cashflows.  	 – We assessed whether the future rehabilitation costs were consistent  with the closure plans prepared by the Group’s internal experts.  	 – We tested the mathematical accuracy of the closure and rehabilitation  provision calculations.  	 – We assessed the discount rates adopted to calculate the closure  and rehabilitation provisions, including benchmarking to comparable  market data.  	 – With the assistance of our rehabilitation subject matter specialists,  we evaluated a sample of closure and rehabilitation provisions for  operating and closed sites within the Group, including: 	 – Evaluation of the closure and rehabilitation plans with regard to  applicable regulatory and legislative requirements;  	 – Evaluation of the methodology used by the Group’s internal mine  closure engineers against industry practice and our understanding  of the business; and 	 – Assessment of the reasonableness of the timing of cash flows  and cost estimates against the closure and rehabilitation plan and  industry practice.  	 – The Group has used internal and external experts to support  the estimation of the mine closure and rehabilitation provisions.  With the assistance of our rehabilitation subject matter specialists,  we assessed the qualifications, competence and objectivity of the  internal and external experts and that the information provided by  the Group’s internal and external experts has been appropriately  reflected in the calculation of the closure and rehabilitation provisions. Climate change related procedures: With the assistance of our climate change and rehabilitation subject  matter specialists, we undertook the following procedures: 	 – Evaluated how physical risk has been incorporated into the  closure and rehabilitation provision estimates, such as the Group’s  current understanding of changes to long-term weather outlooks  and the potential to impact site closure designs and post-closure  monitoring activities.  	 – Evaluated the consistency of Other Information reported by the  Group in relation to its climate change strategy with the key inputs  used to determine the closure and rehabilitation provisions.  	 – For the Group’s steelmaking coal assets, we evaluated the potential  for climate change to shorten mine operating lives and therefore  impact the timing of closure activities.   	 – Assessed the reasonableness of the Group’s disclosure of the  Profile of closure and rehabilitation cashflows included in Note 16  of the financial report and the impact of a one-year acceleration to  the Group’s steelmaking coal closure and rehabilitation provisions  included in Note 16. We assessed the adequacy of the disclosures included in Notes 15 and  16 of the financial report. 202 BHP Annual Report 2024 A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation  ===== PAGE 205 ===== Samarco dam failure provisions recognised and contingent liabilities disclosures Why significant   How our audit addressed the key audit matter Refer to Note 3 ‘Exceptional items’, Note 4 ‘Significant events –  Samarco dam failure’ and Note 34 ‘Contingent liabilities’.  The provision at 30 June 2024 reflects the Group’s best estimate of  cash outflows required to resolve all aspects of the Federal Public  Prosecution Office claim, being reparation, compensation and moral  damages, and the Framework Agreement. Significant uncertainty remains around the resolution of the Federal  Public Prosecution Office Claim and the Framework Agreement  obligations, and there is a risk that outcomes may be materially  higher or lower than amounts reflected in the provision for the  Samarco dam failure. There were a number of significant judgements and disclosures  made by the Group in relation to the Samarco dam failure, including: 	 – Determining the terms of any potential future outcome of the  settlement negotiations; 	 – Quantifying the costs to resolve all aspects of the Federal Public  Prosecution Office claim, being reparation, compensation and  moral damages, and the Framework Agreement; 	 – Assessing the extent to which Samarco is able to directly fund  any future obligations relating to reparation, compensation and  moral damages;  	 – Considering possible outcomes of appeals relating to the judicial  decision regarding collective moral damages; 	 – Determining the status, accounting treatment and quantification  (if applicable) of the legal claims against BHP Group Limited, BHP  Group (UK) Ltd, BHP Billiton Brasil Ltda and Samarco; and 	 – Disclosures relating to the contingent liabilities from the various  legal claims and other circumstances that represent exposures to  the Group.  We identified the Samarco dam failure provisions recognised, and  contingent liabilities disclosures, as a key audit matter as auditing  these estimates is complex. There is a high degree of estimation  uncertainty, together with a wide range of reasonable outcomes.  Significant judgement was required in relation to assessing the  completeness and measurement of the estimated cash outflows  related to the provisions and contingent liabilities, including the  probability of the outflows. The primary audit procedures we performed, amongst others, included  the following: 	 – We assessed the design of, and tested the operating effectiveness of, the  Group’s controls over the Samarco dam failure accounting and disclosure  process. This included testing controls over: 	 – The determination of the provision for the settlement of the Federal  Public Prosecution Office claim and the Framework Agreement,  including significant assumptions in the estimate of amounts payable,  obligations to perform ongoing programs in relation to reparation and  compensation, and the period over which any amounts payable may  be made;  	 – The determination of the amount of funding Samarco is able to directly  contribute to fund any future obligations; and 	 – The Group’s assessment of the legal claims and determination of the  associated provision and related contingent liability disclosures. 	 – We assessed the key assumptions used to determine the provision  recorded by the Group in relation to potential obligations by: 	 – Understanding the impact of any court decisions on the Federal Public  Prosecution Office claim and the Framework Agreement;  	 – Determining whether or not it is possible to provide a range of  outcomes or a reliable estimate of any potential settlement outcomes;  	 – Inquiring with the Group’s subject matter experts regarding the cost  estimate to resolve all aspects of the Federal Public Prosecution  Office claim and to complete the various programs of work under the  Framework Agreement;  	 – Evaluating the qualifications, competence and objectivity of the  Group’s subject matter experts, and the independent external  party that contribute to the determination of the cash flow  estimates by considering their qualifications, scope of work and  remuneration structure; 	 – Comparing the nature and extent of remediation activities described in  the Framework Agreement and any new obligations under any potential  future settlement agreement, to the activities included in the cash  flow forecasts; 	 – Selecting a sample of cost estimates included in the provision and  considering the underlying supporting documentation;  	 – Assessing the extent to which Samarco is able to directly fund any  future obligations relating to reparation, compensation and moral  damages by: 	 – Comparison to Samarco’s business plan and our understanding of  the operations; and  	 – Performance of sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact  of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions such as  commodity price forecasts, debt refinancing scenarios and  tax contingencies; 	 – Testing the mathematical accuracy of the provision model; 	 – Assessing the period in which a provision change was recorded by  understanding when the event that caused the change occurred; 	 – Evaluating the historical accuracy of prior year’s forecasted cash flows  with respect to the Group’s current year actual cash flows; and  	 – Considering the claims and assessing their status and whether they  now represent liabilities through: 	 – Inquiries with the Group’s internal legal advisors, senior  management, Group finance, and members of the  Executive Leadership Team, with respect to the ongoing  settlement negotiations; 	 – Inspection of correspondence with external legal advisors; and 	 – Independent confirmation letters received from external  legal advisors. We assessed the disclosures regarding the environmental and legal  contingent liabilities as included in Note 34, and the relevant disclosures  regarding the significant events relating to Samarco dam failure as included  in Note 4 against the disclosure requirements of the relevant Australian  Accounting Standards. 203 Operating and Financial Review Overview Additional Information Governance Contents Financial Statements A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation  ===== PAGE 206 ===== 5  Independent auditor’s report to the members of BHP Group Limited continued Information other than the financial report and auditor’s  report thereon The directors are responsible for the other information. The other  information comprises the information included in the Company’s 2024  annual report, but does not include the financial report and our auditor’s  report thereon. Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information  and accordingly we do not express any form of assurance conclusion  thereon, with the exception of the Remuneration Report and our related  assurance opinion. In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility  is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the  other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report  or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be  materially misstated.  If, based on the work we have performed on other information obtained  prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a  material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report  that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of the directors for the financial report The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of: a)	the financial report (other than the consolidated entity disclosure  statement) that gives a true and fair view in accordance with  International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the IASB,  Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001; and b)	the consolidated entity disclosure statement that is true and correct in  accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to  enable the preparation of: i)	 the financial report (other than the consolidated entity disclosure  statement) that gives a true and fair view and is free from material  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and  ii)	the consolidated entity disclosure statement that is true and correct  and is free of misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for  assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing,  as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going  concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to  liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic  alternative but to do so. Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the  financial report Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the  financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether  due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our  opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is  not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the ASAs  and ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material  if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected  to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this  financial report. As part of an audit in accordance with the ASAs and ISAs, we exercise  professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout  the audit. We also: 	 – Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial  report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit  procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence  that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from  fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve  collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the  override of internal control. 	 – Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit  in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on  the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.  	 – Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the  reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures  made by the directors. 	 – Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going  concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence  obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events  or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability  to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material  uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s  report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such  disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions  are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our  auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the  Group to cease to continue as a going concern.  	 – Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the  financial report, including the disclosures, and whether the financial  report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner  that achieves fair presentation. 	 – Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial  information of the entities or business activities within the Group to  express an opinion on the financial report. We are responsible for the  direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain  solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters,  the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings,  including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify  during our audit. We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied  with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to  communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may  reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where  applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied. From the matters communicated to the directors, we determine those  matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial report  of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe  these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes  public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare  circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated  in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would  reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of  such communication. Report on the audit of the Remuneration Report Opinion on the Remuneration Report We have audited the Remuneration Report included in the Directors’  Report for the year ended 30 June 2024. In our opinion, the Remuneration Report of BHP Group Limited for  the year ended 30 June 2024, complies with section 300A of the  Corporations Act 2001. Responsibilities The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation and  presentation of the Remuneration Report in accordance with section  300A of the Corporations Act 2001. Our responsibility is to express an  opinion on the Remuneration Report, based on our audit conducted in  accordance with ASAs and ISAs.

The engineering  work and execution of procurement agreements is largely complete. In FY2025, underground and surface construction works will continue, including  structural, mechanical and electrical activities for the mill areas. We also expect to complete the conversion of the service shaft headframe to a  permanent structure. In FY2025, we estimate capex of US$1.3 billion for JS1 (FY2024: US$0.9 billion).  In October 2023, we approved an investment of US$4.9 billion for Jansen Stage 2 (JS2), which when combined with JS1, will increase our total planned  potash production capacity to approximately 8.5 Mtpa representing around 10 per cent of the estimated market when fully ramped up. JS2 execution  activity has now commenced and is 2 per cent complete, with first production expected in FY2029, followed by a three-year ramp-up period. In FY2025,  the focus will be on detailed engineering, procurement for major equipment and construction packages, and structural steel fabrication. In FY2025, we  estimate capex of US$0.5 billion for JS2 (FY2024: US$0.2 billion).

In July this year, we signed an agreement with Lundin Mining to jointly acquire Filo Corp. and to enter a  joint venture with the intent of developing the Filo del Sol and Josemaria copper projects. Capital and exploration expenditure of approximately US$10 billion is expected for FY2025, including approximately US$0.5 billion of exploration.  In FY2026 and the medium term,2 capital and exploration expenditure of approximately US$11 billion per annum on average is expected. We have  flexibility to adjust capital spend and phasing of projects to accommodate market dynamics and cash flow generation. Guidance is subject to exchange  rate movements.  1.

Reserves are a subset  of resources that can be demonstrated to be able to be economically and  legally extracted. In order to estimate reserves, assumptions are required  about a range of technical and economic factors, including quantities,  qualities, production techniques, recovery efficiency, production and  transport costs, commodity supply and demand, commodity prices and  exchange rates. The statement of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves  presented in this Annual Report has been produced in accordance with  the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) Listing Rules Chapter 5 and the  Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources  and Ore Reserves, December 2012 (JORC Code). Predicted sales prices, based on supply and demand forecast and current  and long-term historical average price trends, have been used. The Ore  Reserves tabulated are held within existing, permitted mining tenements.  Mineral leases are of sufficient duration (or convey a legal right to renew  for sufficient duration) to enable all reserves on the leased properties to  be mined in accordance with current production schedules. Ore Reserves  may include areas where some additional approvals remain outstanding,  however it is anticipated such approvals will be obtained within the  timeframe required by the current life-of-mine schedule. Declaration tables 	 – All Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves presented are reported in  100 per cent terms (unless otherwise stated) and represent estimates  as at 30 June 2024.  	 – Tonnes are reported as dry metric tonnes (unless otherwise stated).  All tonnes and grade/quality information have been rounded, so small  differences may be present in the totals.  	 – The Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources are inclusive of those  Mineral Resources modified to produce the Ore Reserves.  Other reporting jurisdictions  The information contained in this document is expected to differ from that  reported to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  in our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended 30 June 2024.  Mineral resources and mineral reserves reporting requirements for SEC  filings in the United States are set forth in S-K 1300. S-K 1300 requires  resources estimates to be reported exclusive of reserves estimates and both  reported only for the portion attributable to our interest in such resources  or reserves. In addition, specific disclosure requirements pertaining to  economic assumptions and interpretation of reasonable prospects of  economic extraction are expected to result in further differences between  the resources and reserves estimates presented in this document and those  to be reported in our Annual Report on Form 20-F.  Key differences in the estimation of our resources and reserves pursuant to  the ASX Listing Rules and S-K 1300 are the economic inputs, commodity  prices and cost assumptions. Estimates we report in accordance with the  ASX Listing Rules and JORC Code (2012) are generally based on cost  forecasts and internally-generated projected long-term commodity prices  and current operating costs or costs used in studies for development  projects. S-K 1300 requires mineral resources and mineral reserves  estimates to be based on a reasonable and justifiable commodity price  selected by a qualified person. The estimates reported in accordance with  S-K 1300 are generally based on the historical average costs and prices  over a timeframe of three years for production stage properties or, for  development stage properties, costs determined from first principles. Our resources and reserves estimates to be reported in our Annual Report  on Form 20-F are therefore not directly comparable to those presented  in this document and should be considered in relation to the differing  reporting and disclosure requirements of the jurisdiction under which they  are presented. Assurance and verification BHP has internal controls over our Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves  estimation efforts that are designed to produce reasonable and reliable  estimates aligned with industry practice and our regulatory reporting  requirements. The governance for our estimation efforts is located at  both the asset and the BHP Group level within our Resource Centre of  Excellence, an internal assurance team independent of our Competent  Persons and BHP employees who are responsible for the estimations.  The assets provide first-line assurance on estimates through peer  review and validation processes. The Resource Centre of Excellence is  responsible for assurance over the processes implemented by the assets  as they relate to Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves estimations and  the compiling of the estimates to be reported in accordance with the ASX  Listing Rules and JORC Code (2012). Our internal controls utilise management systems, including, but not limited  to, formal quality assurance and quality control processes, standardised  procedures, workflow processes, data security covering record keeping,  chain of custody and data storage, supervision and management approval,  reconciliations, internal and external reviews and audits.  Our internal requirements and standards provide the basis for the  governance over the estimation and reporting of Mineral Resources and  Ore Reserves and provide technical guidance to all reporting assets.  These internal requirements and standards are periodically reviewed and  updated for alignment with industry practice and reporting regulations. Our internal controls for exploration data, as they relate to Mineral  Resources and Ore Reserves estimations, are managed by our operating  assets with assurance provided by the Resource Centre of Excellence.  These include procedures and standards defining minimum requirements  of critical aspects to support exploration and resource development  programs, spatial quality control checks on measurement points (e.g.  collar, down-hole survey), quality control checks on samples, including  laboratory data quality checks, geological database reviews and back-up  routines and technical peer review across the data gathering, integration  and estimation processes. Our internal controls for Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves estimations  include, but are not limited to: 	 – source data review from database extracts, using exploratory data  statistical analysis prior to use in the estimation of Mineral Resources.  Identification of data to exclude outliers and visual checks against  estimation domains 	 – peer reviews of the estimation inputs based on statistical studies  and estimation parameters as applied in industry standard  estimation software 	 – visual and statistical validation of the estimates against source data and  where available reconciliation to previous models, operational models  and production data 	 – peer review of the classification applied, considering quantitative  measures and qualitative considerations 	 – peer review of assumptions applied that convert resources to reserves 	 – independent audits or reviews for new or materially changed Mineral  Resources and Ore Reserves Operating assets manage internal risk registers relating to uncertainties in  the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves estimates to direct future work  programs or estimation updates. These may include but are not limited to: 	 – areas of uncertainty in the estimates impacting local interpretations 	 – bulk density assumptions, based on sample testwork or  operational results 	 – metallurgical recovery assumptions, based on testwork or  plant performance 	 – changes in commodity prices, costs and exchange rate assumptions 	 – geotechnical and hydrogeological considerations impacting on  underground or open-cut mining assumptions 	 – ore loss and dilution, mining selectivity and production rate assumptions 	 – cut-off value changes to meet product specifications 	 – changes in environmental, permitting and social licence to  operate assumptions Further to assurance activities by the assets specifically relating to the  estimation of resources and reserves, the Resource Centre of Excellence  with subject matter experts has developed standards and guidelines  across BHP for reviewing and documenting the information supporting our  Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves estimates, describing the methods  used and verifying the reliability of such estimates. These activities are  supported by the following controls:  	 – The reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves estimates are  required to follow BHP’s standard procedures for public reporting in  accordance with current regulatory requirements.  	 – Annual risk reviews are conducted with Competent Persons and BHP  employees on all Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves to be reported,  including a year-on-year change impact assessment, reconciliation  performance metrics for the operating mines and a control assessment  for the estimation inputs. The information and supporting documentation  are prepared by the Competent Persons relating to the estimates and  evaluated for compliance with BHP’s internal controls. Based on these  reviews, recommendations of endorsement are provided to our senior  management for the use and reporting of the Mineral Resources and  Ore Reserves. 6  Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves 222 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 225 ===== 	 – Periodic internal technical ‘deep dive’ assessments of Mineral  Resources and Ore Reserves are conducted on a frequency that is  informed by asset materiality and outcomes of the annual risk reviews.  	 – Management and closure reviews of actions assigned to Competent  Persons and BHP employees resulting from the annual risk reviews and  technical ‘deep dive’ assessments are conducted. 	 – Assurance is undertaken over the reporting documentation provided by  Competent Persons for public release and management and verification  of inputs into the BHP Resources and Reserves reporting database.  The Resource Centre of Excellence also provides an annual update on  assurance activities and changes relating to our resources and reserves  estimation efforts to the Risk and Audit Committee (RAC) in connection  with the RAC’s responsibility over the effectiveness of systems of internal  control and risk management of BHP. Inherent risks in the estimation of Mineral Resources  and Ore Reserves  Estimated annual cash flows from our future operations, estimated  production schedules, estimated capital expenditure and operating costs,  estimated site closure costs, estimated royalty and tax costs, valuation  assumptions and interpretations of geological data obtained from drill  holes and other exploration techniques may not necessarily be indicative  of future results. The assumptions and interpretations used to estimate our  Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves may change from period to period,  and because additional geological data generated during the course of  our operations may not be consistent with the data on which we based our  Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, such estimates may change from  period to period or may need to be revised. No assurance can be given  that our Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves presented in this Annual  Report will be recovered at the grade, quality or quantities presented or  at all. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in the estimation of Mineral  Resources and Ore Reserves. Areas of uncertainty that may materially  impact our Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves estimates may include,  but are not limited to: (i) changes to long-term commodity prices, external  market factors, foreign exchange rates and other economic assumptions;  (ii) changes in geological interpretations of mineral deposits and geological  modelling, including estimation input parameters and techniques; (iii)  changes to metallurgical or process recovery assumptions which adversely  affect the volume, grade or qualities of our commodities produced (for  example, processing that results in higher deleterious elements that  result in penalties) or other changes to mining method assumptions; (iv)  changes to input assumptions used to derive the potentially mineable  shapes applicable to the assumed underground or open-pit mining  methods used to constrain the estimates; (v) changes to life of mine or  production rate assumptions; (vi) changes to dilution and mining recovery  assumptions; (vii) changes to cut-off grades applied to the estimates;  (viii) changes to geotechnical data, structures, rock mass strength, stress  regime, hydrogeological, hydrothermal or geothermal factors; (ix) changes  to infrastructure supporting the operations of or access to the applicable  mine site; (x) changes to mineral, surface, water or other natural resources  rights; (xi) changes to royalty, taxes, environmental, permitting and social  licence assumptions in the jurisdictions where we operate; and (xii)  changes in capital or operating costs. Estimates of Mineral Resources are subject to further exploration and  evaluation of development and operating costs, grades, recoveries  and other material factors, and therefore, are subject to uncertainty.  Mineral Resources do not meet the threshold for Ore Reserves modifying  factors, such as engineering, legal or economic feasibility, that would  allow for the conversion to Ore Reserves. Accordingly, no assurance can  be given that our Mineral Resources not included in Ore Reserves will  become recoverable Proved and Probable Ore Reserves.  This statement is based on and fairly represents information and  supporting documentation compiled by Competent Persons (as defined  in the JORC Code). All Competent Persons have, at the time of reporting,  sufficient experience relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of  deposit under consideration and to the activity they are undertaking to  qualify as a Competent Person.

Insurance or other  indemnification protection may offset the financial impact on the Group   of a successful claim. This section summarises the significant legal proceedings, investigations,  and associated matters in which the Group is currently involved or has  finalised since our last Annual Report.  Legal proceedings relating to the failure of the  Fundão tailings dam at the Samarco iron ore  operations in Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo  (Samarco dam failure)  The Group is engaged in numerous legal proceedings relating to the  Samarco dam failure. While there has been progress in priority areas,  such as individual compensation and indemnification for the damage  caused by the dam failure, it is not possible at this time to provide a range  of possible outcomes for all proceedings or a reliable estimate of potential  future exposures. BHP Billiton Brasil Ltda. (BHP Brasil) is a party to  approximately 42 ongoing public civil claims, of which 20 are suspended.  The most significant of these proceedings are summarised in this section  Additional information 8. There are numerous additional lawsuits against  Samarco relating to the dam failure to which the Group is not a party. Public civil actions brought by federal prosecutors  and agreements Several legal proceedings have been brought by government authorities  and civil associations claiming environmental and socioeconomic damages  and a number of specific remediation measures as a result of the Samarco  dam failure, including proceedings in which BHP Brasil is a defendant.  Among the claims brought against BHP Brasil are: 	 – the public civil action brought by the Federal Government of Brazil,  states of Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais and other public authorities  against Samarco and its shareholders, BHP Brasil and Vale S.A. (Vale)  in November 2015, seeking their joint liability for the full reparation of  environmental and socioeconomic damages arising from the Samarco  dam failure, in the amount of R$20 billion (approximately US$3.6 billion1)  (the R$20 billion Public Civil claim)  	 – the public civil action brought by the Brazilian Federal Public  Prosecutors’ Office against Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale, as well as  other public entities in May 2016, seeking R$155 billion (approximately  US$27.9 billion1) for reparation, compensation and social, individual and  collective moral damages in relation to the Samarco dam failure (the  R$155 billion Federal Public Prosecutors’ Office claim) A number of other proceedings to which BHP Brasil is a party are currently  suspended due to their connection with the R$20 billion Public Civil claim  and R$155 billion Federal Public Prosecutors’ Office claim.  Samarco, Vale, BHP Brasil, and other public authorities have entered into  agreements for the remediation of damages resulting from the Samarco  dam failure.   	 – In March 2016, Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale (Companies), entered  into a Framework Agreement with the Federal Government of Brazil,  the states of Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais and certain other public  authorities to establish a foundation (Renova Foundation) to develop  and execute environmental and socioeconomic programs (Programs)  to remediate and provide compensation for damages caused by  the Samarco dam failure. The term of the Framework Agreement  is 15 years, renewable for periods of one year successively until all  obligations under the Framework Agreement have been performed.  Under the Framework Agreement, Samarco is responsible, as a primary  obligor, for funding Renova Foundation’s annual calendar year budget  for the duration of the Framework Agreement. The amount of funding for  each calendar year will depend on the remediation and compensation  projects to be undertaken in a particular year and judicial decisions.  To the extent that Samarco does not meet its funding obligations  under the Framework Agreement, BHP Brasil and Vale have funding  obligations under the Framework Agreement, as secondary obligors,  each in proportion to its 50 per cent shareholding in Samarco in this  section Additional information 8.  	 – 	In June 2018, Samarco, BHP Brasil, Vale, the other parties to the  Framework Agreement, the Public Prosecutors’ Office2 and the Public  Defense Office3 entered into a Governance Agreement (ratified by the  Court on 8 August 2018), which settled the merits of the R$20 billion  Public Civil claim and established a process to renegotiate the Programs  over two years to progress settlement of the R$155 billion Federal  Public Prosecutors’ Office claim. Under the Governance Agreement,  renegotiation of the Programs is based on certain agreed principles,  including full reparation consistent with Brazilian law, the requirement for  a technical basis for any proposed changes, consideration of findings  from experts appointed by Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale, consideration  of findings from experts appointed by prosecutors and consideration of  feedback from impacted communities. In February 2021, the Minas Gerais State Prosecutor filed a public civil  action against Samarco, BHP Brasil, Vale and Renova Foundation  seeking the dissolution of Renova Foundation. The plaintiffs are  seeking R$10 billion (approximately US$1.8 billion1) for moral damages.  An injunction for the immediate intervention in Renova Foundation was  also sought, alleging the need to preserve information and documents  produced by Renova Foundation to evaluate criminal and civil  responsibilities. A ruling on the merits is pending. Since 7 January 2020, the Federal Court has issued several decisions  creating 14 enforcement proceedings and ruled on several proceedings  linked to the R$20 billion Public Civil claim and R$155 billion Federal Public  Prosecutors’ Office claim, including dismissal without prejudice of some  of the requests and proceedings. Issues covered by these proceedings  include, for example, environmental recovery, tailings management, human  health risk and ecological risk, resettlement of affected communities,  infrastructure and development, registration of certain impacted individuals  under the Programs, monthly emergency financial aid, loss of profit and  indemnities for people impacted by the Samarco dam failure, resumption  of economic activities, water supply for human consumption and hiring of  technical advisers to impacted people, Renova Foundation’s governance  and management system, and new areas allegedly affected by the dam  failure, including freezing orders requests. In October 2023, the Federal Court judge rendered a decision determining  that the Interfederative Committee (IFC), which is an external and  independent body responsible for supervising Renova Foundation and  its programs, holds the final authority to determine technical issues  concerning the reparation. This decision was confirmed by the Federal  Court of Appeals in April 2024, which upheld that Renova Foundation  and the Companies must comply with all IFC’s directions, which are  presumed to be valid and must prevail, unless the Companies and Renova  Foundation can present clear proof that they are illegal. In January  2024, the Federal Court rendered a decision (25 January decision) that  found Samarco, Vale and BHP Brasil jointly and severally liable to pay  collective moral damages in the amount of R$47.6 billion (approximately  US$8.6 billion1) (to be adjusted for interest and inflation). The decision  ordered that no payment should occur until the decision is final and  unappealable. In March 2024, the Federal Court found that the correct  historical amount due of collective moral damages is R$46.7 billion  (instead of R$47.6 billion). Samarco, Vale, and BHP Brasil appealed  the decision challenging the merits and amount of damages. In May  2024, the various government parties filed interlocutory appeals to the  25 January decision seeking increased damages and the ability to enforce  the judgment prior to it becoming final. The Federal Court judge and the  Federal Court of Appeals issued rulings denying the requests for early  enforcement. On 27 June 2024, the Federal Court judge dismissed without  prejudice certain claims directed at the Companies in the R$155 billion  Federal Public Prosecutors’ Office claim, on the grounds that they are  already covered by previous agreements and decisions (such as the  Framework Agreement). This decision did not dismiss the collective moral  damages decision outlined above and is subject to appeal. In June 2024, the Public Prosecutors’ Office and the Public Defense Office  filed a public civil claim against the Companies and Renova Foundation for  alleged gender discrimination against women in the reparation process.  They requested certain changes in Renova Foundation’s registration  program, damages and an injunctive relief to implement emergency  measures. On 14 August 2024, the Federal Court partially granted the  injunctive relief request and ordered Renova Foundation to allow the  review of the registration of all women who are either registered or have  pending registration applications in Renova Foundation. The decision is  subject to appeal. 8  Legal proceedings 1.	 Based on the exchange rate as at 30 June 2024. 2.

The negotiations are ongoing and the outcome is uncertain. The potential  liabilities resulting from current and future claims, lawsuits, proceedings,  enforcement actions and Framework Agreement obligations relating to  the Samarco dam failure, together with the potential cost of implementing  remedies sought in the various proceedings, cannot be estimated with  certainty at this time and there is a risk that outcomes may be materially  higher or lower than amounts reflected in BHP Brasil’s provision and  contingencies for the Samarco dam failure.  For more information on BHP Brasil’s provision and contingencies  for the Samarco dam failure refer to Financial Statements note 4  ‘Significant events – Samarco dam failure’ Civil public actions commenced by the State  Prosecutors’ Office in the state of Minas Gerais  (Mariana CPA cases) The State Prosecutors of Mariana have commenced several civil public  actions (CPAs) against Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale. On 10 December 2015, the State Prosecutors’ Office in the state of Minas  Gerais filed a CPA against Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale before the State  Court in Mariana claiming indemnification (amount not specified) for moral  and material damages to an unspecified group of individuals affected by  the Samarco dam failure, including the payment of costs for housing and  social and economic assistance (CPA Mariana I).  On 2 October 2018, the parties reached a settlement dismissing the claim,  which was ratified by the Court. Under this settlement, Renova Foundation  has reached more than 100 individual agreements with impacted families  in Mariana for the payment of damages. In connection with CPA Mariana I, the State Prosecutors (Minas Gerais)  started enforcement proceedings against Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale.  There are six enforcement proceedings under way, which among other  things seek (i) to set a deadline for completion of resettlement of the  residents of Mariana’s districts and for fines to be imposed for delays to  resettlement; (ii) to set the final term that will allow new households to join  the resettlement; (iii) payment of compensation to affected individuals  for delivery of houses below standard; (iv) to guarantee access to water  sources for the families of the collective resettlements; (v) payment of  fines for alleged delays in presenting proposals and making payments  to affected individuals; and (vi) payment of compensation to impacted  individuals who allege they have not yet received compensation and a  penalty for the alleged delays in making such payments.  In addition to CPA Mariana I, the State Prosecutors (Minas Gerais)  commenced other CPAs in Mariana against Samarco, BHP Brasil, Vale  and, in some cases, Renova Foundation. The claims presented in those  CPAs are related to damages that, according to the State Prosecutors,   are not covered by CPA Mariana I. As to those CPAs, there are proceedings that (i) have been settled  by the parties, including BHP Brasil, (ii) have been dismissed or (iii)  are still pending (9 in total). Renova Foundation is responsible for any  pending obligations set forth in the settlement agreements relating to the  CPAs and for complying with future awards eventually rendered in the  remaining CPAs. Civil public action commenced by Associations  concerning the use of Tanfloc for water treatment  (R$120 billion Associations claim) On 28 October 2021, the Vila Lenira Residents Association, State of  Espírito Santo Rural Producers and Artisans Association, Colatina Velha  Neighbourhood Residents Association, and United for the Progress of  Palmeiras Neighbourhood Association filed a lawsuit against Samarco,  BHP Brasil and Vale and others, including the State of Minas Gerais, the  State of Espírito Santo and the Federal Government. The plaintiffs allege  the defendants carried out a clandestine study on the citizens of the  locations affected by the Samarco dam failure, using Tanfloc, a tannin- based flocculant/coagulant that is currently used for wastewater treatment  applications. The plaintiffs claim this product allegedly put the population at  risk due to its alleged experimental qualities. On 17 November 2023, the Federal Court dismissed the lawsuit without  prejudice due to the Associations’ lack of standing to sue and the  defectiveness of the complaint. The Associations filed a motion for  clarification and the decision is still subject to appeal.  Indigenous Communities – Civil public action for  partial nullity of agreements In February 2024, the Federal Prosecutor’s Office filed a collective lawsuit  against the Companies, alleging that the settlement agreements entered  into between Renova Foundation and the Indigenous communities of  Tupiniquim Guarani, Mboapy Pindó, and Comboios contain nullities  regarding the release of monthly Emergency Subsistence Aid (ASE), and  requested an injunction ordering the Companies to continue to pay ASE  to the Indigenous Peoples of the Tupiniquim, Comboios, and Caieiras  Velha II, in the Indigenous Lands of Aracruz, State of Espírito Santo in  Brazil, following certain new rules, including an increase in the monthly  payment amount. On 4 March 2024, the Federal Court granted the  Federal Prosecutor’s request for a preliminary injunction, which was later  overturned in April 2024. As of 30 June 2024, a final decision on the merits  is pending. Other civil proceedings in Brazil As noted above, BHP Brasil has been named as a defendant in numerous  lawsuits relating to the Samarco dam failure. In addition, government  inquiries and investigations relating to the Samarco dam failure have  been commenced by the Brazilian Government’s representatives and are  ongoing, including studies regarding impact of the dam failure. BHP Brasil’s potential liabilities, if any, resulting from other pending and  future claims, lawsuits and enforcement actions relating to the Samarco  dam failure, together with the potential cost of implementing remedies  sought in the various proceedings, cannot be reliably estimated at this  time. Ultimately, these could have a material adverse impact on BHP’s  business, competitive position, cash flows, prospects, liquidity and  shareholder returns.  For more information on the Samarco dam failure refer to OFR 7 As of 30 June 2024, Samarco had been named as a defendant in more  than 87,200 small claims for moral damages in which people argue their  public water service was interrupted for between five and 10 days, of which  approximately 38,000 claims are still active. BHP Brasil is a co-defendant  in more than 24,300 of these cases.  The Brazilian Code of Civil Procedure provides that repetitive claims can  be settled through a proceeding known as the Resolution of Repetitive  Demands Procedure (IRDR). Under the IRDR, a court will hear a ‘pilot  case’ representative of such recurring legal matters and the judgment in  that decision will set a precedent for the resolution of similar cases in that  jurisdiction. An IRDR has been established in Minas Gerais and the court  in the pilot case has ruled that the mandatory parameter for resolution  of claims will be the payment of R$2,000 (approximately US$4001) per  individual claim for moral damages due to the suspension of public water  supply. Appeals before higher courts were filed. Meanwhile, as of 30 June  2024, Samarco has reached settlement in more than 18,200 individual  cases. On 21 May 2024, the Superior Court of Justice granted the State  Prosecutor of Minas Gerais request to declare null the IRDR due to the  alleged failure to satisfy the procedural requirements necessary for its  formal admissibility.  Samarco’s judicial reorganisation  On 9 April 2021, Samarco filed for judicial reorganisation (JR) with the  Second Business State Court for the Belo Horizonte District of Minas  Gerais (JR Court). On 28 July 2023, Samarco and one of its supporting  creditors filed a consensual plan (Consensual Plan), which provided,  among other things, that the agreements entered into between Samarco  and Brazilian public authorities in connection with the Samarco dam failure  will not be impaired by the Consensual Plan and Samarco will continue  to have the primary obligation to fund Renova Foundation. In addition,  pursuant to the Consensual Plan, between 2024 and full payment of the  debt owed by Samarco to the holders of the senior notes, Samarco is  permitted to fund remediation activities to Renova Foundation up to a  US$1 billion cap. This means that BHP Brasil and Vale will pay directly  or fund Samarco in the form of common equity in respect of remediation  obligations, including payments to Renova Foundation, in excess of  the US$1 billion cap. The JR Court confirmed the Consensual Plan on  1 September 2023. Following the confirmation of the Consensual Plan and  satisfaction of other conditions precedent set forth therein, the definitive  documentation formalising the consummation of Samarco’s financial debt  restructuring was executed on 1 December 2023. Samarco has paid the  majority of labour claims, suppliers and other non-financial creditors as  provided in the Consensual Plan. BHP Brasil participated in Samarco’s JR  proceeding in its capacities as a shareholder and creditor of Samarco. 8 Legal proceedings continued 236 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 239 ===== Class or group action claims BHP Group Limited and certain of its subsidiaries have been named  as defendants in class or group action claims related to the Samarco  dam failure. The most significant of those claims are summarised in the  bullets below.  	 – BHP Group Limited is named as a defendant in a shareholder class  action in the Federal Court of Australia on behalf of persons who  acquired shares in BHP Group Limited or BHP Group Plc (now BHP  Group (UK) Ltd) in periods prior to the Samarco dam failure. The amount  of damages sought in the class action is unspecified. A trial is scheduled  to commence in September 2025. 	 – BHP Group (UK) Ltd (formerly BHP Group Plc) and BHP Group  Limited are named as defendants in group action claims for damages  filed in the courts of England. These claims were filed on behalf of  certain individuals, municipalities, businesses and communities in  Brazil allegedly impacted by the Samarco dam failure. The amount of  damages sought in these claims is unspecified. In December 2022, the  BHP parties filed their defence and a contribution claim against Vale.  The contribution claim contended that if the BHP parties’ defence is not  successful and they are ordered to pay damages to the claimants, Vale  should contribute to any amount payable. A trial in relation to the BHP  parties’ liability for the dam failure is set to commence in October 2024.  	 – In January 2024, the BHP parties were served with a new group action  filed in the courts of England on behalf of additional individuals and  businesses in Brazil allegedly impacted by the Samarco dam failure.  The new action makes broadly the same claims as the original action  and the amount of damages sought in these claims is unspecified. In March 2024, a claim was filed in the Netherlands against Vale S.A.  and a Dutch subsidiary of Samarco for compensation relating to the  Fundão dam failure. The claim filed in the Netherlands indicates that  these claims were filed on behalf of certain individuals, municipalities,  businesses, associations, and faith-based institutions allegedly impacted  by the Samarco dam failure who are not also claimants in the UK  group action claims referred to above. BHP is not a defendant in the  Netherlands proceedings. In July 2024, BHP Group Limited, BHP Group (UK) Ltd, BHP Brasil Ltda  and Vale S.A. entered into an agreement – without any admission of  liability in any proceedings – whereby: (i) Vale will pay 50 per cent of any  amounts that may be payable by the BHP Defendants to the claimants in  the UK group action claims (or by the BHP Defendants, BHP Brasil or their  related parties to claimants in any other proceedings in Brazil, England or  the Netherlands covered by the agreement); and (ii) BHP Brasil will pay  50 per cent of any amounts that may be payable by Vale to the claimants in  the Netherlands proceedings (or by Vale or its related parties to claimants  in any other proceedings in Brazil, England or the Netherlands covered  by the agreement). The agreement reinforces the terms of the Framework  Agreement entered into in 2016 which require BHP Brasil and Vale to  each contribute 50 per cent to the funding of the Renova Foundation for  compensation of persons impacted by the Fundão dam failure where  Samarco is unable to contribute that funding. The BHP Defendants  withdrew the contribution claim against Vale in England as it is no longer  necessary given this agreement. Criminal charges On 20 October 2016, the Federal Prosecutors’ Office in Brazil filed  criminal charges against Samarco, BHP Brasil, Vale and certain of their  employees and former employees in the Federal Court of Ponte Nova,  Minas Gerais. On 3 March 2017, BHP Brasil and the charged employees  and former employees of BHP Brasil (Affected Individuals) filed their  preliminary defences. The Federal Court granted Habeas Corpus petitions  in favour of all eight Affected Individuals, terminating the charges against  those individuals. The Federal Prosecutors’ Office appealed seven of the  decisions with hearings of the appeals still pending. BHP Brasil remains  a defendant in the criminal proceeding. The evidentiary phase has been  concluded and Federal Prosecutors and defendants are expected to  present written closing arguments by August 2024. BHP Brasil rejects  the charges against BHP Brasil and the Affected Individuals and expects  to defend against the charges and fully support each of the Affected  Individuals in their defences of the charges.  In several civil proceedings the Federal Court has stated that Renova  Foundation has allegedly obstructed the adoption of reparation measures.  The judge ordered an official notice to be sent to the Prosecutor’s Office  to communicate his view on the need for an investigation into Renova  Foundation’s conduct. On 10 May 2024 the Public Prosecutor’s Office  publicly announced that they will conduct an investigation into Renova  Foundation, without specifying if civil or criminal liability for Renova  Foundation, BHP Brasil, Vale, Samarco or any individual will be sought. Legal proceedings unrelated to the   Samarco dam failure South African class action claim On 14 August 2023, an application to commence a class action was filed in  the High Court of South Africa on behalf of current and former mineworkers  (and the dependants of certain mineworkers). The mineworkers are alleged  to have contracted coal mine dust lung disease and to have worked on  specified coal mines in South Africa between 1965 and the filing date.  ‘BHP Billiton Plc Incorporated’ is named as a respondent, alongside  South32 SA Holdings Limited and Seriti Power (Proprietary) Limited.  The claims against the BHP entity relate to the period from 1999 to 2015.  The relevant businesses were divested in 2015 as part of the demerger of  South32 Limited. The matter is currently at the certification stage whereby the South African  Court must first grant permission for a class action to proceed. BHP,  South32 and Seriti have filed notices opposing certification. The amount  of damages sought by the Applicants on behalf of the putative class is  unspecified. BHP has notified South32 that it considers any liability to the  Applicants arising from the class action to be indemnified under the terms  of the Separation Deed agreed as part of the demerger of South32 in 2015.  1.

The Board may issue  shares on any terms it considers appropriate, provided that: 	 – the issue does not affect any special rights of shareholders 	 – if required, the issue is approved by shareholders 	 – 	if the issue is of a class other than ordinary shares, the rights attaching  to the class are expressed at the date of issue Restrictions on voting by Directors A Director may not vote in respect of any contract or arrangement or any  other proposal in which they have a material personal interest except in  certain prescribed circumstances, including (subject to applicable laws)  where the material personal interest: 	 – 	arises because the Director is a shareholder of BHP and is held in  common with the other shareholders of BHP 	 – 	arises in relation to the Director’s remuneration as a Director of BHP 	 – relates to a contract BHP is proposing to enter into that is subject to  approval by the shareholders and will not impose any obligation on BHP  if it is not approved by the shareholders 	 – 	arises merely because the Director is a guarantor or has given an  indemnity or security for all or part of a loan, or proposed loan, to BHP 	 – 	arises merely because the Director has a right of subrogation in relation  to a guarantee or indemnity referred to above 	 – relates to a contract that insures or would insure the Director against  liabilities the Director incurs as an officer of BHP, but only if the contract  does not make BHP or a related body corporate the insurer 	 – relates to any payment by BHP or a related body corporate in respect of  an indemnity permitted by law, or any contract relating to or containing  such an indemnity, or 	 – 	is in a contract or proposed contract with or for the benefit of or on behalf  of a related body corporate and arises merely because the Director is a  director of a related body corporate If a Director has a material personal interest and is not entitled to vote  on a proposal, they will not be counted in the quorum for any vote on a  resolution concerning the material personal interest. Loans by Directors Any Director may lend money to BHP at interest with or without security  or may, for a commission or profit, guarantee the repayment of any money  borrowed by BHP and underwrite or guarantee the subscription of shares  or securities of BHP or of any corporation in which BHP may be interested  without being disqualified as a Director and without being liable to account  to BHP for any commission or profit. Appointment and retirement of Directors Appointment of Directors The Constitution provides that a person may be appointed as a Director of  BHP Group Limited by the existing Directors of BHP or may be elected by  the shareholders in a general meeting.  Any person appointed as a Director of BHP Group Limited by the existing  Directors will hold office only until the next general meeting that includes  an election of Directors.  A person may be nominated by shareholders as a Director of BHP Group  Limited if: 	 – a shareholder provides a valid written and signed notice of  the nomination 	 – the person nominated by the shareholder satisfies candidature for the  office and provides written and signed notice of their willingness to be  elected as a Director and the nomination is provided at least 40 business days before the date of  the general meeting. The person nominated as a Director may be elected  to the Board by ordinary resolution passed in a general meeting. Retirement of Directors The Board has adopted a policy under which all Non-executive Directors  must, if they wish to remain on the Board, seek re-election by shareholders  annually. This policy took effect in 2011 and replaced the previous  system that required Non-executive Directors to submit themselves to  shareholders for re-election at least every three years. A Director may be removed from the Board in accordance with applicable  law and must vacate their office as a Director in certain circumstances set  out in the Constitution. There is no requirement for a Director to retire on  reaching a certain age. Rights attaching to shares Dividend rights Under Australian law, dividends on shares may be paid only if the  company’s assets exceed its liabilities immediately before the dividend  is determined and the excess is sufficient for payment of the dividend,  the payment of the dividend is fair and reasonable to the company’s  shareholders as a whole and the payment of the dividend does not  materially prejudice the company’s ability to pay its creditors. The Constitution provides that payment of any dividend may be made in  any manner, by any means and in any currency determined by the Board. All unclaimed dividends may be invested or otherwise used by the Board  for the benefit of BHP until claimed or otherwise disposed of according to  law. BHP Group Limited is governed by the Victorian unclaimed monies  legislation, which requires BHP to pay to the State Revenue Office any  unclaimed dividend payments of A$20 or more that have remained  unclaimed for over 12 months. 9  Shareholder information 238 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 241 ===== Voting rights For the purposes of determining which shareholders are entitled to attend  or vote at a meeting of BHP Group Limited and how many votes such  shareholder may cast, the Notice of Meeting specifies when a shareholder  must be entered on the Register of Shareholders in order to have the right  to attend or vote at the meeting. The specified time must be not more than  48 hours before the time of the meeting. Shareholders who wish to appoint a proxy to attend, vote or speak at  a meeting of BHP Group Limited on their behalf must deposit the form  appointing a proxy so that it is received not less than 48 hours before the  time of the meeting. Rights to share in profits The rights attached to shares of BHP Group Limited, as regards the  participation in the profits available for distribution that the Board  determines to distribute, are as follows: 	 – The holders of any preference shares will be entitled, in priority to any  payment of dividend to the holders of any other class of shares, to a  preferred right to participate as regards dividends up to but not beyond   a specified amount in distribution. 	 – Any surplus remaining after payment of the distributions above will be  payable to the holders of ordinary shares in equal amounts per share. Rights on return of assets on liquidation On a return of assets on liquidation of BHP Group Limited, the assets  of BHP Group Limited remaining available for distribution among  shareholders after the payment of all prior ranking amounts owed to  all creditors and holders of preference shares, and to all prior ranking  statutory entitlements, are to be applied on an equal priority with any  amount paid to the holders of BHP Group Limited ordinary shares.  Any surplus remaining is to be applied in making payments solely to  the holders of BHP Group Limited ordinary shares in accordance with  their entitlements.  Redemption of preference shares If BHP Group Limited at any time proposes to create and issue any  preference shares, the terms of the preference shares may give either  or both of BHP Group Limited and the holder the right to redeem the  preference shares.  The preference shares’ terms may also give the holder the right to convert  the preference shares into ordinary shares. Under the Constitution, the preference shares must give the holders: 	 – the right (on redemption and on a winding-up) to payment in cash in  priority to any other class of shares of (i) the amount paid or agreed to  be considered as paid on each of the preference shares; and (ii) the  amount, if any, equal to the aggregate of any dividends accrued but  unpaid and of any arrears of dividends 	 – the right, in priority to any payment of dividend on any other class of  shares, to the preferential dividend Capital calls Subject to the terms on which any shares may have been issued, the  Board may make calls on the shareholders in respect of all monies unpaid  on their shares. BHP Group Limited has a lien on every partly paid share  for all amounts payable in respect of that share. Each shareholder is  liable to pay the amount of each call in the manner, at the time and at the  place specified by the Board (subject to receiving at least 14 days’ notice  specifying the time and place for payment). A call is considered to have  been made at the time when the resolution of the Board authorising the call  was passed. Borrowing powers Subject to relevant law, the Directors may exercise all powers of BHP to  borrow money and to mortgage or charge its undertaking, property, assets  (both present and future) and all uncalled capital or any part or parts  thereof, and to issue debentures and other securities, whether outright or  as collateral security for any debt, liability or obligation of BHP or of any  third party. Variation of class rights Rights attached to any class of shares issued by BHP Group Limited can  only be varied where such variation is approved by: 	 – the company as a special resolution, and 	 – 	the holders of the issued shares of the affected class, either by a special  resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the issued  shares of the class affected, or with the written consent of members with  at least 75 per cent of the votes of that class Annual General Meetings The Annual General Meeting (AGM) provides a forum to facilitate the  sharing of shareholder views and is an important event in the BHP  calendar. The meeting provides an update for shareholders on our  performance and offers an opportunity for shareholders to ask questions  and vote.

General meetings can also be adjourned,  cancelled or postponed where permitted by law or the Constitution.  Notice of a general meeting must be given to each shareholder entitled to  vote at the meeting and such notice of meeting may be given in the form  and manner in which the Board thinks fit subject to any applicable law.  Five shareholders of the company present in person or by proxy constitute  a quorum for a general meeting. A shareholder who is entitled to attend  and cast a vote at a general meeting of BHP Group Limited may appoint  a person as a proxy to attend and vote for the shareholder in accordance  with applicable law. All provisions of the Constitution relating to general  meetings apply with any necessary modifications to any special meeting of  any class of shareholders that may be held.  Limitations of rights to own securities There are no limitations under the Constitution restricting the right to own  BHP shares or other securities.

For information on Underlying attributable profit (Continuing operations) for FY2024 refer to OFR 4.2 and OFR 10 The Board will assess, at each reporting period, the ability to pay amounts additional to the minimum payment, in accordance with the Capital Allocation  Framework, as described in OFR 2. In FY2024, we determined our dividends and other distributions in US dollars as it is our main functional currency.  Payments BHP Group Limited shareholders may have their cash dividends paid directly into their bank account in Australian dollars, UK pounds sterling, New  Zealand dollars, South African rand or US dollars, provided they have submitted direct credit details and if required, a valid currency election nominating  a financial institution to the BHP Share Registrar no later than close of business on the dividend reinvestment plan election date. BHP Group Limited  shareholders who do not provide their direct credit details will receive dividend payments by way of a cheque in Australian dollars. BHP Group Limited  shareholders who reside in New Zealand must provide valid direct credit details to receive their dividend payment.  Dividend reinvestment plan BHP offers a dividend reinvestment plan to registered shareholders, which provides shareholders the opportunity to reinvest dividends to purchase  additional BHP shares in the market, rather than receiving dividends in cash. Participation in the plan is entirely optional and is subject to the terms and  conditions of the plan, which can be found at bhp.com/DRP. 241 Operating and Financial Review Overview Financial Statements Governance Contents Additional Information  ===== PAGE 244 ===== 9.7 American Depositary Receipts fees   and charges We have an American Depositary Receipts (ADR) program for BHP Group  Limited which has a 2:1 ordinary shares to American Depositary Share  (ADS) ratio.

Cybersecurity risks are  addressed by BHP’s Risk Framework, a system of control for identifying  and managing risks, implemented by the CEO.  For information on our Risk Framework refer to OFR 8 We employ a number of measures designed to protect against, detect and  respond to cyber threats, events or attacks, including BHP’s mandatory  minimum performance requirements for technology and cybersecurity,  cybersecurity performance requirements for suppliers and cybersecurity  resilience programs. In addition, cybersecurity standards, cybersecurity  risk and control guidance, security awareness programs and training  to build capability, security assessments and continuous monitoring,  restricted physical access to hardware and crisis management plans are  also in place to manage cybersecurity.  We utilise dedicated internal and external cybersecurity personnel to focus  on assessing, detecting, identifying, managing, preventing and responding  to cyber threats, events and attacks. We have a dedicated cybersecurity  team, which has been in place since 2016 and has 24/7 monitoring and  response capability that leverages core in-house capability and external  service providers. Our assets, functions and projects are responsible for  managing localised or project-specific exposure to technology and cyber  risks, including risks associated with business-critical technology systems,  with guidance provided by our cybersecurity team. Enterprise-level risks  that are specific to technology, such as those that pose a greater threat to  our wider business and strategic opportunities, are managed by our global  Technology team and other relevant stakeholders. We regularly evaluate and assess the threat landscape and our security  controls, including through audits and assessments, regular network and  endpoint monitoring, vulnerability testing, penetration testing and tabletop  exercises that include members of BHP’s management team. To assess  the design and effectiveness of our cybersecurity controls, we engage  with assessors, consultants, auditors or other third parties, including  through independent third-party reviews of our information technology  security program conducted on a periodic basis. We have processes in  place to consider and remediate any findings from these reviews and  assessments as required. We also have processes to oversee and identify  material cybersecurity risks associated with our use of third-party service  providers, including performing diligence on certain third parties that have  access to our systems, data or facilities that store such systems or data  and we continually monitor cybersecurity risks identified through such  diligence. We also utilise contractual clauses to manage cybersecurity  risks, including by requiring certain agreements to be subject to periodic  cybersecurity audits. We have experienced targeted and non-targeted cybersecurity threats in  the past; however, no prior cybersecurity incident has materially affected  our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.  For information on our risk factors refer to OFR 8.1 Governance The Board, supported by the Risk and Audit Committee (RAC), is  responsible for oversight of emerging and principal risks facing the Group.  The Board and the RAC receive updates on the Group’s cybersecurity  position, and the Group has policies in place through the Group’s  disclosure process that are designed to escalate material incidents.  For information on other Board Committee activities that support risk  governance at BHP refer to the above ‘Risk governance’ disclosures  and Corporate Governance Statement 5 The CEO is responsible for the effectiveness of BHP’s Risk Framework  with oversight from the Board. Primary responsibility for Technology and  Systems Group Risk (which includes the cybersecurity risks), rests with the  Chief Technical Officer under authority delegated by the CEO. 9 Shareholder information continued 242 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 245 ===== The Chief Technical Officer is accountable for and establishes the risk  appetite for Technology and Systems, while the Vice President (VP)   Technology Secure & Architecture is responsible for overseeing the  performance of cybersecurity risks in the Technology and Systems Group  Risk category within that risk appetite, and provides reports concerning  these matters to the Chief Technical Officer.  Our VP Technology Secure & Architecture oversees the prevention,  detection, mitigation and remediation of cybersecurity incidents through  their management of, and participation in, our cybersecurity risk  management and cybersecurity strategy processes described above.  Our VP Technology Secure & Architecture leads the BHP cybersecurity  team involved in monitoring and managing our cyber security threat risk  and assurance process. That team includes personnel with significant  information technology experience. During FY2024, two individuals  held the role of VP Technology Secure & Architecture, each of whom  has more than 25 years of experience in the information technology and  information security field, including serving as chief information security  officer (CISO) and deputy CISO at other large companies. Our current  VP Technology Secure & Architecture holds a number of qualified  technical expert certifications, including Certified Information Systems  Security Professional (CISSP) since 2001 and various cybersecurity- related technical certifications, in addition to Master in Information  Technology (specialising in Information Security) and Master in Business  Administration degrees, and is active in various cybersecurity industry  collaboration groups internationally. 9.9 Government regulations Our business is subject to a broad range of laws and regulations imposed  by governments and regulatory bodies. These laws and regulations  touch all aspects of our business, including how we extract, process and  explore for minerals and how we conduct our operations, including laws  and regulations governing matters such as environmental protection,  land rehabilitation, occupational health and safety, human rights, cultural  heritage, the rights and interests of Indigenous peoples, competition,  foreign investment, export, marketing of minerals, and taxes. The ability to extract and process minerals is fundamental to BHP.   In most jurisdictions, the rights to extract mineral deposits are owned   by the government. We obtain the right to access the land and extract the  product by entering into licences or leases with the government that owns  the mineral deposit. We also rely on governments to grant the rights   necessary to transport and treat the extracted material to prepare it for  sale. The terms of the lease or licence, including the time period of the  lease or licence, vary depending on the laws and regulations of the   relevant jurisdiction or terms negotiated with the relevant government.  Generally, we own the product we extract and we are required to pay  royalties or other taxes to the government. In Australia and Chile, recent  reforms to mining royalties laws have been adopted. For example,  from 1 July 2022, a progressive system of coal royalties in the State of  Queensland was adopted, resulting in higher royalty rates as the price of  coal passes certain monetary thresholds. In May 2024, the Queensland  Government introduced new legislation to Parliament which, if passed,  would prevent future governments from reversing these higher royalty rates  without parliamentary approval. Similarly, in September 2023, the State  of New South Wales introduced a new coal royalty scheme, replacing the  emergency domestic coal cap and reservation measures. This increase  took effect on 1 July 2024, increasing the royalty rate payable for different  methods of extraction by 2.6 percentage points. In May 2023, the Chilean  Congress approved a mining royalty bill to establish a new regulatory  tax framework for copper mining activities, which, in general terms,  established that mining operators are subject to an ad-valorem component  plus a margin component, with a maximum tax rate of 46.5 per cent.  The new Chilean mining royalties took effect from 1 January 2024, subject  to existing tax stability agreements. In most instances, the rights to explore  for minerals are granted to us by the government that owns the natural  resources we wish to explore. Usually, the right to explore carries with it  the obligation to spend a defined amount of money on the exploration, or to  undertake particular exploration activities.  Environmental protection, mine closure, land rehabilitation, cultural  heritage and occupational health and safety are principally regulated by  governments and to a lesser degree, if applicable, by conditions under  leases or licences. These obligations often require us to make substantial  expenditures to minimise or remediate the environmental impact of our  assets and to ensure the safety of our employees, contractors and the  communities where we operate.  In many of the jurisdictions where we or our suppliers or customers  operate, legislation and regulations are increasingly being enacted in  response to the potential impacts of climate change and to implement  international environmental commitments. For example, as a result of the  Paris Agreement a number of governments, including Australia, Chile,  Canada and the United States, have submitted Nationally Determined  Contributions to reduce national greenhouse gas emissions (GHG).  Further, the governments in a number of regions where we or our suppliers  or customers operate have advanced targets and goals to reduce GHGs.  In Australia, the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007  (Cth) imposes requirements for corporations meeting a certain threshold  to register and report company information about GHGs and energy  production and consumption as part of a single, national reporting  scheme and establishes the Safeguard Mechanism to keep certain GHG  emissions at or below legislated limits, known as baselines, for Australia’s  largest industrial facilities. On 1 July 2023, amendments to the Safeguard  Mechanism commenced operation, which require facility baselines for  Scope 1 GHG emissions at Australia’s largest industrial facilities to be  decreased in accordance with a set decline rate, with a view to achieving  consistent and gradual emission reductions on a trajectory consistent with  achieving Australia’s GHG emission reduction targets of 43 per cent below  2005 levels by 2030 and net zero by 2050. Facilities that exceed their  progressively declining legislated baselines may apply credits to meet the  compliance obligations. Regulations setting emissions standards for fuels used to power vehicles  and equipment at our assets and the modes of transport used in our supply  chains can also have a substantial impact, both directly and indirectly, on  the markets for these products, with flow-on impacts on our costs.   A number of governments and regulators in relevant jurisdictions for  BHP have proposed or foreshadowed disclosure rules that would require  enhanced climate-related and broader sustainability-related disclosures.  For example, in Australia, the Federal Government has proposed  legislation that would implement a new mandatory climate-related financial  disclosure regime and associated auditing and assurance requirements,  intended to be phased in from 1 January 2025. There is also growing  focus on mandatory corporate due diligence and reporting for climate-  and broader sustainability-related issues in the value chain. For example,  the new European Union (EU) Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence  Directive requires in-scope companies to conduct human rights and  environmental due diligence on the company’s own operations and their  business partners’ chain of activities (largely upstream). While it is not yet  possible to reasonably estimate the exact nature, extent, timing and cost or  other impacts of any future climate-related or broader sustainability-related  regulatory programs or future legislative action that may be enacted,  we anticipate we will be required to dedicate more resources to address  legislative or regulatory changes.  In Australia, national environmental law is currently undergoing review with  the potential for significant reform, including an emphasis on addressing  environmental decline and achieving nature-positive outcomes, although  timing, scope and outcome remain uncertain. Aspects of heritage  protection laws in Australia have also been reviewed. For example,  in November 2023, the Western Australian parliament repealed the  Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2021 (WA) and reverted to the previous  Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 1972 (WA) (with limited amendments). Our business is also subject to a number of regulations and legal  developments relating to employee relations. From time to time, certain trade sanctions are adopted by the United  Nations (UN) Security Council and/or various governments, including in the  United Kingdom, the United States, the European Union (EU), China and  Australia against certain countries, entities or individuals, that may restrict  our ability to sell extracted minerals or other products to and/or our ability  to purchase goods or services from, these countries, entities or individuals. 243 Operating and Financial Review Overview Financial Statements Governance Contents Additional Information  ===== PAGE 246 ===== 9 Shareholder information continued Shareholding limits Under current Australian legislation, the payment of any dividends, interest  or other payments by BHP Group Limited to non-resident holders of BHP  Group Limited’s shares is not restricted by exchange controls or other  limitations, except that in certain circumstances, BHP Group Limited may  be required to withhold Australian taxes.  From time to time, certain sanctions are adopted by the UN Security  Council and/or various governments, including in the United Kingdom, the  United States, the EU and Australia. Those sanctions prohibit, or in some  cases impose, certain approval and reporting requirements on transactions  involving sanctioned countries, entities and individuals and/or assets  controlled or owned by them. Certain transfers into or out of Australia of  amounts greater than A$10,000 in any currency may also be subject to  reporting requirements. The Australian Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (the FATA)  restricts certain acquisitions of interests in securities in Australian  companies, including BHP Group Limited. Generally, under the FATA,  the prior approval of the Australian Treasurer must be obtained for  proposals by a foreign person (either alone or together with its associates)  to acquire 20 per cent or more of the voting power or issued securities  in an Australian company. Lower approval thresholds apply in certain  circumstances, including for acquisitions of interests in entities that  operate a ‘national security business’, and acquisitions of interests by  foreign government investors of voting power or issued securities in an  Australian company. The FATA also empowers the Treasurer to make certain orders prohibiting  acquisitions by foreign persons in Australian companies, including BHP  Group Limited (and requiring divestiture if the acquisition has occurred)  where the Treasurer considers the acquisition to be contrary to national  security or the national interest.  Except for the restrictions under the FATA, there are no limitations,  either under Australian law or under the Constitution of BHP Group  Limited, on the right of non-residents to hold or vote BHP Group Limited  ordinary shares. Post-unification requirements under FATA The Treasurer gave approval under the FATA for the actions taken as  part of implementation of the unification of BHP’s DLC structure on the  conditions set out below: 	 – BHP Group Limited remains an Australian resident company,  incorporated under the Corporations Act, that is listed on the ASX   under the name ‘BHP Group Limited’ and trades under that name. 	 – 	BHP Group Limited remains the ultimate holding company of and  continues to ultimately manage and control the companies conducting  the businesses that are presently conducted by the subsidiaries of BHP  Group Limited, including the Minerals and Services businesses, for so  long as those businesses form part of the BHP Group. 	 – 	The headquarters of BHP Group Limited (including the BHP Group’s  corporate head offices) are in Australia. 	 – The Chief Executive Officer of BHP Group Limited has their principal  office in Australia. 	 – The centre of administrative and practical management of BHP Group  Limited is in Australia and BHP Group Limited’s corporate head office  activities, of the kind presently carried on in Australia, continue to be  managed in Australia. 	 – The headquarters of BHP Group Limited is publicly acknowledged  as being in Australia in significant public announcements and in all  public documents. 	 – The Chief Executive Officer of BHP Group Limited has their principal  place of residence in Australia. 	 – 	The majority of all regularly scheduled Board meetings of BHP Group  Limited in any calendar year occurs in Australia. 244 BHP Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 247 ===== 10  Glossary 10.1 Mining-related terms 3D  Three dimensional.

Metallurgical coal  A broader term than  coking coal, which includes all coals used  in steelmaking, such as coal used for the  pulverised coal injection process. May also be  referred to as steelmaking coal. Mineral Resources  A concentration or  occurrence of solid material of economic   interest in or on the Earth’s crust in such form,  grade (or quality) and quantity that there are  reasonable prospects for eventual economic  extraction. The location, quantity, grade  (or quality), continuity and other geological  characteristics of a Mineral Resource are known,  estimated or interpreted from specific geological  evidence and knowledge, including sampling   (JORC Code, 2012 Edition). Mineralisation  Any single mineral or  combination of minerals occurring in a mass,   or deposit, of economic interest. Mixed (ore type)  Refer to Transitional Sulphide. Modifying Factors  Considerations used to  convert Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves.

PEGBC  Association of Professional   Engineers and Geoscientists of the   Province of British Columbia. Probable (Ore) Reserves  The economically  mineable part of an Indicated and, in some  circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource.  The confidence in the Modifying Factors  applying to a Probable Ore Reserve is lower  than that applying to a Proved Ore Reserve.  Consideration of the confidence level of the  Modifying Factors is important in conversion of  Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves. A Probable  Ore Reserve has a lower level of confidence  than a Proved Ore Reserve but is of sufficient  quality to serve as the basis for a decision on  the development of the deposit (JORC Code,  2012 Edition). Proved (Ore) Reserves  The economically  mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource.  A Proved Ore Reserve implies a high degree of  confidence in the Modifying Factors. A Proved  Ore Reserve represents the highest confidence  category of reserve estimate and implies a  high degree of confidence in geological and  grade continuity, and the consideration of the  Modifying Factors. The style of mineralisation  or other factors could mean that Proved Ore  Reserves are not achievable in some deposits  (JORC Code, 2012 Edition). ROM (run of mine)  Run of mine product mined  in the course of regular mining activities.  Tonnes include allowances for diluting materials  and for losses that occur when the material  is mined.

Supergene Sulphide  Supergene is a term  used to describe near-surface processes and  their products, formed at low temperature and  pressure by the activity of meteoric or surface  water. Copper in Supergene Sulphide is mainly  provident from the copper bearing minerals  chalcocite and covellite and is amenable to  both grinding/flotation concentration and  leaching processes. Tailings  Those portions of washed or milled ore  that are too poor to be treated further or remain  after the required metals and minerals have  been extracted. Total (Mineral) Resources  The sum of Inferred,  Indicated and Measured Mineral Resources. Total (Ore) Reserves  The sum of Proved and  Probable Ore Reserves. Transitional Sulphide  This is a term used to  describe the zone of mineralisation that is  a gradation between Supergene Sulphide  and Hypogene Sulphide resulting from  the incomplete development of the former  as it overprints the latter. This results in a  more irregular distribution of the three main  copper bearing minerals and is amenable  to both grinding/flotation concentration and  leaching processes. Troy oz  Troy ounce is a unit of measure of  precious metals. TSF  Tailings storage facility/facilities. Underground (UG)  Below the surface  mining activities.

AASB (Australian Accounting Standards Board)  Accounting standards as issued by   the Australian Accounting Standards Board. Activity data (in relation to greenhouse gas  (GHG) emissions data)  A quantitative measure  of a level of activity that results in GHG  emissions. Activity data is multiplied by an energy  and/or emissions factor to derive the energy  consumption and GHG emissions associated with  a process or an operation. Examples of activity  data include kilowatt-hours of electricity used,  quantity of fuel used, output of a process, hours  equipment is operated, distance travelled and  floor area of a building. Adjusted/unadjusted (in respect to GHG  emissions data) Adjusted means calculated  to present the GHG emissions data for a time  period (such as a baseline year or reporting  year) as though relevant changes took effect  from the start of that period even though  they occurred during or not until after the  end of the period. Unless expressly stated  otherwise, relevant changes are all acquisitions,  divestments and/or GHG emission calculation  methodology changes. For example, when  we adjust the FY2020 baseline year for our  operational GHG emission target and goal to  compare our adjusted FY2024 performance data  against it:  	 – the FY2020 data is presented with Scopes  1 and 2 emissions for operated assets that  have been acquired or divested by BHP  added or removed (respectively), and applying  methodology changes that took effect,  between 1 July 2019 and 30 June 2024; and  	 – the FY2024 data is presented as though any  acquisitions, divestments and/or methodology  changes that occurred during the year took  effect from the start of the year  This enables a ‘like for like’ comparison that  provides the information most relevant to  assessing progress against our GHG emissions  targets and goals. Unadjusted means calculated  to present the GHG emissions data for a  reporting year so that any relevant changes that  occurred during the year (including acquisitions,  divestments and/or methodology changes)  are applied only from the date they took effect.  Adjustments (in respect of our GHG emissions  targets and goals)  Calculations to present GHG  emissions data on an adjusted basis. ADR (American Depositary Receipt)  An  instrument evidencing American Depositary  Shares or ADSs, which trades on a stock  exchange in the United States.

Carbon credits are  generally created and independently verified  in accordance with either a voluntary program  or under a regulatory program. The purchaser  of a carbon credit can ‘retire’ or ‘surrender’  it to claim the underlying reduction towards  their own GHG emissions reduction targets or  goals or to meet legal obligations, which is also  referred to as carbon offsetting or offsetting.  We define regulatory carbon credits to mean  carbon credits used to offset GHG emissions  for regulatory compliance in our operational  locations (such as the Safeguard Mechanism in  Australia).

Such references  are not intended to characterise the legal  relationship between the owners of the asset. Operational control approach (in relation   to GHG emissions data)  A consolidation  approach whereby a company accounts for  100 per cent of the GHG emissions over  which it has operational control (a company  is considered to have operational control over  an operation if it or one of its subsidiaries has  the full authority to introduce and implement its  operating policies at the operation). It does not  account for GHG emissions from operations  in which it owns an interest but does not have  operational control. Also see the definition for  Equity share approach. Operational GHG emissions  Our operational  GHG emissions are the Scope 1 emissions and  Scope 2 emissions from our operated assets.  Operations  Open-cut mines, underground  mines and processing facilities, which in the  case of BHP are within our operated assets.

Residual mix  The mix of energy generation  resources and associated attributes such  as GHG emissions in a defined geographic  boundary left after contractual instruments have  been claimed/retired/cancelled. The residual mix  can provide an emission factor for companies  without contractual instruments to use in a  market-based method calculation. A residual mix  is currently unavailable to account for voluntary  purchases and this may result in double counting  between electricity consumers. Safeguard Mechanism  A mechanism  established in Australia under the National  Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007  to keep certain GHG emissions at or below  legislated limits, known as baselines, for  Australia’s largest industrial facilities. Reforms   to the Safeguard Mechanism that applied from  1 July 2023 are intended to reduce Scope  1 emissions at Australia’s largest industrial  facilities on a trajectory consistent with achieving  Australia’s GHG emission reduction targets  of 43 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 and  net zero by 2050. Facilities that exceed their  progressively declining legislated baselines may  apply Australian Carbon Credit Units to meet the  compliance obligations.
