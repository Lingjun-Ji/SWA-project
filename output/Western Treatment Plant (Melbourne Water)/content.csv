This includes building key infrastructure projects at our  treatment plants, such as the $711 million Resource Recovery & Re- use Complex (RRRC) announced this year for the Western Treatment  Plan. The RRRC will include new and improved treatment processes  to reduce emissions and include a liquid food waste facility to  generate renewable energy.   As part of the SoO(ER), Melbourne Water is also working towards  sourcing 100 per cent of its consumed electricity from renewable  sources by 2025. Further details on Melbourne Water’s net zero  target and strategy, including reliance on offsets and our emissions  baseline can be found on page 37. This year, we received the 2024 Australian Water Association  Infrastructure Project Innovation Award, which recognises significant  and innovative water infrastructure projects driving prosperity and  sustainability. Melbourne Water’s approach to the Biogas Handling  System upgrade at the Eastern Treatment Plant was awarded for its  ability to maximise biogas conversion to bioenergy, helping to deliver  our commitment to decarbonisation.  Collaborating for resilient services  This year, we also worked closely with the Victorian Government  and our partners to implement key water strategies, such as the  Greater Melbourne Urban Water and System Strategy: Water for Life.  This provides a clear path for our sector to work together to address  challenges and achieve a greater outcome.  A changing climate means we can no longer rely solely on rainfall  to meet our water needs. In a collaborative effort with South East  Water, Yarra Valley Water, Greater Western Water and Barwon  Water, Melbourne Water has established a shared vision for water  security through The Accord. This inclusive approach ensures that all  stakeholders are part of the solution.    This year, the Accord focused on long-term water security planning,  including alternative water sources such as recycled water and  desalination. Storages can take as little as four years to become  critical. Therefore, these alternative options are increasingly  important in our long-term resilience preparation.   The challenges facing the water sector are complex, and we cannot  solve them alone. We are continuing to collaborate with like-minded  leaders, communities, and our customers, including through our  2026 Price Submission engagement program. We look forward to  continuing these conversations to better understand our customers'  and community's priorities and embedding them into a robust 2026  Price Submission that delivers secure and resilient water sources for  Greater Melbourne.  Water is essential to our way of life. At Melbourne Water, we  are committed to delivering the essential services that sustain  communities now and in the future.    Planning for and meeting the needs of all Melburnians is at the centre  of what we do. As our city grows, we have the unique opportunity  to shape the future of water through the way we recover resources,  treat and reuse wastewater and ensure the availability of water  sources to sustain our way of life. We are in the decade that matters when the actions we take now  will define our future. Melbourne Water is already responding to a  changing climate by building resilience into our infrastructure and  water supplies in preparation for extreme weather events, rising sea  levels, reduced rainfall and increasing temperatures.  To help us meet these challenges, Melbourne Water has defined our  sustainability role. We have significant opportunities to make positive  impacts on communities by providing resilient services that enhance  environmental, social, cultural and economic outcomes for current  and future generations. We have also focused our priorities to ensure we build resilience into  our systems and create a fit-for-future organisation that continues to  protect the resources essential to Greater Melbourne's way of life.   To catalyse the change needed to respond to the challenges  of climate change and population growth, Melbourne Water  is also working towards a set of strategic goals that focus on  decarbonisation, the circular economy, securing future water sources,  Integrated Water Management and supporting Traditional Owner  self-determination.  While we continue to prioritise the critical work our customers,  community and environment need from us today, we have also  strengthened our priorities to meet the challenges of tomorrow.  Supporting the Housing Statement    Melbourne is the fastest-growing Australian city with over six million  people expected to rely on our services by 2030. Melbourne Water  is committed to supporting the Victorian Government's Housing  Statement to provide 800,000 new houses over ten years.  As floodplain manager under the Water Act 1989, we are working  with others to design our region's infrastructure and housing to  include integrated flood management practices. This year, we have  collaborated with government and other stakeholders to formulate  an action plan that supports the Housing Statement delivery,  including addressing broader systemic issues to better support  housing.  Refer to page 11 for more information on how we are  supporting the Victorian Government’s Housing Statement.  The Year in Review Report from the Chair   and Managing Director  ===== PAGE 5 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   3 Sustaining the community, now and into the future  The actions we take today will define our future. Our people are  vital to ensuring our region remains sustainable and are committed  to delivering the safe and reliable services communities depend on.  We are proud of our passionate workforce, who care deeply about  our community, customers, the environment and each other. We  look forward to supporting the future of a water-secure and thriving  Greater Melbourne. We are pleased to present Melbourne Water’s Annual Report for the  year ended 30 June 2024. Greg Wilson Chair 30 August 2024 Nerina Di Lorenzo Managing Director    30 August 2024 Walking Country together with Traditional Owners    Our commitment to walking Country together relies on our  strong relationships with Traditional Owner partners. This year, we  continued our journey with Traditional Owners towards formal  partnership agreements, working with Gunaikurnai Land and Waters  Aboriginal Corporation and Wadawurrung Traditional Owner  Aboriginal Corporation to implement our commitments.   Our partnership agreements are bespoke to the relationship and  designed to articulate our roles and agreed priority outcomes and  activities that enable Traditional Owners to achieve self-determined  outcomes.   Through our Walking Country Together Leaders Forum, we are proud  of the respectful relationships developed that ensure a culturally  safe workplace and continue supporting self-determination and  Traditional Owner aspirations. This year, we have also continued to  implement the Innovate III Reconciliation Action Plan, with our focus  now turning to a Stretch Reconciliation Action Plan.   Preparing communities for flood events  This year, we have welcomed the Independent Review Panel's  findings on the 2022 Maribyrnong flood event and accepted all  15 recommendations. These insights have enabled us to be better  informed for making future decisions and helping the community  prepare for future events. Long-term sustainable flood mitigation solutions will now become  a focus alongside our comprehensive community flood awareness  and preparedness program. We will continue to work closely with  the Victorian State Emergency Service and councils to deliver these  programs. Additionally, we have continued our ambitious five-year target to  update maps and models for every catchment in Greater Melbourne.  Scheduled for completion in 2026, the fast-tracked program aims  to provide updated flood information so that new housing and  infrastructure is more flood-ready over the next 70 years and  includes climate change estimates to 2100. The Maribyrnong River  Flood Model has now been released and will be used to better  understand current and future flood information for the region. See  page 21 for more information on Melbourne Water’s flood modelling  updates. Supporting the Victorian economy    Melbourne Water's financial strength objective is to focus our  activities on delivering value for our customers and strengthening  our business. We remain focused on running an efficient business  that delivers value-for-money outcomes for our customers and  stakeholders. Our capital investment expenditure during the year was $866.9  million, which helped us grow and renew existing infrastructure to  deliver the essential services our customers expect and rely on. We remain focused on delivering financial efficiencies in our  expenditure. We aim to deliver valued services at the lowest possible  cost and a commercial return for our shareholders to support the  Victorian state budget outcomes.

Our Strategic Goals  ===== PAGE 12 ===== 10   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report Delivering the Victorian Government’s plan for  water Water for Victoria is the Victorian Government’s statewide water  plan. The plan identifies priorities for managing water across the  state, including Greater Melbourne. The plan drives improved  outcomes for communities in the way water is managed and  delivers shared benefits, while also addressing challenges such as  climate change and population growth. We work closely with the Victorian Government to deliver our  services, which have been crucial in supporting Melbourne to  grow into the city it is today. This Annual Report outlines our  achievements in 2023-24 to meet the changing needs of the  Greater Melbourne region and addresses priorities detailed in  Water for Victoria. Letter of Expectations We are further guided by the Minister for Water’s Letter of  Expectations and the Ministerial Reporting Directions (MRDs)  administered by the Department of Energy, Environment and  Climate Action (DEECA), which focus on: •	 climate change and energy •	 customer, community and engagement •	 recognising Aboriginal values •	 recognising recreational values •	 resilient and liveable cities and towns •	 leadership, diversity and culture •	 performance and financial management •	 compliance. Tier 1 goals are highly material to the customer and  community outcomes created through our service offering:  Tier 2 goals are material to the way we deliver our services:  Tier 3 goals present opportunities  to support the SDGs more broadly:  1 2 3 Sustainable Development Goals Melbourne Water is a signatory to the United Nations Global  Compact, the world's largest sustainability initiative, which  encompasses the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Whilst  these goals were established with the aim to end extreme poverty,  fight inequality and injustice, and protect our planet at the global  level, the ways in which businesses can contribute to these  outcomes locally are through responsible business practices and  finding opportunities to solve societal challenges through business  innovation and collaboration.  The SDGs provide a broad lens for planning and a common  framework for communicating with partners, enabling shared value  outcomes and fostering innovation. We recognise our ability to  contribute to advancing each of the goals, both directly through  our own work and indirectly through partnerships with customers,  stakeholders and suppliers. We have previously assessed how the  delivery of our services and programs of work contribute to the  advancement of the SDGs3, and this year completed a sustainability  materiality assessment to identify the sustainability areas of  greatest importance to our operations in alignment to the goals. Our strategic context 3 https://www.melbournewater.com.au/about/what-we-do/publications/delivering-sustainable-development-goals Yarra River, Warburton  ===== PAGE 13 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   11 In 2024, digital technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and  automation have enhanced efficiency across industries. Renewable  energy advancements are driving a significant shift towards a more  sustainable future. Additionally, population growth, climate change and economic  conditions put pressure on essential services across Greater  Melbourne. Within the water industry, demographic shifts are  creating new demands for water services, with infill development  and greenfield expansions necessitating network growth. These  shifts underscore the importance of careful strategic planning to  ensure that infrastructure can meet the needs of a growing and  diverse population at an affordable cost.  Climate change continues to pose critical challenges, impacting  water availability and exacerbating weather extremes. Victoria's  climate is becoming warmer and drier. Extreme weather events,  such as floods and droughts, further strain resources and  infrastructure, requiring robust disaster preparedness and resilience  measures to protect communities and ensure reliable service  delivery. Economic conditions are also influencing our operating  environment. The cost-of-living and affordability must be balanced  against high-quality services for a growing population. In particular,  as regulatory commitments, infrastructure investments and  construction costs exert upward pressure on prices. Despite these challenges, environmental sustainability continues  to remain a priority, with increasing expectations from the  government and community for Melbourne Water to play a key  role in contributing to decarbonisation, ecological conservation,  and the emerging green economy.  Our operating  environment We operate in an evolving landscape shaped  by significant social, demographic, political,  environmental and technological changes.  These factors are radically transforming the  way we live, work and play. Housing Statement The Victorian Government’s Housing Statement was announced in  September 2023 and sets an ambitious agenda of 800,000 new  houses over a ten-year period. This involves large-scale reform of  the state’s planning system to stimulate investment and to build  homes faster. Under the Planning and Environment Act 1987 (Vic), Melbourne  Water has a significant role to play as a referral authority  in unlocking Melbourne’s housing potential in growth and  urban areas, and will need to engage with state agencies, local  government, the development sector and decision makers in  different ways.  Melbourne Water’s response has been detailed in the Housing  Statement Roadmap, which focuses on actions that deliver the  biggest impact in supporting the Housing Statement. This Roadmap approach is underpinned by five key pillars: 1	 Good decisions – made faster: streamlining transparent and  consistent decisions so people are in homes faster. 2	 Better information to support growth: providing  information to enable faster processing in low-risk areas  while identifying earlier higher flood risk areas proposed for  development. 3	 Greenfields: enabling the 30 per cent of growth target by  taking action to address process issues and streamlining  approval processes. 4	 Established areas: enabling the 70 per cent growth target for  urban infill by providing faster advice on engineering solutions,  guiding growth to safer locations, clearer identification of  high hazard areas and working with government to explore  infrastructure funding mechanisms.  5	 Innovative and well considered risk management: working  with government to set strategic directions for Melbourne’s  growth that shape the city in response to flood hazard.  Exploring our changing risk profile and how we can better  manage changing risk and priority locations for growth and  innovative design solutions to enable safe development.  ===== PAGE 14 ===== 12   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report 2026 Price Submission Melbourne Water’s 2026 Price Submission aims to ensure we can  respond to the challenges we face in the next ten years. Subject to  approval by the ESC, Victoria’s independent economic regulator,  the submission will detail our proposed 2026-2031 services for  water, sewerage, waterways and drainage, the infrastructure  investments we will make, the cost of delivering these essential  services, and the prices we intend to charge.  Our 2026 Price Submission will be prepared in the context of  transition to stay ahead of population growth, advancements in  technology and a changing climate. All our services will need to  undergo substantial change to keep pace with population growth  and climate change over the next decade, including the following:  •	 securing new water supplies •	 transitioning to new sewerage treatment technologies •	 preparing drainage for more frequent and intense flood events.  Planning for this transition must balance affordability with building  resilient infrastructure, ensuring we make the changes needed now  to prepare for our water future. We are developing our 2026 Price Submission with customers  and communities across Greater Melbourne to ensure we embed  customer values and affordability that also meet current and  future challenges. The 2026 Price Submission is due to the ESC in  September 2025. The Accord Through collaboration with South East Water, Yarra Valley Water,  Greater Western Water and Barwon Water, Melbourne Water has  established The Accord, which sets out a shared vision and agreed  principles to guide collective efforts towards cost-effective and  equitable outcomes.  The Accord represents a commitment to act in the best interests of  the communities we serve. The shared vision encompasses water  security, financial sustainability of high-quality water and waste  provision, partnership with Traditional Owners, water literacy and  efficiency, and addresses the challenges posed by climate change  resilience and transition.  Alignment at the senior leadership levels has facilitated significant  progress in system augmentation for future water resilience, the  success of which is now being replicated in other key focus areas.  The foundation for the alignment is the improved way in which  The Accord partners work together based on agreed principles.  This has been highlighted in the way Melbourne Water has taken  these principles for cooperation and applied them to key projects,  including the 2026 Price Submission, bulk entitlement reform and  bulk supply agreement reform. This year’s focus was to align planning for long-term water security.  Although Melbourne’s water supplies are currently strong, we know  they can go from high to critically low in four years. Together, we  have been planning to ensure that the sector has strategies in place  should Greater Melbourne go into another dry period.  ===== PAGE 15 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   13 At Melbourne Water, sustainability is about providing resilient  services that enhance environmental, social, cultural and economic  outcomes for current and future generations. It is critical for our services and our community that our business  remains resilient to ongoing and emerging challenges, such as  climate change and rapid urbanisation. Melbourne Water aims to share information about risks and  opportunities with stakeholders and the community to support  an ongoing dialogue on how we might best adapt, recognising  there may be new costs or trade-offs to make, depending on the  pathways chosen. ‘Our Path to Net Zero’ is Melbourne Water’s strategy for meeting  its obligations for emissions reduction. Refer to page 37 for more  details.  Our commitment  to sustainability We are working toward expanded disclosures that align with  emerging best practice. A focus both globally and locally is on  disclosures associated with climate change, such as the ongoing  development of the Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards  – Disclosure of Climate-related Financial Information. We will  continue to work towards broader sustainability disclosures as new  guidance in this area is developed.   This year, we continued to mature our approach by completing a  sustainability materiality assessment to identify the sustainability  areas of greatest importance to our operations. The assessment  identified our high priority sustainability focus areas and validated  our existing strong focus on climate adaptation, Our Path to  Net Zero and our work with state government and retail water  authorities to secure our water future. The assessment also  highlighted the importance of our role in preserving nature and  biodiversity in our region.    We are acutely aware that the scale of challenges facing  our services by the interacting risks of climate change, rapid  urbanisation and population growth, and biodiversity loss will test  our existing ways of operating and require us to adapt our approach  over the next decade. This assessment encourages us to investigate  further to understand the complex and interacting risks and  opportunities in pursuit of our vision and goals. Material sustainability  topic Melbourne Water’s impact in this topic area Relevant  SDGs Climate resilience and  adaptation Melbourne Water impacts the resilience of our services and the region through activities including:  •	 planning and research to understand risks •	 designing and constructing new and renewed assets and systems with increased resilience to  climate-related impacts •	 managing land, biodiversity and natural assets to promote ecosystem resilience.  We may face higher expenditure to adapt assets and processes to maintain service capacity and may  experience increased costs associated with maintenance and operation under climate change.  SDGs most  relevant to  these topics:         Carbon and energy Melbourne Water is responsible for significant greenhouse gas emissions, primarily through our use of  energy and sewage treatment processes.  We are progressing Our Path to Net Zero by 2029-30. We may experience higher capital expenditure  to adapt assets, systems and processes to reduce carbon emissions and align with a path to our net  zero target, and operational expenditure where offsets are necessary. See page 37 for further details  on our commitments and targets. Biodiversity Melbourne Water impacts biodiversity through: •	 investment in natural resource management activities •	 altering flow regimes and changing stocks of water in the environment •	 removal/degradation of habitat through service provision.  Failure to align with emerging natural capital policies may lead to reputational challenges and  financial implications for Melbourne Water. Water security Melbourne Water manages catchments, water storages and the transfer network to ensure Greater  Melbourne’s water supply remains secure.   In partnership, we plan for augmentation and climate adaptive diverse water sources in response to  reduced yields from catchments and increased demand. Refer to the ‘Climate change and adaptation’  section of this report on page 37 for more detail.    Melbourne Water may incur costs to deliver augmentation and climate-adaptive diverse water  sources in response to reduced yields from catchments.

Melbourne Water supplies, treats and transfers drinking water  to the city’s three metropolitan retail water companies and  four other regional water businesses, which in turn provide it to  households and businesses across the Greater Melbourne and  neighbouring regions. Melbourne is one of only a few cities in the world that draws  over half of its drinking water from protected catchments.  These protected forested mountain catchments throughout  the Yarra Ranges act as a vast natural filter, providing a  high-quality, low-cost source of water that requires minimal  treatment. This process underpins the affordability of our  drinking water. Water Overview A safe and secure water  supply is essential to our  way of life. OUR SERVICES  |  WATER Cardinia Reservoir Melbourne Water delivers essential services to our region every day  to sustain a healthy and liveable city. As caretakers for Melbourne’s  water cycle, we care for all aspects of water, life and land across  Greater Melbourne, including people and the natural systems.  The 2021 Price Determination currently guides our water,  sewerage, waterways and drainage services, infrastructure projects,  and the cost of delivering these services.  On average over the past 10 years, about a quarter of  Melbourne’s drinking water has come from open catchments,  which incorporate mixed land uses, such as houses and farms,  instead of being used exclusively to harvest water. Water from open catchments undergoes additional treatment  processes to ensure it meets the same quality standards as  water from protected catchments. Greater Melbourne’s water  system also includes the Victorian Desalination Plant, which  complements our catchments by providing a secure source  of high-quality water independent of rainfall. The plant can  provide up to 150 billion litres of drinking water each year  and is a key component in ensuring long-term water security,  building a buffer in our storages and taking pressure off our  reservoirs during drier periods and droughts. In 2023-24, we invested $231.1 million to safely manage the  water production and supply for Greater Melbourne. Significant  investments included the continued construction of a $140  million project to supply water to the north and north-west  growth areas and the $161 million renewal of key transfer  assets from Olinda to Mitcham and onto Syndal and Glen  Waverley. Our role as PPWCMA also means we are responsible for promoting  the integrated management of land, water, natural systems, coasts,  and marine environments.  ===== PAGE 18 ===== 16   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report Managing water supply Melbourne's 10 storages commenced financial year 2023-24 at 91.7 per cent full (1,662 billion litres). Above average inflows allowed  storages to remain above 95 per cent until early February 2024. However, by June 2024, they had reduced to 86.5 per cent (1,568 billion  litres). See Figure 2 for more details. OUR SERVICES  |  WATER In 2023-24, Melbourne’s water supply catchments received 1,015 millimetres of rainfall - 3.6 per cent below the 30-year average. It has  been five years since the catchments received below average annual rainfall largely due to three consecutive wet La Niña years. The monthly  average rainfall across Melbourne's catchments varied from 15 millimetres in February 2024 to 209 millimetres in October 2023 (Figure 3).  Slightly more than 10 per cent of the entire rainfall for 2023-24 (104 millimetres) fell on the year’s wettest day, 3 October 2023.

Water consumption Despite high rainfall, permanent water saving rules still apply across Victoria to ensure we use water wisely. Melbourne's residential water  use in 2023-24 was 162 litres per person per day4, which is 12 litres more than the Victorian Government’s new target of 150 litres. Melburnians averaged use of 1.27 billion litres of water per day this year – 5 per cent more than the last five-year average, which  was influenced by wet conditions from three consecutive wet La Niña years and the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. While water  consumption has generally increased over the past 10 years, it is 4 per cent lower than during the 1990s.  ===== PAGE 20 ===== 18   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report Ensuring the health and  wellbeing of Melbourne's  population and environment  is dependent on a safe and reliable  sewerage system.  OUR SERVICES  |  SEWERAGE Sewerage Our approach The reliability of Greater Melbourne’s  sewerage system significantly  contributes to the city’s liveability. Since  its establishment in the 1890s, the  system has expanded and adapted with  Melbourne to ensure the ongoing protection of public health,  wellbeing and environment. Melbourne Water's system is distinguished by two prominent  treatment plants: the Western Treatment Plant in Werribee  and the Eastern Treatment Plant in Bangholme. These facilities,  coupled with an extensive network of 400 kilometres of  sewers and nine sewage pumping stations, efficiently transport  substantial volumes of sewage across the city to be treated.  In our long-term investment planning, we carefully consider  external factors, such as population growth and climate  change, to ensure the continuous evolution of our sewerage  system. The Melbourne Sewerage Strategy describes a 50-year  transformation in our sewerage system from a mostly one- way process, which views sewage as a waste that must be  collected, treated and discharged, to a circular process focused  on the recovery, reuse and recycling of valuable resources  like water, energy and nutrients, while ensuring Melbourne’s  sewerage service continues to protect public health and the  environment. In 2023-24, we invested $397.4 million to safely manage  the sewage generated across Greater Melbourne. Significant  investments included the continued construction of a $200  million project to duplicate the Hobsons Bay Main Sewer  Yarra River crossing and the progression of $1,037 million of  treatment capacity upgrades at the Western Treatment Plant. Western Treatment Plant Resource Recovery & Re-use Complex Announced in 2023-24, Melbourne Water’s Resource Recovery & Re-use Complex (RRRC) aims to improve the resilience of the Western  Treatment Plant as Greater Melbourne’s population grows and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from our current treatment processes. The RRRC will include: •	 new preliminary and primary treatment processes to divert  raw sewage away from the heavily loaded anaerobic lagoons,  reducing the frequency of odour intensive maintenance works •	 improved solids handling and anaerobic digestion processes  to divert sludge away from the heavily loaded aerated ponds,  capturing carbon and improving safety •	 a new receiving facility to receive and treat tankered waste  from customers to manage environmental risk and fulfil  Melbourne Water’s obligations under the Environmental  Protection Act •	 a new liquid food waste facility to receive waste from  industrial customers for co-digestion, which will generate  renewable energy. Works will run until late 2027, with the John Holland Design Joint Venture currently progressing the Design and Construct phase this year.  ===== PAGE 21 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   19 OUR SERVICES  |  SEWERAGE   OF RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY GENERATED 86,700 MWh 210,110 MILLION LITRES SEWAGE RECEIVED WESTERN TREATMENT PLANT Eastern Treatment Plant In 2023-24, the Eastern Treatment Plant received 155,757  megalitres of sewage, generated 73,800 megawatt hours of  electricity from renewable sources from its power station and solar  farm (46 per cent of the plant’s total electricity consumption) and  produced 49,546 tonnes of biosolids for future reuse. The Eastern  Treatment Plant also supplied 7,464 megalitres of recycled water  to residential third pipe, industry and agriculture users in the south- eastern suburbs.  In December 2023, Melbourne Water commissioned a new solar  farm comprising 38,960 panels, with a maximum output of 19.4  megawatts. Annual energy production is forecast to be 25,000  megawatt hours per annum, which is 16 per cent of the Eastern  Treatment Plant’s total energy usage. In 2023-24, the biological solids load entering the Eastern  Treatment Plant increased by up to 30 per cent. These additional  solids have significantly impacted the treatment process and  Melbourne Water is working with South East Water to identify the  source. Contingencies are in place to manage them, and they have  not impacted Environmental Protection Authority Victoria (EPAV)  licence compliance. The increase has resulted in periods of reduced  Class A recycled water supply reliability, however all contractual  volume supply requirements to customers were met. OF RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY GENERATED 73,800 155,757 MILLION LITRES SEWAGE RECEIVED EASTERN TREATMENT PLANT MWh Western Treatment Plant The Western Treatment Plant received 210,110 megalitres of  sewage in 2023-24, which was 7 per cent lower than the amount  received in 2022-23 due to significant rain events in that year.   In addition, the Western Treatment Plant generated 86,700  megawatt hours of electricity from renewable sources such as  biogas from the anaerobic lagoons. This represents 107.5 per cent of  the plant’s total energy consumption.  As part of the Port Phillip Bay Environmental Management Plan  (2017-2027) and EPAV nitrogen load target to Port Philip Bay  under the Environmental Reference Standard (2021), the Western  Treatment Plant has a three-year rolling average limit of 3,100  tonnes per annum of total nitrogen (TN) that can be discharged to  Port Phillip Bay.  At 30 June 2024, Melbourne Water’s three-year rolling average TN  discharge was 3,454 tonnes. This is higher than the 3,100-tonne  limit, which is mostly attributable to higher nitrogen loads into  the plant above current treatment capacity during extreme wet  weather events in 2022 and growth in the sewerage catchment.  This is the first time since 2015-16 that the Western Treatment  Plant has recorded an individual year less than the 3,100-tonne  limit. The individual TN discharge for financial year 2023-24 was  3,075 tonnes. Planned capital works are underway to support reducing nitrogen  loads discharged from the Western Treatment Plant over the  next decade. A new nutrient removal plant is currently under  construction to remove nitrogen from the treatment process  further. The new plant is expected to be operational by mid-2025,  with benefits set to be seen by 2025-26. As the population grows  and climate changes, further investment will be required to build  additional resilience and continue to manage increased nitrogen  loads to the Western Treatment Plant.  ===== PAGE 22 ===== 20   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report Flood and Drainage Extreme flood events are  expected to become more  likely as our climate changes  over the coming decades. Melbourne  Water has the opportunity now to  enhance Greater Melbourne’s future  resilience by using flood information  that takes future projections into  account and ensuring this information  is readily available so authorities and  communities can plan for flood events. Our approach As the region’s floodplain manager and  under the Water Act 1989, Melbourne  Water plays a critical role in managing  flood risk through: •	 land use planning and establishment of criteria for  building and renovations that minimise flooding risk and  drive water-oriented urban design •	 constructing, maintaining and upgrading drainage,  including flood management infrastructure and  multifunctional assets •	 the provision of flood information and education. We also plan for and respond to flooding that may impact our  waterways, drainage, water supply and sewerage treatment,  and transfer systems and services. Melbourne Water’s role is to coordinate the development and  delivery of the Flood Management Strategy for the Port Phillip  and Westernport regions and drainage services in conjunction  with local and state government agencies, emergency services,  the insurance and private sectors and the community.  The Victoria State Emergency Service (VICSES) is the  designated control agency for flooding in Victoria. Melbourne  Water partners with VICSES to support awareness and  preparedness in communities at risk of flooding to build  community resilience. Melbourne Water also develops flood  information to inform the development of VICSES Flood  Guides and Municipal Emergency Management Plans. We  also contribute to flood warning services, particularly through  management of flood warning hydrographic infrastructure. Floods are a natural part of the landscape within the Port  Phillip and Westernport regions. The impacts of climate change  and continuing urban development means we will likely see  more parts of Greater Melbourne flood in the future.   As a result, flooding that would typically occur on rare  occasions has the potential to become more frequent and  severe. During 2023-24, $24.5 million was allocated to renewing  and enhancing our drainage and flood protection assets. In  addition, $136.1 million was allocated to create new drainage  and stormwater quality assets (such as wetlands) to support  the development of new land. Cora Lynn OUR SERVICES  |  FLOOD AND DRAINAGE  ===== PAGE 23 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   21 Maribyrnong River Flood Review On Friday 14 October 2022, significant flooding occurred within the  urban catchment of the Maribyrnong River. In response, Melbourne  Water established an expert panel led by former Federal and  Victorian Supreme Court judge, the Honourable Tony Pagone AM,  to undertake an independent review of the causes of the flooding  in the urban catchment, including the impact of the Flemington  Racecourse flood wall. The findings of the Pagone Panel were released in October 2023,  with Melbourne Water accepting all 15 recommendations. A six- month progress update on the recommendations was published  in April 2024. Consistent with these recommendations, we have  completed and released new flood modelling for the Maribyrnong  River. Insights from the review will better inform future decisions and  help the community better prepare for any future event. Our focus  now turns to long-term sustainable flood mitigation solutions  for the catchment, as well as the comprehensive community  awareness and preparedness program in partnership with VICSES  and councils.  Following the Panel’s findings on the Flemington Racecourse flood  wall, Melbourne Water will now incorporate an examination of the  flood wall mitigation into our broader investigation of potential  mitigation options across the catchment. Parliamentary Inquiry In parallel with the Pagone review of the Maribyrnong River  flooding event, Melbourne Water participated in the Legislative  Council Environment and Planning Committee Inquiry, tasked with  undertaking an inquiry into the 2022 flood event in Victoria. The Inquiry is considering factors, such as cause of or contribution  to the flood event, emergency services, government policy, flood  mitigation strategies, the Flemington Racecourse flood wall and the  Victorian planning framework. Melbourne Water contributed to the whole of Victorian  Government submission last year and participated in the  Committee’s hearings in October 2023 and May 2024.  Once the Committee’s report is released, Melbourne Water will  work with DEECA to contribute to the whole-of-government  response to recommendations. Flood modelling program Melbourne Water works with all 38 local government agencies  across our operating area through a joint flood modelling program  to update flood models and maps of our waterways and drainage  networks. Local government manages the drainage network on  local streets, housing and industrial estates (local catchments of  less than 60 hectares), feeding into the broader drainage network  managed by Melbourne Water.  This year, we continued our five-year target to update maps and  models for every catchment in Greater Melbourne. Scheduled  for completion in 2026, the fast-tracked program aims to  provide updated flood information to inform new housing and  infrastructure to be more flood ready over the next 70 years. The  program includes climate change estimates to 2100.  Maribyrnong River Flood Model In April 2024, Melbourne Water released a new Maribyrnong  River Flood Model5 to better understand current and future flood  information in the Maribyrnong River region, including 2024 and  projected 2100 flood extent scenarios. This new model incorporates the most up-to-date data about the  Maribyrnong River, including contemporary rainfall and run-off  data and detailed physical features of the floodplain. The model is  also calibrated to the most recent flood event of October 2022 and  climate change projections through to 2100. Both the 2024 and 2100 scenarios are based on a flood event that  has a 1 per cent chance of occurring in any given year (1% Annual  Exceedance Probability). 5 https://letstalk.melbournewater.com.au/maribyrnong-river-flood-model OUR SERVICES  |  FLOOD AND DRAINAGE  ===== PAGE 24 ===== 22   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report OUR SERVICES  |  WATERWAYS Waterways Melbourne’s waterways  provide habitat for more  than 1800 species of  native plants and 600 species of  native animals. They also support the  liveability of our city, providing water  to homes and farms, and are enjoyable  places to visit.  Our approach  Our waterways sustain a diverse range  of life, including birds, fish, frogs,  platypus, macroinvertebrates and  vegetation. They provide places for  people to gather, exercise and relax and  are important sites of cultural significance. They support the  growth and prosperity of our city by providing drainage, flood  mitigation and drinking water. They also provide economic  benefits by supplying water for agriculture, recreational fishing,  commercial industries and tourism opportunities. Melbourne Water is the prescribed waterway manager under  the Water Act 1989 for over 25,000 kilometres of waterways,  wetlands and estuaries and undertakes work to protect and  improve conditions to support environmental and social values.  We undertake maintenance and improvement of vegetation  and habitat along waterways. We also build and maintain  fishways and more than 1,000 stormwater treatment systems,  including constructed wetlands.  We work together with state and local governments, non- government organisations and community groups to enhance  the environmental, social, cultural and economic value of our  waterways and protect them from the impacts of climate  change and population growth. We also support our partners  and individual landowners to deliver works through the  provision of incentives and partnerships, support the planning  process by offering referral advice for planning permits and  actively enforce compliance measures. The Healthy Waterways Strategy6 is a shared strategy across  Melbourne Water, state and local government, water  corporations, Traditional Owners and land management  councils, non-government organisations and the community.  The strategy provides a shared regional and catchment- specific vision for the health of rivers, estuaries and wetlands  in the Port Phillip and Westernport regions and contributes to  delivery of the Port Phillip and Westernport Regional Catchment  Strategy7 and Victorian Waterway Management Strategy8. Our community engagement has highlighted the value that  waterways have for people in Greater Melbourne through  their support of environmental health and overall quality of  life. In 2023-24, Melbourne Water invested $33.4 million to  repair and protect our waterways from a variety of threats. Of  this, $6.4 million was spent on improving stormwater quality  through renewing and revegetating wetlands (such as Lilydale  Lake Wetland, Laverton Mt St Joseph Wetland and Hallam  Valley Wetland) and $26.5 million on improving waterway  conditions.

The WDIP aligns with our commitment to  enhancing life and liveability across the region and supports our  responsibilities to protect and improve waterway health, provide  regional drainage services, work with partner organisations to  reduce flooding impacts, and manage river diversions. As required by the Victorian Government’s Statement of  Obligations, the WDIP includes key performance indicators (KPIs)  that describe how progress with implementation of the investment  plan is measured over the five-year period. Melbourne Water  performs an annual independent assessment of our progress  against these KPIs.  In 2023-24, we continued to deliver on the KPIs relating to  community engagement, education and capacity building. This  included the delivery of 20 stormwater capacity building initiatives  through our Clearwater program this year and the cumulative  delivery of 172 community education and engagement events over  the past three years.  We also continued to identify ways to improve our performance  against unmet targets over the past three years, including 2023- 24. This includes our target to increase stormwater harvesting and  infiltration capacity by 8 gigalitres per year through Melbourne  Water programs. Despite these challenges, several key projects are  progressing and contributing to our overall goals. For example, the  options to construct the Sunbury Stormwater Harvesting Scheme  to meet waterway health outcomes, which would aim to deliver  3.8 gigalitres per year by 2026, have been fully explored and are  currently for decision. More detailed information, including our annual performance  against individual KPIs can be found on our website9. Waterways research This year, we continued to address key research areas, deliver  communications activities and work collaboratively to achieve the  Healthy Waterways Strategy performance objectives relating to  waterways research. Initiatives included partnering with the University of Melbourne in  the Melbourne Waterway Research-Practice Partnership to conduct  research into: •	 improved methods for monitoring waterway health •	 prioritisation tools for stream and wetland works •	 options for protecting headwater streams from urbanisation •	 management of deer impacts on vegetation and water quality •	 the relationship between stream channel form and ecological  health •	 application of real-time-control technology to the  management of stormwater •	 approaches to increase the resilience of vegetation in a  changing climate. We also collaborated with RMIT University in the Aquatic Pollution  Prevention Partnership to conduct research into pollution  management in waterways on the following topics:  •	 developing a decision support framework to prioritise water  quality management actions •	 identifying cost-effective solutions for pollutants from  industrial catchments •	 managing emerging contaminants •	 understanding the ecological impacts of sewage inputs in  waterways •	 assessing risks of contaminants to environmentally significant  sites •	 understanding climate change impacts on water quality •	 managing pollution in estuaries and bays. Work was also undertaken to explore enhanced methods for  propagation and planting of seagrass to restore critical habitats in  Westernport. Melbourne Water also continued collaborative research with  Traditional Owners on billabong watering along the lower Birrarung  (Yarra) River (with Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung), seagrass restoration  in Westernport (with Bunurong), and Port Phillip biodiversity  assessments with environmental DNA (eDNA) (with Wadawurrung  and Bunurong). 9 https://www.melbournewater.com.au/services/prices-and-charges/waterways-and-drainage-charge/waterways-and-drainage-investment-plan  ===== PAGE 26 ===== 24   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report Catchment  Management Located on the traditional  lands of the Wadawurrung,  the Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung  and the Bunurong Peoples,  the Port Phillip and Westernport region  is Victoria’s most diverse and complex  natural resource management area by  virtue of its location, geography, land  use and population. Our approach As the region's Catchment Management  Authority (CMA), Melbourne Water  has specific roles, responsibilities and  obligations, enabling us to adopt a more  comprehensive and integrated approach  to catchment management.  Covering an area of almost 13,000 square kilometres, our  region extends from the You Yangs Ranges and volcanic plains  in the west, across the Macedon Ranges and the Kinglake  Plateau in the north, through the Yarra Valley to the foothills  of the Baw Baw Plateau in the east and south to the Bass  Coast. The region also includes the bays of Port Phillip and  Westernport, and Victoria’s two largest islands, French and  Phillip Islands. As a CMA, our role involves considering and contributing  to the integrated management of land, water, biodiversity,  coasts and marine environments throughout the region. It also  involves extensive collaboration with diverse stakeholders and  communities. Melbourne Water’s statutory functions, powers  and responsibilities as a CMA are set out in the Catchment and  Land Protection Act 1994. For the full Catchment Condition Report, see Appendix E. Across five distinctly different major catchment systems  (Werribee, Maribyrnong, Yarra, Dandenong and  Westernport) the region’s land and waterways form a  complex network of interconnected and interdependent  catchments, rivers, wetlands and estuaries, which flow  to Port Phillip Bay and Westernport. OUR SERVICES  |  CATCHMENT MANAGEMENT Simons Creek  ===== PAGE 27 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   25 Water supply catchment management Melbourne's water supply catchments comprise 158,000 hectares  and generate 80 per cent of the region’s drinking water. Our water  supply catchments are serviced by 1,500 kilometres of unsealed  access roads, which are constantly maintained or upgraded. This  year, upgrades were made or commenced on several bridges  damaged by storm events in previous years.  The 2023-24 Season Works Program is implemented under the  Catchment Management Optimisation Program (CMOP) and  funded by the 2021 Price Determination. Bushfires Bushfires in our catchments pose a significant risk to water  quality and long-term water yield. They can impact water supply  infrastructure and surrounding community assets. To manage bushfire risk, Melbourne Water is involved in fire  prevention, preparedness, and response and recovery activities. We  maintain an initial fire suppression capability, allowing us to attack  fires early to keep them as small as possible. We also undertake fuel  reduction programs and bushfire strategic and operational plans.   Melbourne Water actively participates in the state’s Fire  Management Planning process to identify and mitigate fire risk  under a coordinated framework. We proactively assess and mitigate  bushfire risk on our land and apply suitable hazard mitigation,  works and response capability, including planned burning, fuel  break management and access road management. Melbourne Water bushfire preparedness planning and operational  activities are implemented annually from July to December. Each  Melbourne Water bushfire work centre (Healesville, Warburton,  Woori Yallock and Thomson) is allocated a minimum number of  resources in line with DEECA recommendations, including seasonal  firefighting resources. Provision is made for helicopter capability,  with a helicopter stationed at the Healesville depot. Melbourne Water participates in state and national fire  preparedness activities as part of the AFAC Fire Risk Planning  Working Group (national) and Forest Fire Management Victoria  (FFMVic) Partnership Committee. Melbourne Water also attends  relevant municipal fire committees and DEECA and Emergency  Management Victoria (EMV) pre-season briefings.  Bushfire risk is captured within our enterprise risk register. 2023-24 fire season El Niño and positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) events impacted  the 2023-24 fire season. El Niño typically leads to reduced rainfall  in spring and early summer for eastern Australia and to warmer  days in the south. When a positive IOD and El Niño occur together,  the drying effect is typically stronger and more widespread. These  conditions are associated with droughts and increased likelihood of  bushfire. Bushfire agency arrangements DEECA and Parks Victoria are responsible for public land  management in the catchments. Melbourne Water manages  risks to drinking water and water supply infrastructure in the  catchments.  Melbourne Water is part of FFMVic, a network of public land  management organisations led by DEECA, including Parks Victoria  and VicForests. The Country Fire Authority (CFA) is the agency responsible for fire  response on private land in the catchments. Deer management Melbourne Water participates in an active deer management  program to control potential pathogens that could contaminate  the water supply.  In 2023-24, deer control programs continued in Cardinia, Silvan  and Upper Yarra catchments. Program planning is underway  with DEECA for an expanded program in the Armstrong Creek  catchment.  Current data demonstrates a reduction in risk to water supply  contamination in Cardinia and Silvan catchments during the last  three years as deer populations have reduced. This is also expected  to reduce further at Cardinia over the next year. Security Melbourne Water is upgrading its security approach to protect  the water supply catchments from unauthorised entry, which  increases bushfire and contamination risk.

Melbourne Water relies on nature and biodiversity to provide  essential services to the community, including:  •	 closed catchments to provide water filtration and reduce the  cost of high-quality drinking water to communities •	 floodplains and headwater streams to provide flow regulation  that decreases flooding impacts •	 Port Phillip Bay to receive treated wastewater, enabling safe  management of the region’s sewage.  Provision of our services also impacts our environment, both  positively and negatively. For example: •	 the release of water for environmental purposes results in  improved waterway health and better habitat for flora and  fauna •	 sewage treatment processes release greenhouse gases,  contributing to climate change •	 building new infrastructure can remove vegetation and  habitat, impacting biodiversity. In alignment with our strategic goals and direction, Melbourne  Water aims to reduce the impact of our operations on the  environment and contribute to a secure water future for Greater  Melbourne. Yarra River, South Yarra  ===== PAGE 29 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   27 10 https://www.planning.vic.gov.au/guides-and-resources/Data-spatial-and-insights/discover-and-access-planning-open-data/urban-development-program/victoria-in-future Resilient and liveable  cities and towns In collaboration with our partners,  Melbourne Water plays a significant  role in ensuring that Greater Melbourne  continues to remain resilient and  liveable. Our approach  Melbourne Water is uniquely placed to  lead water-oriented and community- driven design that supports a water  resilient future as our city grows and  transforms.  As Melbourne’s population is set to increase to 10 million  by 205010, the combined pressures of growth and climate  change will affect the entire water cycle, including increased  demand for water, generation of more stormwater in the urban  environment and reduction in water captured by our water  supply catchments.  Subsequently, our need for increased drinking water supply and  sanitation services, including further sewerage infrastructure,  waste treatment and resource recovery, is also growing.  Melbourne Water is committed to investing in critical  infrastructure to support this growth. The Greater Melbourne Urban Water and System Strategy (Water  for Life), Melbourne Sewerage Strategy, Flood Management  Strategy – Port Phillip and Westernport 2021-2031 and Healthy  Waterways Strategy each take an integrated approach to the  water cycle, particularly in relation to how we respond to  future growth and climate change. This integrated approach  to planning and delivering our services will assist us to provide  improved value for the community and better outcomes for  the environment over the long term. With over 32,000 hectares within our service area, land is one  of Melbourne Water’s most significant assets. Optimising our  use and management of land can deliver a significant benefit  to our communities’ quality of life. As part of our WDIP, we  have committed to investing $73 million in community access,  involvement and recreation across our five-year price period. OUR ENVIRONMENT  |  RESILIENT AND LIVEABLE CITIES AND TOWNS Yarra River, Southbank  ===== PAGE 30 ===== 28   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report Preparing for Greater Melbourne’s water future Urban water efficiency Melbourne Water, together with the urban water retail companies,  runs water efficiency programs, including the refreshed Target 150,  which encourages Melburnians to limit their water use to 150 litres  per person per day. Melbourne’s water use, compared against this  target, is reported each week on Melbourne Water’s website. The  new target links to the industry’s long-term plan outlined in Water  for Life and the Central and Gippsland Regional Sustainable Water  Strategy (CGRSWS).  The Target 150 campaign aims to educate the community about all  aspects of the water cycle to improve water-saving habits.  In 2023-24, the campaign was put on hold due to continuing high  water storages following three successive years of La Niña events.  However, Melburnians are continuing to use less water per person  than approximately 20 years ago: residential use is down from 247  litres per person per day in 2000-01 to 162 litres per person per day  in 2023-24. Recycled water and reliability Melbourne Water produces recycled water at the Western and  Eastern Treatment Plants, providing recycled water to customers  for a range of non-drinking purposes. Recycled water production at the Western Treatment Plant was  significantly impacted during 2023-24 by two separate and  unrelated incidents: •	 the rupture of a concrete pipeline in late January, which  impacted the ability to supply Class A and C recycled water for  19 days while the pipeline was repaired •	 a blue green algal bloom in the lagoon system that  interrupted supply of Class A recycled water for 58 days.  We continue to explore new opportunities to increase recycled  water use and improve quality and reliability at the Western and  Eastern Treatment Plants.

Low flow  supplementation was also delivered (in March and May).    The environmental water release for summer/autumn freshes and the autumn high flow aimed to improve aquatic habitat  and channel form, maintain bank vegetation and provide opportunities for fish movement. Low flow supplementation  was delivered to sustain the river through periods of prolonged dry and warm conditions.  Water for the environment was delivered to Yering Backswamp to improve wetland vegetation and provide habitat for  frogs and birds. The site was also naturally inundated in October and December 2023. All billabongs in the lower Yarra (Birrarung) floodplain were engaged naturally in January 2024.   Catchment rainfall and unregulated flows helped to achieve some watering actions, including one spring fresh, one spring  high and two summer/autumn freshes. Tarago and  Bunyip 453 Tarago Reservoir spilled for most of 2023-24. As a result, the environmental entitlement remained near 3000 megalitres  for most of the year.  Water for the environment was actively delivered to achieve two summer/autumn freshes. These releases help to enhance  habitats, maintain vegetation communities and facilitate movement and spawning of various fish species, including the  endangered Australian Grayling.  Catchment rainfall and unregulated flows helped to achieve some watering actions, including two spring freshes and two  spring highs, five summer/autumn freshes and one autumn high. Werribee  (Wirribi Yaluk) 1,215 Water for the environment was actively delivered to Pyrites Creek (Reach 6) to achieve a spring continuous low flow,  three spring/summer freshes and one spring/summer high flow event. These flows maintain channel form, habitat and  vegetation, and allow for fish movement between pools.  In the lower Werribee River, below Melton Reservoir (Reach 8 and 9) and into the estuary, water for the environment  was actively delivered to achieve four summer/autumn freshes. Delivery of these freshes improves habitat, maintains  vegetation, mitigates blue-green algal bloom, and supports fish and frog populations.   The lower Werribee also benefited from enhanced releases through Southern Rural Water’s bulk entitlement - 10  megalitres per day from Werribee Diversion Weir (January to June 2024).  Catchment rainfall and unregulated flows helped to achieve some watering actions, including one fresh for Pyrites creek  and one summer/autumn fresh for the lower Werribee, and achievement of low flow targets during wet periods. Maribyrnong (Mirrangbamurn) 261.9 In 2023-24, 261.9 megalitres of environmental water was secured by the Victorian Environmental Water Holder through  temporary trade of unused irrigation allocations.   Water for the environment was actively delivered from Rosslynne reservoir to Jacksons Creek (Reach 6 and 7) to achieve  five summer/autumn freshes targeting improved water quality and connectivity between in-stream habitats. Available  water volumes and operational constraints limiting the maximum release from the reservoir meant full achievement of all  targets (other than summer/autumn freshes) was not possible.   Catchment rainfall and unregulated flows helped to achieve some watering actions, including two summer/autumn  freshes for Reach 7 and partial achievement of summer/autumn low flow targets. Table 3: Environmental water delivered for 2023-24 As storage operator and delivery partner, Melbourne Water delivered 24,679 megalitres from Thomson Reservoir to the Thomson River  as water for the environment in 2023-24. This was achieved in partnership with the West Gippsland CMA and on behalf of the Victorian  Environmental Water Holder. Delivering water for the environment With variable seasonal conditions experienced across most of  Melbourne Water’s region during 2023-24, many environmental  watering actions, which involve the release of water from a  storage to a river or wetland, were met with unregulated flows  and reservoir spills in the Yarra, Tarago, Maribyrnong and Werribee  systems. OUR ENVIRONMENT  |  RESILIENT AND LIVEABLE CITIES AND TOWNS 12 https://www.vewh.vic.gov.au/water-for-the-environment/what-is-water-for-the-environment All lower Yarra billabongs were engaged by natural overbank  flows in January 2024. A drier late summer and autumn resulted  in support for low flow conditions along the Yarra (Birrarung).  Environmental water was used to deliver 23 environmental  watering actions using 20.9 gigalitres of environmental water as  shown in Table 3. See the Victorian Environmental Water Holder website12 for more  information on the terminology used to describe the types of flows  in environmental watering. Sustainable and resilient water services systems Yan Yean to Bald Hill Pipeline Construction continued this year on a 20-kilometre pipeline from  the Yan Yean Water Treatment Plant to the Bald Hill, Kalkallo tank  site. The new pipeline is designed to meet growing water demands  and improve supply reliability in the northern suburbs, while freeing  up capacity to transfer more water to the west. Along with the installation of a new pump station near Yan  Yean, 20 kilometres of steel water main was constructed from  the Yan Yean Water Treatment Plant to Bald Hill tank this year.  Construction is continuing under Merri Creek and the North  East Rail Line, and we are undertaking water quality testing and  commissioning activities in preparation for project completion in  October 2024.  ===== PAGE 33 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   31 Water main supplies more than water  The renewal of ageing water mains between Mitcham and Syndal  as part of the M22 and M46 water main renewal program were  completed this year. The $68 million project upgraded the century  old asset to ensure ongoing reliable water supply.  As a further community benefit, Melbourne Water also  collaborated with the community to shape and design plants,  seating and safety features along the 1.5-kilometre pipe track  pathway, which is now open from Mitcham to Forest Hill. Water from the Victorian Desalination Plant Following above-average rainfall and based on Greater Melbourne’s  continuing high storage levels, projected weather patterns  and demand, the Victorian Government adopted the advice of  Melbourne Water and the metropolitan retail water corporations to  not order water from the Victorian Desalination Plant for 2023-24.  In April 2024, with the continuation of favourable catchment water  supply conditions, the government announced that there was also  no requirement for a desalination order for the 2024-25 period. Since 2017, 455 billion litres of water have been supplied from the  Victorian Desalination Plant. Without regular desalination orders,  Victoria would not be able to meet the increase in demand over  the long term. In a severe drought, storage levels can drop by 20  per cent in a year, which is why Victoria’s water supply must be  responsibly managed to avoid challenging water restrictions, such  as those experienced during the Millennium Drought. The Victorian Desalination Plant provides a critical element of  operational flexibility during significant events, such as storms or  bushfires, when parts of the system may be taken offline to manage  water quality and protect the delivery of essential services. Despite  recent wet years, an increasing population, expanded supply area  and changing climate mean desalinated water is part of the long- term strategy to help prepare the water supply system for future  dry periods and increased demand, as indicated in CGRSWS.

The scope of this review includes: •	 raw water loss from aqueduct leakage •	 leaks on pipelines, valves and fittings •	 wastage from tank draining to enable cleaning and condition  inspection •	 operational water usage for outages to enable planned works  and for other purposes. Several other losses are not included, such as reservoir evaporation,  dam seepage and environmental flows. Melbourne Water has met its KPI target of maintaining transfer  losses to less than 1 per cent of water delivered to metropolitan  retail water companies during financial year 2023-24. Melbourne  Water recorded 4,432 megalitres of total water loss that represents  0.96 per cent of water supplied to metropolitan water retailers. The  losses from potable and raw water systems were 1266 megalitres  (0.27 per cent) and 3,166 megalitres (0.68 per cent) respectively.  Figure 6 summarises Melbourne Water’s transfer losses and  performance to achieve this KPI over the past five years. Melbourne Water continues to reduce and better account for water  loss in the trunk water network though: •	 utilising a dedicated in-house pipe repair crew •	 cathodic protection of tanks and pipelines •	 renewal of aqueducts and water mains •	 flow meter validation •	 other best practice asset management activities.  ===== PAGE 34 ===== 32   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report Integrated Water Management Integrated Water Management (IWM) is a holistic and collaborative  approach to the way we plan for and manage all elements of the  water cycle. IWM considers how the delivery of water, wastewater  and stormwater services can contribute to water security, public  and environmental health and urban amenity.  Melbourne Water is a key delivery partner in the implementation  of the IWM Framework for Victoria that seeks to coordinate and  balance many views and interests in the water sector around  common goals and agreed outcomes. Integrated Water Management Forums Melbourne Water has continued as a key partner and contributor  to the DEECA-led IWM Forums. These forums are a collaborative  effort to plan for better solutions to climate change, urbanisation,  and environmental and economic challenges.   This year, five Catchment Scale IWM (CSIWM) action plans  were released for Werribee, Maribryrnong, Yarra, Dandenong  and Westernport catchment, representing over six years of  work by Melbourne Water and partner agencies, including local  governments, water corporations, the Victorian Planning Authority  and Traditional Owner groups.   The CSIWM action plans outline over 135 actions that contribute  to the IWM visions, strategic outcomes, targets and measures and  are agreed to in each catchment’s Strategic Direction Statements.  Melbourne Water is committed to working with stakeholders to  progress the CSIWM action plans over the next 10 years and update  them as necessary.  Melbourne Water is the delivery lead for 14 actions and is a partner  on the delivery of another 51 actions led by other organisations. All  14 of the actions led by Melbourne Water are underway, including  the following projects:  •	 Re-imagining Blind Creek •	 Living Links Program implementation in the Dandenong  Catchment •	 Werribee Reconfiguration Project business case investigation  •	 Annulus Wetlands delivery •	 Monbulk Creek Smart Water Network. These plans and actions are an example of the water sector working  together to deliver outcomes that matter to the community by  using an IWM approach. Werribee System Reconfiguration Project This year, Melbourne Water continued to work collaboratively  with DEECA, Southern Rural Water, Greater Western Water and  Traditional Owners (via the DEECA facilitated Traditional Owner  Partnership) to progress the Preliminary Business Case for the  Werribee System Reconfiguration Project (WRSP).  The WSRP is a key commitment of the CRGSWS and Water for  Life and explores alternative ways to use and share water in the  Werribee system, including greater use of recycled water and  subsequent return of river water to the environment, Traditional  Owners and urban users.  Key project activities for 2023-24 included the following: •	 Southern Rural Water led engagement with Werribee  Irrigation District growers on the project. Melbourne Water  has also been actively involved in discussions with growers,  particularly focused on the supply and quality of Class A  recycled water, which is a fundamental aspect of this project. •	 Increased Traditional Owner involvement in the project,  particularly through the Traditional Owner Partnership  facilitated by DEECA, which enables Traditional Owner groups  to self-determine their involvement in and contribution  to the project. In March 2024, Wadawurrung, Wurundjeri  Woi-wurrung and Bunurong Traditional Owner groups  confirmed unanimous support for water returns to be used in  the Preliminary Business Case. Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung and  Wadawurrung have representatives on the Project Steering  Committee. •	 Completion of a concept design and cost estimate for the  Western Treatment Plant Class A recycled water upgrade to  enable the reconfiguration of water in the Werribee system.  The joint project team is currently working towards a submission  for federal funding to support the development of a Detailed  Business Case. The submission is expected to be made in January  2025. OUR ENVIRONMENT  |  RESILIENT AND LIVEABLE CITIES AND TOWNS  ===== PAGE 35 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   33 Circular Economy Recycling in construction projects This year, Melbourne Water and John Holland trialled the feasibility  of using a general blended cement, containing approximately 25  per cent recycled supplementary cementing materials, as part of  the Hobsons Bay Main Sewer project ground improvement works. The trial revealed that general blended cement performed equally  to general purpose cement. Therefore, approximately 486 tonnes  of cement containing recycled material was used in the project.  Additionally, the trial provided an example for other industry  projects to use recycled cement materials for ground improvement  works in the future.  Biosolids reuse program In 2023-24, Melbourne Water safely applied biosolids from the  Western Treatment Plant to suitable broad-acre farmland in  Victoria’s west. These biosolids are applied as a soil supplement and  can contribute nutrients, carbon and trace elements often scarce in  Australian soils. The 2024 biosolids reuse program delivered 22,935 tonnes of  biosolids to eight farms. This is approximately 56 per cent of the  annual solids production at the Western Treatment Plant. The  three-year rolling average for biosolids reuse for Melbourne Water  is 66 per cent.  Melbourne Water worked with LOOP Organics and its partner,  Mahonys Transport, to deliver biosolids to farmland from January to  March 2024. Farm machinery was used to spread and incorporate  the biosolids into the land to maximise nutrient improvement. Melbourne Water continues to work with the EPAV, the water  industry, customers and community to implement measures that  are considered as the best available techniques or technologies to  meet its General Environmental Duty. Drinking water quality Melbourne’s safe and trusted water supply system is central to our  customers’ experience and perceptions of Melbourne Water. Our  obligations are set out in the Safe Drinking Water Act 2003 (Vic) and  the Safe Drinking Water Regulations 2015 and are enforced by the  Department of Health. As a provider of essential services, Melbourne Water takes its  responsibility for public health extremely seriously and regularly  seeks to improve our water supply system and quality management  controls. Opportunities to improve our system controls are underway or in  planning, incorporating thinking about climate and other resilience  pressures so our system can adapt. To ensure a coordinated and  risk-driven response, these opportunities have been collated into  a single Drinking Water Quality Improvement Program, spanning  Melbourne Water’s planning, delivery and safety groups. Focus  areas include improvements in foundational activities, core  business processes, short and long-term risk interventions and  emergency response. In addition, Melbourne Water continues to work in collaboration  with the Department of Health, DEECA, and metropolitan water  corporations to deliver joint improvements to enable a sector-wide  approach to drinking water quality improvements and ensure public  health is protected. This year, we continued implementation of our Drinking Water  Quality Strategy. This strategy outlines an approach that maintains  and builds on the achievements and legacy assets of the past, while  planning approaches and solutions suitable for the future. Effective catchment protection remains a cornerstone of our  approach to managing drinking water quality risks for our existing  water supply catchments. However, going forward, our reliance on  sophisticated engineered treatment barriers will grow as we source  increasingly large volumes of manufactured water as climate  change, a growing population and other factors drive an evolution  in our supply sources. To ensure we are prepared for the challenges and opportunities  of the future, the Drinking Water Quality Strategy describes four  strategic goals: •	 Continuity of supply: We continuously improve our systems,  processes, people and infrastructure to enable us to do the  basics of drinking water quality risk management brilliantly. •	 Source management: We take a robust multiple barrier  approach to managing drinking water quality risks, ensuring  that drinking water from all existing and potential future  sources are equally safe. •	 Trust, innovation and leadership: Our customers,  stakeholders, and regulators value and trust our leadership  and innovation in managing our drinking water supplies. •	 Resilience of safe supply: Potential threats are anticipated,  and appropriate measures are in place to enable supply to  continue during and after extreme events with minimised  impacts on customers. OUR ENVIRONMENT  |  RESILIENT AND LIVEABLE CITIES AND TOWNS  ===== PAGE 36 ===== 34   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report Our strategies Central and Gippsland Region Sustainable Water Strategy  Melbourne Water contributed to the development of the CGRSWS,  released by DEECA in 2022. The CGRSWS established the path  towards greater use of manufactured water, the delivery of more  water for the environment, an increased uptake of IWM and the  creation of water entitlements for Traditional Owners. This year, we have continued to participate in actions to secure  more water for the environment and have worked closely with  state and local governments to enable IWM at a city scale, which  will help protect waterways from stormwater pollution while  retaining more water for the urban natural environment. Melbourne Water also continued to work with government and  other water corporations to improve water sharing arrangements  for towns in the central region connected to the Melbourne Supply  System. Greater Melbourne Urban Water and System Strategy – Water  for Life To prepare for our needs over the next 50 years, Melbourne Water  and the three metropolitan retail water corporations launched  Water for Life in 2023. The strategy is a significant step forward for industry collaboration,  where a shared, whole-of-system approach now sits within a single  strategy, providing greater benefit to the broader water network  and community. Water for Life identifies the best mix of actions to supply water to  our towns and cities via an adaptive plan that includes several short  and long-term options and pathways to manage the water supply  deficit by incorporating climate resilient or manufactured water. The adaptive plan demonstrates the likelihood that new water  supplies will need to be added to our existing system within  the next 10 years, as well as several system augmentations  over the next 50 years. As most options take years of planning  and investment, Melbourne Water is already planning for and  undertaking readiness activities now. The implementation of  actions in Water for Life are aligned with those in the CGRSWS and  require a coordinated delivery effort. Healthy Waterways Strategy  The Healthy Waterways Strategy mid-term evaluation concluded  this year. It evaluated trends of values and conditions, changes to  threats and the effectiveness of interventions. In addition, it looked  at the likelihood of meeting 10-year targets, the factors influencing  strategy implementation and reviewed the effectiveness of  co-delivery to help achieve strategy outcomes. An independent  panel of waterway and evaluation experts guided the review and  Melbourne Water's Waterways and Wetlands Research program  supported the evaluation. A response to the mid-term recommendations and socialisation  of results with key agency partners and the community is being  developed. Catchment forums and workshops will further progress  critical areas over the coming year. Progress of the Healthy Waterways Strategy can be found in the  Report Card13 and information on the mid-term review can be  found on the strategy website14. Regional Catchment Strategy The latest version of the Port Phillip and Westernport Regional  Catchment Strategy was approved by the Minister for Water on  behalf of the Victorian Government in March 2023. Over 120  organisations were consulted during its development. The Regional Catchment Strategy builds on 25 years of  collaboration since its first iteration in 1995 and highlights the  interconnectedness of land, water and biodiversity in the region. It emphasises the important roles and plans of various  stakeholders, including councils, government agencies, Traditional  Owners, non-government organisations, industry bodies and  community organisations, showcasing their contributions to the  conservation efforts of the broader region. For more information on actions, see the Catchment Condition  Report in Appendix E. Burndap Birrarung burndap umarkoo (Yarra Strategic Plan) Burndap Birrarung burndap umarkoo (Yarra Strategic Plan)  2022–2032 puts the interests of the river and its lands at the  heart of future land use planning and decision-making. It sets  out a transformative shift for collaborative governance between  government agencies and Traditional Owner corporations, ensuring  the river and its lands are protected as one living and integrated  natural entity. Melbourne Water was appointed by the Minister for Water as the  lead agency for implementation of the plan, which is required  under the Yarra River Protection (Wilip-gin Birrarung murron) Act  2017. Melbourne Water is also one of 14 public entities listed in this  Act that are responsible for implementing the plan. As lead agency, we facilitate the Yarra Collaboration Committee,  coordinate the implementation of the plan, track and measure  progress, champion funding submissions, identify opportunities  for collaboration, and facilitate improved partnerships with and  resourcing of Traditional Owner corporations. 13 https://healthywaterways.com.au/report-card  14 https://healthywaterways.com.au/resources/mid-term-review OUR ENVIRONMENT  |  RESILIENT AND LIVEABLE CITIES AND TOWNS  ===== PAGE 37 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   35 In the past year, Melbourne Water has successfully secured $1.65  million in state government funding to progress transformative  projects for the corridor. These are projects that set Traditional  Owners up as decision-makers, will leave a long-lasting impact and  build a stronger connection between the community and the river  while addressing complex multi-agency gaps.  In partnership with the Yarra Collaboration Committee, two key  initiatives, Birrarung Parklands and Greening the Birrarung, will be  delivered in the coming years to realise better understanding of  cultural values along the corridor and engagement with Traditional  Owners, a universal approach to our communication on the river  as ‘one living and integrated natural entity’ and scaling up of our  collaboration and coordination across parklands and revegetation  projects.  More broadly, Melbourne Water continues with its leadership in  coordinating the activities associated with the plan, its actions  and embedding the necessary organisational change to support  collaborative governance and decision-making for the river. Port Phillip Bay Environmental Management Plan  The Port Philip Bay Environmental Management Plan 2017-2027  (EMP) operates under the Marine and Coastal Act 2018 and sets out  priority goals and actions for taking care of Port Phillip Bay. The  EMP is the result of a coordinated effort by DEECA, in partnership  with Melbourne Water and the EPAV. As a CMA, Melbourne Water  contributes to the EMP through its annual maintenance program,  which has over 225 stormwater quality treatment systems across  the Port Phillip and Westernport region. We also have a capital  rectification program to restore functionality of stormwater assets  when they are compromised by degradation and contribute to  meeting the Port Phillip Bay’s pollutant load target.  Melbourne Water has also conducted research on pollution impacts  to waterway ecology from emerging contaminants, pesticides and  other toxicants (including litter and microplastics) and developed  new bioassays for early detection of detrimental effect. This has  been conducted through a major collaborative research partnership  between Melbourne Water and RMIT University — The Aquatic  Pollution Prevention Partnership. Additionally, Melbourne Water has a catchment pollutant loads  monitoring network of eight sites with auto-samplers and water  quality probes. We have partnered with Monash University to  update monitoring protocols to improve reliability and accuracy of  the predicted estimates to assist with quantifying pollutant loads  to Port Phillip Bay. Melbourne Water’s Liveable Communities Liveable Waterways  program invests in education and extension programs and grants  for implementing improved urban and rural land use practices.  These grants are available to councils and landholders to support  a range of on-ground works and strategic projects. In 2023-24, 54  stormwater and rural land management projects were funded by  the program. Enhancing biodiversity Melbourne Water’s land supports diverse communities of native  plants and animals, and we have a critical role in managing  waterways, estuaries and wetlands.  In compliance with Victorian and Commonwealth biodiversity  obligations, Melbourne Water develops and implements strategies  to protect native biodiversity, including the following: •	 Corporate Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan 2020 •	 Catchment and Land Protection Act 1994  •	 Port Phillip and Westernport Regional Catchment Strategy  •	 Healthy Waterways Strategy  •	 Sites of Biodiversity Significance Program. Melbourne Water is also the host agency for catchment-scale  programs, including Grow West, Yarra4Life and Living Links,  contributing to the enhancement of catchment biodiversity,  protection of threatened species protection and creation of  biolinks.   During 2023-24, Melbourne Water contributed to the following  activities to enhance biodiversity across our region:  •	 reviewed and revised the Corporate Biodiversity Conservation  Action Plan and spatial prioritisation for biodiversity  conservation (as a required ‘sub-plan’ of the Regional  Catchment Strategy) •	 received $7 million in funding as a part of the Regional  Delivery Partners panel from the Federal Department of  Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water in  collaboration with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries  and Forestry to develop an Emergency Preparedness and  Response Plan for the Port Phillip and Westernport region •	 continued to implement the Growling Grass Frog Masterplan  Program in Melbourne’s urban growth areas •	 commenced land management on new Crown land reserves  along Merri Creek •	 progressed feasibility investigations and design of 20 new  habitat wetlands. OUR ENVIRONMENT  |  RESILIENT AND LIVEABLE CITIES AND TOWNS  ===== PAGE 38 ===== 36   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report Ramsar Wetlands As a CMA, Melbourne Water continued as lead agency of the  region’s Ramsar Protection Program. This long-term, collaborative  environmental program works to maintain and improve the  ecological values of the Westernport and Port Phillip Bay western  shoreline Ramsar wetlands sites.  Melbourne Water also manages the two Great Ramsar Wetlands  Project at the Western Treatment Plant and Edithvale-Seaford  Wetlands Ramsar site, as well as the Westernport Enhancement  Project. All three Ramsar wetlands within our region fall under our  Sites of Biodiversity Significance Program, ensuring appropriate  planning, management and monitoring. The Ramsar-listed Edithvale-Seaford Wetlands are the largest  remaining part of the former Carrum Carrum Swamp and home to  many bird species, most significantly the endangered Australasian  Bittern. Works in 2023-24 included: •	 progressing the Climate Change Cost Benefit Analysis project  to help understand future management options for the  wetlands under a changing climate •	 continuing work with RMIT to undertake research into water  and sediment quality at both Edithvale and Seaford wetlands  aimed at improving our understanding of water quality and  flow-on effects to prey populations for shorebirds, with a  recent focus on pollution sources •	 commissioning a review and update of the site’s Ramsar  Management Plan •	 on-ground works, including management of tall reeds to  maintain migratory shorebird foraging and roosting habitat.  Our long-term monitoring of birds by Birdlife Australia began  in 1989 and confirms the value of reed management. Western Treatment Plant The Western Treatment Plant supports a wide range of biodiversity  values, including coastal saltmarsh and temperate grasslands, and  some associated threatened species, such as the Orange-bellied  Parrot and Spiny Rice-flower. Lagoon-based sewage treatment  and dedicated habitat ponds provide critically important habitat  for waterfowl, migratory shorebirds and the endangered Growling  Grass Frog. In alignment with the Environment Protection and Biodiversity  Conservation Act 1999, we report annually on the delivery of  environmental flows and monitoring of waterbirds, Growling  Grass Frogs and Straw-necked Ibis populations, as well as other  management actions.  Due to an observed decline in ibis numbers, a research project has  been initiated with the Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental  Research to track ibis movements in response to watering regimes  to help improve future site management.  During 2023-24, Melbourne Water also supported Wadawurrung  Traditional Owners with a cultural burn at Lake Borrie grassland to  promote regeneration of the Spiny Rice-flower.

However, there are opportunities to adapt our services and  support climate resilience in the wider region. How we adapt  and change will be guided by the input and priorities of  stakeholders and the community. Melbourne Water is positioned to help navigate a path that  meets the region’s water needs, optimises use and reuse of  resources, preserves our natural environment, and sustains  the liveability of our region. The adaptation and resilience  investments we develop will be overseen by environmental  and economic regulators and guided by engagement with our  customers and overall community willingness to pay.  Under the Victorian Statement of Obligations (Emission  Reduction) set down by the Victorian Minister for Water,  Melbourne Water must: 1	 Reduce our annual reportable scope 1 and 2 emissions  (as calculated under National Greenhouse and Energy  Reporting Scheme (NGERS) to 204,380 tonnes CO2-e  a year by 2024-25 (which represents a 50 per cent  reduction from our 408,760 tonnes CO2-e baseline,  which was calculated from our average annual emissions  between 2011 and 2016). 2	 Source 100 per cent of our consumed electricity from  renewable sources by 2025. (This must continue for all  years beyond 2025).  3	 Reduce our annual reportable scope 1 and scope 2  emissions to net zero from 1 July 2029. It is important to note that there has previously been a  lack of clarity with regards to the precise timing of 100 per  cent renewable energy commitment under the Statement  of Obligations (Emission Reduction). Melbourne Water has  previously reported that we would be required to source 100  per cent of our consumed electricity from renewable sources  from 1 July 2024. However, upon more recent advice from  DEECA, this has instead changed to 1 July 2025, meaning all  electricity utilised from 1 July 2025 must be supplied from  renewable sources either via onsite generation or renewable  energy output under our electricity supply agreement. We have  adjusted our target and emissions projection to align with this  updated advice. To ensure consistency with the language used in the Statement  of Obligations (Emission Reduction), Melbourne Water currently  uses the words ‘net zero’ rather than ‘carbon neutral’ to  describe the achievement of an annual reportable scope 1 and  scope 2 emissions total of zero through emissions reduction  activities. It should also be noted that supply chain emissions  (scope 3) are not currently included in our targets.   For transparency, offsets will be required to meet our targets  from 1 July 2024 to allow time to transform our treatment  plants to lower emissions alternatives. This is discussed further  on page 49. Melbourne Water is required to report annually on a range of  specific indicators relating to our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions,  electricity use and energy consumption to DEECA through  ‘Ministerial Reporting Direction 01 – Climate Change and  Energy’ and to DTF through ‘Financial Reporting Direction  24 - Reporting of environmental data by government entities’.  These indicators can be found in this section of the report and  in Appendix F.   OUR ENVIRONMENT  |  CLIMATE CHANGE AND ADAPTATION  ===== PAGE 40 ===== 38   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report OUR ENVIRONMENT  |  CLIMATE CHANGE AND ADAPTATION Governance Our approach to climate governance and reporting significant  risks and opportunities is informed by Ministerial Directions and  other regulatory guidance, along with our internal business goals  and tools, such as our materiality assessment (see 'Our approach  to sustainability’ section of this report). In 2023, Melbourne  Water undertook a readiness review comparing our past climate  risk disclosures and internal systems to the draft International  Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) climate reporting standards.  The review identified a range of strengths and improvement  areas and has informed disclosures in this report. The structure  of this section of the report has also been informed by the  recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial  Disclosures (TCFD) framework.  Climate risk governance within Melbourne Water   The Melbourne Water Board approves overarching business  Strategic Goals, including our decarbonisation goal, which has been  established in alignment with the requirements of the Victorian  Water Corporation’s Statement of Obligations (Emission Reduction).  The Board also approves the capital plan through which major  investments are made to deliver on, amongst other drivers, actions  to address our most material climate risks and opportunities.  The Board also notes the key service strategies and delegates to  management the development, execution and publication of these  strategies for sharing with stakeholders.  In November 2023, Melbourne Water’s Board Committee structure  was changed to consist of the following relevant committees:  •	 A Risk, Optimisation and Sustainability Committee (ROSC),  with oversight of the Enterprise Risk Universe, strategic  Risk Profile, and corporate governance frameworks.  This committee has carriage of sustainability risks and  opportunities, including climate change. •	 A Finance, Audit and Compliance Committee, with oversight  of the Public and Environmental Health Framework. The Board and sub-committees provide overarching governance  of the overall Enterprise Risk Universe, including climate-related  risks. The Executive Leadership Group validate and monitor risks  and controls included in the Enterprise Risk Universe and report  the status of risks to the Board and Sub-committees. Each risk  is allocated to a member of the executive leadership group as  accountable and to a member of their senior leadership group as  the individual risk owner responsible for overseeing controls and  regular reporting. Strategic oversight and ownership of climate risk  falls to the Head of Sustainable Futures.   An emissions KPI is included in our Managing Director’s 2023-24  performance plan to hold emissions to no more than net 480,000  tonnes CO2-e, across the NGERS reportable emission scopes 1 and  2. This emissions KPI was met for this period.  Strategy, material risks and opportunities Understanding and preparing for climate risks is a critical  component of Melbourne Water’s long-term business strategy. We  explore a range of climate scenarios and other influences, such as  potential population growth, technology and regulatory change, to  understand how physical and transition risks may affect resources,  operations, services and stakeholders.  Climate change, extreme weather, and changes in the economic  and regulatory environment have the potential to create  unanticipated costs or impacts on Melbourne Water’s revenue and  asset values. While scenario planning is used to explore and help  prepare for a wide range of potential future conditions, there is a  risk that the assumptions made based on what is currently known  may not reflect the actual impact of emerging risks in the future.  As of 30 June 2024, Melbourne Water considered climate-related  risk in the preparation of the financial statements as summarised in  Note 1 (Financial reporting impacts of climate related matters) in  the Financial Statements of this report. Melbourne Water and the services we provide are also strongly  dependent on nature. Often costs to infrastructure are a large  focus of the financial impacts of climate change, the loss of  environmental, social, economic and intrinsic value from nature  is often not. The outcome is an imbalance, with many values  unable to be consistently expressed and justified against their  costs. Melbourne Water is currently working on improving its  understanding of how to value nature, including through the  exploration of standard accounts to help record economic value  and demonstrate the return on investment from waterways  management. Climate risks and opportunities Melbourne Water’s approach to climate resilience builds our  ability to identify and manage climate-related risks to our services,  people, financial sustainability and operations over the short,  medium and long term. We are responding to physical risks arising  from the physical impacts of climate change and transition risks  arising from the regulatory, economic, financial, technological and  social changes from a transition to a low-carbon economy (noting  that there would be greater environmental, economic, financial  and social risks from not transitioning). These risks affect the entire  organisation as the timing and severity of climate impacts are  complex and uncertain, creating challenges in our ability to adapt.    ===== PAGE 41 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   39 OUR ENVIRONMENT  |  CLIMATE CHANGE AND ADAPTATION Physical risks Declining rainfall and increasing heat creating risks for water security Description Projected long-term decline in rainfall and potential for increased variability, such as longer, more severe  droughts and more severe storms, will decrease the drinking water supply available from existing natural  sources. Increasing hot weather and other extremes may drive changes in peak demand or other stresses  on supply systems. In addition, warmer temperatures in water storages may increase the risk of algae or  other risks to drinking water quality. Potential financial impacts •	 Costs associated with the need to manage and augment water supply systems to provide sufficient  water for a growing population if supply from rain-dependent sources declines. •	 Costs associated with managing treatment and transfer systems to meet higher water demands. •	 Increasing reliance on water treatment processes and new water sources may increase the overall  energy consumption of water services and the costs associated with this. Opportunities •	 Ensuring that new water sources developed to service future populations are less reliant on rainfall  and less exposed to climate hazards, including supply chain risks. •	 Embedding IWM practices as we plan for urban growth and upgrade ageing infrastructure, aiming to  make the most of all potential water resources across the region. Management Responses •	 Melbourne Water is actively planning for current and future water security, including participation  in water sector working groups focused on water security, water resource and supply system  modelling, system augmentation and strategy/regulation. In addition, we are exploring the potential  for climate independent new water supply sources while also managing potential greenhouse gas  emissions, particularly from higher grid electricity use. We are also supporting government and  councils to explore both statewide and local adaptations, such as increased water transfer between  Victoria’s supply regions, and more rainwater tanks and water sensitive urban design. Declining rainfall and increasing heat creating bushfire risks Description Rising temperatures and extreme weather events have the potential to increase the frequency and scale  of bushfires. If bushfires occur in catchment areas, it may increase the risk of debris-flow contamination  of water supplies. In other locations, bushfire may affect the operation or lifespan of water, sewerage or  other assets. Potential financial impacts •	 Costs associated with additional water treatment and transfer activities to address water quality  impacts from extreme fire events. •	 Costs associated with making assets more resilient or repairing damage from extreme fire events. Opportunities •	 By proactively investing in adaptation and resilience there may be opportunities to reduce impacts  and costs from fire events. Management Responses •	 Recognising that fire hazards are a significant driver of water supply and quality risk, and may  already be amplified by climate change, we operate ongoing catchment fire risk management  programs in partnership with DEECA, Parks Victoria and the CFA. Refer to the ‘Water supply  catchment management’ section of this report on page 25 for more details on how we prepare and  plan.  ===== PAGE 42 ===== 40   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report OUR ENVIRONMENT  |  CLIMATE CHANGE AND ADAPTATION Increasingly severe rainfalls creating risks of flooding and discharge of sewage Description More intense or extreme rainfall events due to climate change have the potential to result in increased  and more frequent flooding across the region, causing drainage systems, sewerage transfer networks,  treatment plants and rivers to overflow more often. These events would also create a direct physical  and financial risk for affected communities, and environmental impacts. Potential financial impacts •	 Increasing costs associated with emergency management, response and repairs from extreme  flooding events. •	 Costs associated with managing and cleaning up sewage spills. Opportunities •	 Mapping and sharing information on potential future flood risks to inform urban planning and  design, including locating new buildings outside of flood risk areas. •	 When existing buildings are renovated or replaced, they can be designed in a way that increases  resilience and safety when floods occur. •	 Embedding IWM practices in urban planning, design and asset management to incorporate  opportunities that capture and re-use stormwater to reduce smaller floods, improve urban  greening and cooling, and deliver other benefits when drainage and other infrastructure is  developed or renewed. Management Responses •	 We work with the Department of Transport and Planning (DTP), Victorian Planning Authority  (VPA), the Bureau of Meteorology and councils to understand changing flood hazard and urban  development as flood models are updated. Flood maps and related information are shared with all  relevant government stakeholders to inform their decisions and are used by Melbourne Water in  our role as a referral authority for land use and development under the Planning and Environment  Act 1987 (Vic) and in our consultative role under the building regime (pursuant to the Building  Amendment Regulations 2015). •	 In accordance with the Flood Management Strategy Implementation Plan, we have prepared the  Climate change in flood information and land use planning guideline to confirm the climate settings  to be applied through flood modelling and flood hazard planning scheme amendments.  •	 A new Strategic Urban Planning Climate Risk Assessment Framework has also been prepared to  help us assess climate (flood) risk as part of land use and infrastructure decision making, using  both existing and updated flood information. We are now working with the VPA on land use  planning for the Housing Statement precincts to understand flood hazard and guide development  to safer locations.  ===== PAGE 43 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   41 OUR ENVIRONMENT  |  CLIMATE CHANGE AND ADAPTATION Sea level rise and changing coastal process affect assets and ecosystems Description Sea level rise, changing coastal storm and wind patterns, storm surges and the movement of salt water  in estuaries may damage coastal communities, public assets and ecosystems. Potential financial impacts •	 Increased costs for emergency repairs.  •	 Costs associated with the potential relocation of treatment assets from coastal areas. Opportunities •	 By investing in adaptation and resilience ahead of sea level rises, there may be opportunities to  reduce impacts and costs and enable conservation of biodiversity values. Management Responses •	 A detailed coastal hazard assessment for the Western Treatment Plant has commenced, including  input from DEECA. We are also partnering with DEECA and others on ‘Adapt West’, a Port Phillip  Bay Western Shoreline Regional and Strategic Partnership to develop a coordinated regional  approach to managing coastal hazards from Geelong North to Williamstown. In addition, we are  updating our regional Sea Level Rise Guidelines, which are incorporated into the Planning Scheme  and support land use and development decisions as part of our role as a referral authority for land  use and development. Increasingly extreme weather may cause asset and operational damage or disruption Description More extreme weather may damage assets, create disruption to power and other essential supplies and  affect the safety of operations. This could lead to the interruption of services. Potential financial impacts •	 Costs associated with making assets more resilient or repairing damage from extreme events. Opportunities •	 As growth and ageing assets drive expansion and renewal of systems, we have opportunities to  design new investments in a way that helps them function under future conditions. Management Responses •	 Asset system risk assessment processes identify extreme weather hazards and track mitigation  measures. Review of these systems to enable response and planning for climate changes are in  progress.   Transition risks Regulatory and stakeholder expectations Description New and developing regulations may impose requirements associated with transitioning to a lower  carbon economy or limiting the impacts of climate change, which affect our business.  Community expectations for services may change as climate impacts are experienced, but willingness  and ability to pay for adaptation and recovery may be limited. Potential financial impacts •	 Introduction of a carbon price may impact the costs associated with offsetting emissions. •	 Additional increased costs associated with changing requirements. Opportunities •	 As ageing assets are renovated and replaced, or expanded for a growing population, they can be  designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and meet new and anticipated standards. Identifying  and researching uncertain aspects of emission estimation and forecasting can improve the  information we use to meet targets and plan ahead. Management Responses •	 We expect ongoing adjustment of regulations in response to community expectations and  climate change. We are engaged in ongoing dialogue with regulators and regional stakeholders  to understand potential changes and provide data and technical contributions to the evidence  base that informs regulatory change. Transparency on climate risks enables all stakeholders to  participate in determining a pathway forward.  ===== PAGE 44 ===== 42   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report OUR ENVIRONMENT  |  CLIMATE CHANGE AND ADAPTATION Climate risk management Melbourne Water’s Risk Management Framework  Climate change is captured as an overarching strategic enterprise  risk and as a driver of strategic service, operational and business  risks within our Enterprise Risk Universe and overarching Risk  Management Framework (RMF). The design and implementation of  our RMF is regularly reviewed in line with the internal and external  context in which we operate. Our risk management framework is  underpinned by our: •	 Risk Management Policy, which assists Melbourne  Water to meet its organisational objectives by articulating  its commitment to risk management and defining the  organisation’s risk management principles •	 Risk Appetite Statement, which defines the amount of risk  that Melbourne Water is prepared to take in the pursuit of our  vision of enhancing life and liveability.  Melbourne Water continuously seeks to improve and mature its  approach to risk management, which is guided by an annual risk  improvement plan. Currently, the annual risk improvement plan  is being driven by our Risk Management Uplift Plan from 2023 to  2025. Assessing risk The ongoing assessment and management of climate-related risks  also occurs through the following processes: •	 A biannual strategic risk report is provided to the ROSC and  at least annually to the Board, including climate topics. These  reports summarise the current state of overarching climate  risks, any key changes and general performance of controls. •	 Annual asset-system risk assessments capture near-term  weather and climate-related risks to assets and inform an  annual asset condition and risk reporting process. •	 A pilot exploration of longer-term climate-related risks for  selected operating sites over 2023-24 to inform ongoing asset  climate risk process improvement.   •	 Ongoing research and modelling programs to explore and  evaluate potential climate impacts for different areas of  our business under a range of Representative Concentration  Pathways (RCPs). An RCP 8.5 emissions scenario (worst case)  is used in the following cases to interrogate severe climate  changes: 	o water supply - water flows in our region and capacity  of key systems to meet performance standards under  changing conditions 	o sewage treatment - flows and spill risks for sewer transfer  networks and treatment plants. 	o flooding and drainage - changes to rainfall, run-off and  sea-level, which will change the frequency and severity of  flood events 	o waterways and catchments - ecological changes that may  affect catchments and waterways and key environmental  values. •	 Sea-level rise and coastal hazard impact investigations  using a range of sea-level rise benchmarks provided by  state government regulations or recommended by research  institutions such as the CSIRO.  •	 Continued development of our ‘emerging risk’ process and  register to facilitate communication and monitoring of  emerging and uncertain topics that are not amenable to  immediate controls.  ===== PAGE 45 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   43 OUR ENVIRONMENT  |  CLIMATE CHANGE AND ADAPTATION The prediction of a hotter, drier and more unpredictable  climate with greater variability due to climate change means  we need to think differently about how we source and  distribute water in our region.  Using the Guidelines for Assessing the Impact of Climate  Change on Water Availability in Victoria published by the  Victorian Government in 2020, the Greater Melbourne water  corporations have assessed how climate change could impact  on the availability of water from the current supply system  over the next 50 years.  As per the recommendations in the guidelines, three climate  change scenarios using RCP 8.5 emissions scenario are used,  considering varying rainfall outcomes from the suite of Global  Climate Models used in the Intergovernmental Panel on  Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report. It should be  noted that none of these scenarios is seen as more likely than  others. They are all considered as plausible futures that should  be used as a basis for planning future water supplies.  The three climate projection scenarios have been combined  with the three demand growth projection scenarios as the  basis for projecting the potential range of emerging water  supply-demand deficits to address: •	 high climate change impact and high demand growth  •	 medium climate change impact and medium demand  growth  •	 low climate change impact and low demand growth.  Figure 7 shows these projections in our modelling. We have  also assessed the impact of climate variability, which shows  a possible range of available supply. In this figure, we have  selected and shown the median water availability for each of  the three supply scenarios modelled.  The supply and demand modelling indicates that under the  range of scenarios explored, demand is expected to grow, and  climate change will decrease the availability of water from our  existing supplies, requiring us to augment the supply system  over time to develop climate independent water sources.

Figure 7: High, medium and low demand growth and climate change scenarios for 2020–2070  ===== PAGE 46 ===== 44   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report OUR ENVIRONMENT  |  CLIMATE CHANGE AND ADAPTATION Metrics and targets Melbourne Water is responsible for significant greenhouse gas  emissions, primarily through our use of energy and sewage  treatment processes. We are progressing Our Path to Net Zero by  1 July 2029 in line with the Victorian Government’s Statement of  Obligations (Emission Reduction) and the Victorian Government’s  long-term target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.  Under the Victorian Statement of Obligations (Emission Reduction)  Melbourne Water must: 1	 Reduce our annual reportable scope 1 and 2 emissions (as  calculated under NGERS to 204,380 tonnes CO2-e a year by  2024-25 (which represents a 50 per cent reduction from our  408,760 tonnes CO2-e baseline, which was calculated from  our average annual emissions between 2011 and 2016). 2	 Source 100 per cent of our consumed electricity from  renewable sources by 2025. 3	 Reduce our annual reportable scope 1 and scope 2 emissions  to net zero from 1 July 2029. Our Eastern and Western Treatment Plants are also subject to the  Federal Safeguard Mechanism. At a high-level, Melbourne Water’s  greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirements under the  Victorian Statement of Obligations (Emission Reduction) and Federal  Safeguard obligations are complementary. Our energy and emissions A breakdown of our greenhouse gas emissions by service delivery  and electricity consumption from different sources for 2023-24 is  provided in Table 4. All figures are calculated using NGERS carbon  accounting methodologies. For additional breakdowns of our  energy and emissions metrics, refer to Appendix F.  In 2023-24, there was a material decrease in total net scope 1 and  2 emissions of 8.7 per cent compared to financial year 2022-23.  In particular, this is seen in the 19.6 per cent decrease in scope 2  emissions due to greater behind-the-meter electricity generation  capacity.   Melbourne Water’s major sources of self-generated electricity are  solar and biogas. During 2023-24, infrastructure upgrades and  developments across our operations contributed to an increase in  generation from these sources.   New solar farms at the Winneke Water Treatment Plant in  Christmas Hills and the Eastern Treatment Plant began contributing  to Melbourne Water’s energy generation throughout 2023-24.   In addition, the Biogas Handling System was updated at the Eastern  Treatment Plant, maximising biogas conversion to bioenergy and  earning Melbourne Water the 2024 Australian Water Association  Infrastructure Project Innovation Award. At the Western Treatment  Plant, the Plant B power station also became fully operational,  providing an additional 6-megawatt capacity to generate electricity  from biogas.

More information about our fleet and  transport emissions can be found on page 193.  ===== PAGE 48 ===== 46   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report OUR ENVIRONMENT  |  CLIMATE CHANGE AND ADAPTATION Scope 3 emissions Melbourne Water is in the early stages of scoping a strategic  approach to understanding and managing our entire scope 3  emissions profile across the 15 categories prescribed by the  Greenhouse Gas Protocol15. This includes working with the Water  Services Association of Australian to identify potential approaches  at an industry-wide level.   We currently track and report certain contributors to our larger  scope 3 emissions profile, as required under the Ministerial  Reporting Directives. This year, our total scope 3 emissions relating  to waste disposal and commercial air travel decreased by 8.9 per  cent, which can be attributed to a decrease in emissions from  waste disposal due to reduced consumption at our head office site.  However, an increase in commercial air travel emissions was also  seen and, despite a decrease in the number of flights taken in 2023- 24, the emissions increase was attributable to an average higher  distance travelled on these flights.  Improving our understanding of our greenhouse gas emissions Melbourne Water has established and intends to implement a  proactive emissions measurement program, bolstered by the  support of local and international partners. This program aims to  enhance our emissions reporting, ensure greater transparency of  actual emissions and identify opportunities for emissions reduction  across our treatment plants.  Through the development and validation of monitoring protocols  targeting major emission sources of nitrous oxide and methane,  we aim to contribute to the development of new standards  for measurement accuracy and predictive modelling in sewage  treatment facilities. A major focus in this area is nitrous oxide  emissions from nutrient removal processes.

However, it was found that this was utilising a scope 1 emissions factor, which resulted in a significantly higher and erroneous result.  Nitrous oxide emissions monitoring program Melbourne Water’s industry-leading nitrous oxide monitoring  program with The University of Queensland has contributed  fundamental knowledge of nitrous oxide emissions behaviour from  biological nitrogen removal systems.  With over two years of direct measurement data, results have  shown that actual emissions from the monitored system are  approximately three times higher than currently reported under the  NGERS framework.  This year, our reported emissions for nitrous oxide at the Eastern  and Western Treatment Plants were 16,383 and 25,618 t CO2-e  using NGERS carbon accounting methodology, respectively.  However, our direct emission measurement project at the Western  Treatment Plant indicates that nitrous oxide emissions at this  site may be as high as 72,243 t CO2-e, which is not reflected in  the reported emissions in Table 4. Nitrous oxide emissions have  not been continuously monitored at our Eastern Treatment Plant  at this point in time. Variations between reported and measured  nitrous oxide emissions arise from the relevant immaturity in the  science at the time that the current assumptions in the emission  reporting calculation methods under NGERS were set by the  Federal Clean Energy Regulator. As the industry’s understanding of  actual emissions evolves, it is anticipated that emission reporting  methods and calculations will need to be updated to enable  reported emissions to more closely match measured or estimated  emissions. Until this occurs, Melbourne Water is voluntarily  transparently disclosing this discrepancy to ensure our plans focus  on real emission reductions. The monitoring project has also revealed potential opportunities  for Melbourne Water to adjust process conditions, potentially  mitigating a proportion of the emissions from this source. We are  currently testing these adjustments to validate and optimise our  model at the Western Treatment Plant, aiming to effectively reduce  our actual emissions. 15 https://ghgprotocol.org/corporate-value-chain-scope-3-standard  ===== PAGE 49 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   47 OUR ENVIRONMENT  |  CLIMATE CHANGE AND ADAPTATION Sewer Methane Methods for Everyone Co-funded by The Water Research Foundation and multiple  international utilities, including Melbourne Water, Sewer  Methane Methods for Everyone is a joint research project led  by Brown and Caldwell.  By leveraging data from over 40 sewer sheds of varying  climates and sizes, the project aims to enhance our  understanding of sewer methane emissions, which are  presently unaccounted for in national reporting guidelines and,  therefore, currently not included in Melbourne Water’s NGERS  emissions estimates.  Methane technology trial Melbourne Water has initiated a trial in collaboration with UK  company QLM Technology, aimed at deploying its Quantum  Gas LiDAR equipment at the Eastern Treatment Plant. This  imaging technology is designed to detect, visualise and  quantify methane emissions.  International partnership to reduce wastewater emissions Through Melbourne Water’s international alliance with  Danish water utility Aarhus Vand and UK water leader Severn  Trent, partners are building on their experience, expertise and  innovation capacities and aim to establish new international  standards for measuring and reporting emissions.  Projects and research currently underway within the  partnership include:  •	 sharing of data and insights from nitrous oxide emission  measurements at wastewater treatment plants across  Europe and Australia to inform the development of  standardised measurement techniques, future planning  of nitrogen removal plants and mitigation of fugitive  emissions •	 an emissions paper to comprehensively evaluate  methane emissions from wastewater treatment plants  and sludge treatment facilities, which aims to summarise  identified emissions sources, propose normalised  emission factors, discuss the benefits and limitations  of emission measurement technologies and explore  potential mitigation strategies. Collaborative emissions projects  Methane emissions from sludge drying Through collaboration with the University of Melbourne, we have  gained valuable insights into methane emissions from our open- air sludge drying pans, employing both direct measurement and  modelling methodologies.  The findings revealed that methane emissions from this source  closely adhere to NGERS emission factor guidelines, indicating  broad consistency between our reported and actual emissions.  However, findings underscore the significant contribution of  open-air sludge drying to our scope 1 emissions, accounting for  approximately 50 per cent of our total scope 1 emissions. This  highlights the imperative of implementing alternative sludge drying  technologies to curb our scope 1 emissions.   ===== PAGE 50 ===== 48   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report OUR ENVIRONMENT  |  CLIMATE CHANGE AND ADAPTATION 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-23 2023-24 2024-25 2025-26 2026-27 2027-28 2028-29 2029-30  100,000  200,000  300,000  400,000  500,000  600,000 -0 Figure 8: Trajectory of net emissions from baseline year (2016-17) to achievement of ‘net zero’ in 2029-30 (based on NGERS carbon  accounting methodology) Reducing our emissions Integrating transition and physical risk management An Eastern Treatment Plant Solids Adaptive Plan and a Western  Treatment Plant Adaptive Plan have recently been developed. These  plans outline the investments in infrastructure required to ensure  we sustain and improve performance at these facilities now and  into the future.  These adaptive plans outline how Melbourne Water must physically  adapt in response to climate risks such as sea level rise and coastal  erosion, and in its handling and treating wet weather flows to  support a future which may be increasingly reliant on higher quality  recycled water.  The adaptive plans also map out the potential pathways and  the scale of investment required to transform our currently  high greenhouse gas emission sewage treatment plants to  lower emission alternatives (where mature technologies exist).  Importantly, the plans consider our lower emissions alternatives  in conjunction with other strategic and operational drivers such  as groundwater contamination, odour, solids reuse, emerging  contamination and sea level rise. Renewable energy Melbourne Water has a portfolio of onsite energy generation  facilities throughout our water system and wastewater treatment  plants. This onsite generation reduces our need to use electricity  from the grid, which reduces our reportable scope 2 emissions as  calculated under NGERS.  At this time, the Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) from our  onsite energy generation are sold to keep costs to customers down,  which reduces the proportion of electricity that can be reported as  renewable (as seen in Tables 6 and 7). However, to meet our 100  per cent renewable electricity commitment, Melbourne Water will  begin retiring RECs ourselves rather than selling them in 2025-26,  which was accounted for in the assumptions within the 2021 Price  Submission.

Two forest areas  are in progress on Melbourne Water land and site preparation and  planting will progress over winter 2024.  In addition, a third forest area is in planning for a privately owned  landholding, in partnership with a community member seeking to  contribute to regional biodiversity by revegetating a cleared parcel  that historically supported forest cover. Known as the Growing  Carbon Project, this partnership forest planting is jointly funded by  Melbourne Water, Yarra Valley Water and Greater Western Water.  This project will support metropolitan water businesses to achieve  carbon targets, enhance the natural environment and develop  technical carbon project skills that can be shared with the wider  water industry. These forests will be protected for 100 years under  a 100-year ‘permanence period’. As it takes time for the trees to  grow and store carbon, offsets generated from these plantings will  be available for use against targets in approximately five years. We are working with VicWater and other Victorian water  authorities to develop a collaborative approach to long-term  carbon offset sourcing in line with policy that encourages local  investment and catchment health. To meet carbon targets in the near term, Melbourne Water  anticipates a quantity of market-sourced offsets will be required.  An ‘integrity hierarchy’ for Australian carbon offset sourcing was  approved by Melbourne Water’s Board in 2022. This hierarchy  is focused on high-integrity, ‘removals’-based offsets and due- diligence processes, in alignment with principles one and two of  the Oxford Principles for Net Zero Aligned Carbon Offsetting.  An integrity and risk approach for international offsets is in  development, responding to rapidly evolving Australian and  international regulation and best practice. Market sourcing  activities to meet future targets are in progress.  ===== PAGE 52 ===== 50   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report Our community Yarra River, Yarra Bend Park  ===== PAGE 53 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   51 OUR COMMUNITY  |  CUSTOMER, COMMUNITY AND ENGAGEMENT Customer, community  and engagement Our customers and the community  are at the centre of everything we do.

For each customer group, the ecosystem  defines the specific and most important drivers for customer  satisfaction and reputation.  ===== PAGE 54 ===== 52   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report OUR ENVIRONMENT  |  CUSTOMER, COMMUNITY AND ENGAGEMENT Our customer performance As a customer-centric organisation, Melbourne Water continues to  evolve alongside shifting customer expectations, internal priorities  and a dynamic operating environment. This year, we continued  delivering our Customer Program through our formalised Customer  Improvement Planning process, which seeks to address known  pain points, based on insights and data, to enhance our customers’  experience. This work has increased our customer capability and ability to build  customer insights from multiple data sources, including operational  performance and our ongoing customer satisfaction (CSAT)  survey program, enabling our people to better identify areas for  improvement and reinforce successful customer-centric outcomes. Improved visibility of our customers’ experiences through data  also allows us to see links between our operational service delivery  performance and customer results and feedback received through  our survey programs. Reputation and customer satisfaction by service Melbourne Water’s reputation score with our customers and the  community was at 71.3 in June 2024 (an increase on 69.4 in June  2023).   Scores are independently determined by RepTrak, a global  reputation monitoring agency that has undertaken this work for  Melbourne Water since 2014. The score establishes the levels of  trust, esteem, admiration and respect felt by our customers and  community.  Our customer experience framework continues to focus on  delivering enhanced customer experiences in our role as a regulator  and bulk water supplier. Our customer experience improvement  programs highlight opportunities across our organisation to  improve customer experiences with our services and to provide  positive customer experiences, even when delivering on our  statutory responsibilities and regulatory outcomes. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Overall Reputation Community Customer Overall 71.3 79.9 77.1 75.9 75.8 69.4 70.5 Jun-21 Dec-21 Jun-22 Dec-22 Jun-23 Dec-23 Jun-24 Figure 9: Customer reputation and satisfaction scores Customer Service Centre results This year, our Customer Service Centre improved on prior year  results in the independent Customer Service Benchmarking  Australia call quality and customer experience benchmarking  program.

Melbourne Water continues to define its community  engagement by our six engagement principles: •	 Transparent •	 Timely •	 Meaningful  •	 Considered •	 Inclusive •	 Reflective. Driven by these principles, Melbourne Water is continuing  to expand its reach and involve more people in the strategic  decisions we make through integrated digital and face-to-face  engagement. This approach is led by insights into our customers’  preferences for engagement and information sharing, which creates  meaningful opportunities for greater diversity and inclusivity in our  engagement practices. Tailored and multi-staged engagement programs are being rolled  out in support of several significant, strategic activities, including: •	 public consultation on the Maribyrnong River Flood Review  submission process •	 implementation actions in support of our Flood Management  Strategy to build community resilience and awareness of flood  risks and take proactive action to be ready for flood events •	 delivery of a range of strategic engagement and educational  activities to raise awareness of our Western and Eastern  Treatment Plants •	 exploration of recreation opportunities at the Yan Yean and  Tarago reservoirs •	 delivery of an ‘engagement always on’ approach to key  precincts in our operating area, such as Patterson Lakes, Koo  Wee Rup Longwarry Flood Protection District and Spotswood •	 strategic communications and engagement planning for the  2026 Price Submission •	 24/7 incident response to provide support to the business on  communications and media •	 the rollout of an extensive infrastructure delivery program and  community group projects, with targeted engagement with  local communities. Our tailored engagement and communication approaches employ  a range of methods, including community bulletins, focus groups,  doorknocks, pop-up events and online approaches, such as  deliberative panels, co-design, digital platforms and social media.  We apply an evidence-based understanding of our target audiences,  informed by our customer insights research program, in addition to  the IAP2 (International Association for Public Participation) levels  of engagement to tailor the right types of engagement at the right  times to reach a broad and diverse audience. We will continue to  expand our digital engagement tools and focus on improving the  evolution of our Let’s Talk engagement platform to maximise two- way engagement and accessible language translation features.  ===== PAGE 56 ===== 54   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report Engaging our customers and community in 2026 Price  Submission In preparation for Melbourne Water’s 2026 Price Submission, we  are delivering a multi-faceted engagement program to ensure the  voice of partners, customers, Traditional Owners, government and  the community is embedded within our Price Submission process.  Over the past year, Melbourne Water has established the Water  Corporation Forums, run deliberative panels and heard from over  1,200 people across Greater Melbourne in a social research survey  to understand community priorities. In 2024-25, our planned engagement includes regular meetings  with key stakeholders, forums with our community panel and  direct service customers, and surveys with the broader community.  This work aims to build our understanding of our customers, and  communities’ priorities as they relate to investment trade-offs and  validate whether we have incorporated their collective views into  the draft submission. We will continue to build on these findings to ensure our  customers’ voices and priorities influence how we work as a  business and deliver value to Greater Melbourne. Water literacy An evidence-based approach and behaviour change framework  underpin Melbourne Water’s approach to connecting with  customers in an engaging way to improve the water literacy of all  Melburnians. In a water-literate community, customers are informed about  water cycle management and empowered to participate in shaping  the future of Melbourne’s water. Improved water literacy also drives  an increase in customers’ familiarity with our organisation, which  creates a platform for Melbourne Water to deliver key programs of  work into the future. Water literacy has been built into our 2021 Price Determination  and is measured through research and insights gathered on a  quarterly basis via brand tracking, and biannually via the water  issues survey. This year, our Water Literacy Program engaged with over 11,000  people through a range of in person tours and educational  programs delivered to a wide range of audiences, including school  groups and Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) community  audiences. In partnership with ABC Education, we co-created content and  resources for students and teachers aligned with the curriculum  and focused on a Kids-Teaching-Kids approach to learning in  delivering information about all aspects of the water cycle. This  initiative has been cross-promoted via Melbourne Water and ABC  Education, reaching over 2,000 views with students, teachers and  community. Our partnership with Scienceworks supporting Melbourne Water’s  Hobson’s Main Drain project, co-created a choose-your-own  adventure style experience, Super Sewage, and used play and  exploration to encourage participation and learning about the  Hobson Bay Sewer and the water cycle. The experience ran for two  weeks during spring school holidays and resulted in 2,615 children  and adults engaging and learning about the hidden water world  below our city. WaterWatch community involvement As part of Melbourne Water’s Community Connections Team,  WaterWatch facilitates the delivery of community capacity building  programs to build awareness of and practically enhance waterways  and the environment. Some of our key partners in this include  volunteers, environmental groups, the Werribee Riverkeeper,  Maribyrnong River and Waterways Association, Yarra Riverkeeper,  Port Phillip EcoCentre, and Merri Creek and Darebin Creek  management committees. This year, WaterWatch volunteers actively participated in litter  clean-ups, educational initiatives, tree planting, webinars and  citizen science programs, including the Frog Census, water quality  monitoring, EstuaryWatch and PlatypusSpot programs. The efforts  of these dedicated volunteers have led to increased knowledge  of waterway management, a greater understanding of species  diversity and abundance, and on-ground action resulting in  improved habitat for waterways and biodiversity.  WaterWatch attended and presented at the National ‘Future of  Platypus Conference’ in October 2023. With strong interest from  attendees, the WaterWatch team established the National Platypus  Network, bringing together scientists, researchers, community  engagement practitioners, government bodies and wildlife  managers for the first time and establishing quarterly meetings at  which the network can share ideas, knowledge and resources that  enhance the protection of platypus.   In April 2024, Melbourne Water celebrated citizen science month  and WaterWatch delivered four community events to engage and  encourage citizen scientists to collect frog records for the Frog  Census. Participants in these events drove an increase in data  collection that will contribute to shaping waterway management  decisions, particularly for frog species known to be in decline. OUR ENVIRONMENT  |  CUSTOMER, COMMUNITY AND ENGAGEMENT  ===== PAGE 57 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   55 Recognising  recreational values Our approach The CMOP informs how Melbourne  Water approaches our adherence to  water quality requirements, while also  meeting the Victorian Government’s  expectations to increase access to and  recreation at some catchments under Water for Victoria. Melbourne Water has worked with DEECA and other partners  to explore opportunities for recreation in water supply  catchments, including options for land activation along  waterways, pipe tracks and retarding basins. Melbourne Water’s website17 provides information for  numerous recreational activities, such as locations of barbecue  areas, walking tracks and bike paths, and advice for fishing  and bird watching. We also assess opportunities to release  environmental water over long weekends to support canoeing,  fishing and camping along waterways. There are no Recreational Area Management Plans in place  for reservoirs under the management of Melbourne Water  as these are closed and protected catchments as part of the  water supply system. Should the nature of any of the reservoirs  managed by Melbourne Water change to include recreation,  Melbourne Water would examine all available management  options, including those provided under a Recreational Area  Management Plan. Tarago Reservoir Melbourne Water has continued to work with DEECA, Better  Boating Victoria and other relevant stakeholders to deliver drinking  water treatment upgrades as part of the $12.4 million project to  open Tarago Reservoir to some boating for fishing.  17 https://www.melbournewater.com.au/things-do OUR ENVIRONMENT  |  RECOGNISING RECREATIONAL VALUES The water supply catchments and  reservoirs around Greater Melbourne  are significant assets to the Victorian  community. They provide places for  people to gather, exercise and relax  and are important sites of cultural  significance. Design for the water treatment plant upgrade is underway and  construction works are scheduled for completion by July 2025.  Melbourne Water is committed to providing high-quality drinking  water and, therefore, all treatment upgrades will be completed  before any recreational activities commence. Maribyrnong River  ===== PAGE 58 ===== 56   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report OUR ENVIRONMENT  |  RECOGNISING RECREATIONAL VALUES Moonee Ponds creek Revitalising Yan Yean Reservoir Yan Yean Reservoir Park is a valuable public recreation space and  popular location for walking and picnics. As part of Melbourne  Water’s vision to enhance life and liveability, we are exploring ways  Yan Yean Reservoir can offer enhanced recreational and open space  opportunities for the community.  Following intensive engagement with residents and locals, and  completion of a Cultural Values Assessment, we are continuing  to work with project partners (Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung Cultural  Heritage Aboriginal Corporation (WWCHAC), Parks Victoria and  City of Whittlesea) to develop a Future Directions Plan (FDP).  The FDP will consolidate our collective vision for the site, identify  potential issues and opportunities, and help inform future  recreational opportunities in keeping with the site’s important  water supply function and inherent environmental and cultural  values.  To help inform the FDP, we are also working with WWCHAC to  undertake eDNA sampling to better understand the aquatic species  present in the water reservoir.  Reimagining Your Creek Reimagining Your Creek is a collaborative program that revitalises  concrete channels into natural spaces for community enjoyment,  resulting in enhanced liveability and environmental benefits.  This initiative holds particular significance for suburbs where  opportunities for exercise, recreation and relaxation in natural or  open spaces are limited.  Reimagining Your Creek adopts a co-design approach that  actively involves local communities, leveraging their knowledge,  suggestions and values to optimise liveability outcomes. These  projects are delivered in collaboration with DEECA, ensuring  alignment with IWM policies. We also work in close partnership  with Traditional Owners, local government and communities  throughout the design, planning and implementation stages of the  projects. Blind Creek Construction on Blind Creek at Lewis Park is almost complete.  The new waterways and wetlands are now fully constructed with  planting scheduled to take place in spring 2024. The project will:  •	 naturalise 1.7 kilometres of underground drain •	 create three new wetlands •	 create 6.3 kilometres of new shared pathways for community  recreation and access along the creek •	 provide 677,000 plants for improved biodiversity outcomes  and 1,700 trees for improved shade and cooling •	 develop community infrastructure assets, such as viewing  platforms, a pedestrian bridge, steppingstone crossings and  seating. Moonee Ponds Creek Construction on Moonee Ponds Creek will be completed in late  2024. The project will convert a 360-metre section of the concrete- lined channel into a more natural and enjoyable community space.  This transformation involves the planting of 43,000 native trees  and shrubs, the establishment of new shared paths and a bridge,  and the creation of a pond and terracing near Oak Park Reserve.  By re-naturalising the area, the creek-side environment will become  more attractive, providing an opportunity for people to engage  with nature in a cooler and healthier setting. This initiative will  contribute to improved water quality and waterway health by  regulating water flow, enhancing biodiversity and native species  habitat, and activating open spaces. The initiative will also improve  connections for active transportation. These efforts aim to enhance  community connection and recreation in the area.  ===== PAGE 59 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   57 Recognising  Aboriginal values We will walk Country together and  recognise that the Traditional Owners  of the region have connections to and  hold ancient knowledge of the land and  water that are inseparable from their  lives. In tending to all the rivers, creeks  and surrounding land, we work as  partners, we listen, and we tell the truth  with Traditional Owners throughout our  region. Our approach Melbourne Water’s approach to  Traditional Owner relationships  considers Traditional Owner  organisations as sovereign partners  in land and water management, not  customers or stakeholders to be consulted in relation to these  matters. In 2023-24, we continued to develop as a culturally  competent organisation by partnering with Traditional Owners  on a range of activities and projects and by implementing our  Innovate III Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP). We have also been  drafting and engaging externally on a Stretch Reconciliation  Action Plan to be launched in 2024-25.  Traditional Owner partnership agreements Melbourne Water is guided by Water is Life: Traditional Owner  Access to Water Roadmap18 and Victorian Government policy  direction, which place a high priority on working with Traditional  Owners (particularly those registered with Aboriginal Party status)  in recognition of the right people for Country. This year, we continued our journey with Traditional Owners  towards formal partnership agreements, working with both  Gunaikurnai Land and Waters Aboriginal Corporation (GLaWAC)  and Wadawurrung Traditional Owner Aboriginal Corporation to  implement our commitments. These agreements are bespoke to  the relationship and designed to clearly articulate our roles, agreed  priority outcomes and activities to enable Traditional Owners to  achieve self-determined outcomes. We are committed to formalising a partnership with Wurundjeri  Woi-wurrung Corporation in 2024-25 and will progress discussions  towards a formal agreement.

Management of  Silvertop will continue as a discussion topic into 2024-25 and  include face-to-face meetings. Traditional Owner relationships Our strategic goal of ‘We will walk Country together’ aims to give a  voice to Traditional Owners, instead of speaking on their behalf. The  following sections have been developed with our Traditional Owner  partners for inclusion within this report to share their stories and  their relationship with Melbourne Water over 2023-24. Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung Provided by the Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung Cultural Heritage Aboriginal  Corporation During 2023-24, Melbourne Water continued our ongoing  relationship with Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung Cultural Heritage  Aboriginal Corporation. Discussions during the year have included  developing a formal partnership between the two parties, with  discussion ongoing. Melbourne Water acknowledge the impact  settlement and development, and the management of water has  had and continues to have on Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung community  and are thankful for the ability to work together. Our work together has several focal areas, including cultural  ceremony and consultations, cultural heritage management,  cultural values work and cultural mapping, cultural awareness  and education, water strategy and policy and caring for Country.  Developing a formal partnership together will be complex and a  process has been initiated to continue into 2024-25.  There has been steady growth of the Narrap Unit Water Program in  terms of capacity and ability to participate. Some key highlights for  the year include the negotiations around the Amcor water licence  and working towards water returns to the Birrarung, involvement  in seasonal watering plans and streamflow management plans. The  Narrap Water Program also had input into the Healthy Waterways  Strategy mid-term review in 2024 and provided contribution  to the development of the Watts River Integrated Catchment  Management Plan. The Water Program also had critical involvement in the  implementation of Burndap Birrarung burndap umarkoo (Yarra  Strategic Plan) and the CGRSWS and have welcomed the launch  of Water is Life and support its actions and guiding principles.  There are several other key strategies requiring time and thought,  including the Regional Catchment Strategy, development of new  National Landcare Program projects and the review of the Victorian  Waterway Management Framework. Participation in conferences and research have been highlights,  with Narrap staff presenting and participating in OzWater in  May 2024. Narrap also hosted a conference tour to Bolin Bolin  Wetland, highlighting the research partnership with Melbourne  OUR ENVIRONMENT  |  RECOGNISING ABORIGINAL VALUES Water and Melbourne University. Wurundjeri Corporation and  Melbourne Water continued to discuss data sovereignty, data use  and reuse with a series of workshops to renew data use protocols.  Narrap Rangers also completed eDNA training in 2024 and are  now qualified to take and process samples. Several fauna and flora  surveys are planned for the coming year and further eDNA testing  continually increases knowledge of Country. The Narrap Ranger team were very busy during 2023-24 and  capacity has increased. The team has grown to 25 Rangers and 6  project support staff with a dedicated crew working many contracts  for Melbourne Water. Some of the key sites have been Yan Yean  Reservoir, Bolin Bolin, Laughing Waters, Macedon, Lerderderg,  Coranderrk Creek, Brushy Creek, Deep Creek and Dights Falls. Main  tasks include managing culturally significant sites, weed control,  revegetation, site assessments and, monitoring for waterway, flora  and fauna health. During 2024, the Narrap Unit have been supported to develop a  Yan Yean Healthy Country Plan. The planning process will conclude  in late 2024 and involves all team members in workshopping  with leaders and finalising a plan supported by Trust for Nature.  Melbourne Water have enabled this process but are not involved  in the planning itself until the end of the process to allow Narrap  Unit members to self-determine values and management priorities  without influence. Looking at the year ahead, Wurundjeri Corporation welcome  the support and commitment of Melbourne Water in the steady  sustained growth of Wurundjeri capability to participate in  decision-making and planning regarding their waterways and  cultural landscapes.

These aligned with key themes and priorities of the Partnership  Agreement.  Monthly partnership steering committee meetings with  representatives from both WTOAC and Melbourne Water across  their program areas has played an important coordination role for  the partnership, building relationships and understanding of each  other’s work and sharing information.    Through WTOAC cultural education sessions and ceremonies, such  as on Country cultural awareness sessions with Wadawurrung’s  cultural educator Ash Skinner, have been delivered to Melbourne  Water staff. Online lunch and learn sessions have also been held  on the topics of cultural heritage assessments, cultural values  assessments and cultural heritage permits and how they are used  in protecting Wadawurrung cultural landscapes.  A highlight project has seen the Digital Education Centre at the  Western Treatment Plant transformed with the integration of  Wadawurrung artist Chloe Chatterton’s spirited partnership  agreement artwork, Walking on Wadawurrung Dja, into the  education hall.  The centre has additionally enabled sharing of Wadawurrung  continuing connections and culture with students, learning  about Yaluks (waterways), who Wadawurrung are and fostering  connections with the cultural landscape around them through art,  animation and digital storytelling.  Caring for Country  Two of a series of three collaborative workshops between  Wadawurrung and Melbourne Water staff were held to build  knowledge, relationships and ways of working together, helping to  understand each other's program areas, create staff connections  and strengthen relationships. The October 2023 workshop focused  on defining what the partnership is and what current and future  projects are going on.  The June 2024 workshop was focused on wiyn murrup (fire spirit),  the work in cultural burning, sharing knowledge on what it has  meant to the health of Wadawurrung people and the grasslands  and on the previous year’s cultural burning role in healing the  grasslands and strengthening Wadawurrung people. The workshop  also focused on working with private landholders on caring for  Country and looking after cultural heritage projects, plus forming  a partnership communications plan. From these workshops, a five- year partnership implementation plan is being developed.   In December 2023, Melbourne Water executive and staff visited  WTOAC’s Gobata Dja (Caring for Country) nursery and base at  Bostock, near Ballan, providing an opportunity for Wadawurrung  Traditional Owners to proudly share the journey of how the Gobata  Dja program, team and base has grown, the future needs, growth  and direction, with nursery expansions underway, to see more  culturally important plants and threatened species back on Dja  and the need for additional equipment, fire equipped vehicles and  a base or depot closer to the grasslands and coast to better enable  Wadawurrung to care for Dja.  WTOAC welcomed Melbourne Water support and response to this  in getting a fire vehicle this year and having five of our younger  Traditional Owners go through General Fire Fighter training to  further support the Wiyn Murrup – cultural burning team – to build  WTOAC’s fire capacity and better meet the increasing needs and  opportunities for cultural burns both within the Western Treatment  Plant and across Wadawurrung Dja.  Wadawurrung Gobata Dja (Caring for Country) team, project  officers' field and nursery crew are continuing to build their services  and capacity, holding a series of on Country knowledge building  days, on Yaluks (waterways) and wetlands, including one at the  Western Treatment Plant in September 2024. Here the team  undertook an induction at the Western Treatment Plant, so they  now have safe access to the site and keys to gates and buildings  to do caring for Country works across the Western Treatment  Plant, including the opportunity to monitor cultural burn sites,  seeing burnt and unburnt Country, showing how beneficial cultural  burns are to Country and their healthy biodiversity and spending  time with grassland ecologist strengthening and building their  knowledge around grasslands species and sharing their cultural  knowledge.

This  collaboration has involved Environmental Water Planners in  Service Futures and at the delivery end, the Environmental Water  Resources delivery team.  This collaboration has also involved regular meetings and check-ins  every few months. During regular catch ups, environmental water  planning and policy, flows studies, Sustainable Water Strategy  actions, water recovery and IWM were discussed.  There have also been some practical discussions about the  Werribee River system, and, in particular, the Lower Werribee  Diversion Weir Fishway onsite meeting. This meeting was on  Country to talk about the concept of putting a fishway at the  diversion weir, to provide fish movement up with Werribee River.  Bunurong Land Council have also been involved in science and  research during the year, including two Tupong monitoring sessions  on the Werribee River. These were conducted out in a specialist  boat with scientists from the Arthur Rylah Institute collecting  logged Tupong records. The purpose of this project was to track  Tupong movement down the Werribee after an environmental  water release below the diversion weir. This is an important species  for Bunurong and also an important method to improve their  knowledge of culturally important species. The Melbourne Water Waterways and Wetlands research manager  continues to work with Bunurong seagrass restoration in Western  Port with support from Deakin University. There have also been  eDNA training and surveys within and surrounding Port Phillip Bay. Late in the year, following on from an enlightening presentation  on values and methodologies for cultural mapping on Bunurong  Country during National Reconciliation Week in collaboration  with South East Water, the Bunurong Land Council put together  an innovative project to record cultural information in the  Westernport Bay landscape, which will be continued into 2024-25.  This will provide an array of benefits as Bunurong increase their  participation in land and waterway management with Melbourne  Water. Melbourne Water and Bunurong Land Council continued its  partnership through the Indigenous Ramsar Ranger program,  helping to protect the culturally and ecologically significant  Westernport Ramsar wetland. This year marked the fourth year of  this important partnership, with representatives from Bunurong  Land Council assisting with the delivery of flora and fauna  monitoring on French Island and Millowl (Phillip Island). Other  highlights included helping restore mangrove forests by planting  thousands of seedlings along the coastal foreshores at Hastings and  Grantville.

Through our Walking Country  Together Leaders Forum we have ensured a focus on respectful  relationships, embedding protocols and procedures, ensuring  a culturally safe workplace, continuous growth in our cultural  learning, supporting self-determination and Traditional Owner  aspirations and opportunities to support Aboriginal business  prosperity. Melbourne Water’s journey from 2024-25 onward will be a Stretch  Reconciliation Action Plan, which involves continued progress  toward targets. National Reconciliation Week 2024 Highlights of National Reconciliation Week 2024 included: •	 a community barbecue at Dardi Munwurro in Preston •	 a Welcome and Smoking ceremony at the Eastern Treatment  Plant, raising money and providing donations to Nairm  djambana (Frankston Gathering Place) with Bunurong Land  Council •	 our inaugural lunchtime cultural film event at Melbourne  Water’s Docklands office •	 an event with guest speakers at Yarra Valley Water’s office in  Mitcham •	 a collaboration with South East Water at Frankston with a  Bunurong Land Council archaeologist discussing cultural  mapping. OUR ENVIRONMENT  |  RECOGNISING ABORIGINAL VALUES Yoorrook Justice Commission The Yoorrook Justice Commission was established as a Royal  Commission to lead the inquiry into the impact of colonisation  on First Peoples in Victoria and is the first of its kind in Australia.  The Commission began in March 2022 and will establish an  official public record and shared understanding of the impact  of colonisation on First Peoples in Victoria. It will make  recommendations for healing and system reform, and practical  changes to laws, policy and education. The Commission will also  outline matters to be included in future treaties. Throughout 2023-24, we prepared and tested plans and  approaches to be an enabler of this truth-telling process and to  respond promptly to any requests from the Commission with  openness and transparency. The Commission hearings into Land, Sky and Waters were  undertaken throughout the first half of 2024. Although Melbourne  Water was not required to appear at the Commission, we actively  supported the important work of the Commission and ensured our  staff were informed on the role of the Commission and likely areas  of relevance to Melbourne Water. We also provided updates and  wellbeing support to our Aboriginal staff given the topics and issues  raised at the Commission.  ===== PAGE 64 ===== 62   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report Our business Our organisation is our people.

OUR BUSINESS  |  OUR PEOPLE Culture and engagement In 2023, Melbourne Water launched its refreshed values and  behaviours (Figure 11) to lay the foundation for our future fit  culture aspiration. The launch included updated collateral and  new awareness raising visuals throughout our workplaces and was  integrated into our learning curriculum run for leaders through  culture workshops. Shifting culture is a medium to long-term proposition, the full  impacts may not be felt in the short-term and will be embedded  and reinforced through a robust culture change program over the  following years. Our newly established project team has dedicated  change management support and a multi-horizon project plan that  outlines how different elements of shifting culture and building  capability will move us towards our future fit ambition. Culture and engagement survey Melbourne Water conducted its employee engagement survey in  June 2023. Since then, we have moved from a single annual survey  and added more frequent opportunities to listen to employees  by listening by introducing pulse surveys in November 2023  and March 2024. This agile approach aims to focus on specific  themes and feedback more often and adapt to changing needs and  environmental factors.  Melbourne Water returned an engagement score of 60 per cent in  our March 2024 pulse survey, up 2 per cent from November 2023.  The next comprehensive annual survey will take place in July 2024.  What we do well Our surveys showed: •	 75 per cent of employees take great pride in contributing to  Melbourne’s quality of life •	 70 per cent answered favourably to recommending Melbourne  Water as ‘a great place to work’ •	 87 per cent answering favourably to their leader genuinely  caring about their safety and wellbeing •	 84 per cent believe the organisation supports a diverse and  inclusive workforce. Areas for improvement Our surveys told us: •	 There is a need for increased transparency and visibility of  leadership to role model our refreshed culture/values and  build trust.  •	 Our people want more development opportunities, career  growth and robust discussions with their leaders on work goals  and clarity on the path ahead. Figure 11: Melbourne Water values and behaviours  ===== PAGE 67 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   65 OUR BUSINESS  |  OUR PEOPLE Diversity and inclusion Melbourne Water is dedicated to fostering a truly inclusive  workplace culture where all employees know and feel they  belong and which respects and values diversity in backgrounds,  perspectives, skill sets and contributions. Melbourne Water’s  Diversity & Inclusion Strategy (2020-2025)19 acts as an overarching  framework for our individual action plans, which provide specific,  measurable objectives to ensure progress and accountability.  Our Belonging Framework was implemented in 2024 and serves  as our diversity and inclusion operating model. This intersectional  framework places belonging at the forefront, engaging allies,  fostering community and connection for individuals with lived  experience, and promoting collaborative, efficient work across the  business. We seek to provide inclusive environments where people from our  diversity and inclusion focus areas have equity in opportunities,  knowing they are safe, affirmed, celebrated and can confidently  bring their authentic selves to work. By cultivating an inclusive  culture, identifying and removing barriers to participation, and  providing opportunities for those facing significant employment  inequities, we aim to enhance the diversity and vibrancy of our  workforce. Melbourne Water’s Interim Accessibility Action Plan and LGBTIQA+  Inclusion Plan have been developed to align with the conclusion  of our current Diversity & Inclusion Strategy (2020-2025). This  prepares us for the development of our longer-term accessibility  and LGBTIQA+ actions within our future Belonging Workplan (2025  - 2028), which supports Melbourne Water’s compliance with the  Disability Act 2006. Diversity and inclusion snapshot •	 Women now represent 40.9 per cent of Melbourne Water’s  workforce, an increase of 5.4 per cent over the previous five  years. •	 Female representation has decreased 0.8 per cent since 2023  (down from 41.7 per cent in 2023).  •	 Females now represent 41.5 per cent of our Senior Leadership  Group roles. •	 The current gender pay gap is a -1.4 per cent variance between  the base salary of women and men at Melbourne Water.  •	 We have 15 team members who identify as Aboriginal  and Torres Strait Islander and make up 1.1 per cent of our  workforce (up from 0.9 per cent in 2022-23). We have a target  of increasing this to 3 per cent by 2027. •	 This year, 378 employees undertook a cross-cultural training  course. Cultural awareness training Embedding an ongoing cultural education and training plan to  develop Melbourne Water employees’ knowledge and awareness  of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and culture is  key to supporting and achieving reconciliation. In 2023-24, we  continued to embed our three-tiered Cultural Awareness Training  plan, including online cultural competency and awareness training  for employees, training by third-party providers (not Traditional  Owners) and training by Traditional Owners delivered on Country. 19 https://www.melbournewater.com.au/about/what-we-do/policies Training type Number of employees in 2023-24 Cultural awareness eLearn 322 Full day externally provided training 23 Training on country with Traditional Owners 75 Table 8: Participation in cultural education and training in 2023-24  ===== PAGE 68 ===== 66   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report Gender Equality Action Plan Melbourne Water's Gender Equality Action Plan 2022-2025  (GEAP)20  outlines our strategies and measures to promote gender  equity within the organisation and the progress made on these  initiatives, providing insights into completed actions, ongoing  efforts and future plans. Key focus areas include improving  gender diversity, fostering an inclusive culture and ensuring equal  opportunities for all employees. In February 2024, Melbourne Water submitted its Gender Equality  Progress Report to the Gender Equality Commission, outlining the  actions we have taken on our 110 strategies and measures included  within our GEAP. Some of the key actions and outcomes for 2023- 24 include the following: •	 A digital Diversity & Inclusion Information form was rolled  out across Melbourne Water to capture broader intersectional  data across our organisation, including gender, living with a  disability, cultural identity, religion, sexual orientation and  whether the person identifies as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait  Islander. •	 Employee engagement events discussed equity issues,  including sexual harassment, family violence, psychological  safety, challenging implicit biases, challenging assumptions  around job roles and the concept of intersectionality.  Engagement events and forums included the Belonging  Framework Launch, International Women's Day, IDAHOBIT,  NAIDOC Week, Reconciliation Week and International Day of  People with a Disability. Events included speakers who shared  their intersectional experiences. •	 Melbourne Water continues to monitor parental leave rates,  including data on uptake of and return from parental leave.  Our data reports an overall improvement towards a more  gender-balanced uptake and return from parental leave across  the organisation. We reported that females represented the  majority of staff who accessed paid Parental Leave within  the 2023-24 progress reporting period (51.4 per cent). This is  a decrease of 8.6 per cent from our 2020-21 baseline audit,  which reported a 60 per cent female majority, illustrating a  shift in caring responsibilities between men and women post  the COVID-19 pandemic. 20 https://www.melbournewater.com.au/about/what-we-do/policies OUR BUSINESS  |  OUR PEOPLE Cultural and linguistic diversity Through our new operating model ‘The Belonging Framework’,  Melbourne Water has established and implemented a CALD  Working Group. Comprised of allies and people with lived  experience, the Working Group aims to accelerate the progress of  our CALD Action Plan and support the operations of our Connect  Group, which provide community and connection for people with  lived experience.  In addition, the Pathways Program, in partnership with Jesuit Social  Services, aims to increase diversity by providing opportunities for  qualified individuals from CALD backgrounds to gain Australian  work experience.  ===== PAGE 69 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   67 OUR BUSINESS  |  SAFETY, HEALTH AND WELLBEING Safety, health and  wellbeing Keeping our people and the community  safe. Our approach Keeping people safe is our highest  priority, whether they are employees,  contractors, delivery partners,  volunteers or visitors. This year, we began the development  of a new Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) Framework  to provide an opportunity for Melbourne Water to set a  five-year direction to enhance HSE focused performance. This  framework is underpinned by a clear set of revised targets and  objectives. Key drivers for the HSE Framework are to: •	 strengthen the integrity of our management system  performance through the publication of comprehensive  HSE objectives at the organisation’s top level •	 take a more informed and longer-term approach to HSE  improvement •	 proactively manage our risks with a focus on leading  indicators •	 expand the focus of our existing safety reporting to  include health and wellbeing and the environment. The HSE Framework includes design principles that can be  applied across Melbourne Water’s diverse risk profile from  major hazard facilities to treatment plants, pumping stations,  wetlands and catchment areas. This requires the diligent  application of process safety principles across our water  and sewage treatment plants, and the use of dynamic risk  assessment tools while in the field weeding, slashing and  operating a chain saw.  To prioritise our safety efforts effectively, we employ a critical  risk methodology. This approach focuses on identifying and  mitigating risks that pose the greatest potential harm. By  concentrating on these high-risk areas, we ensure that our  assurance activities are targeted and aimed at reducing  significant risks throughout our operations.  ===== PAGE 70 ===== 68   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report Health and safety initiatives Following consultation with Melbourne Water’s Health and  Safety Representatives (HSRs) and the broader business, a Health,  Safety and Wellbeing Calendar was created to capture themes  and improvement initiatives closely aligned with our risk profile.  Additionally, we continue to produce Working Well, our quarterly  newsletter, which features news related to health, safety and  wellbeing, practical articles, lessons learned and operational  insights. Business-wide campaigns This year, we ran the following health and safety campaigns: •	 RUOK? Day - Dedicated to raising mental health awareness  and providing support, the campaign attracted over 200  participants. From 2024, we introduced a series of RUOK  speaker events to make the campaign more intimate and  engaging, which featured both external speakers and personal  stories from Melbourne Water colleagues. The ongoing series  ensures a continuous focus on wellbeing, aims to reduce  stigma and fosters a more supportive work environment. •	 Safe Work Month - In collaboration with WorkSafe and  other partners, Melbourne Water hosted a series of in-person  and online sessions in October 2023. These emphasised our  commitment to workplace health, safety and wellbeing and  focused on essential strategies for resilience, improving sleep,  financial management and enhancing a safety culture. •	 The Step Challenge - This three-week initiative fostered  team engagement and promoted physical activity, mental  health and social connection. Over 450 participants took part,  surpassing last year's involvement by over 100. Our Corporate  Services team emerged as the victors, averaging 139,819 steps  per participant — equivalent to two full marathons. •	 Flu Vaccination Program - Melbourne Water employees and  their families were offered complimentary influenza vaccines,  helping to safeguard against seasonal illness. This annual  initiative provided access to the vaccine through pop-up  clinics at Melbourne Water sites or by redeeming a vaccination  voucher at participating pharmacies. •	 Employee Assistance Program (EAP) - The EAP remains a  cornerstone of support for our employees. EAP Awareness  Sessions helped participants discover the breadth of services  available, spanning traditional counselling, assistance with  nutrition, and lifestyle and financial matters.  Mental health and wellbeing framework Melbourne Water aims to foster a culture of employee wellbeing  by addressing psychosocial hazards in the workplace. Collaborating  with Lysander, we conducted interviews and workshops across our  portfolios to gain deeper insights and inform the development of a  Psychosocial Hazard Action Plan.  This plan aims to promote physical, mental, and social health,  while also enhancing our organisational culture and creating  an environment where every individual can thrive. Aligned  with the proposed Occupational Health and Safety Amendment  (Psychological Health) Regulations, our focus extends beyond  compliance to enriching Melbourne Water's culture and fostering a  supportive workplace. Our performance Melbourne Water successfully renewed the certification of our  Integrated Management System to accredited ISO9001, ISO45001,  ISO14001 and ISO22000 for another six years, confirming our  systems’ integrity and resilience.  Our total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) increased from  3.1 (June 2023) to 7.6 (June 2024). The increase in TRIFR can  largely be attributed to a heightened focus on event governance  and reporting. Over the period we had an increase in the instances  of both near misses and incident reporting. In addition, through  tighter governance, more cases of recordable injuries were  identified amongst the reported events. There was specifically  an increase in the contribution of restricted work injuries. It was  also observed through injury analysis that the severity of injuries  decreased over the financial year. Further analysis observed that the majority of injuries over the  financial year were minor muscular and skeletal strains and sprains  associated with manual works in our waterway maintenance.  Measures are in place to correct the trend, including:  •	 making it a priority to investigate and learn from events to  identify systemic causes   •	 establishing a heightened focus on lead indicators through  increased assurance  •	 ensuring preparedness and fitness for work   •	 a campaign educating our frontline people leaders on safety  leadership and their obligations. The most serious injury for 2023-24 occurred on one of our major  capital projects and involved a truck rollover where the driver was  hospitalised as a result of the injuries sustained. An investigation  was performed and corrective actions implemented.  In addition to recordable injuries, Melbourne Water also monitors  High Potential Incident Frequency Rate which has remained steady  since last year.  A further breakdown of our injury and incident data can be found in  our expanded safety results in Figure 12 and Tables 9 and 10.

The Minister for Water, as the Portfolio Minister, undertakes  recruitment for Board membership in accordance with the Victorian  Government Appointment and Remuneration Guidelines and  Diversity on Victorian Government Boards Guideline. All members,  except the Managing Director, are appointed for terms of up  to four years, which may be renewed if a director is eligible for  reappointment. A non-executive director’s remuneration is effected  through an Instrument of Remuneration issued by the Minister for  Water, in accordance with the Appointment and Remuneration  Guidelines issued by the Department of Premier and Cabinet.  In October 2023, there was a significant transition and change in  the Board composition of Melbourne Water. The Chair and three  directors retired on 30 September, each having served two terms  (one being a shorter second term). On 1 October, the appointment  of a new Chair and four new non-executive directors came into  effect, increasing the Board to ten board members (from nine).  New directors receive an induction tailored to the needs of Board  members. In line with the Board Charter, all new and continuing  directors have been granted indemnity through a ‘Deed of Access,  Indemnity and Insurance’ prior to accessing information and  completed a Primary Interest Form upon commencement. All non-executive directors on the Board are independent. They  are subject to duties and responsibilities regarding conflicts of  interest, including annual and ongoing disclosure requirements.  The Company Secretary maintains a Register of Interests for the  Corporation, and director entries are reviewed at each Board  meeting. Directors are invited to declare any conflicts of interest  (perceived or actual) at the start of each Board and Committee  meeting.  The Melbourne Water Board Charter is reviewed regularly by the  Board, reflects the obligations of the Water Act 1989 and the Public  Administration Act 2004, and sets out the duties, ethical standards,  expectations of individual directors, handling of declaring conflicts  of interest and Board governance. In line with the Board Charter, the Board evaluates its performance  and that of its Committees on an annual basis, in line with the  Public Administration Act 2004 requirements. In 2023, the Board  undertook an externally facilitated assessment and evaluation of its  performance that was considered by the Board in August 2023.  Melbourne Water works with officers of DEECA and DTF.  We provide statutory and other reports that cover Melbourne  Water’s performance against the objectives and performance  indicators stated in the Corporate Plan. The Board is supported by a corporate secretariat team, comprising  the Company Secretary and the Assistant Company Secretary.

As a provider of essential services, strict regulatory compliance and  strong risk management are critical to what we do. To meet these  requirements, we have systems and processes in place to support  us to monitor and report on our performance and to alert us early  when we are off track. Melbourne Water maintains an Enterprise  Risk Management Framework consistent with the International Risk  Management Standard (ISO 31000:2018) and the requirements of  the Victorian Government's Risk Management Framework. Melbourne Water's Enterprise Risk Management Framework  comprises several key elements, which, when combined, create  an environment for effectively managing risk and pursuing  opportunities. This framework includes: •	 an established Risk Management Policy and Risk Appetite  Statement •	 a governance structure with a ‘three lines of defence’  operating model •	 processes that ensure ongoing management of strategic and  operational risks •	 provision of ongoing assurance over our control environment •	 a compliance program to ensure we continue to meet all our  regulatory and legislative obligations •	 continued education about and development of risk capability  across the organisation and maintenance of a positive risk  culture. Melbourne Water maintains and tests our Emergency Management  Framework, which outlines controls with respect to the preparation  for, response to and recovery from internal and external  emergencies. The framework aligns to the Australasian Inter- service Incident Management System 2017 (AIIMS) and includes  contingency, business continuity, emergency response and disaster  recovery planning. Last year, Melbourne Water participated in a range of interagency  emergency management exercises aimed at testing and improving  the plans and arrangements in place for response to emergency  events. These included: •	 a desktop cyber response exercise in conjunction with the  metropolitan water retailers to further test and enhance  existing response arrangements for cyber intrusion and  ransomware attempts •	 operational exercises testing contingency and emergency  response plans for risks at key sites, such as evacuation  of water treatment plants, response to chlorine leaks and  bushfire response. Climate risks pose a significant impact on how we deliver and  manage our services.

This is informed by a range of drivers in our strategic environment,  including:  •	 emphasising business efficiency to deliver on the commitment  made in the 2021 Price Submission, aimed at keeping  customer bills low. Additionally, this focus on efficiency will  serve as the foundation for our approach and preparation for  the upcoming 2026 Price Submission •	 ensuring ongoing financial sustainability in the face of  potential business risks (climate, environmental and  population), together with navigating the changing economic  landscape with increased inflation and interest rates •	 enhancing transparency regarding the cost to serve,  particularly considering the increase in infrastructure  investment required in the future •	 continuing and increasing efforts to enhance financial  capability and commercial acumen across the business. This is  crucial to ensure commercially prudent investments are made,  while maximising value from our contractual arrangements •	 meeting Melbourne Water’s carbon emission reduction  obligations from 2025 and achieving net zero carbon  commitments from 2030 •	 building capacity to identify and develop opportunities for  unregulated revenue •	 ensuring robust financial performance to maximise  shareholder value and make a positive contribution to the  Victorian Government. Focus areas for our Financial Strength Plan over 2023-24 included:    •	 implementing the key outcomes identified in the Capital  Investment Framework Review •	 responding to the Victorian Government on shareholder  dividend and financial requirements     •	 developing and implementing a framework for alternative  revenue generation •	 implementing the outcomes of our procurement operating  model review. Our financial performance in 2023-24 continues to be robust. We  have recorded a positive net profit after tax result of $149.7 million  ($119.1 million in 2022-23).  Total revenues for the financial year were $2,040.3 million  ($1,919.4 million in 2023-24). Our net revenue for bulk water and  sewage treatment is higher than the previous year due to increased  demand and an increase in average charges in line with the price  determination. Our revenue from waterways and drainage charges  is higher due to the growth in customer numbers and an increase  in average charges in line with the price determination that reflects  our customers’ expectation of healthier waterways.   Total expenses (excluding tax) for the financial year were $1,785.5  million ($1,715.8 million in 2023-24). Our total expenses are  higher than the previous year mainly due to increased depreciation  on a growing asset base, increased operational expenses,  employee benefit expenses, repairs and maintenance, finance and  government rates and taxes expenses.  We remain focused on delivering financial efficiencies in our  expenditure. This will ensure we deliver valued services at the  lowest possible cost and a commercial return for our shareholders  to support the Victorian State Budget outcomes.  During 2023-24, Melbourne Water made cash payments to the  Victorian Government of $242.9 million ($159.4 million paid  in 2023-24). The increase from the previous year was due to an  additional capital repatriation payment deferred from 2022-23  and additional dividends requested by the Treasurer of Victoria,  including a new efficiency dividend of $25.4 million.

FINANCIAL REPORT For the year ended 30 June 2024  ===== PAGE 95 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   93 About this Report This Annual Financial Report presents the audited general purpose  financial statements of Melbourne Water Corporation ('the  Corporation' or 'Melbourne Water') for the year ended 30 June 2024.  This report informs users about the Corporation's stewardship of the  resources entrusted to it. A description of the nature of the Corporation's operations and  principal activities is included in the report of operations which does  not form part of these financial statements. The Corporation is classified as a for-profit entity for the purposes of  reporting. Accounting policies selected and applied ensure that the resulting  financial information satisfies the concepts of relevance and  reliability, thereby ensuring that the substance of the underlying  transactions or other events is reported. The accrual basis of accounting has been applied, where assets,  liabilities, equity, income and expenses are recognised in the  reporting period to which they relate, regardless of when cash is  received or paid. Functional and presentation currency These financial statements are in Australian dollars, the functional  and presentation currency of the Corporation, and the historical  cost convention is used except for the revaluation of certain classes  of infrastructure, property, plant and equipment and financial  instruments. Rounding Unless otherwise stated, amounts in the report have been rounded  to the nearest thousand dollars. Classification between current and non-current In the determination of whether an asset or liability is current  or non-current, consideration has been given to the time when  each asset or liability is expected to be realised or paid. The asset  or liability has been classified as current if it is expected to be  exhausted over the next 12 months.  Historical cost convention These financial statements have been prepared under the historical  cost convention, except for the revaluation of financial assets, all  classes of infrastructure, property, plant and equipment. Comparative information In these financial statements the Corporation has changed the  classification or presentation of certain disclosures (and relevant  comparative information) to improve readability by the user.  This change in the presentation has not arisen as a result of the  identification of errors or changes in accounting policies by the  Corporation. Accounting estimates Judgements and estimates require assumptions to be made about  highly uncertain external factors such as discount rates, probability  factors, the effects of inflation, changing technology, political and  social trends and climate change. There are many uncertainties in  the estimation process and assumptions that are valid at the time  of estimation but may change significantly when new information  becomes available.  Judgements, estimates and assumptions are required to be made  about financial information presented. The significant judgements  made in the preparation of these financial statements are disclosed  in the notes where amounts affected by those judgements are  disclosed. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on  professional judgements derived from historical experience and  various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the  circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in  which the estimate is revised and also in future periods that are  affected by the revision.

Having regard to this AASB/AuASB guidance, the potential impacts  of climate related risks on the financial statements have been  considered within the following notes: •	 Note 3.1 Operational expenses; •	 Note 3.11 Provisions; •	 Note 4.1.2 Fair value determination of non-financial physical  assets;  •	 Note 4.1.2.2 Description of significant unobservable inputs to  level 3 valuations; •	 Note 4.1.3 Depreciation, amortisation and impairment;  •	 Note 5.1 Financing our operations;  •	 Note 6.1.5 Climate related risk; and •	 Note 6.3 Contingent liabilities. In October 2023, the AASB released Exposure Draft (ED) SR1  Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards – Disclosure of Climate- related Financial Information. It is not yet confirmed when/if this ED  will become mandatory for the Corporation as a public entity. In the  interim, broader climate and sustainability reporting considerations  have been informed by the draft ISSB climate reporting standards,  and the structure of the operating sections of the annual report by  the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial  Disclosures (TCFD). Going Concern These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern  basis and do not include any adjustments to the carrying amounts  and classification of assets, liabilities and reported expenses that  may otherwise be required if the going concern basis was not  appropriate. Compliance These general purpose financial statements have been prepared  in accordance with the Financial Management Act 1994 and  applicable Australian Accounting Standards (AAS) which include  Interpretations, issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board  (AASB). They have also been prepared in compliance with applicable  Financial Reporting Directions and Standing Directions issued by the  Assistant Treasurer. FINANCIAL REPORT  ===== PAGE 97 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   95 Accounting Policies The Corporation has adopted the following accounting policy  changes in the current period. The Corporation has classified borrowings which mature within 12  months as non current liabilities (previously classified as current).  The Corporation has changed its interpretation of ''right to defer  settlement''. The Corporation has discretion to, and will refinance  or roll over these loans with TCV pursuant to section 8 of the  Borrowings and Investment Powers Act 1987. Short term borrowings  are classified as current borrowings at floating interest rate.  These amendments have been applied retrospectively with  comparatives restated. Refer to Note 7.9 for details and illustrative  tables disclosing financial impacts of above changes. The Corporation has adopted the following accounting standard  amendments in the current period. 	– Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to Australian  Accounting Standards AASB101 – Disclosure of Accounting Policies  and Definition of Accounting Estimates) from 1 July 2023. The  amendments require the disclosure of ‘material’, rather than  ‘significant’, accounting policies. 	– Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a  Single Transaction (Amendments to AASB 112) from 1 July 2023.  The amendments narrow the scope of the initial recognition  exemption to exclude transactions that give rise to equal and  offsetting temporary differences. These amendments have been applied retrospectively with  comparatives restated. Refer to Note 7.9 for details. FINANCIAL REPORT  ===== PAGE 98 ===== 96   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report Funding Delivery of Our Services	 Introduction	 This section provides additional information about how the Corporation is funded and the accounting policies that are relevant for an  understanding of the items recognised in the financial statements. Revenue is recognised in accordance with AASB 15 Revenue from  contracts with customers. Accordingly, the term 'performance  obligation' used in the financial statements has the meaning set out  in AASB 15 Revenue from contracts with customers.  The Corporation collects bulk water and sewerage services  revenue for providing storage operator services and bulk water  and sewerage services to retail metropolitan and regional water  businesses. Bulk water and sewerage services revenues consist of a variable  metered component (based on volume of usage) and a fixed fee  (for service availability). The usage charge is invoiced weekly with  payment required within 7 days. The availability charge is invoiced in  advance monthly with payment required within 14 days. Bulk water and sewerage services revenue is recognised in line with  the Corporation meeting its performance obligations over time as  the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the services  provided. An estimate is made at the end of the accounting period  for unbilled revenue (refer to receivables Note 2.2). The Corporation provides waterways and drainage services to  residential, non-residential, rural and special area customers.   The charges are recognised in the year for which the charge is  levied and are billed either quarterly or annually in advance and  are collected by various retail water businesses on behalf of the  Corporation. A lien is held over each property to ensure that any  outstanding amounts are recovered upon sale of the property.  Waterways and drainage service charges revenue is recognised in  line with the Corporation meeting its performance obligations over  time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the  services provided. An estimate is made at the end of the accounting  period for unbilled revenue (refer to receivables Note 2.2). 2.1 Revenue from contracts with customers                     ($ thousands) 2024 2023 Bulk water services 958,285  906,295  Bulk sewerage services 494,055  447,056  Waterways and drainage service charges 298,645  279,657  Developer contributions 231,433  230,003  Developer contributed assets 15,512  10,241  Net gain on disposal of property, plant, equipment and intangibles 14,715  20,042  Other revenue 13,719  15,166  Total Revenue from contracts with customers 2,026,364  1,908,460  Developer contributions are collected from developers in order to  fund drainage scheme infrastructure (constructed catchment assets)  and stormwater quality treatment works in accordance with the  Corporation's responsibility for regional drainage, flood plain and  waterway management across greater Melbourne under the Water  Act 1989 and the Planning and Environment Act 1987.  The Corporation has a performance obligation in relation to  developer contributions, which is to assess whether the  relevant  conditions specified by the Corporation in a planning permit or  offer of drainage conditions have been met by the developer and  to provide consent to the local council to support issuance of a  Statement of Compliance (SOC).  The Corporation recognises developer contribution revenue at a  point in time as the performance obligation is satisfied (i.e. upon  provision of consent to the local council). The transaction price  is the total amount of cash contributions from the developer for  the applicable contract, unless the transaction price is adjusted  by differences between the assessed fair value of the constructed  catchment assets and reimbursements to the developer for  construction of those assets (see developer contributed assets policy  below). Developer contributions received in advance of the performance  obligation being satisfied are recorded as contract liabilities  from contracts with customers (included in Note 3.10) and then  recognised as revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied for  each contract.  A significant financing component is deemed to exist within a  contract when developer contributions revenue is received greater  than 12 months before the performance obligation is satisfied.  The Corporation assesses the balance of unearned revenue from  developer contributions at balance date. If a significant financing  component exists then the Corporation adjusts the revenue  transaction price (within unearned revenue) and recognises an  interest expense (see Note 5.1) to reflect the time value of money  using prevailing interest rates. When the performance obligation is  satisfied the revenue is recognised based on the adjusted transaction  price. FINANCIAL REPORT  ===== PAGE 99 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   97 FINANCIAL REPORT Developer contributed assets (DCA) consist of developer  constructed catchment assets transferred to the Corporation to  maintain in perpetuity. Under a drainage scheme, developers may be  required by the Corporation to undertake capital works in relation to  the construction of drainage infrastructure required for their stage  of development and other developers in the drainage catchment.  This will be included in contracts between the Corporation and  the developer as a condition of the Corporation's consent. Upon  completion of the works, these constructed catchment assets  become the property of the Corporation. The developer will either  be reimbursed by the Corporation for the construction costs  at an agreed reimbursable amount (funded through developer  contributions for that catchment) or the developer will fully fund the  construction costs (in arrangements where there are no developer  contributions).  The Corporation has a performance obligation in relation to DCAs,  which is to assess whether relevant conditions specified by the  Corporation in a planning permit or offer of drainage conditions  (including construction of catchment assets) have been met for  the Corporation to provide consent to the local council to support  issuance of a Statement of Compliance (SOC). The transaction price for DCA revenue is determined based on  any difference between the assessed fair value of the constructed  catchment assets and the reimbursements made to the developer  (where reimbursements are applicable depending on the  arrangement). The transaction price is uncertain until the date  of practical completion of the assets, which usually occurs after  the performance obligation is met. Therefore at the time the  performance obligation is met any revenue associated with the  constructed catchment assets to be received is considered to be  variable consideration.  DCA revenue (and associated infrastructure assets) are therefore  recognised at the date of practical completion of the works (and  their acceptance by the Corporation) when the uncertainty regarding  the fair value of the assets is resolved.  Land parcels are also voluntarily transferred from developers to the  Corporation (for nil consideration).  These transfers relate to land  set aside by developers as reserves at the point of subdivision. The  transfers are made voluntarily on the basis of the Corporation being  the relevant authority to hold and maintain such land for public  benefit, rather than being transferred in the context of a contract  with a customer. There is no exchange of goods or services from the  Corporation to the developers for this land and contracts between  the Corporation and the developers do not include these transfers of  land. Accordingly, the transfer of land is not considered to form part  of the transaction price for revenue recognition. As the transferred  land satisfies the definition of property, plant and equipment under  AASB 116, the initial measurement and subsequent measurement of  such land is within the scope of AASB 116 i.e. the land is recognised  initially at cost (being nil) and subsequently revalued in accordance  with the land class of assets.  The net gain on disposal of property, plant, equipment and  intangibles from sales is recognised as revenue when control  over the asset has been transferred to the customer at a point in  time.  This is the point when the Corporation has performed its  performance obligation. Revenue is measured at the transaction price agreed under the  contract. For property sales the consideration is due when it settles.  Property sales are recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss and  Other Comprehensive Income on a net basis of sale proceeds less  costs. Other revenue includes fees and charges and other miscellaneous  revenue which are all recognised at a point in time when the  Corporation meets the required performance obligations under the  contract.  ===== PAGE 100 ===== 98   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report Trade debtors, contract assets and other receivables are  recognised at the amounts receivable less any allowance for  expected credit losses. Trade debtors relate to amounts receivable  for bulk water services, bulk sewerage services and waterways  drainage charges and other charges. Contract assets relate  to developer works that have met the perfomance obligation  requirements but no contribution has yet been received. Other  receivables relate to land deposits, accrued revenue and accrued GST  receivable. Receivables are reviewed on an ongoing basis to identify  any receivables which cannot be collected. Debts which cannot be  collected are written-off when identified.  The Corporation applies the AASB 9 simplified approach to  measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss  allowance for contractual receivables. On this basis, an assessment  undertaken by management has identified that historical debt write- offs and future expected losses are immaterial. As such, there is no  allowance for expected credit losses as at 30 June 2024 (2022-23:  nil).  2.2 Receivables             ($ thousands) Contractual receivables 2024 2023 Trade debtors 53,641  48,439  Contract assets 10,764  10,764  Other receivables 59,819  50,587  Less: allowance for expected credit losses   -    -  Total contractual receivables 124,224  109,790  Statutory receivables Net GST receivable from the ATO 15,446  16,788  Total current receivables  139,670   126,578   ($ thousands) Current Past due but not impaired Total 30 June 2024 0-30 days 31-60 days 61-90 days 91 days + Receivables       Trade debtors (a) 24,642  8,177  1,961  18,861  53,641  Contract assets 10,764    -    -    -  10,764  Other receivables 59,819    -    -    -  59,819  Total contractual receivables 95,225  8,177  1,961  18,861  124,224  Current Past due but not impaired(b) Total 30 June 2023 0-30 days 31-60 days 61-90 days 91 days + Receivables Trade debtors (a) 27,992  5,076  1,038  14,333  48,439  Contract assets 10,764    -    -    -  10,764  Other receivables 50,587    -    -    -  50,587  Total contractual receivables 89,343  5,076  1,038  14,333  109,790  (a) The majority of the aged receivables relate to waterways and drainage service charges guaranteed by a lien on a property to ensure that any outstanding amounts are  recovered upon sale of the property. These matters would be subject to the Corporation's hardship provisions. Ageing analysis of contractual receivables Net Goods and Services Tax (GST) receivable from the  Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is the gross amount of GST  recoverable from the taxation authority and is included as part of  the receivables balance. AASB Interpretation 1031 provides that  revenue, expenses and assets must be recognised, net of the amount  of GST, except where GST relating to the expenditure items is not  recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the item is  recognised as GST inclusive.

Employee benefits expenses include all expenses related to  employment including; salary and wages expenses, defined  contribution plans, annual, long service and shift leave expenses,  defined benefit superannuation plan expense, and other employee  expenses (i.e payroll tax, Work Cover (post-1985), workers'  compensation (pre-1985), rostered days off, redundancy payments).  They are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Directly  attributable costs for bringing an asset to the location and condition  necessary for operation, such as costs of employee benefits arising  directly from the construction or acquistion of the asset are  capitalised via a reduction to the employee benefit expense. Provision is made for benefits accruing to employees in respect of  salaries and wages, annual leave and long service leave (LSL) up to  the reporting date and recorded as an expense during the period the  services are delivered. FINANCIAL REPORT  ===== PAGE 103 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   101 Liabilities for salaries, wages and annual leave are all recognised in  the provision for employee benefits as ‘current liabilities’ as per AASB  119 Employee Benefits, because the Corporation does not have an  unconditional right to defer settlements of these liabilities. Liabilities  for salaries, wages  and annual leave are measured at: •	 undiscounted value; if they will be wholly settled within 12  months; or •	 present value; if not expected to be wholly settled within 12  months. Sick leave payments are made in accordance with relevant awards,  determinations and Corporation policy. No provision is made in the  Financial Statements for unused sick leave entitlements as these are  non-vesting benefits (i.e. can't be transferred or paid out when an  employee leaves). LSL is recognised in the provision for employee benefits. LSL is recognised as a current liability when there is no unconditional  right to defer settlement should an employee take LSL they are  entitled to within the next 12 months, even when the Corporation  does not expect to settle the liability within 12 months. The  components of this current LSL liability are measured at: •	 undiscounted value; if they expect to be wholly settled within  12 months; or •	 present value; if not expected to be wholly settled within 12  months.

This non- current LSL liability is measured at present value.  Expected future  cash payments are discounted using market yields attached to the  Reserve Bank of Australia's 10 year rate for semi-annual coupon  bonds. Discount rate as at 30 June 2024 was 4.35% (2022-23:  4.06%). Use of this discount rate is mandated by the Department of  Treasury and Finance (DTF). The valuation of LSL also incorporates  wage inflation, based on DTF budget estimates with the rate at 30  June 2024 of 4.45% (2022-23: 4.35%). The current and non-current Work Cover and workers'  compensation provisions are based on independent actuarial  assessments. A provision of $15.1 million (2022-23: $14.7 million)  has been made for outstanding claims incurred and not settled, and  for claims incurred but not reported at 30 June 2024. The value of  the bank guarantee to the Victorian Work Cover Authority (as part  of the Corporation's Work Cover self insurance commitments) at  30 June 2024 is $13.4 million (2022-23: $13.4 million). The bank  guarantee amount is not included in the provision.

They include written down assets and Community Service Obligation (CSO) adjustments for  purchased land based on Valuer General Victoria  (VGV) valuation. They are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. 3.8 Income and deferred tax The Corporation is subject to the National Tax Equivalent Regime  (NTER), which is administered by the Australian Taxation Office  (ATO). The difference between the NTER and the Commonwealth  tax legislation is that the tax liability is paid to the Victorian State  Government rather than the Commonwealth Government. The income tax expense for the period is the tax payable on the  current period's taxable income based on the national corporate  income tax rate of 30%, adjusted for current tax of prior periods  and changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to  temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities  and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised as temporary  differences at the tax rate expected to apply when the assets are  recovered or liabilities settled, based on those tax rates which are  enacted or substantially enacted. The relevant tax rates are applied  to the cumulative amounts of deductible and taxable temporary  differences when they arise in a transaction that at the time of the  transaction did not affect either accounting or taxable profit or  loss. Deferred tax assets are recognised as deductible temporary  differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future  taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary  differences and losses. Current and deferred tax is recognised in  the Statement of Profit or Loss, except to the extent that it relates  to items recognised in Other Comprehensive Income or directly in  equity. In this case, tax is also recognised in Other Comprehensive  Income or directly in equity respectively. 3.7 Other expenses             ($ thousands) 2024 2023 Assets written off/written down 1,386   1,779  CSO adjustments for purchased land 4,813   13,939  Allowance for expected credit loss   -   -  Other expenses 2,310   2,099  Total other expenses  8,509   17,817  FINANCIAL REPORT  ===== PAGE 106 ===== 104   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report Reconciliation of income tax to prima facie tax payable	                               ($ thousands) 2024 2023 Profit before income tax 254,806   203,569  Tax at the Australian tax rate of 30% (2022-23: 30%) 76,442  61,071  Tax effect of amounts which are not deductible/(taxable) in calculating taxable income:    Non assessable and non deductible for income tax purposes 22,915   17,827     Assessable income not booked 5,740   5,602  Income tax as reported in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income 105,097  84,500  Income tax liability                                ($ thousands) 2024 2023 Current tax liability 45,142  14,413  Total income tax liability 45,142  14,413  Income tax recognised in other comprehensive income	                                ($ thousands) 2024 2023 Deferred tax arising on items recognised in other comprehensive income Increase in deferred tax on land & buildings revalued   -  599  Reversal of deferred tax on disposal of land previously revalued (11) (7) Actuarial gains on the defined benefit plan 411   579  Net gain in fair value of cash flow hedges (11)  11  Total income tax recognised in other comprehensive income 389   1,182  3.8.1 Income tax Components of tax expense                               ($ thousands) 2024 2023 Current tax 139,593  121,169  Deferred tax relating to temporary differences (34,496) (36,669) Adjustments for current tax of prior periods   -   -  Total tax expense 105,097  84,500  FINANCIAL REPORT  ===== PAGE 107 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   105 Movements                                ($ thousands) 2024 2023 Opening balance  1,259,596   1,280,138  Credited to Profit or Loss  (34,496)  (36,669) Debited to Other Comprehensive Income  389   1,182  Adjustment in respect of deferred tax of prior period  32,102   14,945  Closing balance  1,257,591   1,259,596  Net deferred tax liabilities to be recovered after more than 12 months  1,294,355   1,296,971  Net deferred tax liabilities to be recovered within 12 months  (36,764)  (37,375) Total non-current liabilities - deferred tax liabilities  1,257,591   1,259,596  3.8.2 Net deferred tax liabilities – non-current                               ($ thousands) 2024 2023 Amounts recognised in Profit or Loss Property, plant and equipment  139,141   136,005  Employee entitlements  (12,561)  (12,704) Developer contributions  -   13  Provisions  (3,735)  (5,533) Revenue in advance  (28,221)  (28,681) VDP service concession liability  74,458   82,122  Leases under AASB 16 (a)  (1,362)  (1,430) Other (a)  (6,563)  (6,241) Total recognised in Profit or Loss  161,157   163,551  Amounts recognised in Other Comprehensive Income Net gains on revaluation of land and buildings  146,893   146,904  Net gains on revaluation of infrastructure assets  934,758   934,758  Actuarial gain on the defined benefit plan  14,783   14,372  Changes in fair value of cash flow hedges  -   11  Total recognised in Other Comprehensive Income  1,096,434   1,096,045  Net deferred tax liability  1,257,591   1,259,596  (a) In 2022-23 $1.4 million of other expenses have been re-classified to leases under AASB16 for consistency with the current year as a result of adopting AASB 112 Deferred Tax related to  Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction accounting standard amendment.

FINANCIAL REPORT  ===== PAGE 108 ===== 106   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report Trade creditors represent liabilities for goods or services provided to  the Corporation prior to the end of the financial year, where invoices  have been received and processed but not yet paid. The amounts are  unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition or in  accordance with contract terms. Payments for invoices with a contract  value of less than $3.0 million are paid within 10 business days in line  with the Victorian Government's Fair Payment Policy.  Interest payable is recognised as an expense in the reporting period  in which it is payable and accrued in accordance with the terms and  conditions of the underlying financial instruments or other contracts. 3.9 Payables                               ($ thousands) 2024 2023 Current Trade creditors 183,603   135,475  Interest payable 35,695   32,076  Accruals 329,867   299,709  Other payables 5,052   4,559  Total payables  554,217   471,819  Accruals represent liabilities for goods or services provided to the  Corporation prior to the end of the financial year, where invoices  have not yet been received or processed and are not yet paid. The  amounts are based on estimates, are unsecured and are usually paid  within 30 days of recognition (payments for invoices with a contract  value of less than $3.0 million are paid within ten business days in  line with the Victorian Government's Fair Payment Policy). Other payables primarily represent liabilities for miscellaneous  security deposits held. Contract liabilities - developer contributions represents  consideration received in advance of the Corporation performing its  contract obligations and will be recognised as revenue when the services  are performed. Refer to Note 2.1. Other unearned revenue represents revenue received in advance in  relation to other income or assets (i.e. grants) and will be recognised as  revenue (or offset against the asset for grants relating to assets) when  the services are performed and conditions are met. 3.10 Contract liabilities                               ($ thousands) 2024 2023 Current Developer contributions 77,716   82,150  Other unearned revenue 19,345   17,108  Total current contract liabilities  97,061  99,258  Non-Current Other unearned revenue 11,992   10,656  Total non-current contract liabilities  11,992   10,656  Total contract liabilities  109,053   109,914  Developer contributions                               ($ thousands) 2024 2023 Unearned revenue at the beginning of the financial year 82,150  92,854  Consideration received in the year before performance obligations are satisfied 227,000  219,605  Performance obligations satisfied during the period and recognised as revenue (231,434) (230,309) Closing balance  77,716  82,150  FINANCIAL REPORT  ===== PAGE 109 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   107 3.11 Provisions                                                  ($ thousands) 2024 2023 Current Insurance claims 639   464  Other provisions 7,644   13,693  Total current provisions  8,283   14,157  Non-current Insurance claims 410   332  Total non-current provisions  410   332  Total provisions  8,693  14,489  Reconciliation of movement in provisions ($ thousands) Insurance claims Other provisions Total Carrying amount at 1 July 2023  796   13,693   14,489  Provisions recognised/(de-recognised)  340   (443)  (103) Amounts utilised during the year  (87)  (5,606)  (5,693) Carrying amount at 30 June 2024 1,049  7,644  8,693  Carrying amount at 1 July 2022  425   9,028   9,453  Provisions recognised/(de-recognised)  535   5,015   5,550  Amounts utilised during the year  (164)  (350)  (514) Carrying amount at 30 June 2023 796  13,693  14,489  Provisions are recognised when the Corporation has a present legal  or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable  that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation  and the amount has been reliably estimated.  The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the  consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of  the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties  surrounding the obligation.  The recognition of provisions requires significant estimates and  assumptions such as requirements of the relevant legal and  regulatory frameworks, timing, cost estimation, legal disputes and  consideration of climate related risks or obligations (i.e. carbon  offsets surrender obligation or impacts of acute weather events).  These uncertainties may result in future actual expenditure differing  from the amounts currently provided. Provisions are periodically  reviewed and updated based on the facts and circumstances  available at the time. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to  settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value  of those cash flows. When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a  provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the  receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that  recovery will be received and the amount of the receivable can be  measured reliably. The insurance claims provision represents the amounts that  are likely to be payable under claims but excluding amounts over  the relevant insurance policy deductable. Insurance claims are  independently assessed by loss adjusters, claims managers and  legal practitioners. The insurance claims provision includes claims  reported but not yet paid, claims incurred but not yet reported, and  the anticipated costs of settling those claims. Due to the inherent  uncertainty in the estimate of the outstanding insurance claims,  a risk margin is included. The risk margin is set to ensure that the  liability estimate will be sufficient to cover outstanding claims. The  measurement of the liability for outstanding insurance claims is  on the basis of estimated costs of future claims payments. Claims  classified as current are expected to be settled within 12 months.  The amount classified as non-current is expected to be settled  later than 12 months. The provision amounts are based on an  independent assessment of claim costs. Other provisions satisfy the recognition requirements of AASB 137  Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and include  contractual, remediation and other provisions.

FINANCIAL REPORT  ===== PAGE 112 ===== 110   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report If land, buildings, infrastructure and service concession assets were measured at historical cost, the carrying amounts would be as follows:                                      ($ thousands) 2024 2023 Land 931,437  917,650  Buildings 35,140  36,661  Infrastructure assets - owned 7,289,661  7,087,555  VDP service concession asset 3,761,687  3,839,239  Total  12,017,925  11,881,105  Initial recognition	 	 	 	 All non-financial physical assets (except for service concession  assets) are measured and recognised initially at cost. Service  concession assets are recognised initially at current replacement  cost in accordance with the cost approach to fair value in AASB  13 (Fair Value). Where an asset is acquired for no or nominal cost,  the cost is its fair value at the date of acquisition. The cost of  constructed non-financial physical assets includes the cost of all  materials used in construction and direct labour on the project. The  cost of leasehold improvements is capitalised when incurred.  Items with a cost or value in excess of $500 (2022-23: $500) and  a useful life of more than 1 year are recognised as assets, with the  exception of lifecycle costs (total of all recurring and one-time costs  over the full life span of a good, service, structure or system) for the  VDP which are expensed. All items with a cost or value less than  $500 (2022-23: $500) are expensed.  Subsequent measurement	 	 	 All non-financial physical assets, with the exception of capital  works in progress, are subsequently measured at fair value less  accumulated depreciation and impairment. Non-financial physical  assets are measured at fair value with regard to the asset’s highest  and best use after due consideration is made for any legal or  physical restrictions imposed on the asset, public announcements  or commitments made in relation to the intended use of the asset.  Theoretical opportunities that may be available in relation to the  asset are not taken into account until it is virtually certain that  the restrictions will no longer apply. Therefore, unless otherwise  disclosed, the current use of these non-financial physical assets will  be their highest and best use. Revaluation of infrastructure, property, plant and equipment,  and VDP service concession asset Revaluations are conducted either independently every 5 years  (as required under Financial Reporting Direction (FRD) 103  Non-Financial Physical Assets) or in the intervening years using  management expertise and classified as a managerial revaluation.  The Corporation uses land indices (provided by the Valuer General  Victoria VGV) to perform managerial valuations on land and  buildings. Fair value assessment is performed annually for all other  property plant and equipment as a managerial valuation, utilising  external experts to conduct the infrastructure and service concession  asset valuation annually. Managerial valuation movements are  booked if material in accordance with FRD 103. Any accumulated  depreciation at the date of revaluation is eliminated against the  gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to  the revalued amount of the asset.  Any revaluation increase is recognised in other comprehensive  income, except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease  for the same asset (or asset class when specifically related to  infrastructure and service concession arrangements) previously  recognised in net profit in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other  Comprehensive Income, in which case the increase is credited to  profit to the extent of the decrease previously expensed. A decrease  in the carrying amount arising on the revaluation is recognised in net  profit in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive  Income to the extent that it exceeds the balance, if any, held in the  asset revaluation reserve relating to a previous revaluation of that  asset, otherwise decreases are recognised in other comprehensive  income. The net effect of any revaluation adjustments to Profit and  Loss is classified as a net gain or loss on revaluation of non-financial  assets. Refer to Note 4.1.2 Fair Value Determination for further information  on the revaluation methods used for the asset classes and the  valuation outcomes for 30 June 2024.

These delayed transfers also have associated backlog increased depreciation expenditure recognised in  2023-24 ($11.4 million) that has not been adjusted against the prior year as deemed not material. FINANCIAL REPORT  ===== PAGE 114 ===== 112   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets held for sale are treated as current and classified  as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a  sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when: •	 the asset is available for immediate use in the current  condition; and •	 the sale is highly probable and the asset’s sale is expected to be  completed within 12 months from the date of classification. These non-current assets are measured at the lower of carrying  amount and fair value less costs to sell, and are not subject to  depreciation or amortisation. Non-specialised land (other than held for sale) and buildings Non-specialised land (other than held for sale) and buildings are  valued using the market/direct comparison approach with key inputs  used being sales evidence and unit of value by comparative basis. To  the extent that non-specialised land and buildings do not contain  significant, unobservable adjustments, the assets are classified as  Level 2 under the market approach. Refer to disclosures below under  specialised land and buildings for current year valuation results for  total land and buildings. Specialised land The market approach is used for specialised land adjusted for the  Community Service Obligation (CSO) to reflect the specialised  nature of the land being valued. A CSO adjustment is a reflection  of the valuer’s assessment of the impact of restrictions associated  with an asset to the extent that it is also equally applicable to  market participants. This approach is in light of the highest and best  use consideration required for fair value measurement, and takes  into account the use of the asset that is physically possible, legally  permissible, and financially feasible. As adjustments of CSO are  considered as significant unobservable inputs, specialised land is  classified as Level 3 assets.  2020-21 was the last formal valuation year under FRD 103. The  valuation methodology to assess each property’s land fair value  in 2020-21 involved an assessment of the unrestricted land value  based on the existing or assumed underlying zoning, taking account  of the individual property attributes. Then an assessment of the  restrictions on the land due to being held by the public sector was  made to consider if a CSO was warranted. The level of the CSO will  depend on the perceived level of restriction and the risk associated  with the removal of the restrictions, if at all possible. The property  attributes considered in assessing the unrestricted value include, but  are not limited to zoning and overlay(s), underlying zoning, location,  land area, access, shape of the site, services available or connected  and the highest and best use of the land. 2023-24 was not a formal valuation year under FRD 103 as such an  interim managerial valuation was conducted using Valuer-General  Victoria (VGV) postcode indices (consistent with 2022-23). The  valuation resulted in no material change in value for specialised and  non-specialised land (2022-23: nil). Note: Total net land valuation decrements of $4.8 million (2022-23:  $13.9 million) at Note 4.1.1 are due to a reduction for CSO discounts  applied to land purchased during the year based on VGV valuation,  which is recorded in other expenses in the Income Statement. The market that the assets (land and buildings) are valued in is being  impacted by the uncertainty that rising interest rates and increased  construction costs has caused. The current market environment  creates significant valuation uncertainty. The value assessed at the  valuation date may therefore change over a relatively short time  period. Specialised buildings For the majority of the Corporation's specialised buildings,  the current replacement cost method is used adjusting for the  associated depreciation. As depreciation adjustments are considered  as significant, unobservable inputs in nature, specialised buildings  are classified as Level 3 fair value measurements. 2020-21 was the last formal valuation year under FRD 103. The  valuation methodology in 2020-21 to assess the fair value of  buildings was current replacement cost  (CRC) for specialised  buildings and a market approach for non-specialised buildings. The  CRC approach for specialised  buildings involved assessing the cost  of replacement of the assets to a 'modern equivalent' standard then  adjusting for an appropriate depreciation rate, on a useful life basis  after making adjustments for condition and general maintenance.  The market approach for non-specialised buildings (i.e. some of the  residential buildings) was a Market Based Direct Comparison method  whereby the subject properties are compared to recent comparable  improved sales making adjustment for points of difference to  establish the Fair Value. 2023-24 was not a formal valuation year under FRD103 and as  such an interim managerial valuation was conducted using Valuer- General Victoria (VGV) indices (consistent with 2022-23). For  2023-24 the managerial valuation resulted in no material change in  asset values for specialised and non-specialised buildings (2022-23:  $3.6 million).  Leasehold improvements For Leasehold improvements, fair value is determined using the  current replacement cost method. As depreciation adjustments are  considered as significant, unobservable inputs in nature, leasehold  improvements are classified as Level 3 fair value measurements.  2020-21 was the last formal valuation year under FRD 103. For  leasehold improvements fair value is assessed through a managerial  valuation. For 2023-24 the managerial valuation resulted in no  material change in asset values for leasehold improvements (2022- 23: nil).    FINANCIAL REPORT  ===== PAGE 115 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   113 Plant and equipment Plant and equipment is specialised in use, such that it is rarely  sold; fair value is determined using the current replacement cost  method. As depreciation adjustments are considered as significant,  unobservable inputs in nature, plant and equipment are classified as  Level 3 fair value measurements. 2020-21 was the last formal valuation year under FRD 103. For plant  and equipment fair value is assessed through a managerial valuation.  For 2023-24 the managerial valuation resulted in no material  change in asset values for plant and equipment  (2022-23: nil).   Fleet vehicles Fleet vehicles are valued using appropriate market or other fair  value indicators as determined by management. The Corporation  acquires new vehicles and at times disposes of them before the end  of their economic life. The process of acquisition, use and disposal  in the market is managed by experienced fleet managers who set  relevant depreciation rates during use to reflect the utilisation of the  vehicles. As depreciation adjustments are considered as significant,  unobservable inputs in nature, fleet vehicles are classified as Level 3  fair value measurements. 2020-21 was the last formal valuation year under FRD 103. For fleet  vehicles fair value is assessed through a managerial valuation. For  2023-24 the managerial valuation resulted in no material change in  asset values for fleet vehicles (2022-23: nil). Infrastructure The fair value of Infrastructure was assessed by an independent  valuer in 2023-24 (consistent with 2022-23). The income approach  was used for the fair value assessment by discounting reliable  estimates of the Corporation's future cash flows (projected  forecast and terminal value to their present value and arriving at  an enterprise value range). Non-infrastructure assets and liabilities  (including Service Concession Asset and Liability) are deducted from  the enterprise value range to obtain the residual infrastructure value.  For 2023-24 the independent valuer used the exit Regulated Asset  Base (RAB) multiple as the primary methodology for calculating  terminal value (2022-23: exit RAB multiple). This approach aligns  with current observed market participant practice. The exit RAB  multiple approach calculates terminal value based on forecast RAB  in the terminal year and an exit RAB multiple. Any tax amortisation  benefit (TAB) available to subsequent market participants has been  implicitly included through the selection of the terminal value exit  multiple.  A valuation cross check was performed to calculate the  terminal value using the previous Gordon growth methodology,  which confirmed that the terminal value is consistent with that  calculated under the exit RAB multiple approach  (sits within the  range of selected terminal enterprise value).  In order to assess reasonableness of the enterprise valuation, cross  checks  are performed by comparing the earnings before interest,  tax and depreciation/amortisation (EBITDA) and regulated asset  value multiples implied by the value determined under the income  approach against multiples implied by share prices at which  comparable organisations are trading and recent transactions in  comparable assets which have occurred. Such approaches are often  referred to as market approaches or relative value approaches.  Melbourne Water's policy is to use a midpoint valuation in assessing  the fair value.  For 2023-24 the valuation resulted in no material change in value  (2022-23: nil).  The significant assumptions used in determining fair value under the  income approach at 30 June 2024 are summarised below: •	 Nominal after tax discount rate in the range of 5.1 % to 5.5 %  (2022-23: 5.1% to 5.5%). The valuation was based on a mid  point of 5.3% (2022-23: 5.3%). This represents the rate that  market participants would expect to use in determining the  fair market value of the Corporation after taking into account  the market cost of debt and equity. The market that the assets  are valued in is being impacted by the uncertainty that rising  interest rates and increased construction costs have caused.  The valuer has advised that the current market environment  creates significant valuation uncertainty. The value assessed at  the valuation date may therefore change over a relatively short  time period. This uncertainty has been reflected in the discount  rate.  •	 Operating expenditure and revenue growth applied post initial  five year pricing period 3.0% (2022-23: 3.0%) •	 Forecast RAB in terminal value year $29,561 million (2022-23:  $27,269million) •	 Terminal value exit RAB multiple range of 1.05x to 1.15x. The  valuation was based on a mid point of 1.10x (2022-23: 1.05x to  1.15x and mid point of 1.10x) •	 A 10 year explicit cash flow projection period, with cash flows  beyond the projection period reflected in the terminal value  (2022-23: 10 years) •	 Assumptions used for cross checks: 	– Long term growth rate of 3.25% (2022-23: 3.25%) -  representing inflation and volume growth 	– A Normalised terminal capex used for steady state $750.0  million (2022-23: $800.0 million). •	 The infrastructure valuation considers anticipated climate  change related physical and transition risks through forecast  cash flows, growth and capital expenditure assumptions. Costs  associated with climate related physical and transition risks are  uncertain and could vary from estimates included in current  financial forecasts included in the valuation. •	 Table 4.1.2.3 highlights sensitivity of the infrastructure fair value  measurement to changes in significant unobservable inputs/ assumptions noted above. VDP service concession asset VDP service concession asset is valued using the current  replacement cost method under AASB 13 (Fair Value), as required by  AASB1059 and adjusted for the associated depreciation.  2020-21 was the last formal revaluation year under FRD 103. The  approach used by the independent valuer in 2020-21 to derive  fair value was the cost approach under AASB 1059. This involved  estimating the current cost to purchase or replace the assets  (replacement cost or RCN) using a combination of direct and  indirect methods with comparison to benchmarking analysis across  different Australian desalination plants. The direct method (used  FINANCIAL REPORT  ===== PAGE 116 ===== 114   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report for 45 per cent of the assets being the pipeline, building and civil  infrastructure and pumps) involved researching the current cost  to replace an asset with a new one of equivalent functionality.  The indirect method (used for the remaining 55 per cent of the  assets) involved applying Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)  equipment specific inflation factors to historical costs. RCN was then  depreciated using engineering lives to account for physical use and  deterioration to arrive at a current replacement cost (CRC).  For 2023-24 (and 2022-23) the fair value of the VDP service  concession asset was assessed by an independent valuer using the  indirect CRC approach as a desktop valuation. This involved using  the 2020-21 formal valuation as the base then applying ABS industry  specific inflation factors to derive RCN. RCN was then depreciated  using engineering lives to derive CRC. The valuation resulted in no  material change in asset values (2022-23: $689.9 million increase).  The VDP service concession asset is classified as level 3 fair value  measurement as it contains significant unobservable inputs and  adjustments. Significant assumptions used in determining fair value  include; costs per unit, engineering useful lives and industry specific  inflation indices. Table 4.1.2.3 highlights sensitivity of fair value  measurement to changes in these significant unobservable inputs/ assumptions. The valuation is based on prevailing market, economic and other  conditions as at the date of this report. Significant uncertainty  continues to exist. To the extent possible these conditions have  been reflected in the Valuation. However, any subsequent changes  in these conditions on the global economy and financial markets  generally, and the Corporation, could impact upon value in the  future, either positively or negatively. Financial reporting impacts of climate related matters (fair  value measurement) Climate change is a risk to the Corporation. Climate change risk  includes the physical risk which can cause direct damage to assets  or property as a result of changes in climate conditions as well as  transition risks which arise from the transition to a low-carbon  economy (i.e. policy changes, carbon tax, legal and reputational risks  and shifts in market and technology).  The Corporation's non-current assets are exposed to the risk of  damage from extreme weather events such as storms, high winds,  floods and drought. Changes in global climate conditions could  intensify one or more of these events. In addition, extreme weather  events may also increase the cost of operations. Physical risks  arising from fires, floods and drought are partially covered through  insurance and also the regulatory funding mechanism. Physical risks  from coastal inundation and erosion are also expected to be covered  through the regulatory funding mechanism. However, should the  frequency and severity of these events increase as a result of climate  change, the cost of such coverage and risk of unfunded costs may  increase.  Transition risks could impact the valuation of infrastructure assets  where the costs significantly exceed funding through the regulatory  pricing mechanism.  Refer to Note 4.1.2.2 for further details on the sensitivity of climate  related physical and transition risks as significant unobservable  inputs to the Infrastructure and VDP valuations.

We have considered the  example of a pre-tax  unrecoverable financial  loss (after insurance  recovery) of $13.5 million  - $27.0 million ($20.3  million mid-point) per  one-off climate change  event (based on actual  average costs of historical  bushfire and flood events  over an average five  year period).  We have  assumed a possible  frequency of one-off  climate change events  between every 3 to 7  years (5 years mid-point)  beyond the terminal year. Costs associated with  physical climate risks are  uncertain and could vary  from estimates included  in current financial  forecasts included in  the valuation. We have  considered the example  of a pre-tax unrecoverable  financial loss (after  insurance recovery) of  $12.5 million - $25.0  million ($18.8 million  mid-point) per one-off  climate change event  (based on actual average  costs of historical bushfire  and flood events over an  average five year period).   We have assumed a  possible frequency of one- off climate change events  between every 3 to 7  years (5 years mid-point)  beyond the terminal year. Occurrence of unrecoverable financial loss due to one off  climate change events every 5 years (beyond the terminal  year) at a cost of $20.3 million per event could reduce the  valuation by $77.2 million or 0.75% (2022-23: $18.8 million  per event could reduce the valuation by $71.5 million or  0.5%). Note:  this is indicative only and limited due to  uncertainty with estimation of the financial impact of  physical climate risks.   Transition risks  arising from  transition to  low-carbon  economy (i.e.  policy changes,  carbon tax, legal  and reputational  risks and shifts  in market and  technology).  Costs associated with  climate change transition  risks are uncertain  and could vary from  estimates included  in current financial  forecasts included in  the valuation. We have  considered the example  of price and volume risk  associated with purchase  and surrender of carbon  offsets (associated with  meeting our emmissions  reduction targets), that  could occur within a  regulatory cycle and  could be partially  unfunded.  We have  considered a range of  increase in volume and/or  price of 25-50% partially  unfunded within each  regulatory cycle.  Costs associated with  climate change transition  risks are uncertain  and could vary from  estimates included  in current financial  forecasts included in  the valuation.

Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight line  method to allocate their cost or revalued amounts, net of their  residual values, over their estimated useful lives, commencing from  the time the asset is held ready for use. The assets residual values  and useful lives are reviewed annually, and adjusted if appropriate,  at the end of each reporting period.  Depreciation does not cease when an asset becomes idle or is retired  from active use, unless the asset is fully depreciated. However, when  an asset is retired permanently, depreciation ceases and the asset is  derecognised. The depreciation charge for each period shall be recognised in profit  or loss unless it is included in the carrying amount of another asset.  Indefinite life assets Land, which is considered to have an indefinite life, is not depreciated. Depreciation is not recognised in respect of these assets because their  service potential has not, in any material sense, been consumed during the reporting period. Major depreciation and amortisation periods used are listed below: Buildings 5 to 150 years (2022-23: 5 to 150 years) Leasehold improvements 3 to 15 years (2022-23: 3 to 15 years) Plant and equipment 3 to 50 years (2022-23: 3 to 50 years) Infrastructure assets 2 to 245 years (2022-23: 2 to 245 years) Fleet vehicles 1 to 25 years (2022-23: 1 to 15 years) Intangible assets 2 to 25 years (2022-23: 2 to 25 years) VDP service concession asset 9 to 100 years (2022-23: 9 to 100 years) Right of use assets 3 to 8 years (2022-23: 3 to 8 years) Physical, economic and environmental factors are taken into  consideration in assessing the useful lives of the assets, including  but not limited to asset condition and obsolescence, technology  changes, capital planning and renewals, and climate-related risks.  VDP service concession assets are depreciated based on guaranteed  lives per the Project Deed arrangements, which incorporate the  impact of the ongoing Project Deed lifecycle cost payments  accounted for as expenditure. Guaranteed lives are used because  lifecycle costs cover repairs and maintenance and also asset  replacements with shorter lives than the Project Deed. Parts of VDP  that have a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of VDP  are depreciated separately. Land is not depreciated. Impacts resulting from changes in  depreciation rates have been incorporated in the current year's  results and have not been separately disclosed as the overall amount  was not material. FINANCIAL REPORT During the period, there were no material changes made to the useful lives of property, plant and equipment (2022-23: nil).  ===== PAGE 122 ===== 120   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report Impairment Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (and intangible assets  not yet available for use) are tested annually for impairment and  whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.  All other assets are assessed annually for indications of impairment,  except for: •	 Inventories •	 Non-current assets held for sale (refer to Note 4.1.2.1 and Note  4.3) If there is an indication of impairment, the assets concerned are  tested as to whether their carrying value exceeds their recoverable  amount. Where an asset’s carrying value exceeds its recoverable  amount, the difference is written off to the Statement of Profit  or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income, except to the extent  that the write down can be debited to an asset revaluation reserve  amount applicable to that asset. 4.2 Intangible assets                                                     ($ thousands) 2024 2023 Intangible assets (f) 185,468   188,211  Less: accumulated amortisation and impairment (153,949)  (148,669) Total intangible assets 31,519  39,542  Reconciliation of movements in intangible assets                    ($ thousands) Total RECs(c) IT(d) Carrying amount at 1 July 2023 (a)  39,542   3,728   35,814  Additions  7,785  7,785   -  Disposals  (7,885) (7,885)  -  Amortisation  (13,149)   -   (13,149) Transfers between classes (b)  -    -   -  Impairment (e)  -    -   -  Capital expenditure  5,225    -   5,225  Carrying amount at 30 June 2024 31,518  3,628  27,890  Carrying amount at 1 July 2022  49,087  2,932   46,155  Additions  13,390  13,390   -  Disposals  (12,667) (12,594)  (73) Amortisation  (17,227)   -   (17,227) Transfers between classes (b)  101    -   101  Impairment (e)  -    -   -  Capital expenditure (f)  6,858    -   6,858  Carrying amount at 30 June 2023 (a) 39,542  3,728  35,814  Note:  (a) 2022-23 Native Vegetation Offsets (NVO's) have been re-clasified from contingent assets ($11.2 million based on market value) to intangible assets (zero value based on  historical cost).

The recoverable value estimates used in the impairment of  assets analysis consider forecast cash flows, growth and terminal  capital expenditure assumptions. The recoverable value estimates  demonstrate that assets are not impaired. While scenario planning is  used to explore and help prepare for a wide range of potential future  conditions (including the impacts of climate change and changes  in macroeconomic conditions), there is a risk that the assumptions  made based on what is currently known may not reflect the actual  impact of emerging risks in the future.   It is deemed that, in the event of the loss or destruction of an asset,  the future economic benefits arising from the use of the asset will be  replaced unless a specific decision to the contrary has been made.  The recoverable amounts for most assets are measured at the higher  of the present value of future cash flows expected to be obtained  from the asset or fair value less costs to sell.  FINANCIAL REPORT  ===== PAGE 123 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   121 FINANCIAL REPORT Intangible assets consist primarily of information technology  software, RECs and NVO's. They represent identifiable non- monetary assets without physical substance. Intangible assets are  measured at cost less accumulated amortisation (RECs and NVO's  are not amortised) and impairment. Costs incurred subsequent to  initial acquisition are capitalised when it is expected that additional  future economic benefits will flow to the Corporation.  The Corporation amortises intangible assets with a limited useful  life using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives  (excluding RECs and NVO's). Amortisation begins when the asset  is available for use, that is, when it is in the location and condition  necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by  management. The useful life and amortisation method is reviewed  at the end of each annual reporting period. RECs and NVO's have an  indefinite life and are not amortised. An assessment is made at the end of each reporting period to  determine whether there are indicators that the intangible asset  concerned is impaired. If so, the assets concerned are tested as to  whether their carrying value exceeds their recoverable amount. Software costs Costs incurred for the development of software code that enhances  or modifies, or creates additional capability to, existing on-premise  systems and meets the definition of and recognition criteria for an  intangible asset are recognised as intangible software assets. Software as-a-Service (SaaS) arrangements are service contracts  providing the Corporation with the right to access the cloud  provider’s application software over the contract period. As such  the Corporation does not receive a software intangible asset at the  contract commencement date.  The following outlines the accounting treatment of costs incurred in  relation to SaaS arrangements: The Corporation made the following key judgements that may  have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in  the financial statements.  Determination whether configuration and customisation  services are distinct from the SaaS access Implementation costs including costs to configure or customise  the cloud provider's application software are recognised as  operating expenses when the services are received. Where the SaaS  arrangement supplier provides both configuration and customisation  services, judgement has been applied to determine whether each of  these services are distinct or not from the underlying use of the SaaS  application software. Distinct configuration and customisation costs  are expensed as incurred as the software is configured or customised  (i.e. upfront). Non-distinct configuration and customisation costs  are expensed over the SaaS contract term (via prepayments). Non-distinct customisation activities significantly enhance or  modify a SaaS cloud-based application. Judgement has been  applied in determining whether the degree of customisation and  modification of the SaaS cloud-based application is significant or  not. During the financial year, the Corporation did not recognise  any prepayments in respect of configuration and customisation  activities undertaken in implementing SaaS arrangements which are  considered not to be distinct from the access to the SaaS application  software over the contract term (2022-23: zero). Capitalisation of configuration and customisation costs in SaaS  arrangements  In implementing SaaS arrangements, the Corporation may develop  software code that either enhances, modifies or creates additional  capability to the existing owned software. This software is used  to connect with the SaaS arrangement cloud-based application.  Judgement has been applied in determining whether the changes to  the owned software meets the definition of and recognition criteria  for an intangible asset in accordance with AASB 138 Intangible  Assets. During the financial year, the Corporation did not recognise  any intangible assets in respect of customisation and configuration  costs incurred in implementing SaaS arrangements (2022-23: zero).

As at 30 June 2024, the  Corporation has a joint arrangement with Development Victoria to actively market Riverwalk Estate lots for private sale. Riverwalk, located in Werribee, an outer western suburb of Melbourne, is a 197 hectare site and was previously part of the Western Treatment  Plant. The Corporation has entered into a Partnering Deed with Development Victoria to develop the land with an estimated 2,260 homes at  the completion of the project.

Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods of 3 to 15 years, but may have extension options as described below.  Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Corporation allocates the consideration in the contract to the lease and  non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone prices.  Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not  impose any covenants. Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by  Corporation.  Initial recognition Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the  following lease payments:  •	 fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable  •	 variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate  •	 amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees  •	 the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and  •	 payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.  Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to the profit and loss over the lease period  to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. Lease payments to be made under  reasonably certain extension options are also included in the measurement of the liability. The lease payments are discounted using the Corporation’s incremental borrowing rate. Treasury Corporation of Victoria (TCV)/Department of  Treasury’s (DTF) calculator is used to determine the incremental borrowing rate. Right-of-use assets include the following components: •	 the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability  •	 any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received  •	 any initial direct costs, and  •	 restoration costs.  The Corporation is exposed to future cash outflows that are not reflected in the measurement of lease liabilities. This includes: •	 variable lease payments •	 extension options and termination options •	 leases not yet commenced to which the lessee is committed.  ===== PAGE 127 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   125 4.4 Right-of-use assets and leases (continued) (iii)  The Corporation’s leasing activities and how these are accounted for (continued):	 Subsequent re-measurements Right of use assets are subsequently measured at fair value less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Fair value is determined with  reference to market rental yields, impairment losses and any re-measurements of the lease liability. A managerial fair value assessment was  performed with reference to market rental yields and concluded that no revaluation adjustments were required for 30 June 2024 (2022-23: no  revaluation adjustments).  Depreciation The Corporation depreciates the right-of-use assets on a straight-line basis from the lease commencement date to the earlier of the end of the  useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. Extension and termination options Extension and termination options may be included in the leases. These terms are used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of  managing contracts. The majority of extension and termination options held are exercisable only by Corporation and not by the respective  lessor.  Residual value guarantees The Corporation is not exposed to any lease residual value guarantees. Critical judgements in determining the lease term	 	 	 	 In determining the lease term, the Corporation considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise  an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. The assessment is reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in  circumstances occurs which affects this assessment. During the current financial year and prior year, there were no changes in circumstances  to impact the assessment of exercising extension and termination options. Operating lease receivable Operating leases receivable primarily relate to land owned by the Corporation.  All operating lease contracts contain market review clauses.  The lessee does not have an option to purchase the land at the expiry of the lease period. Commitments for minimum lease receipts in relation to non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:                        ($ thousands) 2024 2023 Within 1 year 2,993  3,532  Later than 1 year but not later than 5 years 4,664  4,846  Later than 5 years 2,812  1,805  Total operating lease receivable 10,469  10,183  FINANCIAL REPORT  ===== PAGE 128 ===== 126   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report Financing Our Operations The Corporation's operations are financed through a variety of means. Recurrent operations are generally financed from cash flows from  operating activities (see Statement of Cash Flows). Asset investment operations are generally financed from a combination of surplus cash  flows from operating activities, asset sales and borrowings. This section provides information on the balances related to the financing of the Corporation's operations, including financial commitments  (inclusive of lessor receivables) at year-end. 5.1 Interest bearing liabilities                ($ thousands) 2024 2023 Current interest bearing liabilities VDP service concession liability 59,914   48,287  Lease liabilities 8,613   8,112  Borrowings (a) 325,000   134,000  Total current interest bearing liabilities  393,527  190,399  Non-current interest bearing liabilities VDP service concession liability 3,404,823   3,464,736  Lease liabilities 19,369   27,981  Borrowings (a) 4,402,249   4,300,931  Total non-current interest bearing liabilities  7,826,441   7,793,648  Total interest bearing liabilities  8,219,968   7,984,047  Note:  (a) In 2022-23 $448.7 million of current borrowings have been re-classified to non-current borrowings as per accounting policy change. Refer to Note 7.9. Interest bearing liabilities come from borrowings raised through  the Treasury Corporation of Victoria (TCV), along with VDP service  concession liability and leases. They are classified as financial  instruments. All interest bearing liabilities are initially recognised at  the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable  transaction costs. Interest bearing liabilities are subsequently  measured at amortised cost using the constant interest rate method,  with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. Financial liabilities for the VDP service concession liability were  initially measured at the fair value of the service concession asset.  Any modifications to the debt repayments are considered with  reference to the guidance within AASB 9. Where the Corporation has the right to defer settlement of the  liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period,  interest bearing liabilities are classified as non-current liabilities.  Otherwise interest bearing liabilities are classified as current  liabilities. The Corporation has classified borrowings which mature within 12  months as non current liabilities on the basis that the Corporation  has discretion to, and will refinance or roll over these loans with TCV  pursuant to section 8 of the Borrowings and Investment Powers Act  1987. Short term borrowings are classified as current borrowings at  floating interest rate. Financial reporting impacts of climate related matters Under the Greener Government Buildings Program, the Corporation  entered into two Credit Foncier loans with TCV on the 28 September  2022 totalling $78.4M (balance as at 30 June 2024: $62.3M  included within borrowings). The purpose of these loans are to fund  the below climate related projects: •	 To implement the Eastern Treatment Plant and Winneke Water  Treatment Plant Large Scale Solar projects, which are designed  to reduce Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions associated with  the plants' energy consumption and operating costs associated  with purchasing electricity for water treatment at the facilities  operated by Corporation; and •	  Installation of Mini Hydroelectric Power Stations at St Albans  and Upper Yarra Reservoirs have been commissioned and  O’Shannassy will be commissioned in late 2025 The purpose of these loans are to fund the construction of the above  climate related projects with cost savings from purchasing electricity  to repay the loans over 8 years.

Financial accommodation levy is a levy applied to the Corporation  to remove the market advantage that government entities may  experience in borrowings as a result of being guaranteed by the State  of Victoria. The financial accommodation levy is a commercial rate  charged for new borrowings based on the Corporation's underlying  credit rating and is paid into the State’s Consolidated Fund in  accordance with section 40N of the Financial Management Act 1994  in respect of financial accommodation provided to the Corporation  by the State Government of Victoria.

The Victorian Desalination Project  was initiated to design, build, finance and operate a desalination  plant, transfer pipeline and 220 kV underground power cable  capable of supplying 150GL of water per annum into the Melbourne  network. Construction of the Victorian Desalination Project began  in 2009 and the lease term commenced in 2012 upon successful  commissioning. AquaSure is required to transfer the project assets to  the State at the end of the project term for no additional payment  by the State. The desalination plant assets will transfer from the  State to the Corporation at the end of the project contract term  (presently planned for 2039).  Under the arrangement, the state has an obligation to make Water  Security Payments (WSPs) to the consortium provided the plant  is maintained to the appropriate standard. The WSPs have two  components: capital payments for the project assets and other  expenses for operating, maintenance and lifecycle costs. The state  will also make Water Usage Payments (WUPs) for any water that  is ordered and delivered to the required standard. Water can be  ordered annually for flexible amounts from 0GL to 150GL (in set  increments). The arrangement also requires a minimum number of  Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) to be purchased to offset the  electricity used by the plant. The number of RECs that are consumed  will vary based on the volume of water produced by the plant. The  number of banked RECs that remain at the end of the supply period  are controlled by the State and not recognised by the Corporation. An arrangement was entered into by the State and the Corporation,  where a Statement of Obligations (SoO) was issued to the  Corporation under section 4I of the Water Industry Act 1994 that  required the Corporation to pay all monies as required by the State  under the project deed with AquaSure.  This includes payment  of the WSPs and WUP in accordance with the Project Deed. The  Corporation makes these payments to DEECA who are managing the  contract with AquaSure on behalf of the State.  The Corporation also entered into a Victorian Desalination Project  'Water Interface Agreement' (WIA) and a Supplementary Water  Interface Agreement with the State to record the terms of the  interface and financial arrangements between the Project and the  Corporation.  Service Concession Assessment and Policy The State (in conjunction with the Corporation) has assessed the  agreements between AquaSure, DEECA (on behalf of the State) and  the Corporation, and concluded that the agreements are connected  and should form one single commercial arrangement. Under the  combined arrangement, the Corporation is considered the ultimate  grantor under AASB 1059 (Service Concession Arrangements), and  AquaSure the private sector operator that provides public services  on behalf of the Corporation.  Accordingly the Corporation applies  AASB 1059 to the VDP arrangement. Service concession assets are  recognised under Property plant and equipment in section 4.1 and  related liabilities are disclosed under Interest bearing liabilities under  section 5.1 respectively.   Changes in arrangement occurring in the current year As at 30 June 2024 AquaSure had produced zero GL for the 2023-24  supply period (4.1GL for the 2022-23 supply period).  On 1 April 2024 the Minister for Water announced the 2024-25  Supply Notice (order) with a Required Annual Water Volume for 0  GL in 2024-25 and non-binding forecasts of 50 GL for 2025-26 and  75 GL for 2026-27 (2023-24 non-binding forecast: 50GL for 2024- 25 and 75GL for 2025-26).  ===== PAGE 132 ===== 130   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report              ($ thousands) Minimum future  payments (exc GST) Present value of minimum  future payments   (exc GST) 2024 2023 2024 2023 VDP service concession arrangement liability Less than 1 year 448,784  442,947  59,914  48,287  1 year but less than 5 years 1,880,218  1,839,220  414,174  332,483  Later than 5 years 5,051,528  5,541,310  2,990,648  3,132,253  Minimum future liability payments 7,380,530   7,823,477  3,464,736   3,513,023  Less: Future finance charges (3,915,794) (4,310,454)   -    -  Total liability 3,464,736  3,513,023  3,464,736  3,513,023  Representing liability: Current (refer to Note 5.1) (a) 59,914  48,287  Non-current (refer to Note 5.1) (a) 3,404,823  3,464,736  Total liability 3,464,737  3,513,023  Note: (a) The present value of the minimum future payments have been discounted to 30 June of the respective financial years using the weighted average interest rate of 11.28% (2022- 23: 11.28%). These payments exclude finance charges. Under the PPP arrangement that the state entered into with AquaSure, the State is required to make base water security payments, provided  the plant is maintained to the appropriate standard. These payments are for costs related to the VDP's operation, maintenance and lifecycle  costs. The nominal amounts for the other commitments below represent the charges payable under the agreement at the end of the reporting  period for these costs.

Commitments are updated for the change in actual amounts paid, and forecast percentage increases are based on the original forecasted indices and applied to the adjusted actual  payments. This methodology has been applied to reduce volatility in the forecast ‘Other commitments’. (b) The present value of the ‘Other commitments’ has been discounted to 30 June of the respective financial years. The basis for discounting has been to take each 12 month period  of cash flows and discount these cash flows at the end of the period using the annual discount rate. The discount rate used to calculate the  present value of the commitment is  9.99% (2022-23: 9.99%) which is the nominal pre-tax discount rate representative of the overall risk of the project at inception. (c) Net costs associated with the zero water order for the 2023-24 financial year have been reflected in commitments for 2022-23. The announcement of the zero water order  for 2024-25 is a binding commitment and has been included in 2023-24. The announcement of the 50GL and 75GL water order for 2025-26 and 2026-27 are non-binding  commitments and have not been included. As per information provided by DEECA (in accordance with the WIA), the Corporation has recognised the following service  concession liability: VDP service concession arrangement liability FINANCIAL REPORT  ===== PAGE 133 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   131 Risks, contingencies and valuation judgements The Corporation is exposed to financial risks from both its activities and outside factors. In addition, it is often necessary to make judgements  and estimates associated with recognition and measurement of items in the financial statements.  This section presents information on financial instruments, contingent assets and liabilities, and fair value determinations regarding the  Corporation's financial assets and liabilities. Financial instruments arise out of contractual agreements that give  rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity  instrument of another entity. Due to the nature of the Corporation’s  activities, certain financial assets and financial liabilities arise under  statute rather than a contract (for example taxes). Such assets and  liabilities do not meet the definition of financial instruments. The Corporation's principal financial instruments are contractual in  nature and comprise: •	 Cash and cash equivalents •	 Trade debtors and other receivables (including cashflow hedge) •	 Payables (including trade creditors, interest payable, accruals  and other payables) •	 VDP service concession liability •	 Lease liabilities •	 Borrowings (including short term, floating rate notes and fixed  interest) 6.1 Financial instruments The Corporation's policy on financial instruments is noted below. Classification and measurement of financial instruments Receivables and cash are financial instruments with fixed and  determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market.  Financial assets are initially measured at fair value minus any direct  transaction costs. Subsequent to initial measurement, receivables  are measured at amortised cost as the objective is to collect the  contractual cash flows. The following assets are held with the objective to collect the  contractual cash flows: •	 Cash and cash equivalents •	 Trade debtors and other receivables Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value. These  financial instruments are measured at amortised cost with  any difference between the initial recognised amount and the  redemption value being recognised in the profit and loss, over the  period of the interest bearing liability using the effective interest rate  method.  The Corporation recognises the following liabilities: •	 Trade creditors, accruals and interest payable •	 VDP service concession liability •	 Lease liabilities •	 Other payables •	 Borrowings (including short term, floating rate notes and fixed  interest) FINANCIAL REPORT Introduction  ===== PAGE 134 ===== 132   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report •	 Manage the Corporation's cost of borrowings through effective  control and management of interest rate risk •	 Manage the Corporation's cost of borrowings in line with the  revenue provided in the applicable Pricing Determination to  cover the cost of debt •	 Manage working capital requirements by ensuring sufficient  cash resources and funds are available to meet daily and long- term liquidity needs within approved parameters, while utilising  excess cash to reduce debt balances •	 Ensure that adequate financial accommodation facilities are in  place to meet the short and long-term liquidity needs •	 Ensure that all financial and operational risk exposures are  identified and managed •	 Ensure adequate internal controls, roles and responsibilities •	 Maintain an indicative investment grade corporate credit rating  and credit metrics. These objectives are consistent with the Corporate Risk  Management Policy and Framework of the Corporation, the  Corporation's Financial Strength Goals, Standing Directions issued  by the Assistant Treasurer and the Victorian Public Sector Debt  Management Objectives. Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities	 	 Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash  flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred  and the Corporation has transferred substantially all the risks and  rewards of ownership. A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under  the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. When an existing  financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on  substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are  substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated  as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a  new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is  recognised in the comprehensive operating statement.  Impairment of financial assets The Corporation applies the AASB 9 simplified approach to  measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss  allowance for contractual receivables. On this basis, an assessment  undertaken by management has identified that historical debt write- offs and future expected losses are immaterial. As such, there is no  allowance for expected credit losses as at 30 June 2024 (2022-23:  Nil).

Interest rate risk profile – Forward Rate Agreements are used to  mitigate the risk from adverse interest rate increases where the  actual interest rates paid to finance debt are at risk of being higher  than the debt allowance received in revenue to finance debt.  The  Corporation's goal is to align the actual interest rate risk profile  to the profile used by the Essential Services Commission (ESC) in  setting our revenue. Aligning the interest rate re-pricing profile of the debt portfolio with  the annual regulatory weighted average cost of capital (WACC)  re-set based on the 10-year trailing average approach used by the  ESC to determine revenue aims to reduce the regulatory interest  rate mismatch risk. The Corporation also aims to align the modified  duration of its debt portfolio in line with the regulatory benchmark  portfolio. Financing arrangements  – The capacity to borrow funds and  manage the associated risks is subject to the provisions of the  Borrowing and Investment Powers Act 1987. In accordance with this  Act, the Treasurer of Victoria issues an annual approval, permitting  new borrowings and the refinancing of all loan maturities for that  year and non-maturing loans upon request. All funding is sourced  from the Treasury Corporation of Victoria (TCV). The Corporation's total approved maximum borrowing limit for  2023-24 of $5,275.8 million (2022-23: $4,827.3 million) was not  exceeded at any stage throughout the financial year.  Capital management – The Corporation manages its finances in  order to maintain a stable and appropriate capital structure given  the financial risk profile and the regulated nature of its business. The  Corporation’s aim is to maintain credit metrics consistent with an  investment grade long-term corporate credit rating.   The Corporation has the following externally imposed limits in  relation to capital management: •	 Financial Accommodation cannot exceed the approval limits  set by the Treasurer of Victoria pursuant to the Borrowing and  Investment Powers Act 1987 •	 The Corporation, with the exception of working capital  accounts is required to borrow and invest exclusively with TCV. The Corporation's gearing ratio (Total Debt/Total Assets) at 30 June  2024 was 45.1% (2022-23: 44.6%) and interest cover cash ratio was  2.4 times (2022-23: 2.2 times). Gearing and Interest Cover ratios are some of a number of  benchmarks that are considered by the Board when considering  an appropriate capital structure. These ratios are approved via the  Corporate Plan. Development Services Schemes (Schemes) - the Corporation has  functions relating to regional drainage, floodplain management and  waterway management in relation to its waterway management  district across greater Melbourne under the Water Act 1989, and  related responsibilities as a determining referral authority for certain  planning permit applications under the Planning and Environment  Act 1987 and Victoria Planning Provisions. The Corporation prepares  schemes to plan the infrastructure for new urban development  to guide the standards developers must meet regarding flood  protection, water quality, waterway health and amenity and  establish the financial contributions that will apply to developers to  fund the provision of the required infrastructure.  Schemes consist  of an infrastructure plan and pricing model for the provision of  developer funded drainage works. Schemes operate on a user pays  principle where developers pay the full cost of the assets required to  meet the designated standards of service. Once constructed, assets  servicing catchments over 60 hectares are owned and managed  by the Corporation. Works within a catchment size of less than 60  hectares are transferred to councils for ongoing management upon  agreement from council (see Note 3.6 Asset transfers to council). The Essential Services Commission (ESC) regulates the principles  for calculating developer charges. A key principle is that charges for  schemes are based on a discounted cash flow analysis to ensure an  economic net present value neutral outcome to the Corporation.  Timing differences can arise between capital expenditure and  collection of the developer charges for each scheme. These timing  differences are funded by the Corporation through operating cash  flows and/or borrowings with any surplus or deficit also adjusted/ funded through adjustments to the regulatory asset base via the  regulatory pricing model set by the ESC in every pricing re-set.   Schemes are subject to regular financial and engineering reviews by  the Corporation to seek to ensure they remain financially sustainable  and the infrastructure meets evolving requirements.  Future capital commitments for schemes are accounted for  consistently with other future capital commitments for the  Corporation (included in total capital expenditure commitments at  Note 5.3 where there is a committed future contract for the works).

At 30 June 2023 and 30 June 2024, if interest rates had changed by +/- 50 basis points from the year end rates with all other variables held  constant, the net profit before tax and the impact on equity would have changed by the amounts shown above. Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities are denominated in a currency that is  not the entity's functional currency. It is the Corporation's policy to hedge the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the fair values of any transactions in excess  of AUD $1.0 million. The Corporation's policy requires all hedging to be undertaken through TCV in the form of Forward Foreign Exchange  Contracts. As at 30 June 2024, the Corporation had no Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts (30 June 2023: $0.1 million). Price risk is the risk that the Corporation will suffer financial loss due to adverse movements in the price of commodity inputs and/or outputs  related to its business operations. The Corporation faces a range of risks associated with the procurement, delivery and funding of assets, goods and services.  The Corporation  continues to experience significant cost increases in many goods and services that are necessary for ongoing operation and delivery of projects  consistent with significant market trend.  The Corporation is also exposed to disruptions to supply chains from economic and natural events,  however has risk management plans in place to mitigate and minimise these disruptions to business operations where possible. These challenges  are ongoing which could impact service delivery and the ability to meet financial performance targets and commitments. The Corporation regularly assesses exposures to supply chain disruptions and identifies controls and options to reduce any exposures going  forward. Commodity price risk from business operations is quantified and hedged appropriately to minimise risk. Hedging of the risk is mostly performed  through supply and service contracts to provide certainty over timing and quantity (i.e. contracts for electricity, chemicals and procurement  process to deliver capital works), however increased supplier initiated price escalation has been observed, again consistent with significant market  trend. The Corporation has governance arrangements, processes, procedures and systems in place to prioritise delivery of its capital program and  projects. 6.1.2 Foreign exchange risk 6.1.3 Price risk  ===== PAGE 138 ===== 136   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Corporation as a result  of a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument failing to  meet its contractual obligations in full and on the due date. The  Corporation’s exposure to credit risk is influenced by the individual  characteristics of each customer or counterparty. All receivables are recognised at the amounts receivable less any  expected credit loss. Receivables are reviewed on an ongoing basis  to identify amounts which cannot be collected. Debts which cannot  be collected are written off. The Corporation applies the AASB 9  simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses  a lifetime expected loss allowance for all receivables. Refer to Note  2.2 (Receivables). The major exposure to credit risk arises from Trade Debtors and  Other Receivables. Trade Debtors are comprised of:  •	 Metropolitan retail water businesses with minimal credit risk  exposure to the Corporation. These debtors are invoiced in two  parts. The first part is a usage charge that is invoiced weekly  and paid within 7 days. The second part is an availability charge  that is invoiced monthly and paid within 14 days.  •	 Waterways and Drainage customers. The collection of  payments and overdue receivables is managed by the  metropolitan retail water businesses as part of billings and  collection agreements with the Corporation. In addition any  unpaid debt is allocated against the property title and will be  extinguished if there is a change in property ownership. Other receivables primarily consist of accrued revenue in relation  to our services. The Corporation applies the AASB 9 simplified approach to  measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss  allowance for contractual receivables. On this basis, an assessment  undertaken by management has identified that historical debt write- offs and future expected losses are immaterial. As such, there is no  allowance for expected credit losses as at 30 June 2024 (2022-23:  nil). All financial risk management instruments are transacted with TCV,  whose liabilities are guaranteed by the Victorian Government. The  Corporation potentially has a concentration of credit risk with TCV  as the central borrowing authority of Victoria. This risk is considered  minimal. 6.1.4 Credit risk Climate change is a risk for the Corporation. Climate change risk  includes the physical risk which can cause direct impact to natural  resources including water supply, or damage to assets or property  as a result of changes in climate conditions (including rising  global temperatures) as well as transition risks which arise from  the transition to low-carbon economy. The impacts of climate  change create resilience challenges for our services.  Understanding  and preparing for climate risks is a critical component of the  Corporation's long term strategy development. At a strategic  level, climate risk is incorporated into our corporate risk register,  recognising the complex and comprehensive nature of the adaption  and transition challenges.

FINANCIAL REPORT  ===== PAGE 141 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   139 Contingent assets and liabilities are not recognised in the Statement of Financial Position, but if quantifiable are disclosed below. Contingent assets are possible assets that arise from past events,  whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non- occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within  the control of the entity. Contingent liabilities are: •	 possible obligations that arise from past events, whose  existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non- occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly  within the control of the entity (for example: potential  litigation or climate related risks).  6.3 Contingent assets and liabilities             ($ thousands) 2024 2023 Contingent assets (a)   -    -  Contingent liabilities (b) 41,228  61,916  Note: (a) 2022-23 Native Vegetation Offsets (NVO's) have been re-classified from contingent assets ($11.2 million based on market value) to intangible assets (zero value based on  historical cost). Refer to Note 4.2.  (b) Contingent liabilities primarily relate to compulsory land acquisitions where the Corporation will receive an equivalent land asset. Compulsory land acquisitions have not been  included as contingent assets. Given the significant estimation uncertainty, compulsory land acquisitions are not treated as provisions. The Corporation only recognises assets and  liabilities once the Notice of Acquisition has been issued to the landowner. Total compulsory land acquisitions for 2023-24 are $39.8 million (2022-23: $60.5million).  •	 present obligations that arise from past events but are not  recognised because: 	– it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying  economic benefits will be required to settle the  obligations 	– the amount of the obligations cannot be measured with  sufficient reliability FINANCIAL REPORT Contingent liabilities also include possible outflows associated with legal actions both quantifiable and unquantifiable (where there is a  possible outflow that can not yet be measured with sufficient reliability). The extreme weather flooding event from October 2022 has been  considered as an unquantifiable contingent liability at 30 June 2024 (and in 30 June 2023). Should future costs arise, the Corporations liability  exposure is expected to be limited to its normal insurance excess.   ===== PAGE 142 ===== 140   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report 7.1 Superannuation – defined benefit plan This section includes those additional disclosures required by Australian Accounting Standards or otherwise, that are material, for the  understanding of this financial report. Defined benefit members receive lump sum benefits on retirement,  death, disablement and withdrawal. Some defined benefit members  are also eligible for pension benefits in some cases. Benefits are  calculated on a multiple of an employee’s final salary. The multiple is  dependent on an employee’s length of service and their contribution  rate. The fund ceased including new members from September  1994. At each reporting date, a liability or asset in respect of defined  benefit superannuation obligations is recognised. This is measured  as the difference between the present value of the defined benefit  obligations at the reporting date and the net market value of the  Plan's assets.  Actuarial gains and losses arising from the Corporations defined  benefit superannuation scheme are recognised immediately in Other  Comprehensive Income in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other  Comprehensive Income in the year in which they occur. The Plan's Trustee (Equipsuper) is responsible for the governance of  the Plan. The Trustee has a legal obligation to act solely in the best  interests of Plan beneficiaries. The Trustee has the following roles: •	 Administration of the Plan and payment to the beneficiaries  from Plan assets when required in accordance with the Plan  rules •	 Management and investment of the Plan assets •	 Compliance with superannuation law and other applicable  regulations. There are a number of risks to which the Plan exposes the  Corporation. The more significant risks relating to the defined  benefits are investment risk, salary growth risk, legislative risk and  pension risk.

For 2023-24, the Corporation had a $0.05 million ex-gratia expense (2022-23: zero) in relation to a fire tanker gifted to the Wadawurrung  Traditional Owners Aboriginal Corporation to support their cultural fire management. This donation is in direct support of our “We will walk  Country together” strategic goal commitments. 7.7 Subsequent events No matters or circumstance have arisen since 30 June 2024 which have significantly affected, or may significantly affect: •	 the Corporation’s operations;  •	 the results of those operations; and/or  •	 the Corporation’s state of affairs in the financial year subsequent to 30 June 2024. 7.8 Australian Accounting Standards issued that are not yet effective Certain new amendments to accounting standards that are deemed relevant to the Corporation have been published, but are not mandatory  for the 30 June 2024 reporting period. The Corporation has not adopted these amendments early in accordance with DTF guidance. The Corporation's assessment of the impact of these amendments is set out below: Several amending standards and AASB interpretations have been issued that apply to future reporting periods but are considered to have  limited impact on the Corporation's reporting. •	 AASB 2014-10 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture •	 AASB2022-5 Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback •	 AASB2023-1 Supplier Finance Arrangements •	 AASB2020-1 Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current – Amendments to AASB101 •	 AASB2022-6 - Non-current Liabilities with Covenants FINANCIAL REPORT  ===== PAGE 151 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   149 7.9 Changes in accounting policy Disclosure of Accounting Policies  The Corporation adopted Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to AASB101) from 1 July 2023. The amendments require the  disclosure of ‘material’, rather than ‘significant’, accounting policies. The amendments also provide guidance on the application of materiality  to disclosure of accounting policies, assisting entities to provide useful, entity-specific accounting. Although the amendments did not result  in any changes to the accounting policies themselves, they impacted the accounting policy information disclosed in the financial statements.  Where policies/disclosures considered immaterial they have been removed. Deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction.  The Corporation has adopted Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to AASB 112)  from 1 July 2023. The amendments narrow the scope of the initial recognition exemption to exclude transactions that give rise to equal and  offsetting temporary differences – e.g. leases and decommissioning liabilities. For leases and decommissioning liabilities, an entity is required  to recognise the associated deferred tax assets and liabilities from the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, with any  cumulative effect recognised as an adjustment to retained earnings or other components of equity at that date. For all other transactions, an  entity applies the amendments to transactions that occur on or after the beginning of the earliest period presented. The amendments resulted  in minor disclosure changes and did not impact the measurement of DTA's and DTL's. Refer to Note 3.8.1. Accounting policy change - classification of current and non current borrowings The Corporation has changed its accounting policy for presenting current liabilities by classifying its borrowings which mature within 12  months as non current liabilities (previously classified as current). The Corporation has changed its interpretation of the right to defer  settlement requirement of AASB 101 as the Corporation has discretion to, and will refinance or roll over these loans with TCV, pursuant  to section 8 of the Borrowings and Investment Powers Act 1987. The Corporation believes that this presentation provides more relevant  information to the users of its financial statements as it is more aligned to current practices. Short Term borrowings are classified as current  Borrowings at floating interest rate. The tables below show the adjustments recognised for each individual financial statement line item as a result of the policy change. Line items  that were not affected by the changes have not been included.

In my opinion, the financial report presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the  corporation as at 30 June 2024 and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended  in accordance with the financial reporting requirements of Part 7 of the Financial Management Act  1994 and applicable Australian Accounting Standards.      Basis for  Opinion  I have conducted my audit in accordance with the Audit Act 1994 which incorporates the Australian  Auditing Standards. I further describe my responsibilities under that Act and those standards in the  Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report section of my report.   My independence is established by the Constitution Act 1975. My staff and I are independent of the  corporation in accordance with the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical  Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (the Code) that are relevant  to my audit of the financial report in Victoria. My staff and I have also fulfilled our other ethical  responsibilities in accordance with the Code.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for  my opinion.    Key audit  matters  Key audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgement, were of most significance in  my audit of the financial report of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of  my audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a  separate opinion on these matters.     ===== PAGE 153 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   151 FINANCIAL REPORT   Key audit matter  How I addressed the matter  Recognition and Measurement of Service Concession Arrangement asset and liability - the Victorian Desalination  Plant (the VDP)  Note 5.4 – VDP Service Concession Arrangement   VDP Service Concession Asset:  $4.484 billion  VDP Service Concession Liability: $3.465 billion   VDP Commitment Disclosures:   •  Minimum future payments: $7.381 billion (nominal)  •  Other expense commitment: $3.515 billion  (nominal)  I considered the service concession arrangement (SCA)  for the VDP’s asset, liability and commitment to be a key  audit matter because:   •  they are financially significant   •  the contractual rights and obligations are complex  and small changes, including refinancing  adjustments, can significantly affect the SCA liability  and commitments  •  the SCA liability and commitments model is complex  •  a significant degree of management judgement and  assumptions are required to measure the liability,  commitments and the fair value of the VDP asset  •  the requirements of AASB 1059 Service Concession  Arrangements: Grantors (AASB 1059) are complex,  and involve significant management judgement   •  the corporation places significant reliance on the  Department of Energy, Environment and Climate  Action (DEECA) for information to account for and  disclose the arrangement  •  the required disclosures for service concession  arrangements are extensive.    My key procedures included:   •  gaining an understanding of the key contractual  changes from the prior year  •  engaging a subject matter expert to assist in  obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence for  the SCA liability and commitment disclosures,  including the:   o  identification of any model and/or assumption  changes  o  reasonableness and consistency of the liability  model assumptions  o  reasonableness of model inputs, with specific  reference to underlying data and supporting  documentation   o  model’s computational accuracy  o  appropriateness of any re-financing  adjustments   •  evaluating our subject matter expert's workings and  concluding the work was adequate for the purposes  of our audit  •  evaluating management’s assessment of the fair  value of the VDP asset  •  obtaining representations provided by DEECA  relating to the underlying audited data used in the  DCF model and for disclosures   •  assessing the adequacy of financial report  disclosures against the requirements of applicable  Australian Accounting Standards.   ===== PAGE 154 ===== 152   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report FINANCIAL REPORT Key audit matter  How I addressed the matter  Fair Value of Infrastructure Assets   Note 4.1.3 – Fair value determination of non-financial physical assets   Fair value of Infrastructure Assets: $9.312 billion    I considered this to be a key audit matter because:   •  infrastructure assets are financially significant   •  the fair value estimate is derived from an  income-based valuation approach that uses a  discounted cashflow (DCF) model   •  management engage an external valuation  expert to prepare the fair value estimate  •  the DCF model is highly complex and involves  significant judgements and assumptions  •  small changes in key assumptions used in the  DCF model can materially affect the fair value  •  the DCF model's forecast period is long, and  includes a terminal value, which increases the  difficulty in accurately estimating the fair value   •  accounting standard AASB 13 Fair Value  Measurement (AASB 13) requires extensive  financial report disclosures.  My key procedures included:   •  obtaining an understanding of the approach to estimating  the fair value of infrastructure  •  assessing the competence, objectivity and capability of  management's expert engaged to assist with the  valuation process  •  engaging a subject matter expert to assist us in obtaining  sufficient appropriate audit evidence, including:   o  the appropriateness of using an income-based  valuation approach   o  the identification and assessment of the  reasonableness of any changes to the DCF model  and/or assumptions,   o  the reasonableness and consistency of all the  assumptions used in the DCF model  o  the reasonableness of all inputs used in the DCF  model, with specific reference to underlying data  and supporting documentation   o  the DCF model’s computational accuracy  •  evaluating our subject matter expert's work and  concluding the work was adequate for the purposes of  our audit  •  assessing the completeness and adequacy of the financial  report disclosures against the requirements of AASB 13,  including the significant observable and unobservable  inputs utilised in the model and the sensitivity analysis.    Board’s  responsibilities  for the financial  report  The Board of the corporation is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial  report in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Financial Management Act 1994,  and for such internal control as the Board determines is necessary to enable the preparation and fair  presentation of a financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or  error.    In preparing the financial report, the Board is responsible for assessing the corporation’s ability to  continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the  going concern basis of accounting unless it is inappropriate to do so.   ===== PAGE 155 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   153 FINANCIAL REPORT Auditor’s  responsibilities  for the audit of  the financial  report  As required by the Audit Act 1994, my responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report  based on the audit. My objectives for the audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the  financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to  issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance  but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards  will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or  error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be  expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.   As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, I exercise professional  judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also:   •  identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to  fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain  audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk  of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting  from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,  misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  •  obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit  procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing  an opinion on the effectiveness of the corporation’s internal control  •  evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of  accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board  •  conclude on the appropriateness of the Board’s use of the going concern basis of accounting  and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to  events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the corporation’s ability to continue  as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw  attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such  disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit  evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or  conditions may cause the corporation to cease to continue as a going concern.   •  evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the  disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and  events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.   I communicate with the Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the  audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I  identify during my audit.   From the matters communicated with the Board, I determine those matters that were of most  significance in the audit of the financial report of the current period and are therefore key audit  matters. I describe these matters in the auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public  disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter  should not be communicated in the auditor’s report because the adverse consequences of doing so  would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

[2]	 The 2023-24 result for Internal Financing Ratio is favourable to target is due to lower payments for capital expenditure of ($359.7 million) partially offset by higher net  operating cash inflows ($145.8 million – mainly due to lower payments to suppliers and lower income tax).  [3]	 The 2023-24 result for Current Ratio is unfavourable to prior year due to higher current borrowings ($203.1 million) resulting from higher capital expenditure. [4]	 The 2023-24 result for Return on Equity is favourable to prior year due to higher net profit after tax ($30.6 million).  The 2023-24 result for Return on Equity is favourable to target is due to higher average equity ($840.4 million) mainly due to the reserves increase for the revaluation of  assets in 2022-23 not being included in plan. Notes – to Performance Report: PERFORMANCE REPORT Financial Performance Indicators Note:  (a) The 2022-23 actual  and 2023-24 target current ratios have been restated for comparability due to accounting policy changes adopted in 2023-24. For 2022-23 actual this  resulted in $448.7 million of current interest bearing liabilities being reclassified from current to non-current and the current ratio changing from 0.14 times to 0.20 times. For  2023-24 target this resulted in $404.0 million of interest bearing liabilities being reclassified from current to non-current and the current ratio changing from 0.11 times to 0.18  times.  ===== PAGE 158 ===== 156   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report [1]	 Performance indicators as mandated in Ministerial Reporting Direction 07 - Performance and Financial Sustainability. As required by MRD 07 any variances to target or last  year of more than 10% for financial performance indicators and 5% for non financial performance indicators have been further explained within these notes.  [5]	 The favourable variance compared to target and prior year for water quality (turbidity) was due to optimised harvesting during low turbidity periods from the catchment to  help ensure good water quality is supplied to the Silvan system resulting in no exceedances.   [6]	 Waterways - Drainage and Flood protection indicator result is not comparable to the prior year as it is a cumulative result. [7]	 The Waterways drainage and flood protection indicator represents anticipated reduction in damages from flood in the Port Phillip and Westernport region determined to  be achieved through investment into flood mitigation (asset and non-asset solutions). This metric is part of the Waterways Drainage and Investment Plan (2021-2026),  approved by the Essential Services Commission, and sets expectations for active investment which is designed to reduce flood impacts. The indicator is favourable to  target due to the flood effects reduction program delivering higher volume of outcomes than originally planned. The program includes building and planning permits, flood  mitigation works and community education. In 2023-24, there have been 738 building and planning permits for development cases responded to during the period with floor  level advice provided, exceeding the target of 150. The number of households that have received the flood education program are counted as ''effective engagements'' from  the annual report produced by Melbourne University. The number of effective engagements for current financial year is 1,898. The major flood event which occurred in 2022  continues to have a significant impact on housing and the community.  Melbourne Water continues to support of effected communities while also continuing to invest in  flood mitigation initiatives.  Information on the 'flood effects reduction program' can be found at https://letstalk.melbournewater.com.au/maribyrnong-river-flood-model. [8]	 The unfavourable variance to prior year and target is due to WTP being unable to supply Class A recycled water partially for several months due to high PH and Blue Green  Algae (BGA). Class A recycled water customers (our main customer is Southern Rural Water (SRW) who supply on to their customers who are mostly farmers) have an  alternate supply of irrigation water from the Werribee River. We worked closely with SRW during the outage to help ensure that the impact was minimised by keeping them  informed of WTP BGA levels so that they could source alternate water supply. We are currently investigating alternate methods for controlling BGA. [9]	 The favourable variance to prior year is due to no events occurring in 2023-24 that prevented Melbourne Water from meeting its contractual requirements for supply of  recycled water. In 2022-23, the severe weather event in October 2022 adversely impacted ETP’s ability to meet its contractual requirements for the supply of  Class A  recycled water throughout November 2022.

APPENDIX B  ===== PAGE 168 ===== 166   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report APPENDIX B Asset Management Accountability Framework (AMAF) maturity assessment  Melbourne Water's self-assessed maturity for 2023-24 against the Asset Management Accountability Framework (AMAF) requirements  identified that Melbourne Water achieved a maturity rating of ‘competence' or above (rating 3 or above) across 34 of the 41 requirements  of the AMAF. For the seven requirements where we failed to meet our target competency rating, we had a competency rating of  ‘developing' (rating 2). Melbourne Water is targeting a minimum maturity rating of 'competence' across all of the AMAF requirements.  However, Melbourne Water also aims to continuously improve and optimise its asset management practices in all areas, wherever those  improvements and resulting levels of maturity provide best value to customers, stakeholders and the community.   To support a focus on asset management maturity improvement, Melbourne Water develops an annual Total Asset Management  Improvement Plan (TAMIP). The 2024-25 TAMIP includes specific actions and activities designed to address the identified maturity gaps.  Implementation of the TAMIP is reported monthly.

Procurement requirements for each of these  emergencies were met under existing contractual arrangements  pre-established to cater for such events (alongside other business  as usual requirements).  Melbourne Water has a specific set of guidelines for enacting  procurement outside of approved ‘business as usual’ arrangements  during incidents and emergencies. In certain defined emergency  circumstances, Melbourne Water is permitted to forgo routine  procurement procedures. The procurement of materials, equipment  and labour can be undertaken outside of existing delegated  approval authorities, quotation and sourcing requirements.  Melbourne Water is to balance the need to act without delay (for  example, to save or preserve life, safeguard buildings or repair  critical infrastructure) against meeting our overarching agency  obligations (act lawfully, reasonably and with integrity).  Despite the events responded to during the year, these emergency  procurement guidelines and procedures were not specifically  activated for any emergency event. While costs were incurred in  responding to and managing these circumstances, all procurement  was undertaken in accordance with existing delegations, and  business as usual procurement procedures.  Disclosure of procurement complaints  Under the Governance Policy of the Victorian Government  Purchasing Board (VGPB), Melbourne Water must disclose any  formal complaints relating to the procurement of goods and  services received through its procurement complaints management  system.   In 2023-24, Melbourne Water received one formal complaint  through its procurement complaints management system (in  late June 2024) in respect to construction related services. This  complaint is still under investigation.  Pricing  Melbourne Water’s wholesale water and sewerage prices increase  by approximately 0.25 per cent plus inflation in 2023-24, reflecting  the ESCs 2021 Price Determination with updates to cost of debt  and desalination plant costs. The annual residential waterways and  drainage charge increased by 0.70 per cent plus inflation in 2023- 24 to $118.16.  Disclosure of major contracts  Melbourne Water has disclosed, in accordance with Ministerial  Directions and Instructions for Public Construction Procurement in  Victoria and the Victorian Government Purchasing Board (VGPB)  policies, all contracts greater than $10 million in value entered into  during the year ended 30 June 2024. Details of contracts can be  viewed on the Buying for Victoria22 website.  Competitive neutrality policy  Melbourne Water is corporatized, with an independent Board  and independent, objective performance monitoring. Melbourne  Water faces the same tax treatment, borrowing requirements and  regulations as a private business. As outlined above, Melbourne  Water also operates in an environment where the ESC determines  cost-based pricing. In this regard, our processes are consistent with  the requirements of the Victorian Competitive Neutrality Policy.  In relation to anti-competitive behaviour, Melbourne Water did not  have any pending or completed legal action during the reporting  period. 22 https://www.buyingfor.vic.gov.au/  ===== PAGE 170 ===== 168   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report APPENDIX B Decisions made 32 Other requests 16 Access outcomes: •	 Access in full: 3 •	 	Access in part: 27 •	 No documents found: 1 •	 Access denied: 1 Outcomes: •	 Withdrawn: 1  •	 Did not proceed: 4 •	 Provided outside the FOI Act: 3 •	 Not yet finalised: 7 •	 Transferred to another agency: 1 Related to: •	 Environment and planning: 15 •	 Personal: 3 •	 Works: 1 •	 Asset management: 6 •	 Waterways: 4 •	 Miscellaneous: 3 Related to: •	 Asset management: 7 •	 Environment and planning: 5  •	 Waterways: 2  •	 Personal: 0 •	 Miscellaneous: 2 Requests received from: •	 Members of the public: 15  •	 Law firms: 13 •	 Members of the media: 3 •	 Developers: 1 •	 Members of Parliament: 1 •	 Community interest groups: 1 Documents released: •	 Total number of documents: 1327 •	 Documents released in full: 882 Table 16: FOI statistics for the reporting period Freedom of Information Melbourne Water is subject to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Vic) (FOI Act).

Our tenders include weighted criteria which supports delivery of  social and sustainable outcomes across prioritised SPF objectives.  Generally prioritised objectives are those covering opportunities  for Victorian Aboriginal people, women’s equality and safety,  opportunities for disadvantaged Victorians, and environmentally  sustainable outputs – all of these are aligned with our strategic  goals. For lower value purchases, we seek quotations from capable local  social enterprises, disability enterprises, or Aboriginal-owned  businesses. Major projects for infrastructure construction and maintenance  routinely seek social procurement commitments for measurable  outcomes as Key Performance Indicators, in many cases linked to  incentives for rewarding delivering commitments and increased  outcomes. Opportunities for Victorian Aboriginal people Our processes include securing social procurement commitments  to engage Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander owned businesses  under our major contracts for infrastructure construction and  maintenance, and directly purchasing from Aboriginal businesses.  Melbourne Water is a platinum member of Kinaway Aboriginal  Business Chamber of Commerce. In addition, under our Walking Country Together leadership  program we are engaged in funding and negotiating services with  Traditional Owners ranging from cultural services and research  through to engaging them for on-Country work. The Narrap Team  of the Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung Cultural Heritage Aboriginal  Corporation is regularly engaged on field service works for purposes  of natural resource management. In 2023-24, at a national level, Melbourne Water received 1,080  responses to requests for tender that were open to the market27,  four of which were from Aboriginal enterprises and three of which  were accepted. Women’s equality and safety In many procurements we undertake evaluations or seek  commitments that ensure suppliers to Melbourne Water have in  place best-practice gender equality strategies and family violence  policies.  The Building Equality Policy (BEP) has been applied to construction  projects value at $20 million or more since 2022. This sets  project-specific gender equality targets for employment and  training opportunities for women in non-traditional roles and the  implementation of Gender Equality Action Plans (GEAPs). Environmentally sustainable business practices and  environmentally sustainable outputs An increasing number of contracts for field services and for  construction work, include contractual clauses for use of  environmentally sustainable business practices.  Initiatives delivered by contractors that support circular economy  principles included use of recycled high-density polyethylene  corrugated drainage pipe, when the conventional design would be  concrete, and use of recycled crushed glass for embedment instead  of virgin mined sand. 27  This includes request for tender issued through Melbourne Water e-procurement systems but does not include tendering through Vendor Panel to suppliers listed on State  Purchase Contract (SPC) Registers and Panels, as quantitative data is not available for how many responses were received under SPCs.  ===== PAGE 176 ===== 174   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report SPF Objective SPF Outcome Reporting Metrics 2023-24 data Sustainable Victorian social  enterprises and Aboriginal business  sectors Purchasing from Aboriginal  businesses Number of Victorian Aboriginal businesses directly  engaged 9 suppliers engaged Total direct expenditure with Victorian Aboriginal  businesses (excl.

We have now lodged four consecutive Modern Slavery Statements  (2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023). The next Modern Slavery Statement  is due in December 2024, for the period ending 30 June 2024, and  will update our risks, actions taken to assess and address those  risks, effectiveness and progress.   Our most recent Modern Slavery Statement is available on the  Attorney-General’s Department website28.   Melbourne Water has a range of mitigating actions in place to  reduce risk of ethical workplace breaches or contributing to modern  slavery through its own operations or engagement with suppliers.   A key enabling action during 2023-24 was upgrading our Modern  Slavery Supplier Assessment tool to a cloud-based platform. This  supplier assessment tool was developed in conjunction with other  Australian Water Authorities in recognition of similarities in supply  chains.   28  https://modernslaveryregister.gov.au/statements/16506/ This tool is creating efficiencies in the gathering and assessment of  supplier responses – a process which aims to improve assessments  for modern slavery risks in the supply chain and better understand  how our Tier 1 suppliers are managing upstream risk. Melbourne  Water is targeting survey requests to suppliers operating in industry  segments with higher perceived supply chain risk.  Since introduction of the tool in late 2023, Melbourne Water has  achieved a 54 per cent response rate from 206 suppliers invited to  provide responses.  The next area of focus is on improving the effectiveness of modern  slavery risk assessments through the application into our third- party risk management framework, including a specific focus on  supply chain risk exposure.  Efforts are continuing to promote awareness of our responsibilities  through the implementation of policies and risk management  processes and by providing awareness training to employees.  ===== PAGE 179 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   177 APPENDIX C Appendix C – Bulk entitlements The Victorian Government introduced bulk water reforms on 1 July 2014. These reforms introduced a ‘source’ and ‘delivery’ bulk  entitlements model for Melbourne, with a seasonal determination process and rights to carry over unused water allocations from year to  year. The four systems currently supplying Melbourne (Thomson River, Yarra River, Silver and Wallaby creeks and Tarago and Bunyip rivers)  are collectively known as the Greater Yarra System – Thomson River Pool. Melbourne Water is assigned the source bulk entitlements to the Greater Yarra System – Thomson River Pool. The delivery bulk entitlements  to the Greater Yarra System – Thomson River Pool are assigned to Barwon Water, Gippsland Water, Greater Western Water, South East  Water, South Gippsland Water, Westernport Water and Yarra Valley Water (the ‘primary entitlement holders’ [PEHs]). As the storage manager for the Melbourne headworks system, Melbourne Water allocates water to the PEHs by making seasonal  determinations to them. Melbourne Water also has the storage manager functions specified in section 122ZL of the Water Act 1989 and the  obligations specified in bulk entitlements for the Melbourne headworks system, water from the Victorian Desalination Project and those  held by the Melbourne retailers in the Goulburn headwork system.

Table 19: Compliance with the Maribyrnong River Bulk Entitlement held by Melbourne Water APPENDIX C  ===== PAGE 182 ===== 180   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report To maintain our waterway health, Melbourne Water continues to enhance our compliance and enforcement capacity. In alignment  with the state government's commitment to a zero-tolerance approach towards water theft, we have implemented several  initiatives to ensure compliance with water diverter obligations. These initiatives include: •	 the appointment of two Authorised Water Officers  •	 the ability to issue penalty infringement notices for selected diversions offences resulting from the introduction of the Water  (Infringement) Regulations 2020 •	 a continued partnership with Fines Victoria for the management of issued PINs (fines) which helps with the fine collection,  reminder notices and enforcement of the fine if not complied with.  Private diversion licenses  Melbourne Water manages 1,810 licences to use water from farm dams and waterways in the Yarra River, Maribyrnong River, Stony  Creek, Kororoit Creek, Laverton Creek and Skeleton Creek catchments. Water is mainly used for agricultural, industrial, commercial,  domestic and stock purposes. The total number of ‘take and use’ licences (for uses such as irrigation) is 1,221 with a combined  volume of 33,496.23 megalitres.  Melbourne Water applies permanent management trigger and restriction conditions enacted under the Diversions Drought  Response Plan (A Water Sharing Plan for all Licenced Water Users) and licence conditions. Melbourne Water has not invoked  any additional drought response measures outside of the plan during 2023-24. The table below details the licence type, number,  volume and volume used for 2023-24. Compliance management  Melbourne Water has delegated power and functions to undertake compliance and enforcement activities under the Water Act 1989.  Following an independent compliance and enforcement review undertaken in 2020, Melbourne Water has been working with DEECA  to review and update compliance and enforcement strategies to ensure a coordinated, risk-based and consistent statewide approach to  compliance and enforcement activities.  Our Healthy Waterways Strategy and Stream Flow Management Plans provide guidance on our compliance and enforcement priorities,  which is further supported by our Compliance and Enforcement Statement. The Statement is available on our website29 and outlines our  approach to compliance and enforcement and was developed in line with DEECA’s Non-Urban Compliance and Enforcement Guidelines for  Water Corporations 2019.

During 2023-24, Melbourne Water continued to operationalise our Compliance and Enforcement Statement  by undertaking the following priority actions:  •	 implementing system improvements to assist with our  compliance and enforcement reporting capability and  increasing automation of reporting •	 upgrading meters to AS4747 meters as per our Meter Action  Plan •	 continuing the rollout of automated meter reading technology  to provide near-time access to water extraction data •	 continuing our communications campaign to build customer  understanding of the zero-tolerance approach to improving  compliance •	 building the capability of our staff to deliver a zero-tolerance  approach through additional training, including the Certificate  IV Government Investigations and Penalty Infringement  Notice Training and Customer Interaction training •	 Upgrading the Diversions Licencing database to improve fines  reporting efficiency for Auditor General requirements.  •	 appointing two Authorised Water Officers to support our  ongoing commitment to zero tolerance on water theft. •	 Participating in the DEECA-led Compliance Community  of Practice, Water Compliance Communications Working  Group, Authorised Officer Network, and Non-Urban Metering  Working Group. Compliance and enforcement actions  A summary of the investigations into non-compliances and their resolutions over the past three years is provided in Table 21.  Due to increased telemetry installations there will likely be continued increase in the number of potential breaches detected. Metering activities  Melbourne Water has a zero-tolerance approach to unauthorised water take and a risk-based approach to licence management. To support  this, we have developed and are delivering our Metering Action Plan, focused on continuing to improve the meter fleet with highly reliable  Australian Standard AS4747 compliant meters and telemetry to provide real-time water usage data to Melbourne Water and our customers.  This real-time data helps Melbourne Water with enforcement actions and strengthens our zero-tolerance approach. Rollout of our plan  is progressing ahead of schedule, and we anticipate being fully compliant with the implementation program of the Victorian Metering  Policy as 100 per cent of our active meter fleet have been upgraded to AS4747, which will be complemented by the installation of 260  telemetry devices on these meters by 2025 to reach this target. Our Non-Urban Metering Action Plan and its summary can be found on the  Melbourne Water website30.  ===== PAGE 184 ===== 182   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report 31 https://www.melbournewater.com.au/water-and-environment/water-management/waterway-diversions/water-use-compliance APPENDIX D Managing streamflow  Melbourne Water produces streamflow management plans, local management rules and a Drought Response Plan to document the way  water is managed to ensure it is shared fairly between diverters and the environment.  During 2023-24, Melbourne Water maintained streamflow management plans for seven stream systems in the Yarra catchment. The plans  aim to manage the water resources of the catchments, develop sustainable allocations for agriculture and other uses and maintain an  environmental water regime to sustain waterway health.  We are also working with Traditional Owners to better engage on roles and opportunities in the Stream Flow Management Plan process and  to build Traditional Owner cultural values into any future amendments to management plans. In 2023-24, Melbourne Water issued our first  cultural water licence to the Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung Cultural Heritage Aboriginal Corporation. Category  2023-24  1. AS4747 compliant meters  536  2.

The 822 Melbourne Water meters range in diameters from 25 to 450 millimetres in size, with most of the meters being in the 50  to 150-millimetre range. As of June 2024, we have 100 per cent of total required meter fleet compliant with AS4747 as per DEECA  requirements a year ahead of schedule.   Melbourne Water also undertakes meter validations as per AS4747. This is done on each waterway every three years by a Certified Meter  Validator. During 2023-24, there were approximately 221 meters validated on-site. In addition, Melbourne Water undertakes a program of  regular maintenance of meters, including regular inspections. Public information and education campaigns  To inform customers and promote our zero-tolerance approach to water theft, Melbourne Water continues several initiatives, including  developing a compliance and enforcement web page, adding zero tolerance to water theft banners on invoices, having a compliance focus  for the annual StreamNews newsletter, our officers in the field having conversations with customers and creating four fact sheets. These  documents can be assessed on the Melbourne Water website31.

In addition, during drought or low flow conditions, licenced diverters’ access to water may be restricted or banned to protect the  environment. Our Drought Response Plan is always active and specifies how water is shared when there is not enough to meet all users’  needs. It states river flow levels which trigger restrictions or bans and how these are applied to different licence types.  These trigger points have been developed together with stream flow management plans or local management rules or plans.  The status of restrictions and bans for individual catchments is posted daily on Melbourne Water's website32 and is available by calling  Melbourne Water on 131 722 during business hours or via an automated SMS services to subscribed customers.  During 2023-24, we sent over 1,563 text messages to 279 subscribed customers advising them of waterway pumping restrictions and/or  bans.  ===== PAGE 186 ===== 184   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report Statewide key performance indicators Unauthorised take performance is reported against statewide key performance indicators being:  •	 no more than 1 per cent of volume of total water take is taken without authorisation at any time  •	 no more than 3 per cent of accounts are to be in negative at any time.

APPENDIX D  ===== PAGE 187 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   185 APPENDIX E Appendix E – Port Phillip and Westernport  Catchment Condition Report 2023-24 This section of the Annual Report provides an assessment of the  condition and management of the region’s environment and a  reflection on the likely impact of annual scale actions, events, and  observed change within the previous year and over the previous  three years. A key purpose of monitoring changes in the operating  context is to help identify opportunities for adapting and changing  the way we manage the environment.   The report is structured in line with the statewide outcome  framework that links the regional outcomes sought by catchment  communities, to the high-level policy outcomes of the Victorian  Government and Australian Government. These are outlined in  each Regional Catchment Strategy (RCS) (www.rcs.vic.gov.au).  In 2023-24 reporting focused on assessing the Catchment  Management Authority’s (CMA) contribution to the management  of land and water resources. Reporting on condition indicators will  be undertaken as part of the mid-term and final reviews of the RCS.    How to interpret this report   The assessment is based on a set of statewide indicators outlined  in the RCS outcomes framework, augmented with regionally- specific indicators selected based on criteria, including availability  and quality of data, and the linkages back to regional and policy  outcomes.   Three types of indicators make up catchment condition and  management reporting: contextual, management and condition.   Contextual indicators help to identify how external environmental  factors may have influenced program delivery. The management  assessment for each theme assesses the delivery of CMA programs  and activities.   Reporting on management and contextual indicators is undertaken  annually.  Reporting on condition indicators is undertaken less frequently,  reflecting the timeframes to observe changes in the natural  environment and the availability of the supporting data. The  2023-24 Annual Report includes a summary rating for catchment  condition, building on previous years' assessments.   As much as possible, the reporting format attempts to provide a  transparent path between the evidence and the assessment. The  assessment is not definitive but applies to a point in time, based on  the best available evidence. Condition  rating# Description Good The condition is classified as good Moderate The condition is classified as moderate Poor The condition is classified as poor Not applicable A condition rating is not applicable for this indicator  Management  rating* Description Above  expectations  Delivery of activities and programs associated with  this indicator is assessed as above expectations for the  12-month period (i.e. majority of activities delivered/ targets were met or exceeded)   Satisfactory  Delivery of activities and programs associated with  this indicator is assessed as satisfactory for the  12-month period (i.e. targets for some activities were  not achieved or the majority were almost achieved)   Below  expectations  Delivery of activities and programs associated with  this indicator is assessed as below expectations for the  12-month period (i.e. some critical activities/targets  were not delivered, or the majority of activities/ targets were not delivered)   Not applicable  A management rating is not applicable for this  indicator  Unknown  The rating for this indicator is not known or assessable  6-year  condition  trend rating*  Description The condition is moving in a positive direction over the  short to medium term pending ongoing management  and environmental impacts.  The condition is in a neutral state over the short to  medium term, and is considered relatively stable  pending ongoing management and environmental  impacts.  The condition is cause for concern over the short to  medium term, and will continue to decline pending  ongoing management and environmental impacts.  # Condition - where appropriate, a condition rating is provided  that is based on the current state of the theme.  A condition rating  is based on assessments of the assets and pressures represented  by the theme. The assessment is based on available science, expert  advice and evidence gained during the preceding year.   The 6-year trend reflects change in condition over the short to  medium term of the condition. The trend is assessed against the  direction required to contribute to the achievement of regional  outcomes.  *Management - where appropriate, a management rating is  provided that is based on the delivery of planned activities and  targets relevant to the theme.   ===== PAGE 188 ===== 186   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report APPENDIX E Theme  Condition  Management  Summary Comment*  Condition  rating Trend  rating Water (for the environment) Poor Not applicable Water for the environment is assessed as poor and the trend is concerned.  Our reliance on rivers and dams in the Port Phillip and Westernport  region to provide most of our water supplies has come at a cost to the  environment and to Traditional Owners and has also affected recreational  uses of waterways.  Long-term water availability for the environment and river health is  declining. Significant additional volumes of environmental water are  required to avoid irreversible declines in river health, ensure the survival of  native species and the health of water ecosystems33.  The CGRSWS, released by DEECA in 2022, aims to improve water efficiency  and use of manufactured water by returning river water to Traditional  Owners and the environment. The targets set in the Healthy Waterways  Strategy are supported by the CGRSWS, which aims to return a total of  31.3 gigalitres to rivers across the region by 203234. Water (environmental flow  compliance)  Not  applicable  Not  applicable  Satisfactory  A high level of environmental flow compliance was achieved for the Yarra  and Tarago systems (as per targets set out in the Seasonal Watering Plan  2023-24). In the Werribee and Maribyrnong Rivers, ‘critical’ summer and  autumn targets were met. Water (wetlands extent)  Poor  Not applicable  Wetland extent is considered poor, and the trend is concerned. Many of the  region’s wetlands have been modified for urban settlement and agriculture.  Similarly, wetlands have been drained and modified to improve access, land  availability, flooding control and amenity.  Many inner Melbourne and coastal suburbs have been built on ‘reclaimed’  wetlands, and encroaching urban development continues to pose a threat  to ephemeral wetlands33. Melbourne Water continues to amplify efforts to ensure sufficient  protections are in place for natural wetlands, including strengthening urban  planning and policy processes and natural wetland information.  In 2022-23, progress was made in a research collaboration between  Melbourne Water, Melbourne University and Deakin University to develop  wetland habitat suitability models to improve our understanding of how  best to support habitat for frogs and wetland birds. Protection of seasonal  herbaceous wetlands features as an action in the RCS’s Natural Resource  Management Strategy Action Plan and considerable progress has been  made to develop a natural wetland protection framework and tool35. Water (wetlands  vegetation)  Poor  Not applicable  The condition of wetland vegetation is currently considered poor (low)  within the Werribee, Maribyrnong, Yarra and Dandenong catchments.  Wetland vegetation is considered moderate within the Westernport  catchment. The trend is concerned.  Implementing programs to improve wetland buffers, vegetation condition  and water regime is predicted to improve the vegetation value scores in the  region35. 2023-24 Catchment condition and management report 33 Refer to the Port Phillip and Western Port Regional Catchment Strategy: https://portphillipwesternport.rcs.vic.gov.au/ 34 Refer to the Central and Gippsland Region Sustainable Water Strategy: https://www.water.vic.gov.au/our-programs/long-term-water-resource-assessments-and-strategies/ sustainable-water-strategies/central-and-gipps-sws 35 Refer to the Healthy Waterways Strategy: https://healthywaterways.com.au/  ===== PAGE 189 =====  2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report   |   187 APPENDIX E Theme  Condition  Management  Summary Comment*  Condition  rating Trend  rating Water (extent of protected  or improved riparian land  (ha)) Not  applicable  Not  applicable  Satisfactory  Over 10,800 hectares of vegetation was maintained in 2022-23 and the  Yarra, Werribee and Dandenong catchments are all well on their way to  managing the areas required to maintain good habitat quality. However,  the Maribyrnong catchment is slightly off-track, and Westernport is  significantly off-track, particularly for managing areas of high-quality  vegetation. Some of this result is due to the need to increase the area of  vegetation we manage each year; finding ways to work safely in remote  areas where high quality vegetation occurs has been challenging36. Land (soil health)  Good  Not applicable  The condition of soil health in the region is good and the trend is neutral.  The condition and trends of soil health using parameters such as soil  acidity (pH), phosphorous and nitrogen levels, soil salinity, soil compaction  and microbial health have not been systematically recorded and mapped  at landscape level. As a result, the percentage of exposed soil is used  as a proxy for broad soil health and vulnerability assessment. Data has  been collected and mapped nationally through the Australian National  University. The data shows the proportion of exposed soil across the region  over the past 20 years has been steady at between 10 and 15 per cent. This  is relatively low when compared nationally37. Land (area of improved  Agricultural Practices (ha))  Not  applicable  Not  applicable  Below  expectations  Currently, Melbourne Water receives no funding to improve agricultural  practices in the region. In future years, it is expected that Melbourne Water  will deliver against this indicator based on National Heritage Trust funding.  Coast and Marine  (vegetation)  Unknown  Unknown  Not applicable  The condition of the coastal vegetation has been assessed as unknown  and the trend is unknown. The current environmental condition of the  region’s coasts is variable. Some areas retain high environmental values,  while others have been heavily modified by urban development, coastal  settlement and recreational use.  In developing the Port Phillip and Westernport RCS, the region’s coast has  been divided into 11 zones delineated by significant changes in coastal  characteristics and/or environmental values and where it is sensible to  attach tailored environmental targets. Increased and ongoing vegetation  surveys of these zones are required to determine trends and conditions  conditions37. Coast and Marine  (vegetation, pest herbivore  and predator control and  weed control [ha]) Not  applicable  Not  applicable  Below  expectations  Melbourne Water continues to work with key stakeholders to restore  estuarine and marine ecosystems within Westernport Bay, including  mangrove restoration. Melbourne Water is planning major uplift in these programs over the  coming years through the Environmental Contribution 6 (EC6) waterway  health program. Coast and Marine (water  quality)  Good  Not applicable  Coast and marine water quality has been assessed as good and the trend  is positive. The EPAV has six monitoring locations in Port Phillip Bay.  Conditions in Port Phillip Bay have remained relatively consistent since  2002, with overall water quality fluctuating between good to very good.  Riverine inputs, particularly nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus,  highly influence water quality in the northern part of the bay. However,  mixing with oceanic waters from Bass Strait and the natural recycling of  nutrients in the sediments maintain good water quality.  The EPAV has two monitoring locations in Westernport. While rainfall  can temporarily decrease water quality, conditions in Westernport have  generally remained consistent since 2000. The small catchment inflow  volumes and mixing with Bass Strait help to maintain good water quality in  Westernport38. 37 Refer to the Port Phillip and Western Port Regional Catchment Strategy: https://portphillipwesternport.rcs.vic.gov.au/ 38 Refer to the Environment Protection Authority Victoria Annual Report Card: https://www.epa.vic.gov.au/for-community/monitoring-your-environment/monitoring-victorias- water-quality/report-card  ===== PAGE 190 ===== 188   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report 2023-24 Catchment condition and management report (continued) Theme  Condition  Management  Summary Comment*  Condition  rating Trend  rating Biodiversity (native  vegetation)  Poor  Not applicable  The condition of native vegetation in the region is poor and the trend  is concerned. Before European settlement, approximately 1.28 million  hectares was covered by diverse vegetation such as rainforest, woodlands,  grasslands, heaths and marshes. Today, due to historical pressures such as  land clearing and urban encroachment, an estimated 541,812 hectares of  native vegetation remains (around 42 per cent of the region). A number of  the ecological vegetation classes have been severely depleted in this region,  including Plains Grassland, Plains Grassy Woodland and Box Ironbark  Forest39. Biodiversity (native animals)  Poor  Not applicable  The condition of native animals is poor and the trend is concerned. Over  the past 200 years, this region was home to an estimated 627 species of  native fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals and many smaller  animal species such as insects. However, the diversity of native animal  species has declined due to habitat loss, pest predation and other factors.  This decline is indicated by an analysis of animal sighting data that  calculated the probability that each species of native fish, amphibians,  reptiles, birds and mammals was persisting in the Local Areas of this region  at the end of 2016.  In addition, a review of Victoria’s threatened species list, completed by  DEECA in 2021, found that an estimated 159 species of native animals  known to occur in this region since 1980 are listed as threatened39. Melbourne Water is renewing its Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan  (BCAP) to embed biodiversity conservation. The renewed plan will also  expand on prioritising biodiversity assets and values within the National  Resource Management Action Plan recently developed for the Australian  Government. The BCAP will be important for Melbourne Water to support  prudent and efficient investment decisions, enabling investment for the  best possible biodiversity outcomes for the Port Phillip and Westernport  Region and community. Biodiversity (vegetation,  pest herbivore and predator  control and weed control  [ha])  Not  applicable  Not  applicable  Satisfactory  In 2023-24, Melbourne Water collaborated with Parks Victoria to control  feral goats on French Island and continued to lead efforts to eradicate  feral cats from French Island through collaborative partnerships with  Parks Victoria and French Island Landcare. Melbourne Water continues to  support community groups, and land managers to reduce the impacts of  environmental weeds across the region.

Reporting on condition indicators is undertaken less frequently, therefore the 2023-24 Annual Report  includes a summary rating for catchment condition building on previous years' assessments. APPENDIX E Theme  Condition  Management  Summary Comment*  Condition  rating Trend  rating Community  Good  Above  expectations  The community condition is good and the trend is positive. Communities  across the Port Phillip and Westernport region provide an immense pool  of knowledge, skills, services and funds that play a vital role in achieving a  better environment for the region.  At the end of 2020-21, there were 85 Landcare groups, 13 Landcare  networks and one council-hosted natural resource management network  in the region. Approximately 500 other community environmental  groups are active in the region, such as Friends of groups, Coastcare and  Committees of Management, and many part-Landcare networks. These  groups significantly benefit local areas and communities and collectively  contribute substantially to improving environmental outcomes. In the 2021-22 Victorian Landcare Group Health Survey, 94 groups in  the region reported 85,329 volunteer hours, equating to a value of $3.53  million in economic contribution to environmental volunteering based on a  value of $41.72 an hour. Integrated catchment  management Good  Above  expectations  Partnerships and Integrated Catchment Management (ICM) has been  assessed as good and the trend is positive.  In 2022-23, 22 formal partnerships (including partnerships with Traditional  Owners) were established or maintained between organisations and  individuals under Melbourne Water CMA initiatives through state and  federal government funded programs.  In 2023-24, Melbourne Water also developed an ICM pilot for the Watts  River Sub-catchment. The pilot demonstrates the benefit of undertaking  place-based and holistic catchment planning and delivery and identifies  the opportunities generated through collaboration and coordination of  multiple partner, agency and community activities.  ===== PAGE 192 ===== 190   |   2023-24 Melbourne Water Annual Report Appendix F – Environmental Disclosures  Emissions and energy Organisational boundary Melbourne Water calculates and reports on its energy and  emissions data in accordance with the NGER (Measurement)  Determination 2008.

Of these, 64 per cent are goods vehicles used for operational purposes and 29 per cent are passenger  vehicles for transporting staff to the wide variety of sites that Melbourne Water operate. In the last year, our percentage of passenger  vehicles that are battery electric vehicles or Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles has increased from 30 per cent to 43 per cent, as we continue  our journey to a low carbon emission fleet. This year we expanded the boundary of our disclosures to also include our non-road transport  vehicles which can be categorised as agricultural, excavation and marine.

This method has been used as waste  and water data at our corporate office was identified as having  the highest data confidence across our portfolio of sites and also  has the highest percentage of FTE. Melbourne Water is currently  exploring new methods of reliable and accurate water and waste  data capture across other sites in our portfolio.  Water consumption There has been an increase in water consumption between 2022- 23 and 2023-24. This can be attributed to a year-on-year increase  in total FTE, specifically including a headcount increase of almost  150 people at our corporate office, which serves as the basis for our  water consumption data. Indicator 2023-24 2022-23 Total potable water consumption by Melbourne Water (kilolitres) 707.8 519.5 Total FTE 1324.1 1204.4 Units of metered water consumed normalised by FTE 0.535 0.683 Waste and recycling There has been a noticeable reduction is waste disposal including a decrease in the amount of waste disposed to landfill proportionate to  the amount of waste recycled. Note 1: Melbourne Water currently only has dedicated collection services at our corporate office building at 990 La Trobe St. This represents 6 per cent of our 17 office sites. Note 2: An error was identified in the 2022-23 prior year disclosure of scope 3 waste disposal emissions, which has been amended in this report. It was previously disclosed that the  2022-23 result was 1286 t CO2-e. However, it was found that this was utilising a scope 1 emissions factor which resulted in a significantly higher and erroneous result.
