About  ===== PAGE 5 ===== 5 Further Information Financial Report Directors’ Report Governance About Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report  ===== PAGE 6 ===== 6 Americas ~15% EMEA ~15% Asia ~21% ANZ ~49% Macquarie (MGL and its subsidiaries,  the Consolidated Entity) is a global  financial services group with offices  in 34 markets.  Macquarie now employs over 20,600(1) people  globally across 34 markets. (1)	 This figure includes staff employed in certain operationally segregated subsidiaries (OSS). Unless otherwise stated, further  references to staff data and policies do not include those in OSS.  ===== PAGE 7 ===== 7 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Directors’ Report Governance About Macquarie Group Limited (MGL, the Company) is listed in Australia and is regulated by the Australian Prudential  Regulation Authority (APRA), the Australian banking regulator, as a Non-Operating Holding Company (NOHC)  of Macquarie Bank Limited (MBL), an authorised deposit-taking institution (ADI). Macquarie’s activities are also  subject to supervision by various other regulatory agencies around the world.  Founded in 1969, Macquarie now employs over 20,600(1) people  globally, has total assets of $A403.4 billion and total equity of  $A34.0 billion as at 31 March 2024. Macquarie’s breadth of expertise covers asset management,  retail and business banking, wealth management, leasing and  asset financing, market access, commodity trading, renewables  development, specialist advice, access to capital and principal  investment. The diversity of our operations, combined with a  strong capital position and robust risk management framework, has  contributed to Macquarie’s 55-year record of unbroken profitability. Macquarie works with government, institutional, corporate and  retail clients and counterparties around the world, providing a  diversified range of products and services. We have established  leading market positions as a global specialist in a wide range  of sectors, including renewables, infrastructure, resources,  commodities and energy. Alignment of interests is a longstanding feature of Macquarie’s  client-focused business, demonstrated by our willingness to both  invest alongside clients and closely align the interests of our  shareholders and staff. FY2024 profit $A3,522m About Macquarie   1969 2024  ===== PAGE 8 ===== 8 Letter from the Chair Macquarie Group delivered a profit of $A3,522 million  in FY2024, a decline from the exceptional results  of the previous two years. The volatility in global  energy markets that had previously increased  customer demand for services and presented trading  opportunities gave way to much quieter conditions,  and hence lower earnings for the Commodities and  Global Markets business. For much of the year, less  active financial markets also constrained other areas  of the Company’s business, particularly in Macquarie  Asset Management. As long-term investments in  growth paid off, Banking and Financial Services and  Macquarie Capital both generated higher profits  than last year. Shemara’s letter gives a more detailed  account of performance during the year. The company earned a return on shareholders’ funds for the year  of 10.8%, a bit below the level Macquarie typically seeks to achieve.  Over the past five years, Macquarie has earned around 15% for  shareholders on average.  Increases in headcount and in the broader cost base have been  difficult to avoid in recent years given the extent of business  growth, the volume of project work and particularly the increase  in regulatory requirements. As some of these projects now deliver  planned productivity benefits, management has heightened its  focus on costs and is working to ensure value for shareholders.  The global economy appears to have stabilised after the  disturbances of the immediate post-COVID period, and inflation  has declined. Low inflation is not yet assured, however, and the  prospects for interest rates are unclear.  Macquarie remains well placed to respond to opportunities – and  to manage the associated risks – thanks to the diversity of our  businesses, enduring client franchises, a strong balance sheet and  our disciplined approach to risk management. Macquarie remains  well placed to respond  to opportunities and  manage the associated  risks, thanks to  the diversity of our  businesses, enduring  client franchises, strong  balance sheet and  disciplined approach to  risk management.” Letter from the Chair  ===== PAGE 9 ===== 9 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Directors’ Report Governance About Environmental Social and Governance Macquarie issued its second Net Zero and Climate Risk Report in late  2023. We continue to manage on balance sheet lending and equity  exposures in line with our Net Zero Banking Alliance commitments.  In addition, and probably more significantly, we continued to  support the development of clean energy infrastructure, with  110 GW of clean energy capacity in development, construction, or  operation at the end of FY2024.(2) With global emissions still increasing, despite the rapid increase in  renewable capacity, the global and local conversation about climate  change has become more nuanced, and more challenging, as the  full magnitude of the decarbonisation challenge becomes apparent.   Recent experience highlights that fossil fuels, particularly natural  gas, will be required for quite some time to come, even as the trend  to renewables continues. While financial institutions have an important role to play in  marshalling financial resources for the transitions their clients are  seeking to make, the carbon intensity of financial portfolios can only  decline by as much, and as fast, as the underlying physical capital  stock of economies is able to decarbonise. That will be determined  mainly by non-financial factors – technological advancements,  government policies, the supply of skilled labour and of other  necessary capacity. Within its field of influence and capability, and with around 20  years’ experience in advancing climate solutions, Macquarie is  well-positioned to continue playing a constructive role as a financier,  adviser, investor and fiduciary. We expect this to be to the benefit  of shareholders. New workplaces Technological change is challenging conventional notions of the  way work is done. Yet the physical workplace is still important as  a place to come together, to collaborate, innovate and to advance  professional development.  Macquarie has continued to invest in our physical workplaces  around the world. This year sees the opening of our new global  headquarters in Sydney, part of an ambitious project that integrates  a major interchange for the city’s new Metro transport system  with two state-of-the-art office buildings and a regenerated public  space. The project is one of Macquarie’s largest balance sheet  infrastructure undertakings to date and is a prime example of how  we connect capital with community need.  Board Changes Nicola Wakefield Evans retired from the Board in February 2024,  having served for ten years. Nicola made an important contribution  to Macquarie both in her career as a professional lawyer and as  a Director, including for over seven years as Chair of the Board  Governance and Compliance Committee, a responsibility that has  now been taken on by Rebecca McGrath.

GW of green energy assets reflect 100% generating capacity  of each asset, not the proportion owned or managed by Macquarie. During the year, Susan Lloyd-Hurwitz joined the MGL and MBL  Boards as an independent director. Susan brings with her significant  expertise in the global investment and real estate sectors and is  already making a valued contribution. The process of appointing Bank-only Non-Executive Directors  (BONDs) to the MBL Board was completed with the appointment  of David Whiteing in September 2023 and Wayne Byres in February  2024. Both bring highly valued skills and experience to the  MBL board.  As previously advised, Michael Coleman will retire from the MBL  Board after a two-year term as a BOND, expected by mid-2024.  Michael has been associated with Macquarie as a Director for  12 years including nine years as Chair of the Audit Committee.  We thank him for his exemplary service.  Capital and Dividends  The company finished the year in a strong position, with the Bank  Group posting a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of over 13% on  an APRA basis, and with surplus capital at the MGL level. The Board  declared a final dividend of $A3.85 per share, making for a total  dividend of $A6.40 per share for the full year. This was in keeping  with the Board’s longstanding policy of paying between 50 and 70  per cent of earnings in dividends. In November 2023, the Board also approved an on-market  buy-back for Macquarie Group shares of up to $A2 billion. As at  31 March 2024, $A644 million had been purchased under this  program. This decision returns more of the exceptional returns of  FY2022 and FY2023 to shareholders. It remains for me to thank my colleagues on the Board, and the staff  and management of Macquarie, for their efforts in a challenging  year. This is a high-performing team that remains focused on  delivering the best possible results for shareholders.  Finally, your Directors thank you, the owners of Macquarie, for your  ongoing support. Glenn Stevens AC  Independent Director and Chair Sydney  3 May 2024  ===== PAGE 10 ===== 10 Letter from the Managing Director  and CEO Despite ongoing economic uncertainty and subdued  market conditions in many parts of the world,  Macquarie’s client franchises remained resilient over  the last year, with continued client growth, fundraising  and new business origination across the group as we  delivered our 55th consecutive year of profitability  since inception.  With the relevant expertise and agility to respond to changes in  market conditions and support our clients, our diversified portfolio of  businesses continued to invest in structural themes driving long-term  growth around the world. Our people partnered with our clients and  communities as they navigated and adapted to uncertainty, identifying  and realising new opportunities guided by our purpose and principles  and supported by our proven risk management framework and  distinct culture. For the year ended 31 March 2024, in what was a period of transition  for some of our businesses against a backdrop of less active markets,  Macquarie delivered net profit after tax of $A3,522 million, down 32%  on a record prior year, with all four of our operating groups delivering  solid net profit contributions. Banking and Financial Services (BFS) delivered a record net profit  contribution of $A1,241 million, up 3% from $A1,201 million in FY2023.  BFS benefitted from growth in the loan portfolio and BFS deposits,  and credit and other impairment reversals primarily reflecting an  improvement in the macroeconomic outlook. This was partially  offset by margin compression, higher employment expenses and  technology investment to support portfolio growth, compliance and  regulatory requirements. Commodities and Global Markets (CGM) delivered a net profit  contribution of $A3,213 million, down 47% from a record $A6,007  million in FY2023. Despite an environment characterised by much  lower levels of market volatility, CGM delivered revenues at a similar  level to the strong performance of FY2022, demonstrating ongoing  growth and resilience in the client franchise. The result reflected a lower  contribution from Commodities and Asset Finance, partially offset by  stronger performance in Financial Markets. Macquarie Asset Management (MAM) delivered a net profit contribution  of $A1,208 million, down 48% from $A2,342 million in FY2023. The  decrease was driven by lower asset realisations in green investments  and increased net expenditure in investments in the green energy  portfolio as it continues its transition into a fiduciary business. Base and  performance fees were broadly in line with the prior year. Macquarie Capital delivered a net profit contribution of $A1,051 million,  up 31% from $A801 million in FY2023. The increase was driven by  higher investment-related income driven by growth in the private credit  portfolio, lower credit provisions and net reversals of impairments,  partially offset by lower net gains on investments, lower advisory  income and higher operating expenses. This report provides examples of key areas of activity across Macquarie  in FY2024, and explains how, by empowering people to innovate and  invest for a better future, our teams continue to create value for our  clients, communities, shareholders and each other.  Our people partnered  with our clients and  communities as they  navigated and adapted to  uncertainty, identifying  and realising new  opportunities guided  by our purpose and  principles and supported  by our proven risk  management framework  and distinct culture.” Letter from the Managing Director and CEO  ===== PAGE 11 ===== 11 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Directors’ Report Governance About Advancing climate solutions Despite the more challenging macroeconomic backdrop, last year saw  record levels of investment in clean energy and in the deployment  of clean technology to reduce broad-based emissions, supported by  transformative government policy, investment incentives and investor  appetite in major markets around the world. While certain sub-sectors of the climate response were affected  by higher levels of inflation and supply chain constraints, and some  governments scaled back their most ambitious climate pledges,  long-term momentum supporting the energy transition persists. At Macquarie, we are using our deep expertise to develop, construct,  finance and manage practical solutions to climate change across six  continents. We are investing in renewable energy solutions at scale,  supporting the next wave of climate technologies, working with clients  and portfolio companies on their decarbonisation ambitions, and  investing in nature, adaptation and resilience. Our longstanding view remains that a managed glidepath to deliver an  orderly energy transition is the best long-term solution to the energy  trilemma of availability, affordability, and emissions.  A culture of entrepreneurialism By balancing entrepreneurial spirit with operational discipline, actively  seeking out and involving the contribution of others, and applying  expertise and skills, our people generate new ideas that support our  clients and communities through constantly changing times, while also  managing risks and being accountable for the outcomes they deliver. I  am proud of the many ways that our people have stepped up to support  our clients in navigating changing and challenging times.  As geopolitical tensions have escalated over recent years, very real  and often tragic human impacts have been exacerbated by the greater  uncertainty inflicted on the economic environment. Addressing the key  opportunities and challenges the world faces requires the imagination,  ideas and innovation that emerge when you collaborate and bring  together diverse points of view. We work hard to maintain a culture  that empowers people to identify and realise opportunity, and supports  them to learn, achieve and succeed. Opportunities in new technologies Macquarie is committed to investing in and making generative AI  technologies available to our people to unlock productivity, enhance  creativity and improve outcomes, ultimately enhancing the experiences  of our clients and the community. In FY2024, we piloted a range of  Generative AI products and commenced the rollout of enterprise tools  to help our staff with everyday activities. Our businesses continue to  explore targeted solutions in their areas. Through a strong focus on AI  governance and risk management, we have the guardrails in place to  protect our people, our business and our clients. Investing in our communities  and our workplaces  A founding principle of Macquarie is creating value for the communities  in which we operate by using our expertise to address areas of unmet  need, and each of our businesses seeks to do this across their areas  of focus.  As a global leader in the infrastructure sector, we develop and manage  essential assets that connect communities around the world. This  includes creating, investing in, and operating assets across the energy,  utility, transportation, digital, waste management and social sectors.  In 2024, we will open our new global headquarters in the heart of  Sydney, which has drawn on our team’s skillsets across a complex urban,  multi-sector development. Part of a new integrated transport and  community precinct being delivered in partnership with the New South  Wales Government, the project will provide a place for people to come  together, facilitate interaction across communities and deliver shared  value to all. This will be followed by the opening of our new regional headquarters  for the Americas at 660 Fifth Avenue in New York, coinciding with our  30th anniversary of operating in the region. Management changes After 28 years with Macquarie and five years as Group Head,  Nicholas O’Kane stepped down as Head of CGM and from  Macquarie’s Executive Committee, on 27 February 2024. Simon Wright,  who was Global Head of CGM’s Financial Markets division and has been  with Macquarie for 35 years, became Group Head, joining the Executive  Committee on 1 April 2024.  I would like to thank Nick for his significant contribution to CGM and  Macquarie more broadly. He leaves a team and business that is very  well-positioned for the future, and I look forward to continuing to work  with Simon to build on CGM’s success. External outlook Market conditions are likely to remain challenging for some time,  making forecasting difficult. While we haven’t provided overall guidance  for the 2025 financial year, factors impacting our client franchises in the  short-term outlook are outlined further in this report. Macquarie remains well-positioned to deliver superior performance  for our clients, communities and shareholders in the medium term  due to Macquarie’s diversification, businesses that lead in their niches,  and our combination of global knowledge and local expertise. These  are supported by a strong and conservative balance sheet, ongoing  investment in our operating platform, flexibility to allocate capital,  and our proven risk management framework and culture.  On behalf of senior management, we would like to thank Macquarie’s  staff for their work and dedication. As a services business, our people  are one of our greatest strengths and our success over the past  55 years has been driven their expertise, commitment and ideas. Such  success would not be possible without the support of our clients and  shareholders, for which the Macquarie team is extremely grateful.

By empowering people – our colleagues, clients, communities, shareholders and partners – we seek to  achieve our shared potential. Unlocking capital and ideas, we create investment opportunities while helping facilitate economic activity,  address unmet community needs and advance long-term prosperity. We are custodians of businesses and  infrastructure that underpin economies  and communities around the world and are  relied on by hundreds of millions of people  every day. Through long-term investment, we  maintain, upgrade and build assets in energy,  transportation, technology, social infrastructure  and utilities. We connect communities with capital and  innovation to meet the growing demands of  population growth, changing demographics  and the opportunities in digitalisation. Our  specialist teams in each region work with  clients and partners to respond to common  challenges, helping meet the specific needs of  local communities. We offer solutions to help clients navigate  diverse energy, critical mineral and other  commodity markets, develop new approaches  to accelerate their energy transition, and  help communities decarbonise through the  deployment of green energy technologies. We bring more choice and innovation to retail  financial services in Australia. From everyday  banking to investing, growing a business or  buying a home, we support our customers  through key moments in their lives.  ===== PAGE 14 ===== 14 Investing in world-class workplaces  Our workplaces are designed to inspire innovation and learning,  reinforce our culture, and empower our people, customers and  communities to connect and collaborate. We respond to the  changing needs of our business and create equitable workplace  environments that have a positive impact on the community. In the  past two years we have opened new or refurbished offices in Hong  Kong, Houston, Seoul, Melbourne, Milan, Paris, Santiago and Tokyo. In the coming months, we will open our new global headquarters at  1 Elizabeth Street in the centre of Sydney, as part of our delivery of  the new Metro Martin Place station and surrounding precinct. Our  existing heritage 50 Martin Place building has been integrated with  the new development, bringing our Sydney teams together in one  campus for the first time in 25 years.  This will be followed by the opening of our new Americas  headquarters at 660 Fifth Avenue in New York, aligned with the 30th anniversary of operating in the region and demonstrating  our ongoing commitment to and growth in this dynamic part of  the world. Through a focus on creating efficient, sustainable and inclusive  spaces and infrastructure with the latest technology, our  workplaces support the future growth and globally connected  culture of our businesses and our clients. Both our new Sydney  and New York offices have been designed with a dual focus on  sustainability and wellbeing. Each is designed to be 100% electric  in normal operations, maximise direct access to natural light and  views, provide landscaped outdoor areas, optimise indoor air  quality, and offer dedicated end-of-trip facilities. The 1 Elizabeth  Street, Sydney building has achieved a 6-Star Green Star Design  rating, and the 660 Fifth Avenue, New York project’s design is  targeting a LEED Gold Rating.  ===== PAGE 15 ===== 15 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Directors’ Report Governance About Delivering essential infrastructure Around the world we create, invest in and operate assets that underpin economic and social activity, working  with governments and communities to unlock the capital and specialist expertise required to maintain, upgrade  and build the infrastructure of the future. Through its investment in National Gas, MAM is supporting the safe, secure and reliable transportation of gas  across the UK and working with partners to future-proof the energy system. As well as maintaining a safe, secure  and reliable source of energy for over 23 million homes, it’s helping create a next-generation transmission system  capable of transporting low-carbon gases. CGM has played a pivotal role supporting UK energy providers in the transition to smart meters – a crucial  enabler of more efficient energy networks by giving consumers and businesses real-time access to their energy  usage data. Over the past 20 years, we have grown to become one of the largest independent meter asset  providers in the UK, with just under 8 million owned and managed smart meters. Macquarie Capital is delivering community connectivity through investments and partnerships in digital  infrastructure projects. These include Onivia, Spain’s first independent fibre network operator, which is  investing in high-speed internet access, supporting the government’s agenda to accelerate the country’s digital  transformation. In India, through its investment in network infrastructure provider CloudExtel, Macquarie Capital  is helping to improve the coverage, capacity and speed of data connectivity in local communities.  As governments around the world tackle widespread residential real estate shortages, we are supporting the  delivery of new affordable, social and specialist disability accommodation. In the UK, MAM has established  Goodstone Living, a specialist residential  investment manager and developer with  almost 900 new energy-efficient homes under  construction. It has also supported a housing  association’s investment in its property  portfolio to meet current safety and energy  efficiency standards. Meanwhile in Australia,  MAM portfolio company Local is aiming to  create over 5,000 build-to-rent apartments at  affordable rental levels by 2026.(3) In Australia and New Zealand, Macquarie Capital  is working with Kinetic, an industry leader in the  electrification of bus fleets and depot networks.  Through an infrastructure debt repositioning,  it is supporting Kinetic to meet its ambitious  growth pipeline and decarbonisation goals,  including replacing diesel buses with zero  emission vehicles.  (3)	 ‘Integrating impact housing in Australian build-to-rent developments’, Macquarie.  ===== PAGE 16 ===== 16 Advancing  climate solutions 2023 was more challenging for the energy  transition as new projects faced inflationary  and supply chain pressures. Nonetheless,  global investment reached $US1.8 trillion,  an increase of 17% on the previous year.(4) During FY2024, we extended our activities  in supporting the scale-up of established  technologies, such as wind and solar, while  also investing in less mature technologies,  including green fuels.  MAM’s global offshore wind platform, Corio  Generation – named Offshore Developer  of the Year at the 2023 Wind Investment  Awards, progressed its development pipeline. Its two UK-based  projects, Outer Dowsing and the West of Orkney Wind Farm,  submitted offshore planning applications, with the West of Orkney  project being the first ScotWind project to achieve this milestone.(5)  MAM also launched Aula Energy, a new Australasia-focused  renewables platform created with an initial onshore wind  development pipeline of ~4GW of capacity. During the year, Macquarie Capital acquired ONYX Insight, a leading  provider of wind turbine performance analytics and condition-based  monitoring to the wind energy industry. ONYX monitors more than  17,000 turbines in over 30 countries, providing technology solutions  to 7 of the top 10 wind asset owners.(6) Beyond renewables, MAM sees a growing opportunity to generate  new institutional investment in more nascent elements of the  energy transition and reached first close on Macquarie’s first energy  transition fund, Macquarie Green Energy Transition Solutions.  Aligned to this strategy, MAM also became the lead investor in  a funding round to support the construction of a 16 GWh/year  gigafactory in Dunkirk, France. Among other investments, MAM  also committed to support an industrial-scale green nitrogen  fertiliser development platform in the Americas, contributing to the  decarbonisation of the agriculture sector. CGM continues to develop and deploy climate solutions to help  clients with their decarbonisation pathways, including those in  carbon-intensive industries, and to support new initiatives in clean  fuels and critical minerals. This includes helping meet growing  demand for the supply of low-carbon methanol by the shipping  industry, through logistics, capital and price risk management  services. The business has also developed a new lithium hedging  solution to help corporate clients de-risk their supply chains,  supporting greater availability of the mineral for the manufacture of  clean technologies.

(7)	 MAM generally only has influence over scope 1 and 2 emissions. However, to the extent possible, in line with the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative guidance, MAM intends to  support assets where it has control or significant influence to reduce their scope 3 emissions. (8)	 The Paris Agreement’s central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by maintaining a global temperature rise this century well below 2°C above  pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5°C. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded the need for net zero  emissions by 2050 to remain consistent with 1.5°C. Progress towards net zero During the year, we published our second Net Zero and Climate  Risk Report. It provided an update on financed emissions targets  for the coal, oil/gas and motor vehicle sectors, and added new  targets for Australian residential mortgage lending. We now have  targets in place for over 80% of our dollar ($A) exposures to carbon  intensive sectors.  MAM is committed to investing and managing its portfolio in line  with global net zero scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by  2040, where it has control or significant influence.(7) It is working  with its portfolio companies and properties to ensure their net  zero business plans are firmly embedded within their organisations  and supported by the right resources, providing them with access  to Macquarie’s breadth of green investment expertise, industrial  capabilities and specialist external partners. Where it does not have  control or significant influence, such as in its managed portfolio  of public securities, MAM will continue to support the goals of the  Paris Agreement(8) in a manner consistent with its client-guided  fiduciary and regulatory responsibilities.  We believe that the energy transition needs to be managed, orderly  and just, and CGM is actively supporting carbon-intensive industries  to reduce their emissions while maintaining the vital services they  provide and on which communities and industries rely. The scale and  breadth of the transition is driving the delivery of holistic solutions  across CGM’s activities, markets, and client sectors, including  carbon and emissions; renewable and flexible power; clean fuels;  sustainable transport; critical minerals; the circular economy; and  sustainable finance. Representatives from across Macquarie attended our third  successive Conference of the Parties (COP28), meeting with clients  and stakeholders in Dubai to discuss the role that we play to support  countries and corporates’ ambitions to reach net zero.  ===== PAGE 17 ===== 17 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Directors’ Report Governance About Improving governance outcomes As a custodian of vital businesses and through the investments we  make, we have the opportunity to actively drive positive change by  advancing governance and societal outcomes. Macquarie Capital has supported the growth of Forwood, which  provides safety software to help companies in high-risk industries  globally, including mining, construction and utilities, prevent  fatalities. Using artificial intelligence and video analytics to monitor  safe behaviours and conditions, Forwood’s technology has now  been implemented across more than 800 sites globally. Macquarie Capital also supported Partners Group’s refinancing of  Civica, which provides software to public bodies across government,  healthcare and education in the UK, Asia and the US that helps them  increase the efficiency and transparency of service delivery.(9) MAM continues to encourage its portfolio companies to implement  board-approved DEI strategies. One such example is portfolio  company 2degrees, a New Zealand telecommunications provider,  which has secured Rainbow Tick certification, awarded to  organisations that demonstrate they understand and welcome  sexual and gender diversity, following the two-year development of  a new DEI strategy.  In the US, MAM is engaging with American Electric Power  (AEP) – one of America’s largest power companies – on how it  is supporting communities affected by coal plant shutdowns. A  portfolio investment of several MAM Public Investments funds, AEP  is working towards a just transition for those affected by its move  to net zero, ensuring it is an inclusive process that generates new  jobs and reduces inequality. As a shareholder in over 1,000 stocks globally, the Macquarie  Systematic Investments team within MAM is taking a data-driven  approach to modern slavery risk. Through direct engagement with  companies, the team is able to improve the quality of investment  data and encourage improved transparency and disclosures,  while identifying those that require closer monitoring and further  engagement to track their progress. In Australia, BFS continues to invest in new safety and  security technology, such as the Macquarie Authenticator  app, a market-leading multi-factor authentication tool that  provides banking customers with real-time account security  alerts and notifications.

Driving social impact around  the world The Macquarie Group Foundation (The Foundation)  drives philanthropic social impact work for  Macquarie, supporting our people, businesses and  communities to build a better future. During FY2024, $A67 million was contributed  to 3,000 non-profits around the world through  employee donations and fundraising, Foundation  matching and donations, grants and social impact  investments, marking a significant increase on  FY2023 and a record year of giving. This includes  a record $A10 million raised by the 10th annual  Foundation Week, during which our people organised  or participated in over 320 charitable initiatives, spanning 42 offices  in 25 markets and supporting more than 240 non-profits globally.  By partnering with Macquarie businesses, the Foundation helps  integrate a shared value approach into existing business models  and identify projects that can deliver both increased social value  and enhanced commercial outcomes. Catalysing this work, the  Macquarie Shared Value Award recognises a team driving social  impact through a shared value project. The 2023 winner was  a project managed by Macquarie Capital in the Americas – to  develop major bridges in Pennsylvania while also deploying an  enduring workforce development initiative. Philadelphia Works, the  non-profit involved in the project, was awarded a $A100,000 grant  to help increase the scope and scale of social impact. During the year, World YMCA – whose vision is empowering young  people and communities worldwide to build a just, sustainable,  equitable and inclusive world – became the Foundation’s second  global grant partner. Grant funding will support pilot interventions  that use digital solutions and innovative financing to move  historically underserved young people beyond skilling and into work.  New social impact investments were also announced, including  one to US-based Pursuit which received a philanthropic grant  and a social impact investment. These two complementary  forms of catalytic capital will enable Pursuit to scale its impact  supporting low-income individuals without a college degree into  long-term careers.  ===== PAGE 18 ===== 18 FY2024 net profit $A3,522m 	¶ ¶ 	 32% on prior year FY2024 net operating income $A16,887m 	¶ ¶ 	 12% on prior year FY2024 operating expenses $A12,061m 	— — 	 in line with the prior year FY2024 earnings per share $A9.17 	¶ ¶ 	 32% on prior year FY2024 return on equity 10.8% 	¶ ¶ 	 from 16.9% in the prior year FY2024 dividends per share $A6.40 	 (40% franked)  	¶ ¶ 	 15% on prior year FY2024 effective tax rate 26.8% 	µ µ 	 from 26.0%   in prior year Assets under management $A938.3b 	µ µ 	 from $A878.6b(10)  as at 31 March 2023 (10)	 MAM Private Markets AUM includes equity yet to deploy and equity committed to assets but not yet deployed.

FY2024 Highlights  MAM assets under management as at 31 March 2024 increased 7% to  $A938.3 billion from $A878.6 billion as at 31 March 2023, due to favourable  market movements, investments made by Private Markets-managed  funds and favourable foreign exchange movements, partially offset by  assets no longer managed as a result of reduction of co-investment  management rights.  During the period, MAM raised $A21.9 billion in new equity from clients  across a diverse range of strategies, including regional and global  infrastructure and energy transition, with record raisings in private credit.  MAM invested $A17.9 billion of equity across 51 new investments, including:  19 real assets, 18 real estate and 14 private credit investments.

FY2024 Highlights  For the year ended 31 March 2024, the loan portfolio increased 10% to  $A140.2 billion and BFS deposits increased 10% to $A142.7 billion. Funds  on platform increased 15% to $A141.8 billion driven by strong net flows of  $A3.0 billion and favourable market movements. The home loan portfolio increased 10% to $A119.3 billion driven by strong  demand in lower loan-to-value ratio and owner-occupier lending tiers, while  the Business Banking loan portfolio increased 22% to $A15.8 billion driven  by strong client retention, an increase in client acquisition across core  segments and a continued build into emerging segments.  During the year, BFS expanded the Macquarie Wrap managed accounts  offering with funds under administration of $A13.8 billion, up from  $A10.5 billion at 31 March 2023.  Medium‑term BFS remains focused on growth opportunities through intermediary and  direct retail client distribution, platforms and client service; opportunities  to increase financial services engagement with existing Business Banking  clients and extend into adjacent segments; and modernising technology to  improve client experience and support scalable growth.  ===== PAGE 23 ===== 23 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Directors’ Report Governance About Markets‑facing businesses Commodities and Global Markets Macquarie Capital $A3,213m $A1,051m 	¶ ¶ 	 47% on prior year 	µ µ 	 31% on prior year CGM is a global business offering capital and financing, risk management,  market access, physical execution and logistics solutions to its diverse client  base across: 	• Commodities: Provides capital and financing, risk management, and  physical execution and logistics solutions across power, gas, emissions,  agriculture, oil and resources sectors globally 	• Financial Markets: Provides risk management, capital and financing  solutions, and market access to corporate and institutional clients with  exposure to foreign exchange, rates, fixed income, credit markets and  listed derivatives markets 	• Asset Finance: Global provider of specialist finance and asset  management solutions across a variety of industries and asset classes.

It also has global capability in specialist investing across private credit,  private equity, real estate, growth equity, venture capital, and in  infrastructure and energy projects and companies. Macquarie Capital’s Equities brokerage business provides clients with access  to equity research, sales, execution capabilities and corporate access. FY2024 Highlights  CGM recorded a net profit contribution of $A3.2 billion, reflecting the  diversity and strength of CGM’s client platform. This result was down 47%  on the prior year, which was characterised by exceptionally strong market  volatility, particularly in commodities. Commodities contribution was down on the prior year due to decreased risk  management income primarily in EMEA Gas and Power, and Resources. The  decrease was partially offset by an increased contribution from Agricultural  markets. Inventory management and trading income substantially lower  driven by a reduction in trading activity primarily in North American Gas and  Power, partially offset by timing of income recognition on Gas and Power  transport and storage contracts. Financial Markets contribution was up on the prior year, driven by increased  client hedging activity across foreign exchange and interest rate products  and an increased contribution from the Futures business. Asset Finance contribution was down on prior year, primarily due to an  increase in operating expenses, notwithstanding strong origination and  portfolio growth in Advanced Technology and Shipping Finance.  CGM continues to be recognised across the industries it operates in, with a  number of awards earned during the period including House of the Year for  Oil and Products, Electricity and Commodities Research at the Energy Risk  Awards 2023 and House of the Year for Commodities Research, Derivatives,  Environmental Products, Commodity Trade Finance, Natural Gas/LNG and  Emissions at the Energy Risk Asia Awards 2023. CGM is ranked as No.1  Futures Broker on the ASX.  Medium‑term CGM remains focused on: opportunities to grow the commodities business,  both organically and through adjacencies; the development of institutional  and corporate coverage for specialised credit, rates and foreign exchange  products; providing tailored financing solutions globally across a variety  of industries and asset classes; continued investment in the asset finance  portfolio; supporting the client franchise as markets evolve, particularly  as it relates to the energy transition and growing the client base across  all regions. FY2024 Highlights  Macquarie Capital maintained its leading market position in ANZ across  M&A (by deal count) and capital markets (by deal value) in FY2024 and  No.1 Global Financial Adviser in Energy Transition on the Inspiratia FY2023  Energy Transition League Table Report (by deal volume). Macquarie Capital acted as lead sell-side adviser to Parchment, an academic  credential management platform on its sale to Instructure (NYSE: INST)  for $US835 million and Joint Bookrunner on the financing to fund  the acquisition. As a market leading advisory business with global reach, Macquarie  Capital acted as financial adviser to MMG Limited on its acquisition of  the Khoemacau copper mine in Botswana for $A2.9 billion. Khoemacau is  expected to significantly increase MMG’s scale and place MMG as a Top 10  copper-focused producer globally.

We offer our teams significant operating freedom balanced by limits on risk. Alignment of interests is a longstanding  feature, demonstrated by willingness to both invest alongside clients and closely align the interests of shareholders and staff. This approach has helped us to grow into a diversified global business, conducting a broad range of activities and creating enduring franchises  where we have differentiated perspectives. Our approach has not been to place big bets, but to expand adjacently, taking learnings from one  market to another, or using expertise built in one part of a sector to grow into another. This philosophy is reflected in our flexible approach to allocating capital. We rely on our teams who are close to their markets and clients to  drive ideas, setting out both the opportunity they have identified but also the associated risks and how they plan to manage them, with the  teams in the business remaining accountable for the long-term outcomes they deliver. Teams at the centre of the organisation assess the  case being made, including second line review of risks, before allocating capital with a view to maintaining diversification across our activities  while seeking an acceptable risk adjusted return for each project, based on its specific characteristics.

Risk culture Macquarie sets, promotes, monitors and reflects on the  effectiveness of our risk culture. Macquarie’s approach to  maintaining a sound risk culture is based on: •	 setting behavioural expectations  •	 leading and executing •	 monitoring, measuring and reporting. Risk management framework Macquarie’s risk management framework is the totality of  systems, structures, policies, processes and people within  Macquarie that identify, measure, evaluate, monitor, report and  control or mitigate all internal or external sources of material risk. Macquarie’s approach to risk management is based on stable and  robust core risk management principles. These are: •	 ownership of risk at the business level •	 understanding worst-case outcomes •	 requirement for an independent sign-off by RMG. Macquarie’s approach to risk management adopts the ‘three  lines of defence’ model, which sets risk ownership responsibilities  functionally independent from oversight and assurance: •	 primary responsibility for day-to-day risk management lies  with the business •	 RMG forms the second line of defence •	 Internal Audit, as the third line, provides independent and  objective risk-based assurance. Refer to the Risk Management section of this Annual  Report for details on Macquarie’s risk management  framework, risk culture and conduct risk management Macroeconomic factors The key macroeconomic risks to Macquarie’s  short and medium term financial outlook noted  on page 32 are: Market conditions The general condition of markets, driven by macroeconomic,  climate and geopolitical factors, may have a bearing on  Macquarie’s businesses. Changing market conditions influence  the volume and timing of client and principal transactions across  businesses and the value of various equity, credit and market risk  exposures held by Macquarie on its balance sheet. The value of the Australian dollar A significant proportion of Macquarie’s net income is  denominated in foreign currency. Therefore, net income will  be lower in Australian dollar terms if the Australian dollar  appreciates against other foreign currencies, and net income  will be higher in Australian dollar terms if the Australian dollar  depreciates against other foreign currencies. Potential regulatory changes  Macquarie is affected by changes in regulation. Regulatory change  continues to increase at both the global and Australian levels  and has the potential to affect the regulatory capital and funding  requirements and profitability of Macquarie’s businesses. Funding and liquidity Macquarie uses deposits and debt markets, among other funding  sources, to fund its assets. Macquarie is therefore exposed to the  risk of an increase in the cost of funding, or of reduced access to  funding sources. Technology Macquarie recognises that with the use of systems, technology,  and platforms to support its business activities, it is exposed  to risk of loss resulting from failure, inadequacy or misuse of  technology and technology resources. In determining those risks that are material to Macquarie, we  assess the potential for a risk to affect our earnings resilience  and financial strength across market cycles; our ability to meet  regulatory obligations; our stakeholders; and our reputation.  Macquarie’s material risks include asset, conduct, country, credit,  environmental and social, equity, financial crime, legal, liquidity,  market, operational, regulatory and compliance, strategic, tax,  technology and cyber, and work health and safety risks.

These increases were partially offset by: 	• cash and bank balances of $A31.9 billion as at 31 March 2024 decreased  30% from $A45.7 billion as at 31 March 2023, driven by a reduction in the  overnight deposit held with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) as part  of Group Treasury’s liquid asset portfolio management 	• derivative assets of $A24.1 billion as at 31 March 2024 decreased 33%  from $A36.1 billion as at 31 March 2023, driven by volatility and price  movements having stabilised across commodity markets, as well as  the maturity of prior year positions. After taking into account related  financial instruments, cash and other financial collateral, the residual  derivative asset exposure was $A7.4 billion (31 March 2023: $A9.7  billion). The majority of the residual derivative asset exposure was  short-term in nature and managed within the Consolidated Entity’s  market and credit risk frameworks, with a substantial portion of the  exposure with investment grade counterparties. Total liabilities of $A369.4 billion as at 31 March 2024 increased 4% from  $A353.8 billion as at 31 March 2023. The principal drivers for the increase were as follows: 	• deposits of $A148.4 billion as at 31 March 2024 increased 10% from  $A134.7 billion as at 31 March 2023, driven by volume growth in retail  and business banking deposits in BFS 	• issued debt securities and other borrowings of $A119.9 billion as at  31 March 2024 increased 10% from $A109.5 billion as at 31 March 2023,  driven by the issuance of short-term commercial paper and long-term  bonds by Group Treasury 	• other liabilities of $A14.5 billion as at 31 March 2024 increased 16% from  $A12.5 billion as at 31 March 2023, driven by higher commodity-related  payables from increased volumes in CGM 	• loan capital of $A14.2 billion as at 31 March 2024 increased 10% from  $A12.9 billion as at 31 March 2023 driven by the issuance of Tier 2  loan capital. These increases were partially offset by: 	• derivative liabilities of $A25.6 billion as at 31 March 2024 decreased  22% from $A32.8 billion as at 31 March 2023 commensurate with  the movement in derivative assets. After taking into account related  financial instruments, cash and other collateral, the residual derivative  liability was $A6.8 billion (31 March 2023: $A6.6 billion) 	• cash collateralised borrowing and repurchase agreements of  $A12.6 billion as at 31 March 2024 decreased 33% from $A18.7 billion as  at 31 March 2023, driven by a reduction in trading activity in CGM and  partial maturity of the RBA Term-Funding Facility.

The Consolidated Entity’s equity was impacted by: 	• $A2.7 billion in dividend payments 	• $A0.6 billion of ordinary shares on-market buy-back 	• $A0.4 billion decrease in non-controlling interests. These decreases were partially offset by $A3.5 billion of earnings generated  during the current year and a $A0.5 billion increase in foreign currency  translation, largely driven by the depreciation of the Australian Dollar to the  United States Dollar.  ===== PAGE 31 ===== 31 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Directors’ Report Governance About Funding Macquarie’s liquidity risk management framework is designed to ensure that it is able to meet its obligations as they  fall due under a range of market conditions.

Transactions internal to Macquarie are eliminated. The Bank Group’s Level 2 minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio (CET1) in accordance with Prudential Standard  APS 110 Capital Adequacy is 9%. This includes the industry minimum CET1 requirement of 4.5%, capital conservation  buffer (CCB) of 3.75% and a countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB)(18) of 0.75%. The corresponding requirement for  Tier 1 capital is 10.5%, inclusive of the CCB and CCyB18. APRA also requires ADIs to maintain a minimum leverage ratio  of 3.5%. In addition, APRA may impose ADI-specific minimum ratios which may be higher than these levels.

It  describes our key governance practices and articulates how decision-making is guided to meet stakeholder  expectations of sound corporate governance and prudent decision-making, acknowledging Macquarie’s specific  and broader responsibilities to its shareholders, funders, clients, employees and the communities in which  it operates.  Macquarie Group Limited’s (MGL) corporate governance practices have followed the recommendations set by the 4th edition of the  ASX Corporate Governance Council’s Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations throughout the financial year ended  31 March 2024. MGL, together with its subsidiaries (Macquarie), is a global financial services group operating in 34 markets in asset management, retail and  business banking, wealth management, leasing and asset financing, market access, commodity trading, renewables development, specialist  advisory, capital raising and principal investment. Macquarie’s purpose statement ‘Empowering people to innovate and invest for a better future’ explains why we exist. We believe that by  empowering people we will achieve our shared potential. The way we fulfil our purpose is defined by our principles of Opportunity, Accountability and Integrity. These principles guide Board,  management and staff conduct, and it is expected that they will all meet these standards and deal honestly and fairly with our clients,  counterparties and regulators. There are appropriate consequences for anyone who fails to meet our standards.  Corporate Governance framework Our corporate governance framework defines the relationship between the Board and management, underpinned by a strong risk  management framework and the infrastructure needed for our Operating Groups to manage their businesses.

It has a similar governance structure to MGL, with five standing MBL  Board Committees: a Board Audit, Board Remuneration, Board Risk,  Board Governance and Compliance and Board Conflicts Committee.  In addition to supporting the MGL Board, the MGL Board  Nominating Committee supports the MBL Board in satisfying itself  that the MBL Board has an appropriate mix of skills, experience,  tenure and diversity for the Board.  The MBL Board is comprised of a majority of Non-Executive  Directors (NEDs), the MGL CEO and MBL CEO. Following the  retirement of Mr Michael Coleman, expected by mid-2024, there will  be three Bank-only Non-Executive Directors (BONDs) on the MBL  Board: Mr Wayne Byres, Mr Ian Saines and Mr David Whiteing, and  seven NEDs who also serve on the MGL Board. The MBL CEO is assisted by MBL’s management committees and the  MBL CEO’s Office. During FY2024, Macquarie and MBL continued their oversight of  ongoing programs that focus on strengthening MBL’s processes and  controls, including those around intra-group funding arrangements  and internal exposures; capital and liquidity reporting; risk  management frameworks; and accountabilities and governance.  A number of these programs also form part of a remediation  plan with APRA, which has been established to define and deliver  detailed programs of work that enhance MBL’s governance, risk  culture, group structure, and remuneration to ensure full and  ongoing compliance with prudential standards and management of  MBL-specific risks. As part of governance changes to better protect the interests of  MBL within Macquarie, BOND representation on the MBL Board  and MBL Board Committees increased following the new BOND  appointments of Mr Whiteing and Mr Byres during FY2024.  Board oversight The Board sets the ‘tone at the top’ in a highly visible manner. Board  members have broad contact with staff at various levels within the  organisation and across regions. There is a culture of open and frank discussion at the Board. Actions  taken by the Board seek to promote long-term sustainability and  prudent management of risk consistent with What We Stand For. Board workshops scheduled during FY2024 covered topical,  emerging business and governance issues, including presentations  on data ethics, operational risk management, risk appetite,  sustainability reporting, whistleblower training, anti-bribery and  corruption and sanctions compliance and cyber threat intelligence. NEDs also met regularly without members of management and  Board Committees held private meetings with each of the external  auditor, Head of Internal Audit, Head of Compliance and Chief Risk  Officer (CRO) to assist with their oversight role. Board members believe that informal conversations with staff are  important in assessing the culture within Macquarie and seeing  Macquarie’s purpose at work. Board members generally attend  various staff functions in Australia and conduct two international  trips to Macquarie offices each year. In FY2024, the Board visited  Macquarie offices in the US, UK and France. Key highlights from  these visits included visits to certain Macquarie fund assets in  London and New York and presentations from regional staff and  external speakers about topical issues in the region; regional  business updates; and Macquarie’s people, culture, and purpose  statement in practice. Each visit brought together staff from  various locations within the regions, increasing and enhancing  the Board’s opportunity for engagement with staff. During the US  Board visit, Board members engaged with approximately 650 staff  members across all levels of seniority in three key regional hubs:  Jacksonville, Philadelphia and New York. During the visit to London  and Paris, approximately 211 staff members were invited to engage  with Board members at various events, including a staff dinner.  ===== PAGE 38 ===== 38 Corporate Governance Statement Continued Board oversight 	• Commitment to achieving the highest standards of professional conduct across all Macquarie operations 	• Regularly reinforce company-wide expectations  	• Diligently take action as part of its responsibility to shareholders, funders, clients, employees and the communities in which Macquarie operates 	• Review and monitor operations and challenge of management.

In accordance with the Constitution, the Board has  resolved that the maximum number of Voting Directors (Directors)  is currently 12. The Board Charter details the Board’s role and responsibilities and  matters expressly reserved for the Board, which include annually  approving the strategy and business plan, adopting an annual  budget, approving Macquarie’s funding and capital management  strategy, approving Macquarie’s Risk Appetite Statement and  Risk Management Strategy, monitoring material risks faced  by Macquarie and how they are managed, appointing the CEO  and approving major group policies including those relating to  remuneration, diversity and equity, and the Code of Conduct.  The role of the Board is to promote the long-term interests of  Macquarie, taking into account Macquarie’s specific and broader  responsibilities to its shareholders, funders, clients, employees  and the communities in which it operates. The Board is assisted  by its various Board Committees as detailed in each Board  Committee Charter. MGL’s Constitution and Board Charter are available at  macquarie.com/corporate-governance The Board determines delegations to management and approves  applicable limits and policies. The CEO has been granted authority for matters not reserved  for the Board at law or as set out in the Board’s Charter, for a  Board Committee or one or more other Directors. Macquarie’s  management committees assist in the exercise of the CEO’s  delegated authority. The CEO, the CRO and the CFO report to  the Board at each meeting. In addition to regular reporting  from management, the Board has unrestricted access to senior  management and external advisers. The Company Secretary is appointed by and accountable to the  Board, through the Chair, for matters relating to the proper  functioning of the Board. Board renewal, appointment   and performance The Board, with the assistance of the BNC, regularly assesses the  skills, experience, tenure and diversity required collectively for the  Board to effectively fulfil its role. MGL’s Policy on Board Renewal,  Appointment of Directors and Board Performance Review sets out  the fundamental factors relevant to the selection and appointment  of new Directors and the process for assessing performance of  the Board. MGL’s Policy on Board Renewal, Appointment of   Directors and Board Performance Review is available at  macquarie.com/corporate-governance Board diversity and tenure The Board believes that its membership should comprise Directors  with an appropriate mix and diversity of skills, professional  experience, tenure, gender and personal background. The general  expectation is that NEDs will serve three 3-year terms from  first election by shareholders. NEDs may serve for longer than  three 3-year terms if the Board considers it to be of significant  benefit to MGL. 62.5% of Directors are women Years of NED tenure 0-3 3-6 6-9     3.9  years Average tenure of NEDs is  ===== PAGE 40 ===== 40 Corporate Governance Statement Continued Director appointment, induction  and development In accordance with Macquarie’s Fit and Proper Policy, for a Director  appointment, appropriate background checks are undertaken  (typically including criminal record, bankruptcy, employment history  and education checks). Directors appointed to fill a casual vacancy  stand for election at the first AGM following their appointment. The  notice of meeting provides shareholders with material information  relevant to a decision as to whether to elect or re-elect a Director  including their skills, experience, other directorships and an  acknowledgement that they will have sufficient time to fulfil their  responsibilities as a Director. All Directors have received an appointment letter setting out the  terms of their appointment. The material terms of appointment are  set out in MGL’s Policy on Board Renewal, Appointment of Directors  and Board Performance Review. New Directors also undertake an induction program covering  relevant matters such as Board and Board Committee practices and  procedures, prudential requirements and briefings with Heads of  Operating and Central Service Groups and other staff. NEDs identify business awareness needs on an ongoing basis  and regular Board workshops are held during the year on topical,  emerging business and governance issues relevant to Macquarie.  The BRiC, including at regular meetings of the Chairs of the Board  and Board Committees, reviews the annual schedule of Board  workshop sessions. In addition to workshops, the Board has  generally scheduled two separate visits to international Macquarie  offices annually.  The BNC reviews the skills and experience of the NEDs. As part of  the Board performance review, the Board periodically considers  whether there is a need for existing Directors to undertake  professional development to maintain the skills and knowledge  needed to perform their role on the Board effectively. Board performance A Director’s continuing Board membership is subject to their  performance and ongoing relevance of their skills and experience.  The Board undertakes a formal annual performance evaluation  to review its performance and the performance of each Director  with emphasis on those individual Directors who are required to  stand for re-election at the next AGM. The Board considers the  performance and skills of Directors standing for re-election and  whether other particular skills or experience not currently available  are needed prior to determining whether to recommend their  re-election to shareholders. Every three years an external facilitator conducts the Board’s  performance review. In the intervening years, an internal  performance assessment is led by the Chair with the support of the  Company Secretary. The process for conducting the review is agreed  by the Board. Typically, the process includes individual interviews by  the Chair or an external facilitator with each Director and the use of  a self-assessment questionnaire to cover matters such as: •	 the Board’s contribution to developing strategy •	 the Board’s performance relative to its objectives •	 interaction between the Board and management and between  Board members •	 the Board’s oversight of business performance and risk  management •	 Board composition and renewal, including consideration of  relevant skills and capabilities •	 the operation of the Board, including the conduct of Board  meetings, Board culture and Chair leadership •	 stakeholder management •	 succession and remuneration. A written report summarising the results and feedback (e.g., with  themes in FY2024 relating to time allocation, board composition  and board operations) is presented to the Board and discussed at a  Board meeting. A nominated Independent Director or the external  facilitator provides performance feedback to the Chair based on  discussion with the other Directors. The Board’s review in FY2024 was conducted internally in  accordance with the process described above. The FY2025  review is an external review. Board Committee performance As part of the Board’s annual performance evaluation, the  functioning and performance of the Board Committees is reviewed.  Each Board Committee also undertakes a more detailed review, at  least biennially, of its performance and the extent to which it has  met its responsibilities set out in its Charter. The process for the  review of Board Committee performance also includes use of a  self-assessment questionnaire to cover matters such as interaction  between the Board Committee and management, the operation of  the Board Committee, including the conduct of Board Committee  meetings, Board Committee culture and Chair leadership, and  Board Committee composition. A written report summarising the  results and outcomes, including recommendations, is reviewed and  discussed by each Board Committee, led by the Committee Chair. During FY2024, each Board Committee undertook its biennial  performance review internally, in accordance with the process  described above. The next biennial review is scheduled for FY2026.  ===== PAGE 41 ===== 41 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Directors’ Report About Governance Employment and performance  of senior executives In accordance with Macquarie’s Fit and Proper Policy, for a  senior executive appointment, appropriate background checks  are undertaken (typically including criminal record, bankruptcy,  employment history and education checks). All Executive KMP receive an employment contract setting out  the terms of their employment. The material terms of their  employment are set out in the Remuneration Report. There is a consistent and comprehensive process for the Board  and the BRC to assess the performance of the MGL CEO and  each Executive KMP during the year to enable them to determine  remuneration outcomes at the end of the year. A performance  evaluation for senior executives has taken place during the year  in accordance with the process described on page 127 in the  Remuneration Report. Details of the nature and amount of remuneration for each  Executive KMP and Macquarie’s remuneration policies  and practices are contained on pages 106 to 156 in the  Remuneration Report of this Annual Report. Board structure Board Committees MGL’s five standing Board Committees assist the Board in its  oversight role. Board members have access to all Board Committee  meeting papers and may attend any Board Committee meeting.  Subsequent to each Board Committee meeting, the minutes are  included in the Board papers and presented to the Board by the  respective Committee Chairs. The Chairs of the Board and each Board Committee meet to broadly  consider the work plan, responsibilities and the performance of  each Committee and to focus on any areas of overlap or gaps in  Committee reporting and responsibilities, including coordination of  non-financial risk reporting between Committees and the coverage  of risk reporting across Committees. The Board Committee Charters detailing the  responsibilities of each Committee are available at  macquarie.com/corporate-governance  ===== PAGE 42 ===== 42 Corporate Governance Statement Continued Allocation of responsibilities between Board Committees The following table provides a summary of the allocation of responsibilities between Board Committees. Committee Role Board Risk  Committee (BRiC) The BRiC assists the Board by providing oversight of Macquarie’s risk management framework and advising the Board on  Macquarie’s risk appetite, risk culture and risk management strategy. Except to the extent another Board Committee is  responsible, the BRiC receives information on material risks and reviews the impact of developments in markets in which  Macquarie operates on its risk position and profile. The BRiC monitors Macquarie’s risk culture and, with assistance from the  BGCC, conduct risk and certain other non-financial risks, and forms a view on Macquarie’s risk culture and the extent to which it  supports the ability of Macquarie to operate consistently within its risk appetite. The CRO reports directly to the CEO and has a  secondary reporting line to the BRiC. Board Governance  and Compliance  Committee (BGCC) The BGCC assists the Board with adopting the most appropriate corporate governance standards for Macquarie and assists  the Board in monitoring regulatory, legal, compliance and financial crime risk matters for Macquarie, including reviewing  and monitoring compliance with Macquarie’s Conduct Risk Management Framework and its implementation. In addition, the  BGCC reviews and monitors Macquarie’s work health and safety, environmental and social risk management policies, practices  and performance, and customer and client reporting. The BRiC, BRC and BAC oversee aspects of the regulatory, legal and  compliance risk matters for Macquarie relating to their duties and responsibilities. Board Remuneration  Committee (BRC) The BRC is responsible for overseeing the design, operation and monitoring of Macquarie’s remuneration framework. It  makes recommendations to the Board that promote appropriate remuneration policies and practices for Macquarie that align  remuneration outcomes with Macquarie’s financial and non-financial risk outcomes, drive behaviours that support Macquarie’s  risk management framework, and promote Macquarie’s Code of Conduct and the accountability of staff for the business and  customer outcomes they deliver by encouraging a long-term perspective. The BRC reviews HR-related reports and consults  with the BRiC, BGCC and BAC to ensure risk outcomes are appropriately reflected in remuneration outcomes. The BRC is also  responsible for remuneration-related disclosures in the Remuneration Report. Board Audit  Committee (BAC) The BAC assists the Board with its oversight of the quality and integrity of the accounting, auditing and financial reporting of  Macquarie. The BAC also reviews the adequacy of Macquarie’s control framework for financial regulatory reporting to APRA and  prudential regulators in other jurisdictions and monitors the internal financial control environment. The BAC at least annually,  reviews and assesses, and reports to the Board on the quality, effectiveness, objectivity and independence of the external  auditor, and other matters relating to the prior year’s audit and reports to the Board on the annual performance review of  the external auditor. The BAC reviews reports from the external auditor and Internal Audit, referring matters relating to the  duties and responsibilities of the BRiC and BGCC to the appropriate Board Committee. The BAC also monitors and reviews  the performance objectives and rating, remuneration and the degree of independence of the Head of Internal Audit and the  effectiveness of the Internal Audit function. Board Nominating  Committee (BNC) The BNC assists the Board and MBL in satisfying itself that it has an appropriate mix of skills, experience, tenure and diversity  for each board to be an effective decision-making body and to provide successful oversight and stewardship of Macquarie and  MBL respectively. Board and Board Committee membership The Board has eight Directors, comprising seven Independent  Directors and one Executive Director, who is the MGL Managing  Director and Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The Chair of the Board is Mr Glenn Stevens, an Independent  Director, who has been the Chair of the Board since 10 May 2022.  Ms Shemara Wikramanayake is the CEO of MGL. Each Board Committee has an Independent Director as its Chair and  comprises members who are Independent Directors. Other than  the Chair of the Board, all Independent Directors are members of  at least two Board Committees and all Independent Directors are  members of the BNC. The Chair of the Board and the CEO receive a standing  invitation to all Board Committee meetings and attend as they  consider appropriate.  The following changes to MGL Board and Board Committee  memberships occurred during FY2024: •	 Ms Jillian Broadbent was appointed as a member of the BRiC,  effective 28 July 2023 •	 Ms Susan Lloyd-Hurwitz was appointed as a member of the  Board and the BNC effective 1 June 2023, and the BAC and BRC,  effective 28 July 2023 •	 Ms Rebecca McGrath was appointed Chair of the BGCC and  stepped down as a member of the BRC, effective 28 July 2023 •	 Ms Nicola Wakefield Evans retired as a member of the BGCC  and BRiC, effective after the conclusion of the Annual General  Meeting on 27 July 2023, and retired from the Macquarie board  effective 29 February 2024. Members’ attendance at Board and Board Committee  meetings during the past year is contained on page 95 in the  Directors’ Report of this Annual Report.  ===== PAGE 43 ===== 43 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Directors’ Report About Governance The following table sets out the current composition of the Board, each Director’s date of appointment and the membership of each  Board Committee.

The Board believes that its membership should comprise high  calibre directors with an appropriate mix and diversity of skills,  professional experience, tenure and personal background that allow  the Directors individually, and the Board collectively, to: •	 discharge their responsibilities and duties under the law  effectively and efficiently •	 consider and form a view on Macquarie’s culture and governance •	 understand the business of Macquarie and the environment in  which it operates so as to be able to set, with management, the  objectives, goals and strategic direction that will promote the  creation of superior and sustainable shareholder value; and meet  Macquarie’s responsibilities to its shareholders, funders, clients,  employees and the communities in which it operates •	 assess the performance of management in meeting those  objectives and goals. Accordingly, in selecting potential new Directors, the BNC identifies  the competencies and diversity required to enable the Board to fulfil  its responsibilities. In doing so, the BNC has regard to the results of  the annual appraisal of the Board’s performance, the performance  of each Director and ongoing succession planning.  The Board comprises highly experienced senior business leaders  from a variety of professional backgrounds who each meet  the fundamental requirements and, collectively, possess the  skills, experience, tenure and diversity considered necessary  to appropriately govern an ASX-listed, global, diversified  financial group.  The BNC also considers the necessary and desirable competencies  of new MBL directors. For example, through the appointment of  additional BONDs in FY2024, the MBL Board increased the number  of directors with skills in technology, digital and financial services  regulation. These skills complement those of both the MGL and  MBL Boards. From time to time there are areas identified by the Board where  additional knowledge would be beneficial, which it addresses by  engaging external advisers, conducting site visits, Board workshops  and/or requesting more detailed reporting from management.  Sustainability reporting, data ethics and cyber threat intelligence  and generative AI (artificial intelligence) are examples where this  approach has been taken. Details of the Directors’ qualifications and experience are  contained on pages 96 to 100 in the Directors’ Report of  this Annual Report.  ===== PAGE 44 ===== 44 Corporate Governance Statement Continued Skills matrix summary The competencies of the current Board members and the number of Directors with each skill and their experience is set out below.

MGL’s NEDs  meet regularly in the absence of management and Directors are  also able to consult independent experts at MGL’s expense, subject  to the estimated costs being approved by the Chair in advance as  being reasonable. The Board Charter requires that the Board has a  majority of NEDs who satisfy MGL’s criteria for independence. The independence of NEDs is assessed prior to appointment  and reviewed annually by the BGCC. The Board believes that  independence is evidenced by an ability to constructively challenge  and independently contribute to the work of the Board. MGL’s  criteria for assessing director independence align with the guidance  provided in the 4th edition of the ASX Corporate Governance  Council’s Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations. MGL’s Policy on Director Independence is available at  macquarie.com/corporate-governance 88% of Board members are   Independent Directors 100%  of Board Committee members  are Independent Directors The findings of the annual review of Director independence by the  BGCC are considered by the Board. As part of the review, MGL’s  criteria for assessing director independence are sent to each  Independent Director. They are requested to confirm whether they  have any interests, positions or relationships with Macquarie that  could materially interfere with the Director’s capacity to bring  independent judgement on matters before the Board and act in  the best interests of MGL. This year, there were no material or  substantial relationships that were assessed as impacting on the  independent judgement of MGL’s NEDs. Some of the Directors  hold positions in companies with which Macquarie has commercial  relationships. All these dealings are not material and are in the  ordinary course of business on arm’s length commercial terms. Dealing with potential conflicts of interest Macquarie recognises that conflicts of interest or potential conflicts  of interest may arise from time to time for its Directors. Macquarie  has in place procedures to identify and monitor for such conflicts  and to adopt appropriate measures where these arise. The Board has protocols for its members for declaring and dealing  with potential conflicts of interest that include: •	 Board members declaring their interests required under the Act,  the ASX Listing Rules and general law requirements •	 Board members with a material personal interest in a matter  before the Board not receiving the relevant Board paper and not  being present at the Board meeting during the consideration of  the matter and subsequent vote, unless the Board (excluding the  relevant Board member) resolves otherwise •	 as a general rule, Board members with other conflicts not  involving a material personal interest in a matter before the  Board should not receive the relevant Board paper and not be  present at the Board meeting during discussion of the matter. MBL is a subsidiary of MGL and all MGL NEDs generally also serve  on the MBL Board. The MBL Board is ultimately responsible for the  sound and prudent management of MBL, with due consideration  to the interests of deposit holders. Where potential conflicts  arise, there are a number of measures available to Directors of the  relevant Board to deal with such conflicts (e.g., consideration by  the MBL Board Conflicts Committee, BOND representation on the  MBL Board and Board Committees, etc.). Management will also  assist by giving Directors sufficient information to manage conflicts  appropriately. Each Director has the ability to obtain independent  advice or consult with independent experts where that Director  considers it necessary to carry out their duties and responsibilities. Culture and values The balance between opportunity and accountability, while  operating with integrity within a strong risk management  framework, is a feature of Macquarie’s success and a key factor in  our long record of unbroken profitability. Our corporate governance  practices reflect this balance. The Board approves the Code of Conduct and oversees that the  culture instilled by management reflects the principles enshrined  within it:  Opportunity We are entrepreneurial. Our people come from  diverse backgrounds and are empowered to work  together to pursue innovative ideas, to solve  problems and challenge conventional thinking and the  status quo. We work hard and with enthusiasm and  everyone has the opportunity to achieve to their full  potential. We have a learning and growth mindset,  and continually evolve our expertise. We recognise  and reward performance. Accountability We take pride and ownership of the long‑term  outcomes we deliver for our clients and  shareholders, our communities and each other. We  manage risk to ensure these outcomes are sustainable  and invest our time and capital to contribute to a  better future. We take ownership of the performance  of our endeavours and seek to quickly identify and  respond to change, emerging issues and trends. Integrity We operate with care and professionalism. We work  collaboratively to amplify our impact and consider  the effect of our decisions on others. We have the  courage, and are encouraged, to speak up with our  ideas, when we make a mistake or see something that  doesn’t seem right. We respect the law, community  expectations, our regulators, shareholders, clients  and customers and each other.  ===== PAGE 46 ===== 46 Corporate Governance Statement Continued The Board oversees compliance with key policies that are intended  to instil a culture of acting lawfully, ethically and responsibly.  An overview of the key policies that apply to our staff, such  as the Whistleblower Policy and Anti-bribery and Corruption  Policy, is provided in Macquarie’s Code of Conduct. Material  incidents and breaches relating to those policies and the Code of  Conduct are reported to the Board, typically through the relevant  Board Committee. Macquarie’s Code of Conduct The Board approved Code of Conduct, which applies to Macquarie’s  Independent Directors and staff: •	 incorporates What We Stand For: Macquarie’s purpose and the  principles of Opportunity, Accountability and Integrity that guide  the way staff conduct business •	 provides clear guidance on good decision-making and escalation,  encouraging staff to speak up and report genuine concerns about  improper conduct •	 reinforces the main requirements of Macquarie’s key policies. To ensure Macquarie’s culture of honesty and integrity remains  strong throughout the organisation, all staff who join Macquarie  receive specific training on What We Stand For and the Code of  Conduct. Existing staff also receive periodic training and sign an  annual certification that they understand the obligations imposed  on them by the Code of Conduct as well as their responsibility to  adhere to the Code. What We Stand For and the Code of Conduct are available at  macquarie.com/what-we-stand-for The Integrity Office Consistent with the principles of What We Stand For, Macquarie  is committed to providing an environment in which people are  comfortable escalating improper conduct or voicing concerns about  unethical behaviour. The Code of Conduct sets out the expectation  that staff speak up, and outlines the mechanisms, support and  protections available to staff who do so. The Integrity Office, established in 1998, supports this commitment  as an internally independent function dedicated to receiving  and investigating concerns about improper conduct or unethical  behaviour and protecting those who raise concerns. Macquarie’s Whistleblower Program (Program) provides numerous  channels for staff and external parties to confidentially raise  concerns about improper conduct, including suspected breaches  of the Code of Conduct. The Program, which is managed by the  Integrity Office, is supported by the Whistleblower Policy and  includes an externally managed service that enables concerns to  be raised anonymously. All concerns raised with the Integrity Office  or through the externally managed service are assessed and where  appropriate, investigated. The Integrity Office is also a point of contact for external parties  such as suppliers and former employees to raise concerns about  improper conduct by Macquarie or its staff. The Integrity Office reports directly to MGL’s CEO and provides an  annual report to the BGCC. Supporting the Group Integrity Officer  are Regional Integrity Officers located in various Macquarie offices  around the world. The Integrity Office also promotes high ethical  standards and good decision-making through communications and  engagement with staff. Macquarie’s Whistleblower Policy is available at  macquarie.com/whistleblower-policy Customer Advocate  Macquarie established the Customer Advocate office in March 2017  to enhance its continuing commitment to its Australian retail and  small business customers. In addition to customer support provided  by the business, the Customer Advocate’s role is to: •	 listen to Macquarie’s customers and provide a customer-centric  voice when making recommendations to improve  customer experience •	 minimise the risk of future problems by reviewing key customer  themes and new product approvals to identify opportunities to  enhance products, services, systems and processes •	 work with Macquarie complaint teams to promote fair and  reasonable customer outcomes. The Customer Advocate reports directly to the CEO and provides  reporting to the BGCC. Anti‑bribery and Corruption Policy Macquarie’s Anti‑bribery and Corruption Policy strictly prohibits  the actual or attempted use of any form of bribery or corruption  whether direct or indirect and whether involving Public Officials or  private persons. Bribery and corruption are incompatible with the  Code of Conduct, What We Stand For and the probity and integrity  expected of Macquarie’s NEDs and staff. RMG, headed by the CRO, oversees the operation of the policy. Macquarie’s Anti‑bribery and Corruption Policy is available  at macquarie.com/corporate-governance Diversity and Community Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Macquarie recognises that the diversity of its people is one of its  greatest strengths and is fundamental to Macquarie’s success.  An inclusive, equitable workplace enables Macquarie to embrace  diversity to deliver more innovation and sustainable solutions for its  people, clients, shareholders and communities. Macquarie’s Workforce Diversity Policy defines its diversity  commitment and the structures in place to promote: •	 a diverse workforce that is reflective of the communities in  which Macquarie operates •	 equitable processes that enable staff to reach their full  potential, and •	 an inclusive environment where all staff can bring their full  selves to work.  ===== PAGE 47 ===== 47 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Directors’ Report About Governance The BRC sets measurable objectives for increasing the diversity of  Macquarie’s workforce and annually assesses both those objectives  and Macquarie’s progress in achieving them. Macquarie reports against its diversity objectives, which  include increasing the proportion of women and people from  under-represented groups at all levels in the Macquarie workforce.  This includes diverse representation at senior leadership levels  (Board of Directors, Executive Committee, Division Head and Senior  Executive). The principles of equity and inclusion are embedded  in Macquarie’s people related practices and processes, including  core talent programs, talent acquisition processes and promotion  criteria, to ensure all staff have access to equitable opportunities. All Macquarie staff, including its most senior leaders, are required  to have annual DEI objectives, driving accountability from the top  down. The BRC is responsible for reviewing and approving the  annual Diversity, Equity and Inclusion section for the Annual Report.  Reporting to the BRC sets out the composition of Macquarie’s  workforce, gender and cultural representation and progress towards  achieving its measurable objectives for diversity. Macquarie’s measurable objectives for achieving diversity,  and progress towards achieving those objectives, are  detailed on pages 74 to 77 in the Diversity, Equity and  Inclusion section of this Annual Report. Macquarie’s Workforce Diversity Policy is available at  macquarie.com/diversity-equity-and-inclusion Macquarie and the community Macquarie supports the wider community through various  programs, including the Macquarie Group Foundation’s  (Foundation) employee engagement, grantmaking and social  impact investing, and Macquarie Sports and the Macquarie Group  Collection (Collection). The Foundation is governed by the Macquarie Group Foundation  Committee (Committee), which comprises senior executives from  across Macquarie. The Committee is chaired by Mr Alex Harvey,  Chief Financial Officer of Macquarie. Committee members bring specific areas of expertise and  experience and represent the geographical spread of Macquarie’s  employees. The Committee meets regularly to assess funding  applications, review the Foundation’s activities, and to set and  monitor strategy. The Foundation’s Social Impact Investment Advisory Committee  (SIIAC) and Macquarie Sports Advisory Committee comprise senior  employees with a range of experience from across Macquarie. Acquisitions for the Macquarie Group Collection are made by an  Art Committee, comprising Macquarie employees, together with a  curatorial consultant. The Collection has a cohesive integrity and  it is the Art Committee’s responsibility to uphold this integrity  through the acquisition process.  Further information is available on pages 78 to 81  in the Macquarie Group Foundation section of this  Annual Report. Corporate reporting Periodic corporate reports are verified internally by management  prior to release to ASX and subject to external audit or review by  PwC as required. The verification process allocates disclosures  within the relevant document to designated persons to substantiate  the disclosures by reference to company source documents or, if  no source documents are available, by persons with the knowledge  and expertise to confirm the accuracy and completeness of  the disclosures. Financial reporting On behalf of the Board, the BAC: •	 oversees the quality and integrity of Macquarie’s financial  reporting and the operation of the financial reporting  processes: The processes are aimed at providing assurance  that the financial statements and related notes are complete, in  accordance with applicable legal requirements and accounting  standards and give a true and fair view of Macquarie’s financial  position and financial performance. During its review of  Macquarie’s interim and year-end financial reports the BAC  meets with the external auditor in the absence of management  •	 reviews the external auditor engagement: At least annually,  the BAC reviews the terms of the engagement and assesses the  performance, quality, expertise, resources and qualifications,  objectivity, independence and effectiveness of the external  auditor. During FY2024, the BAC oversaw Macquarie’s  comprehensive review of the external auditor. The governance  framework for the external auditor is described on page 48.  The BAC at least annually recommends to the Board the  continuation of, appointment of a new, or removal of the existing  external auditor •	 monitors and reviews the operation of Internal Audit: The BAC  monitors and reviews the degree of independence of the Head  of Internal Audit, their performance and remuneration (after  seeking input from the CRO) and approves their appointment  and removal. The BAC also approves the Internal Audit annual  plan and monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the Internal  Audit function •	 reviews the adequacy of Macquarie’s control framework for  financial regulatory reporting to banking regulators: The  BAC receives reports prepared by management that assess  the control effectiveness of Macquarie’s Operating and Central  Services Groups. Auditor independence Before the Board approves the interim and year-end financial  reports, the BAC reviews the independence of the external auditor,  PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). Macquarie’s Audit and Assurance Independence Policy sets out  the independence requirements Macquarie requires of its auditor.  The policy supplements the legal and professional standard  requirements applicable to its auditor in each jurisdiction. The  policy ensures the independence of the audit firm from MGL, its  subsidiaries and Macquarie’s managed funds and their controlled  portfolio companies.  To ensure an effective and efficient audit, and to ensure the  independence of the auditor, the policy guides the use of a single   ===== PAGE 48 ===== 48 Corporate Governance Statement Continued audit firm for MGL, its subsidiaries, Macquarie’s managed funds and  their controlled portfolio companies.  Where non-audit work to be performed by the external auditor  falls outside the scope of pre-approved services or the proposed  engagement fee exceeds the policy’s local currency threshold the  policy requires BAC approval, or approval of the BAC Chair between  meetings for subsequent noting by the BAC. The policy, which reflects Australian legal requirements, also  requires that Macquarie’s lead auditor and review auditor be rotated  every five years unless the Board grants approval to extend the  term for up to a further two years. As previously announced, in FY2023, the BAC recommended to  the Board, and the Board approved, a replacement lead auditor.  Ms Voula Papageorgiou of PwC replaced Ms Kristin Stubbins  as Macquarie’s lead auditor in FY2024. Ms Stubbins had been  Macquarie’s lead auditor since FY2020. PwC attended the Annual General Meeting (AGM) held during the  reporting period and was available to answer questions about  the conduct of the audit, and the preparation and content of the  auditor’s report. Macquarie’s auditor provides a declaration to the BAC at the time  of Macquarie’s interim and year-end financial reports, that no  prohibited non-audit services have been provided. The external  auditor is also required to declare in their audit report that they  are independent of MGL and its subsidiaries in accordance with  the auditor independence requirements of the Act and the ethical  requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards  Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants  (including Independence Standards) that are relevant to its audit of  the financial report in Australia. The External Auditor Policy Statement describe key aspects  of Macquarie’s Audit and Assurance Independence Policy  and external auditor review process, and are available at  macquarie.com/corporate-governance Review of the quality and effectiveness of  the external auditor’s performance  The BAC conducts an annual review of the quality and effectiveness  of the external auditor, including qualifications, expertise, resources  and performance of the external auditor, PwC. In addition to the  BAC’s annual external auditor review processes, a more detailed  comprehensive review of the external auditor will be conducted at  least every five years, beginning in FY2024. The annual evaluation involves assessing PwC’s performance  against ASIC’s audit quality guidance, obtaining feedback from the  Board and senior stakeholders across various Macquarie finance and  business teams, and obtaining and reviewing feedback from PwC  on the results of any internal or other external audit quality reviews  relating to the audit.  The comprehensive review conducted during FY2024 considered  the performance of the audit firm over several years – both at  Macquarie and as an audit firm in servicing its clients, its industry  expertise, application of professional scepticism, internal quality  processes and independence processes. This enhanced periodic  review strengthens the governance framework for the external  auditor and helps manage risks relating to the external auditor’s  independence and effectiveness, which may include the risk of  institutional familiarity arising from the external auditor’s tenure. The outcomes of the annual and comprehensive reviews were  presented to and discussed with the BAC, and separately discussed  with PwC. Having considered these outcomes, the BAC continues to  be satisfied with the audit quality of the auditor. The comprehensive review identified opportunities for both the  auditor and Macquarie to evolve the audit relationship. Macquarie has revised its Audit and Assurance Independence Policy  to include requirements relating to audit tender, comprehensive  review frequency and the provision of tax services, specifically: •	 Macquarie will tender the audit of MGL and its subsidiaries every  10 years and require the same of its managed funds and their  controlled portfolio companies, where circumstances allow, and  Macquarie has the power to require such appointment •	 Macquarie will continue to conduct a comprehensive review of  its auditor in the intervening 5-year period with timing aligned to  the rotation of the lead audit partner. Macquarie will continue to  conduct an annual review of the quality and effectiveness of its  auditor which aligns to ASIC’s audit quality guidance •	 Other than those tax services required for the audit or assurance  of the financial statements, MGL and its subsidiaries will cease  the use of its auditor for the provision of tax (including tax  compliance) services with effect from 1 April 2025 •	 Macquarie has minimal appetite for the provision of tax services  by the auditor to MGL and its subsidiaries and to Macquarie’s  managed funds and their controlled portfolio companies. Any  new engagement will require BAC approval, unless: 	– the managed funds or controlled portfolio companies have an  independent executive governance committee or board; and 	– that entity’s auditor independence policy contains equivalent  provisions as Macquarie’s policy. In limited commercial circumstances, and where the  independence of the auditor is not impaired, the BAC may  consider approving these services on an exceptional basis. Macquarie expects to tender the audit of MGL, its subsidiaries, and  its managed funds no later than mid-2026. Based on the outcomes of this year’s annual and comprehensive  reviews, and the auditor’s independence confirmations, the BAC  recommended to the Board that PwC continue in its role as  Macquarie’s external auditor. Board evaluation and consideration In FY2024, the Board exercised its continuing oversight of the  performance of the external auditor. Board members provided  feedback forming part of the comprehensive review of the external  auditor considered by the BAC to assess their effectiveness and  service quality. Based on that assessment, the results of the auditor independence  reviews and recommendation of the BAC, in May 2024 the Board  agreed that PwC should continue as Macquarie’s external auditor.  ===== PAGE 49 ===== 49 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Directors’ Report About Governance Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial  Officer declaration Before the MGL and MBL Boards consider and approve the interim  and year-end financial statements, each Board receives written  confirmation from their respective CEO and the Chief Financial  Officer (CFO) that, in their opinion, the financial records have been  properly maintained, the financial statements comply with the  appropriate accounting standards and give a true and fair view of  the company’s financial position and performance, and their opinion  is based on a sound system of risk management and internal control  which is operating effectively in all material respects Commitment to shareholders and an  informed market Macquarie is committed to ensuring that the market as a whole  is relevantly and consistently informed regarding information  about Macquarie by providing securityholders and the market with  timely, balanced, direct and equal access to information issued  by Macquarie, to promote investor confidence in the integrity of  Macquarie and in the trading of its securities. Macquarie has a Continuous Disclosure Policy, which outlines  the responsibility of the Continuous Disclosure Committee  for authorising the release of any price sensitive market  announcements, unless such announcement requires  Board approval.  All external communications that include any price sensitive  material for public announcement, annual and interim result  announcements, release of financial reports, presentations to  investors and analysts and other prepared investor presentations  for Macquarie will, in accordance with the Continuous  Disclosure Policy: •	 be factual and subject to internal review and authorisation  before issue •	 not omit material information •	 be timely and expressed in a clear and objective manner. Material announcements relating to matters that fall within the  reserved powers of the Board and not delegated to management,  or which are otherwise clearly within the purview of the Board’s  responsibilities, are referred to the Board for approval. The Board  receives copies of material market announcements promptly after  they have been released by ASX. Macquarie’s Continuous Disclosure Policy is available at  macquarie.com/corporate-governance Macquarie has an investor relations program to facilitate effective  two-way communication with investors and analysts and to provide  a greater understanding of Macquarie’s business, performance,  governance and financial prospects. Macquarie engages with  institutional investors, private investors, sell-side analysts and  buy-side analysts throughout the year via scheduled and ad  hoc interactions. As part of Macquarie’s commitment to keep its investor base  informed, management presents at various investment conferences  and conducts investor visits and meetings (including virtual)  throughout the year.  All material investor or analyst presentations are lodged  with ASX ahead of the presentation and made available on  Macquarie’s website. Macquarie’s website Recent announcements, past and current reports to shareholders,  including summaries of key financial data, operational briefing  presentations, AGM webcasts and copies of recent notices of  meeting are available on the investor centre page of our website.  Investor Relations contacts are also available on our website. Further information about Macquarie is available at  macquarie.com Shareholder meetings MGL encourages shareholders to participate in general meetings  and aims to choose a date, time and venue convenient to its  shareholders. For shareholders who are unable to attend in person,  MGL provides a webcast of its AGM and any other general meetings.  The results of all resolutions are lodged with ASX as soon as they  are available after the meeting. MGL typically holds its AGM in July each year. Notices of meeting are accompanied by explanatory notes on the  items of business and together they seek to clearly explain the  nature of business of the meeting. If shareholders are unable to attend the meeting, they are  encouraged to vote on the proposed motions by appointing a proxy.  The proxy form sent to shareholders explains how to appoint a  proxy. Online proxy voting is also available to shareholders. Unless specifically stated in a notice of meeting, all holders of  fully paid ordinary shares are eligible to vote on all resolutions.  MGL’s practice is that voting on each proposed resolution is  conducted by poll. MGL seeks to conduct its shareholder meetings in a courteous  manner for those attending. In the interests of attending  shareholders, the Chair of the meeting will exercise their powers to  ensure the meeting is conducted in an orderly and timely fashion. MGL’s 2023 AGM was held as a hybrid meeting with shareholders  able to attend in person or online. Shareholders were provided  with various alternatives to participate in the AGM, including  by watching the AGM live through a facility that enabled  shareholders to vote and to ask questions or make comments  online and a dial-in teleconference to listen to the meeting live  and to ask questions on the telephone but not vote. Shareholder communications Shareholders can elect to receive communications from, and send  communications to, MGL and MGL’s share registry electronically by  visiting the Investor contacts page on Macquarie’s website.

Ownership of risk at the business level  Understanding worst case outcomes Independent sign-off by Risk Management Group  Supported by a sound risk culture The Board annually approves Macquarie’s Risk Appetite Statement  and Risk Management Strategy. The BRiC assists the Board by  providing oversight of Macquarie’s risk management framework and  advising the Board on Macquarie’s risk appetite, risk culture and risk  management strategy. The BRiC constructively challenges management’s proposals and  decisions on risk management arising from Macquarie’s activities.  The Board is also assisted by the BAC, BRC and BGCC in its oversight  of financial and non-financial risk. Each year, including FY2024, the Board oversees the operation  of Macquarie’s risk management framework by management to  satisfy itself that the framework continues to be appropriate and  that Macquarie is operating with due regard to the risk appetite  set by the Board. Key components of the framework are reviewed  by the relevant Risk Management Group (RMG) divisions and the  results are reported to the Board. The Internal Audit Division (IAD)  independently and objectively reviews the compliance with, and  effectiveness of, Macquarie’s risk management framework at least  annually, with coverage of all material elements of the framework  over a 3-year period. The risk management framework has been established on the  premise that a disciplined approach to risk management is best  maintained with a single risk management framework that is applied  appropriately throughout Macquarie (including the Bank Group). In  addition, the Bank Group maintains its own governance structure,  which includes the MBL Board and Board Committees, MBL CEO,  MBL Executive Committee and other management committees. Macquarie’s risk culture A sound risk culture has been integral to Macquarie’s risk  management framework since inception. Macquarie sets, promotes,  monitors and reflects on the effectiveness of our risk culture. All  staff have a role in managing risk. Ownership of risk, including risk  culture, is at the business level. The Board, assisted by the BRiC,  is responsible for forming a view on Macquarie’s risk culture and  the extent to which it supports the ability of Macquarie to operate  consistently within its risk appetite. The Board also identifies  and monitors any necessary or desirable actions to change the  risk culture. Chief Risk Officer The Head of RMG, as Macquarie’s CRO, is a member of the  Executive Committee and reports directly to the CEO. The CRO  has a secondary reporting line to the BRiC, which reviews the  performance and objectives of the CRO and approves the  appointment and removal of the CRO. The CRO has unfettered  access to the Board, the BRiC and its Chair. The BRiC meets with  the CRO, in the absence of other management, at least annually to  discuss any matters that the BRiC or the CRO believe should be  discussed privately. The CRO reports risk matters at the BRiC  meetings. Where there is no scheduled BRiC meeting, the CRO  presents risk matters at a Board meeting. Internal audit The IAD provides independent and objective risk-based assurance  to the BAC, Board, other relevant Board Committees and Senior  Management on the compliance with, and effectiveness of,  Macquarie’s financial and risk management framework, including its  governance, systems, structures, policies, processes and people for  managing material risks.  The structure of the IAD, and further details of  Macquarie’s risk management approach, are contained on  pages 82 to 88 in the Risk Management section of this  Annual Report.   ===== PAGE 51 ===== 51 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Directors’ Report About Governance Environmental, Social and Governance risk The Board and management recognise the importance of sound  Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) practices as part of  their responsibility to our shareholders, funders, clients, employees  and the communities in which Macquarie operates. Macquarie’s ESG approach is structured around eight focus areas  considered to be material to our business and stakeholders. They  are: environmental and social risk management; climate change;  environmental and social financing; sustainability in our own  business operations; client and customer experience; people and  workplace; business conduct and ethics; and community. Building  on What We Stand For and the Code of Conduct, these focus areas  reflect the risks and opportunities identified by the business and the  issues of interest to our stakeholders. Environmental and social risks have been identified as material  risk events within Macquarie’s risk management framework, while  climate change and net zero transition are incorporated as causal  risks under External Risk and Strategic/Business Risk, respectively,  within Macquarie’s risk management framework. Information on Macquarie’s management of environmental  and social risks, including climate-related, nature-related, and  human rights risks, are provided within the ESG section of this  Annual Report. Further details are also available in Macquarie’s  Net Zero and Climate Risk Report and Modern Slavery Act  Transparency Statement. Additional information is available at macquarie.com/esg  and macquarie.com/risk-management Oversight of remuneration Macquarie’s longstanding and consistent approach to remuneration  continues to support Macquarie’s purpose statement, ‘Empowering  people to innovate and invest for a better future’. Staff interests  are aligned with shareholders to meet the needs of clients and  customers, while ensuring that the spirit and intent of regulatory  requirements are upheld. This broad approach has been in place  since Macquarie’s inception and is reviewed regularly to ensure  the framework continues to meet our remuneration objectives  and aligns with our remuneration principles and the expectations  of stakeholders. MGL’s NEDs oversee management’s implementation of Macquarie’s  remuneration framework. The BRC assists the Board with  Macquarie’s remuneration policies and practices. Non-Executive Director remuneration MGL’s NEDs are remunerated for their services from the maximum  aggregate annual amount approved by shareholders, currently  $A5 million. They do not receive payments on their retirement from  office other than payments relating to their accrued superannuation  contributions comprising part of their remuneration, if any. To align the interests of the Board with shareholders, NEDs are  required to have a meaningful direct shareholding in MGL. Unlike  Macquarie executives, NEDs are not granted equity nor are they  eligible to receive profit share payments. The Board minimum shareholding requirement for: •	 NEDs other than the Chair, is an investment equivalent to one  times the average annual NED fee for the financial year ended  prior to their appointment •	 the Chair, is an investment equivalent to one times the  annual Chair fee with the minimum number of shares to be acquired by NEDs  determined using the share price as at the date of appointment. The above requirements apply to MGL’s NEDs and are to be  met within three years from appointment with one third of the  requirement to be held after one year, two thirds after two years  and in full after three years. Each NED’s current Macquarie shareholding is set out in the  Key Management Personnel disclosure on page 150 in the  Remuneration Report of this Annual Report.  Executive remuneration  Macquarie’s remuneration framework has been a key driver of  our sustained success as an international organisation. Staff are  motivated to grow businesses over the medium to long-term,  taking accountability for all decisions and their accompanying risk  management, customer, economic and reputational outcomes. This  approach has been fundamental in ensuring we can continue to  attract, motivate and retain exceptional and entrepreneurial people  with deep industry expertise across the 34 markets in which we  operate. It is characterised by an emphasis on performance-based  remuneration, profit share determined based on a range of financial  and non-financial factors and retaining a significant proportion of  performance-based remuneration to enable risk outcomes to be  considered over a longer period. Macquarie’s remuneration framework works as an integrated whole.  An individual’s remuneration comprises fixed remuneration, profit  share and, for Executive Committee members (our Executive Key  Management Personnel (Executive KMP)), Performance Share Units.  Macquarie retains a percentage of each individuals’ annual profit  share allocation (retained profit share) above a certain threshold.  This is invested in a combination of Macquarie ordinary shares  under the Macquarie Group Employee Retained Equity Plan and  Macquarie-managed fund equity. Details of Macquarie’s approach and the amount of  remuneration paid to NEDs and Executive KMP are  contained on pages 106 to 156 in the Remuneration Report  of this Annual Report.  ===== PAGE 52 ===== 52 Corporate Governance Statement Continued Key policies Dealing with potential conflicts Macquarie’s Conflicts of Interest Policy sets out the framework,  controls and administration for identifying, preventing and  managing conflicts of interest – whether actual, potential  or perceived. Macquarie has established various systems and controls to prevent  and manage conflicts of interest, many of which are outlined in  Macquarie’s policies in relation to conflicts of interest, information  barriers and confidentiality, investment research, personal  investments, gifts and entertainment, outside business activities,  allocations of financial products, personal relationships in the  workplace and political contributions. Conflict checks are required  prior to entering into certain business arrangements. Staff are expected to appropriately manage or avoid any conflict  of interest between Macquarie or its clients and the interests of a  staff member. Activities such as personal investment and outside  business activities are subject to disclosure and pre-approval. Managing conflicts of interest forms part of the training on What  We Stand For and the Code of Conduct for all new and existing staff. Trading Macquarie securities  Key requirements of the Trading Policy include: •	 trading prohibition while in possession of material non-public  information: dealing in Macquarie securities while in possession  of inside information is prohibited •	 trading windows: generally, Directors and staff may only trade  in Macquarie securities during designated trading windows  following MGL’s announcement of its interim results, full year  results and AGM •	 pre‑clear securities trading: directors and staff must pre-clear  their Macquarie securities trading •	 excluded dealings: certain types of transactions such as  acquisition of securities under an employee share plan or  participation in a dividend reinvestment plan may be effected  outside a trading window without pre-clearance •	 unvested equity held in the MEREP and shares held to meet  the minimum shareholding requirement cannot be hedged. Each member of the Board is encouraged to consider positions in a  Macquarie security as a long-term investment and is not permitted  to trade derivatives relating to a Macquarie security without the  prior approval of the Chair of the Board (in consultation with  the CEO). Board members and Executive KMP are also required  to annually disclose to Macquarie any financing arrangements  relating to their Macquarie securities and manage their financing  arrangements in accordance with Macquarie’s policies. MGL’s Trading Policy sets out the restrictions that apply  to dealing in Macquarie securities by Directors and  Macquarie staff, including Executive KMP, and is available at  macquarie.com/corporate-governance Corporate governance in  Macquarie‑managed funds Macquarie’s expertise in managing fund assets and sourcing new  value-adding opportunities is a key attraction for investors in  Macquarie-managed funds (Funds). The Funds adopt an appropriate governance framework to ensure  that key decisions are taken in the best interests of investors  consistent with the Funds’ mandates and regulatory requirements. Macquarie’s Statement of Corporate Governance in  Macquarie‑managed Funds sets out the key elements  of the corporate governance framework for  Macquarie-managed funds and is available  at macquarie.com/corporate-governance This Corporate Governance Statement is current as at   2 May 2024 and has been approved by the Board. Our Key to Disclosures (Appendix 4G) has been  lodged with ASX and is available at  macquarie.com/corporate-governance  ===== PAGE 53 ===== 53 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Directors’ Report About Governance ESG approach and governance The Board and Management recognise the importance of sound Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) practices as part of their  responsibility to shareholders, funders, clients, employees, and the communities in which Macquarie operates. Macquarie’s ESG approach is  structured around eight focus areas considered to be material to our business and stakeholders. The Board is responsible for approving Macquarie’s ESG framework, including major ESG policies. In accordance with its Charter, the  Board Governance and Compliance Committee (BGCC) assists the Board in adopting appropriate governance standards and reviewing and  monitoring Macquarie’s environmental and social risk management policies, practices and performance. Management is responsible for  implementation of the ESG framework. ESG focus areas Environmental and social risk management (see page 56)  Assessing and managing environmental and social risks (including work health and safety risks) is a key business priority  for Macquarie. Failure to effectively manage these risks could result in harm to communities, the environment and other  external parties, and expose the organisation to regulatory, reputational and financial impacts. Climate change (see page 59)  Macquarie’s approach to climate is based around four areas of action. This includes: reducing the emissions of our own  business operations; leveraging our knowledge to help others decarbonise; aligning our financing activity with the global  goal of net zero emissions by 2050; and increasing investment in climate mitigation and adaption solutions. Environmental and social financing (see page 62)  Across our Operating Groups, Macquarie is supporting a range of activities under the following broad categories: financing  and developing; advising; managing; researching and trading. Sustainability in our own business operations (see page 65)  The environmental and social impacts of Macquarie’s own business operations predominantly relate to the energy and  resources we consume in our offices and data centres, business travel, and our procurement activities. We seek to manage  these impacts by monitoring and reducing our operational emissions, developing innovative and sustainable workplaces,  being efficient with energy and resource use, and improving the sustainability and diversity of our supply chain. Client and customer experience (see page 69)  Macquarie’s relationships with our clients and customers, and their trust in us, is central to our business and future success.  Macquarie focuses on delivering exceptional outcomes, services and customer experiences, continuously building on the  trust and confidence in our organisation. People and workplace (see page 71)  At Macquarie, we foster a culture that welcomes diverse ideas and perspectives and empowers individuals to explore  what’s possible in an environment that values inclusion, collaboration, innovation and creativity.  Business conduct and ethics (see page 72)  Macquarie’s organisational culture drives the way we do business, and our expectations of our people are outlined  in Macquarie’s Code of Conduct. Our principles of Opportunity, Accountability and Integrity determine how we  conduct business. Community (see page 78)  The Macquarie Group Foundation (the Foundation) drives social impact work for Macquarie, supporting its people,  businesses, and communities to build a better future. In FY2024, $A67m was contributed by Macquarie employees and the  Foundation ($A641m since inception).  Environmental, Social and Governance  ===== PAGE 54 ===== 54 Environmental, Social and Governance Continued Process for determining our ESG focus areas Macquarie’s ESG approach is structured around eight focus areas  considered to be material to our business and stakeholders.  On an annual basis, we identify the ESG focus areas and topics  most material to our business and stakeholders by assessing the  environmental, social (including human rights) and economic  impacts of our activities and business relationships. Stakeholder engagement Clear dialogue with stakeholders is important for building strong  relationships, understanding external dynamics, earning and  maintaining trust, enhancing business performance and evolving  our ESG approach. We regularly engage with a broad range of  stakeholders including clients, customers, shareholders, investors,  analysts, governments, regulators, employees, suppliers and the  wider community. Our engagement with stakeholders helps identify and validate our  ESG focus areas. Materiality process We refer to the approach of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)  (GRI 3: Material Topics 2021) to determine our ESG focus areas.  This involves: •	 understanding the organisation’s context: gathering and  analysing data and information from a broad range of external  and internal sources to better understand the context in which  we operate •	 identifying negative and positive, actual and potential  impacts and assessing their significance: analysing direct  external stakeholder feedback and engaging across our  Operating and Central Service Groups to identify impacts,  generate a real-world perspective of stakeholder priorities and  evaluate the relative importance of material ESG topics across  our activities •	 prioritising the most significant impacts for reporting:  utilising inputs from our research and engagement to determine  the most material impacts to report •	 validating our ESG focus areas and material ESG topics:  testing our material ESG topics with internal stakeholders and  against external standards and market expectations. (1)	 ESG topics are listed in the order in which they are discussed in the relevant sections of this report. Some ESG topics are relevant across more than one ESG focus area and have  therefore been repeated in the table above. To avoid duplication, these may not be discussed in detail within each relevant section. ESG focus areas The ESG topics identified during the FY2024 materiality process  were the same as those identified in FY2023. As a result, our eight  overarching ESG focus areas remain unchanged.

Given the growing number of standards and best practices,  Macquarie welcomes moves by regulators and governments to  progress disclosure requirements to enable consistent reporting and  approaches across the industry. During the year, the International  Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) published the following  sustainability reporting standards: •	 IFRS S1 General Requirements of Sustainability-related  Financial Information (IFRS S1), which sets out the overall  requirements for sustainability-related financial disclosures; and •	 IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures (IFRS S2), which will require  the disclosure of information that enables the users of financial  statements to understand the reporting entity’s governance,  strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets in relation  to climate-related risks and opportunities.  In Australia, the proposed sustainability standards have been  issued for exposure and comment while proposed legislation has  been tabled in Parliament under the Treasury Laws Amendment  (Financial Market Infrastructure and Other Measures) Bill 2024  (Cth). In the present form, these requirements would have the  MGL Consolidated Entity commence reporting for its FY2026  financial year. Macquarie acknowledges the growing importance  of sustainability-related disclosures and continues to progress its  established project to assess and prepare for future sustainability  and climate-related reporting obligations. Independent assurance PwC has provided limited assurance over select ESG metrics for  the FY2024 reporting period, as detailed in the PwC independent  assurance report available within Macquarie’s FY2024 Basis of  Preparation for ESG Reporting on our website. This also sets out  the reporting boundaries, metric definitions and measurement  methodologies for the assured metrics.

They are supported  by the Environmental and Social Risk (ESR) team. The ESR team coordinates a diverse range of ESG activities across  Macquarie, including developing and implementing company-wide  and business-specific policies, reviewing transactions, providing  advice on environmental and social risks and opportunities and  facilitating training. The ESR team provides six-monthly reports to  the CRO and BGCC on environmental and social risk management  policies, practices and performance. Details on Macquarie’s approach to assessing and managing its  material risks, and our broader risk management framework are  included on pages 82–88 in the Risk management section of this  Annual Report. Environmental and social risks are managed through the  implementation of the ESR and WHS policies. These are updated  periodically to address opportunities for improvement and  emerging issues. Macquarie’s ESR Policy describes our approach to ESR management  when onboarding or reviewing clients and other counterparties and  across a broad range of transactions including equity investments,  financing, leasing and advisory mandates. The ESR Policy provides  a process to assess, manage, mitigate, monitor and report  environmental and social risks and takes a precautionary approach  to ESR issues including labour and employment practices, climate  change, human rights, resource efficiency, pollution prevention,  biodiversity and cultural heritage. Guided by international  guidelines, including the International Finance Corporation  Performance Standards, the ESR Policy provides escalated  decision-making and approval processes, alongside the credit and  broader RMG approval processes, for material environmental and  social risks. Transactions with material environmental and social  risks are referred to the CRO and may be escalated to the CEO or  at least two Non-Executive Directors of the Board. Macquarie’s WHS Policy describes our approach to recognise,  support and promote the rights of every worker throughout  our global operations and investment activities. The WHS Policy  outlines how we apply our WHS risk management principles for:  Macquarie’s day-to-day operations and potential impacts to  our people, third-party suppliers and visitors to Macquarie  premises; product and services provided to our clients; and  investments in businesses or projects by Macquarie or on  behalf of third-party investors. (2)	 Includes risk managers and those in specific business groups with greatest potential exposure to environmental, social and WHS risks. Excludes global online WHS training  completions. Some employees may have attended more than one training session, in which case their attendance was counted for each session.

Macquarie considers the risks of climate change  (climate risk) to be cross-cutting, meaning we recognise climate  risk may impact a broad range of material risks within our risk  management framework as detailed on pages 82–88 in the Risk  management section of this Annual Report. Macquarie continues  to embed and enhance the identification, assessment, monitoring,  management and reporting of climate risks across the risk  management framework.  Human rights Macquarie respects fundamental human rights as set out in  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and codified in  the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the  International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and  core International Labour Organization Conventions.  Macquarie has a company-wide framework of polices and processes  in place to identify, prevent or mitigate and, where relevant,  remediate potential and actual human rights impacts, including  modern slavery, resulting from our business activities and the  relationships connected to those activities. Macquarie’s Modern Slavery Statement can be downloaded  from macquarie.com/human-rights-at-macquarie Nature and biodiversity Macquarie recognises that nature-related risks, such as biodiversity  loss, can have material economic, social and environmental  implications. We have no tolerance for breaches of environmental and social laws  and regulations. We seek to comply with recognised international  standards to ensure that our business activities limit harm to  the environment. We seek to make a positive contribution to  environmental performance, including considering our direct  and indirect impacts and dependencies on resource efficiency  and pollution prevention, biodiversity and natural resource  management, and environmentally sensitive or protected areas. During FY2024, Macquarie Asset Management (MAM) continued  to support the development of frameworks to identify, measure  and disclose nature-related risk and impacts as a founding member  of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD).  Furthermore, Macquarie participated in a pilot study sponsored  by the Australian Government’s Department of Climate Change,  Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) to obtain a better  understanding of the challenges, barriers and opportunities for  Australian organisations in preparing for the adoption of the  TNFD framework. Work health and safety, and wellbeing At Macquarie we are committed to providing safe workplaces where  our employees, contractors and visitors can work and collaborate  without risk of physical and psychological harm. Macquarie’s WHS vision, ‘Safe workplaces that enable and empower  people to do their best work’, is designed in connection with our  purpose of ‘Empowering people to innovate and invest for a better  future’. Our strong culture of leadership, governance and assurance  is integral to how we do this. Our WHS practices are supported by: •	 clear expectations and behaviours agreed with Macquarie  employees, contractors, visitors and business partners •	 incorporation of WHS into our investment and business  decision-making processes •	 WHS management frameworks and controls to: manage  safety-critical risks effectively; comply with laws, regulatory  obligations and standards; select, contract with and govern  third-party suppliers; and enable effective consultation and  communication of relevant WHS matters and information •	 sufficient resourcing to manage material WHS risks •	 measuring, monitoring and managing the progress of our  WHS performance to achieve our WHS vision. Continued integration of work health and safety  into the investment lifecycle and tailored Safety  Alignment Frameworks across all Macquarie  Operating Groups Health, safety and wellbeing of our people The safety and wellbeing of all our people is at the centre of  Macquarie’s vision to create a healthy and safe environment by  identifying, preventing, and managing work-related physical and  psychosocial risks.  Our people are provided with opportunities to engage in health  and safety forums and consultation committees to address local  and regional WHS matters. This input assists in shaping our focus  for future wellbeing initiatives and strategies for injury and illness  prevention and management.  ===== PAGE 58 ===== 58 Environmental, Social and Governance Continued To maintain a safety-positive culture and manage our WHS risks  effectively, Macquarie has implemented: •	 resources supporting the identification of health and wellbeing  risks, trends and insights used to proactively work on  preventative measures to improve the physical and psychological  health and safety of our people •	 ongoing access to education, assessment and equipment for the  prevention of workplace injuries and incidents •	 access to mental health and wellbeing training and resources  for our employees, including employee and family counselling,  mental health first-aid, health coaching, financial counselling  and targeted support and training for people leaders in leading a  mentally healthy workplace  •	 resources to support the identification of potential work-related  psychosocial risks, including through regular review and  workplace assessment •	 an enhanced event management standard to ensure WHS risks,  including conduct-related risks, are appropriately identified,  assessed, and managed. In addition to these health and safety initiatives, Macquarie’s  holistic wellbeing program, Macquarie Plus, provides a  comprehensive range of wellbeing benefits to equip our people with  the tools and resources to help prevent and manage any physical or  psychological injury and illness. Macquarie’s Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) in FY2024  was 0.18.(5) In FY2024, 99% of our people completed global online  Conduct at Macquarie training, including managing and responding  to psychosocial risks and expected standards of behaviour relating  to sexual harassment. Health and safety in our investments Macquarie integrates WHS into the investment lifecycle from due  diligence prior to investment, through to divestment. We believe  there is a strong correlation between actively managing WHS risk  and improving investment returns. This includes identifying WHS  risks and improvement opportunities at acquisition, if necessary  establishing transition plans in agreement with shareholders and  assets, and monitoring investments’ WHS performance throughout  the investment lifecycle. Macquarie’s Operating Groups have tailored Safety Alignment  Frameworks to address the specific WHS risk profiles within our  investments. Frameworks are regularly reviewed and enhanced  to drive consistent WHS governing principles and expectations  for equity and fund management portfolio companies, seeking to  eliminate fatalities and serious injuries. In FY2024, 205 Macquarie  Nominee Directors received WHS governance training and are  supported by a network of senior WHS professionals. (5)	 Lost time Injury (LTI) is an incident that results in time lost from work equal to or greater than a full day/shift. The LTI Frequency Rate (LTIFR) is the number of LTIs resulting in a  compensable claim per million workhours. Data is based on total global workforce for the period 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024, for Macquarie employees. WHS is the responsibility of each portfolio company. The portfolio  company board oversees the management of WHS and regularly  monitors and reports on WHS performance and risk management  to Macquarie, including high potential near miss reporting and  outcomes of incident investigations where there was a fatality or  serious injury. During FY2024, Macquarie increased its focus on critical safety  risk management with the identification of high-risk sectors  and industries based on our investment insights, including the  introduction of additional WHS performance metrics. Macquarie  continues to focus on implementing WHS leading practices,  improvement initiatives, ensuring adequate WHS resources are  in place, updating WHS performance metrics and sharing lessons  learnt across our regions and Operating Groups. This also includes  Macquarie regularly promoting intra-industry WHS forums to share  lessons between organisations and across regions. In FY2024, 19  safety alerts and lessons were shared across our organisation. More detailed information, including examples of how we  put WHS into practice, is available at macquarie.com/esg  ===== PAGE 59 ===== 59 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Directors’ Report About Governance Climate change At Macquarie, our approach to addressing climate challenges is  rooted in our purpose of ‘Empowering people to innovate and invest  for a better future’.  We believe we can contribute most positively to the challenges and  opportunities of climate change mitigation and adaptation through  the financing of practical solutions driven by the core capabilities  of our teams. Over the course of FY2024, we continued to drive  additional capacity in established clean energy technologies,  while also investing in emerging technologies that seek to reduce  emissions across energy, transportation, land use, buildings, waste  and industrial processes. While our fossil fuel financed emissions(6) remain relatively small  compared to global peers, we continue to believe that an effective  transition must be managed, orderly and just. Consistent with that  philosophy, and in recognition that much of the world will depend  on the oil/gas industries for years to come, we are working with  our oil/gas clients to help them reduce their emissions as well as  maintain sufficient energy supply. In addition, our commodity  trading activities are helping clients manage their transition risks  by maintaining and developing deep and liquid hedging markets,  including in emerging commodities essential to the transition,  thereby providing greater price certainty as they navigate this  historic transformation. Macquarie’s approach to climate is based around  four areas of action The climate strategy set out in our 2023 Net Zero and Climate Risk  Report is based around four areas of action: 1 Continue to reduce the emissions of our own  business operations 2 Leverage our knowledge and networks to help  others decarbonise 3 Align our financing activity with the global goal  of net zero emissions by 2050 4 Increase investment in climate mitigation and  adaptation solutions (6)	 For a detailed explanation of our financed emissions, refer to Appendix 3 of our 2023 Net Zero and Climate Risk Report. (7)	 MAM generally only has influence over Scope 1 and 2 emissions. However, to the extent possible, in line with the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative guidance, MAM intends to  support assets where it has control or significant influence to reduce their Scope 3 emissions. (8)	 The Paris Agreement’s central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by maintaining a global temperature rise this century well below 2°C above  pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5°C. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded the need for net zero  emissions by 2050 to remain consistent with 1.5°C. (9)	 Own business operations’ Scope 3 covers Categories 1–8 operational value chain emissions as defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting  and Reporting Standard. It excludes financed emissions (Scope 3, Category 15). Separately to Macquarie’s direct financing activities, MAM has made  a commitment to invest and manage its portfolio in line with global  net zero Scope 1 and 2 financed greenhouse gas emissions by 2040,  where it has control or significant influence.(7) Where MAM does  not have control or significant influence, such as in its managed  portfolio of public securities, it will continue to support the goals of  the Paris Agreement(8) in a manner consistent with its client-guided  fiduciary and regulatory responsibilities. Further details on MAM’s  net zero commitment can be found on the MAM website. 1. Continue to reduce the emissions of our own  business operations We have committed to net zero emissions in our own business  operations across Scope 1 and 2 by FY2025 and are progressing  well towards achieving this. As part of this commitment, we are  aiming to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions from a FY2020 baseline,  including purchasing renewable electricity for our office premises  in line with our RE100 commitment. We are continuing to  purchase carbon credits to offset residual Scope 1 emissions  that are difficult to abate, and we continue to offset our Scope 3  Category 6: Business travel emissions. In relation to our own  business operations’ Scope 3 emissions, we are developing methods  to measure and track emission reductions and are working towards  Scope 3 operational value chain emissions reduction targets aligned  to science.(9)  More details can be found on pages 65–68 and in Macquarie’s 2025  Sustainability Plan which articulates our corporate sustainability  commitments with specific and measurable targets across  environmental and social pillars. Macquarie’s 2025 Sustainability Plan can be downloaded  from macquarie.com/esg-sustainability-in-  business-operations 2. Leverage our knowledge and networks to help  others decarbonise As part of our broader activities, which are described on pages  20–32 in the Operating and financial review section of this Annual  Report, each Operating Group is engaging in a range of activities  aligned to Macquarie’s climate strategy and net zero commitments.  This involves partnering with clients and engaging with portfolio  companies in different ways to scale clean energy solutions and  support their decarbonisation journeys.

Align our financing activity with the global goal of  net zero emissions by 2050 A key aspect of Macquarie’s climate strategy is prioritising efforts  to reduce financed emissions in carbon-intensive sectors, to help set  a path for the global goal of net zero emissions by 2050. We have  estimated our financed emissions and set interim targets for the  residential mortgage, oil/gas, motor vehicle and coal sectors: •	 for residential mortgages we have set a 2030 interim target  of 11.6–19.3 kgCO2e/m2 for Scope 1 and 2 which implies a  50–70% reduction in physical emissions intensity from the  FY2021 baseline •	 for oil/gas we are making progress towards our 2030 interim  target of 56.3–59.6 gCO2e/MJ for Scope 1, 2 and 3 which implies  a 9–14% reduction in physical emissions intensity from the  FY2020 baseline •	 for motor vehicles we had set a 2030 interim target of  147 gCO2e/km for Scope 1 and 2 which implies a 34% reduction  in physical emissions intensity from the FY2020 baseline. BFS  no longer originates new car loans and finance leases and the  interim target when adopted had assumed that this business  was ongoing. Our physical emissions intensity for this portfolio  will be determined by the remaining vehicle mix as loans and  leases run-off •	 for coal, we are on track to run-off our remaining on-balance  sheet lending and equity exposures to the coal sector by the  end of 2024.(10) We now have targets in place for over 80% of our dollar exposures  to carbon-intensive sectors and, in line with the Net-Zero Banking  Alliance (NZBA) Guidelines for Climate Target Setting – Supporting  notes (Guidelines), we will outline our approach to all remaining  material carbon-intensive sectors in our next Net Zero and Climate  Risk Report.(11),(12) In addition to the four sectors where we have set  financed emissions targets, for the first time this year, we reported  historical emissions in the power generation sector of 0.75 MtCO2e  for Scope 1.(13)  Our approach to coal Our broader approach to coal continues to evolve to reflect the  needs of the energy transition and industry practice: •	 in 2021 we announced our intention to run-off our limited  remaining on-balance sheet lending and equity exposures to coal  companies by the end of 2024.(10) This commitment is on track  and applies to coal companies in both the mining and coal-fired  power generation sectors, and to both metallurgical and thermal  coal. At the time of making the 2021 coal commitment, we  followed the then standard industry practice of classifying  clients as coal companies based on ANZSIC and GICS codes  (10)	 Lending refers to loan assets held at amortised cost and excludes certain items such as leasing, asset finance, trading assets and short-term financing (e.g., inventory finance). (11)	 The percentage of dollar exposures is shown as at 31 March 2023. Exposures include on‑balance sheet lending and equity investments. In addition, for motor vehicles, exposures  include novated leases. See Appendix 3 of the 2023 Net Zero and Climate Risk Report for details. (12)	 UN Environment Programme, Finance Initiative (2022), Guidelines for Climate Target Setting – Supporting notes. (13)	 For National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) proxied renewable power generation assets, this also includes immaterial Scope 2 emissions. (14)	 Advisory transactions are defined as advisory mandates, introducer roles or similar structures, Debt Capital Markets transactions on a best endeavours (non-underwritten) basis  and Equity Capital Markets transactions where there is strong confidence that there is no (or will be no) net underwriting risk exposure post book closure. (15)	 International Energy Agency (2023), World Energy Outlook 2023. •	 in 2022, based on the NZBA Guidelines, we began defining coal  companies based on the proportion of a company’s revenue  that comes from coal-related activities. Given computational  challenges associated with revenue shares (particularly in a world  of high and volatile coal prices), we have consistently defined a  coal company as one that derives the majority (i.e., more than  50%) of its revenue from coal (both thermal and metallurgical)  production, mine ownership or operation, or coal-fired power  station ownership or operation. We acknowledge that the 50%  threshold is not in line with the NZBA Guidelines, which define  a coal company as one that derives more than 5% of revenues  directly from thermal coal only  •	 separately, Macquarie also committed to not enter into new  business activity with any counterparty where the underlying  purpose is to fund the purchase, development or expansion  of a coal mine or coal-fired power station. Commencing April  2024, we have refined this commitment to note that advisory  transactions where the underlying purpose is to fund the  purchase, development or expansion of a metallurgical coal mine  will be in appetite.(14) This takes into consideration the ongoing  importance of metallurgical coal for steel making, the industry’s  differential treatment of metallurgical and thermal coal, and  the short-term nature of advisory relationships. Thermal coal  buy-side advisory mandates remain out of appetite •	 the global community has recognised the urgent need to  reduce global carbon emissions and the importance of working  with carbon intensive industries, such as coal, to help them  decarbonise. As noted in our 2023 Net Zero and Climate Risk  Report, we will maintain the ability to work with coal companies  to finance projects that will significantly reduce their carbon  emissions in line with science-based scenarios or are for the  purpose of diversifying away from the coal sector in line with a  credible transition plan. 4. Increase investment in climate mitigation and  adaptation solutions The International Energy Agency (IEA) has suggested that annual  clean energy investment worldwide will need to increase from  $US1.8 trillion in 2023 to $US4.3 trillion by 2030 to put the world on  track to reaching net zero emissions by 2050.(15) This will require a  collective effort across the private and public sectors. Supporting  this need, our businesses are focused on providing solutions to our  clients to help them and the communities we serve to navigate the  challenges and opportunities ahead.

Drawing on our global network,  sector expertise and strong track record, Macquarie provides a  diverse range of products and services with an ESG outcome to  corporate, government and institutional clients. Our activities  span the investment cycle from research on alternative energy to  tailored capital solutions for the development and construction of  renewable assets and social infrastructure.  Across our Operating Groups, Macquarie is supporting a range of  environmental and social financing activity under the following  broad categories: financing and developing; advising; managing;  researching and trading. Our activities are described on pages 20–32  in the Operating and financial review section of this Annual Report. Financing and developing To further support our climate ambition, Green Investment  Group (GIG) moved from Macquarie Capital to Macquarie Asset  Management (MAM) in April 2022 (now MAM Green Investments).  This allows us to combine the market leading renewables project  development and finance expertise of MAM Green Investments and  its portfolio of specialist development platforms with the fiduciary  capital resources entrusted to MAM, thereby providing access  to larger pools of capital and finance that in turn will allow us to  facilitate the development of renewables projects on a much larger  scale. The sell-down of on-balance sheet MAM Green Investments  assets is ongoing. 110 GW of green energy assets in development, under  construction or currently operating, as at  31 March 2024 measured using 100% of generating  capacity for assets managed / owned (including  partially) by Macquarie(16),(17)  $A2.4 billion invested or arranged in green energy assets for the  year ended 31 March 2024(17),(18)  (16)	 On our balance sheet or under Macquarie management.

Examples of environmental and social financing and development  activities from across our Operating Groups are described below. MAM’s specialist Green Investments team is connecting clients  to a range of green investment opportunities and transition  solutions, across technologies, geographies, and stages of the  energy transition.  In core renewables, MAM is working to help accelerate deployment  and create scale, with the launch of its Australian and New Zealand  onshore renewable energy business Aula Energy in November  2023, as well as MAM portfolio companies Corio Generation and  Cero Generation taking part in country-first projects and auctions  globally. In addition to the mature technologies of wind and solar,  MAM is investing across the next generation of decarbonisation  solutions – such as French battery manufacturer Verkor and  green nitrogen fertiliser company Atlas Agro in September and  October 2023 respectively. CGM is developing and deploying climate solutions that meet  our clients’ diverse needs and ambitions to help them with  their decarbonisation pathways. CGM is supporting clients in  carbon-intensive industries, like oil and gas, to reduce their  emissions while maintaining the vital services they provide and on  which our communities and industries still rely. The scale and breadth of the energy transition is driving the delivery  of holistic solutions across CGM’s activities, markets, and client  sectors, which includes actively investing in and financing a variety  of decarbonisation and sustainability initiatives globally. These are  captured under the following broad verticals: carbon and emissions;  renewable and flexible power; clean fuels; sustainable transport;  critical minerals; the circular economy; and sustainable finance. CGM has recently established a low-carbon fuels platform, providing  market access and working capital solutions across the methanol  supply chain via structured supply and offtake solutions.   ===== PAGE 63 ===== 63 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Directors’ Report About Governance In addition, CGM continues to be a long-term strategic partner  of Storegga, a UK-based independent, international developer of  Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), hydrogen and direct air capture  projects. CGM was a cornerstone investor in Storegga’s first  equity raise in mid-2020 and has supported three further funding  rounds, helping the company grow from a developer of a single CCS  project into an international developer of multiple decarbonisation  technologies.  Macquarie Capital invests capital into resilient energy transition  infrastructure, and advises clients in connection with their own  investments in that sector. In Asia, Macquarie Capital announced a strategic investment into  ChargeZone, an Indian EV charging company which will support the  growth of electric vehicle infrastructure and green mobility in India.  In Europe, Macquarie Capital has partnered with IP to create  IPLANET, a joint venture for electrification of service stations on  urban and suburban roads across Italy.  Additionally, Macquarie Capital is focused on driving tech-enabled  innovation and connecting capital with opportunities across key  sectors, such as an investment in BioCatch, a global leader in  behavioural biometrics, leveraging device and behavioural data to  protect global organisations against fraud.  Advising With market-leading renewables and infrastructure advisory  expertise,(19) Macquarie Capital acted as a financial advisor to  APG Asset Management on its €250 million investment in Driveco,  a French EV charging company. This investment aims to support  Driveco’s ambition to be a major player in EV charging infrastructure  in France and wider Europe. In the UK, Macquarie Capital is acting as exclusive financial  adviser to Statera Energy Limited, on behalf of InfraRed Capital  Partners Ltd and Statera’s Founder Management, on its sale to EQT  Infrastructure. Statera Energy develops and operates large-scale  energy storage and flexible generation assets, balancing the grid to  the best value for energy users and supporting the UK’s transition  to a low-carbon future. In the US, Macquarie Capital acted as financial adviser to PureSky  Energy, a leading developer, owner and operator of US community  solar and battery storage projects, on the successful raise of a  3-year $US150 million development loan. The facility will support  funding of interconnection and equipment deposits, including  deployment of capital towards in-construction projects and the  company’s growing greenfield and acquisition pipeline. (19)	 In February 2024, Macquarie Capital was ranked #1 Global Energy Transition Financial Adviser by inspiratia for the 2023 calendar year by deal value. There can be no assurance that  other providers would reach the same conclusions. Further in the US, Macquarie Capital has joined a White House-led  initiative to support renewable energy projects for healthcare  facilities. The projects aim to increase efficiency, lower energy costs,  reduce emissions and improve resilience for critical healthcare hubs,  with a focus on safety-net providers in economically   disadvantaged communities. As part of Macquarie’s social engagement, we are helping clients  expand access to education around the world. Macquarie Capital  acted as exclusive financial adviser to Remind, a popular platform  for communication and learning, on its merger with ParentSquare,  a unified school-home education engagement platform, aimed at  increasing student success through expanded communications for  educators, students, and families across the US.  Managing As part of MAM’s fiduciary responsibility to our clients we assess  a range of commercial factors through our asset management  activities, including material ESG risks and opportunities, before  actively investing in companies and managing portfolios over their  holding period.  MAM manages a diverse suite of investment capabilities and  asset classes on behalf of its clients, with different levels of  ownership in, and influence over, the businesses it is invested in.  As a result, the way we exercise our rights and responsibilities as  stewards varies between the public markets and private markets  businesses of MAM. Within MAM’s public markets businesses, our investment teams  have continued to advance their approach to integrating ESG  factors into their investment processes through access to a variety  of ESG-related analytical tools and resources to help them identify,  measure and track material ESG factors associated with investee  companies or issuers.  MAM is also focused on its investment stewardship activities by  encouraging investee companies and issuers to enhance their  disclosures, as well as act on material sustainability risks and  opportunities, through direct engagement and by exercising proxy  voting rights. In doing so, we can better understand how our  investee companies are responding to these risks and opportunities  and share learnings across our portfolio.   ===== PAGE 64 ===== 64 Environmental, Social and Governance Continued Within MAM’s private markets businesses ESG considerations are  embedded in investment decision-making processes and integrated  throughout the investment lifecycle. During FY2024, MAM has  made progress on its net zero commitment with its infrastructure  and agriculture portfolio companies and real estate properties  measuring and verifying their baseline emissions, setting interim  2030 targets, and identifying abatement measures to form the  basis of their net zero business plans. Alongside scaling green investments, MAM continues to support  carbon-intensive industries and companies to decarbonise, including  those in the electricity, water, gas, agriculture, transport, mining,  oil and waste sectors. These industries provide products and  services that communities rely on and our approach recognises that  long-term solutions lie in collaboration, rather than divestment.  MAM also seeks to promote social outcomes through investments  in products that intentionally seek to contribute to social goals,  such as social and affordable housing. #1 infrastructure investment manager globally(20)  Further details on MAM’s approach to sustainability and  performance may be found in Macquarie’s FY2023 MAM  Sustainability Report, 2022 Stewardship Report and in our  Green Investment Groups Progress Report 2023 which can  be downloaded at macquarie.com/mam-sustainability Researching In Australia, stock initiation reports include a section discussing  relevant ESG considerations. We have issued specialist ESG reports  this year covering topics such as carbon offsets, mandatory climate  disclosure requirements, human capital management, company ESG  ratings and COP28.

The partnership provides our  clients with access to a larger pool of alternative energy research. In Asia, we continue to see increased client demand for ESG  research. Our ESG team works alongside our existing equity  and macro research teams on company-level assessments and  also thematic research. Since 2021, we have run sector specific  ESG scores for our coverage of approximately 800 companies  across 11 Asian markets. Our scoring system layers analysts’  impressions of covered companies on top of company-reported and  third-party data.  We provide more context for the scores and company-level ESG  performance through sector thematic reports and investor calls  on a wide range of topics. We have focused on EV charging and  global cooling (both air conditioners and data centres) in FY2024.  Meanwhile, we are continuing our workstreams on labour rights,  fossil fuel divestment and EV supply chains in Indonesia, and the  impact of geopolitics on the energy transition across Asia.

To achieve this, we are focusing on  improving energy efficiency within our premises and reducing  energy use overall; implementing 100% electrification of our  premises; purchasing 100% renewable electricity for our operational  requirements; and offsetting any residual emissions in line with  industry guidance on the use of credible carbon offsets. Our FY2024 electricity consumption was 39.9 GWh, which is a  decrease of 2% from the previous year and a 38% reduction from  the FY2014 baseline. The reduction since FY2014 is the result of  the consolidation, relocation, and upgrades of office premises to  more sustainable buildings, together with our cloud transformation  strategy that enables rationalisation of servers. Following the move into our new global headquarters in Sydney in  2024, we will re-baseline our electricity consumption to reflect the  corresponding energy performance. This year, Macquarie has sourced the equivalent of 100% of  our electricity consumption from renewable sources through a  combination of renewable energy from building owners or utilities  (47%) and energy attribute certificates (53%).(24)  Based on RE100 boundary criteria, the equivalent of our FY2024  electricity consumption sourced from renewable sources is 98.8%.(25)  We will continue to work towards full RE100 compliance by FY2025,  noting there are challenges purchasing renewable certificates in the  South Korean market. Scope 1 emissions are not considered to be material at 392 tCO2e  and have been offset.(26) These emissions continue to decline as we  move to, or develop, premises that are 100% electrified.(27) Commitment to reach net zero  in Scope 1 and 2 emissions  by FY2025, while developing  emissions reduction strategies  for Scope 3(28),(29) Sourced the equivalent  of 100% of our global  electricity consumption  from renewable sources  in FY2024(30) (23)	 Unless otherwise stated, all Scope 2 emissions in this Annual Report have been calculated using the market-based methodology as described by the GHG Protocol Scope 2  Guidance. (24)	 Energy Attribute Certificates will be retired by 30 June 2024. (25)	 Due to insufficient renewable energy certificates in the South Korean market. Renewable energy certificates were purchased from other international markets to cover this gap. (26)	 Carbon offset certificates will be retired by 30 June 2024. (27)	 Premises are 100% electrified in normal operations. (28)	 Throughout this Annual Report, when we refer to ‘net zero’ in relation to our own business operations Scope 1 and 2 emissions ambition, and industry guidance, we are informed by  recommendations from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Corporate Net Zero Standard, Net-Zero Banking Alliance Supporting note: The Use of Carbon Credits in Climate  Target Setting, and The Oxford Principles for Net Zero Aligned Carbon Offsetting. (29)	 Own business operations’ Scope 3 covers Categories 1–8 operational value chain emissions as defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting  and Reporting Standard. It excludes financed emissions (Scope 3, Category 15). (30)	 PwC has provided limited assurance over these metrics as detailed in the PwC independent assurance report available within Macquarie’s FY2024 Basis of Preparation for ESG  Reporting. This also sets out the reporting boundaries, definitions, and measurement methodologies for the assured metrics. (31)	 Scope 3 Categories 1, 2, 4 and 8 are calculated using the spend-based methodology as set out in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and  Reporting Standard and are directly correlated to our total spend with suppliers that is processed via Macquarie’s procurement system. This methodology does not take into  account any supplier specific emission reduction initiatives. Currently, due to data limitations, this category excludes capital expenditure on the development of our new global  headquarters 1 Elizabeth Street, Sydney, due to be completed in 2024. These offices will be included in Scope 1 and Scope 2 reporting from FY2025.

Previously, in FY2023, we performed a materiality assessment and  developed a baseline for categories of emissions in our upstream  operational value chain, except for Scope 3 Category 7: Employee  commuting which was subject to further analysis on materiality.  We have commenced methodology development and collection of  baseline data for employee commuting to support inclusion of this  in future business operations Scope 3 inventories. For Category 1: Purchased goods and services (which includes  Category 2: Capital goods, Category 4: Upstream transportation and  distribution, and Category 8: Upstream leased assets), emissions  have increased 6% from the FY2020 baseline due to an increase in  expenditure and a greater proportion of this being for technology  services with higher emission factors. For this category, we have  a target that by FY2030, suppliers representing 75% of our total  supplier related emissions (estimated based on spend) have set  a science-based emissions reduction target.(31) We are engaging  with our suppliers to understand their climate commitments and  transition plans, and making progress toward achieving this target.  We are also seeking improved visibility of the emissions associated  with the supply of goods and services.  ===== PAGE 66 ===== 66 Environmental, Social and Governance Continued For Category 6: Business travel (including air, hotels, taxis and car  rental, and food and beverages), we continue to offset our emissions  through the purchase of credible carbon credits. We also continue  to explore emissions reduction strategies, including reviewing travel  reduction opportunities, and enhancing data visibility to support  lower emissions travel choices. In FY2024 we conducted a review of our aviation and hotel suppliers’  carbon commitments and transition plans, and with this improved  understanding we are including business travel (Category 6) in the  scope of our purchased goods and services supplier engagement  target, so that by FY2030 75% of our aviation and hotel-related  emissions will be with suppliers that have set a science-aligned  emissions reduction target.(32) Scope 3 operational value chain categories(33) Category FY20 baseline (tCO2e)  FY24 (tCO2e) Category 1:  Purchased goods & services(34) 147,003 156,018 Category 2:   Capital goods Included in Category 1 Category 3:  Fuel & energy related  activities 4,054 3,631 Category 4:  Upstream transportation  and distribution Included in Category 1 Category 5:  Waste generated in  operations 112 239 Category 6:   Business travel 67,141(35) 63,122 Category 7:  Employee commuting Commenced methodology development  and collection of baseline data Category 8:   Upstream leased assets Included in Category 1 Total   (Categories 1–6 and 8) 218,310 223,010 (32)	 Covers air-travel and hotel bookings made through our corporate travel agency.

Limited assurance was also  provided over FY2024 Scope 3 emissions (Categories 1–6, and 8) as detailed in the PwC independent assurance report available within Macquarie’s FY2024 Basis of Preparation for  ESG Reporting. This also sets out the reporting boundaries, definitions, and measurement methodologies for the assured metrics.  (34)	 The methodology for Category 1 has been refined following identification of some commissions or equivalent payments related to a financial transaction, which MGL considers  to be outside of the procurement process, which had been included in the goods and services calculated emissions. These payments have now been excluded from the Category 1  baseline and calculated emissions to ensure alignment with our company-wide methodology. Please refer to the FY2024 ESG Dataset for further detail. (35)	 We have improved data sources and methodology for this category which has resulted in the FY2020 baseline for Category 6 decreasing by 1,603 tCO2e compared to the previously  reported figure. This revised methodology has also seen changes in reported emissions for FY2021, FY2022, and FY2023, and we are purchasing and retiring additional carbon  offsets to cover the net increase. Please refer to the FY2024 ESG Dataset for further detail. (36)	 To meet our RE100 commitment, in FY2021 we transitioned from purchasing carbon certificates to offset Scope 2 emissions, to purchasing energy attribute certificates to achieve  the equivalent of 100% renewable electricity consumed. Carbon offsetting Since FY2010, Macquarie has been offsetting its Scope 1, Scope 2  and Scope 3 business travel emissions and we continue to evolve  our carbon offsetting strategy.(36) Where residual or hard-to-abate  emissions exist, we utilise credible offsets to achieve carbon  reduction targets, consistent with emerging industry guidance  including the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Corporate Net  Zero Standard, Net-Zero Banking Alliance Supporting note: The  Use of Carbon Credits in Climate Target Setting, and The Oxford  Principles for Net Zero Aligned Carbon Offsetting. We have committed to continue offsetting residual Scope 1  emissions and Scope 3 business travel emissions beyond FY2025.  For FY2024, Macquarie will purchase and retire a portfolio of  Australian Carbon Credit Units and other voluntary carbon offsets  by 30 June 2024. Leveraging our internal due diligence processes,  offset projects are selected based on quality and verifiability  of emissions reductions. We have also engaged an independent  third-party to assist with the evaluation and selection of suitable  offset projects.  ===== PAGE 67 ===== 67 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Directors’ Report About Governance Sustainably-rated buildings Macquarie’s corporate offices are fitted with water and energy  efficient fittings and fixtures and are continually monitored for  energy performance, environmental quality, and our people’s  comfort. We have a commitment that 80% of our employees will be  in sustainably-rated premises by FY2025, and at the end of FY2024,  71% of Macquarie people occupied a sustainably-rated office.(37)  Our new offices in Sydney  and New York Macquarie is delivering the new Sydney Metro Martin Place  integrated station precinct. The precinct includes the new  Martin Place metro station, a retail and dining destination,  underground pedestrian connections, and two landmark  buildings: the 39-storey 1 Elizabeth Street (1 Elizabeth) which,  together with 50 Martin Place, will become Macquarie’s new  global headquarters; and the 28-storey 39 Martin Place. When construction is completed in 2024, the precinct  will feature accessible public spaces that are sustainable,  maximise the use of natural light, feature native plants and  public art, pay respect to the land’s traditional owners, and be  digitally enabled. Our goal is that this precinct will contribute  to the reinvigoration of Martin Place that has been taking  place over the past several years. The 1 Elizabeth building has achieved a 6 Star Green Star  Design Review (Design & As Built) rating,(38) has been designed  to be energy efficient, 100% electric in normal operations, and  our workplace will be powered by 100% renewable electricity.  Throughout the construction and fit-out stages, and as we  relocate from other offices, we have focused on reuse of  materials, fittings, and furniture. In 2024, coinciding with Macquarie’s 30th anniversary in  New York, our New York office will be relocated to a recently  refurbished building at 660 Fifth Avenue and our tenancy will  utilise many of the design principles of our new Sydney global  headquarters including a 100% electric design.  The New York project design has achieved a LEED Gold Rating  with features such as direct access to natural light and views,  multiple outdoor terraces with planting, optimal indoor air  quality, and dedicated end-of-trip change room facilities.  The project is also being built with materials, and furnished  with items, that incorporate reused and sustainable products  that have been sourced, moved, and installed with local and  diverse-owned businesses.

Resource efficiency and minimising waste  to landfill We continue to raise awareness and improve waste recycling  rates across our offices. In our Sydney global headquarters and  our London office, we diverted 63% of our operational waste from  landfill in FY2024 (compared to our 50% target by FY2025). We have  diverted 83% of fit-out construction and demolition waste from  landfill in the year, exceeding the 70% target for FY2024.(39) We have made a FY2025 commitment to eliminate single-use plastic  in our premises operations and are making progress towards this by  focusing on removing single-use cups, cutlery, and plastic packaging  for food presented for sale in our cafes. In FY2024, we achieved a 74% paper use reduction from our FY2019  baseline (exceeding our 60% reduction target by FY2025). We have  an ongoing commitment to use certified sustainable or recycled  paper stock for 100% of our office paper needs. We have committed to managing our electronic waste (e-waste) in  our major offices globally through sustainably certified suppliers to  ensure it is managed in a responsible manner. We are progressing  the first phase of managing our e-waste which involves disposal of  laptops, desktops, and information technology (IT) communications  room equipment. Macquarie follows the principle of reduce, reuse,  and recycle for its devices and appliances, and is aiming to improve  the scope of reporting.  ===== PAGE 68 ===== 68 Environmental, Social and Governance Continued Sustainable procurement In FY2023, a new sustainable procurement framework was  launched, and this has been further embedded this year. The  framework outlines how Macquarie manages our environmental,  social, and economic impacts across the corporate supply chain,  integrating sustainability throughout the procurement life cycle. We continue to work towards our FY2025 commitment to increase  our spend on environmentally and socially sustainable products,  with an ambition to have 80% of prioritised goods being sustainable.  Clear and consistent sustainability definitions for prioritised  categories, such as IT equipment, stationery, pantry consumables,  and office furniture, have been developed in partnership with our  suppliers, and adoption of these new standards is underway. We  have identified challenges in obtaining consistent data, at the  product level, across our priority categories to enable reporting  against this target, and are working to address this with   our suppliers. Macquarie remains committed to spending 1% of our annual  global spend (in our tier one and tier two supply chains) with  diverse suppliers and 10% of our annual global spend with small  businesses by FY2025.(40) In FY2024, Macquarie spent over  $A25.3 million (or 0.6% of global spend) with diverse suppliers and  over $A290.4 million (or 6.3% of global spend) with small businesses.  Our supplier diversity commitment is now available on our website  to support our conversations with our external stakeholders and our  commitment to the diverse supplier community. Since the launch of our Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) in Australia  in February 2023, Macquarie has engaged with First Nations  suppliers, partnering with Supply Nation as the peak body that aims  to grow the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander business sector  through the promotion of supplier diversity in Australia. In FY2024, we continued to achieve 100% compliance with  Macquarie’s Supplier Governance Policy’s environmental and  social risk requirements.(41) We have also continued to engage an  independent auditor to complete ESR audits. These audits follow  the Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) social auditing  methodology enabling us to assess our sites and suppliers to  understand working conditions in the supply chain. (40)	 Diverse suppliers means businesses owned and operated by an individual or group that is part of a traditionally underrepresented group in society such as companies owned and  operated by minorities, women, or First Nations peoples.

The business is committed to supporting our  customers through uncertain and difficult times, and understands  every situation is different, offering a range of solutions that can be  tailored to meet our customers’ needs. Beyond the commitments made in Macquarie’s RAP, BFS has  continued an online First Nations cultural competency training  program for relevant BFS customer-facing teams, which was  developed by an Australian Indigenous business specialising in  cultural competency training. The program is designed to enhance  participants’ understanding of First Nations peoples, culture and  history while providing practical knowledge and skills to serve and  support First Nations peoples more effectively. Protecting clients from scams and fraud As customer fraud and cyber scam attempts are increasing all  around the world, BFS is committed to helping our employees,  clients and customers become more cyber-resilient.  BFS launched a Scams Awareness Campaign, which includes a  customer education program focused on providing the latest  updates on trending scams and how best to protect themselves.  BFS continues to provide customers with informative content and  resources through the Macquarie Scams Hub, as part of our ongoing  scams awareness activity.

The Macquarie Authenticator mobile app, with leading digital  security features, gives customers control to approve or deny  transactions, log-in attempts or account changes in real-time,  and is a key part of our proactive approach to keeping customers’  accounts and information safe.  Throughout FY2024, BFS has continued to invest in fraud  prevention solutions to help identify and prevent fraud and  scam losses.  Providing innovative digital solutions As a digital bank, BFS has a strong focus on innovation, and a key  part of that is the development of new products, features and  reduced costs for customers. While digital security enhancements  make it safer and easier to manage risks for our customers,  innovation also allows us to enhance how they manage their money  with intuitive and connected digital banking experiences. Our everyday transaction account allows customers to apply for an  account, have their identity fully verified and start banking in under  three minutes. Customers are able to load new debit cards into  their Apple or Google wallet so they can start using their account  straight away.  Macquarie’s Business Savings Account, a new digital high interest  savings account for small businesses with no fees, is one of the first  business accounts in Australia to have a digital-only application  process and instant account opening for eligible businesses. BFS is running more than 96% of its applications on public  cloud, including its core banking platform, giving us enhanced  performance, agility and security capabilities to underpin our digital  banking offering.  Our commitment to delivering exceptional customer experiences  across our platforms is reflected in our net promoter scores (NPS),  including an NPS score of 51.5 across mobile banking and 45.3  across internet banking.(43)  ===== PAGE 70 ===== 70 Environmental, Social and Governance Continued Fair and efficient resolution of issues Reflecting our commitment to our customers, Macquarie Bank  Limited subscribes to the latest version of the Australian Banking  Association Banking Code of Practice. Macquarie has a robust complaint management framework across  our retail banking business to resolve customer complaints quickly  and fairly. BFS teams analyse complaint data to understand the  root causes of complaints so they can be addressed at their source,  with oversight from senior management. In FY2024, 39% of BFS  complaints were resolved within one business day and 90% within  five business days.  Macquarie’s Customer Advocate is separate to the operating, risk  and support groups including our internal dispute resolution teams.  The Customer Advocate’s role is to: •	 listen to our customers and provide a customer-centric voice  when making recommendations to improve customer experience •	 minimise the risk of future problems by reviewing key customer  themes and new product approvals to identify opportunities to  enhance products, services, systems and processes •	 work with Macquarie complaint teams to promote fair and  reasonable customer outcomes. The Customer Advocate reports directly to the MGL CEO and  provides annual reporting to the BGCC. Responsible and transparent communications There are longstanding regulatory requirements in relation to  treating customers fairly and prohibiting misleading statements.  Recently, attention on greenwashing as a regulatory, litigation and  reputational risk is increasing. Greenwashing is defined at Macquarie  as a false, misleading, unsubstantiated, ambiguous or overstated  representation of the ESG attributes of an organisation, product or  service. This definition is intended to incorporate similar concepts  such as impact-washing and social-washing. While the regimes that  govern greenwashing vary between jurisdictions, and good practice  continues to evolve, we recognise the importance of mitigating  this risk for our stakeholders. In FY2024 we implemented a  company-wide Greenwashing Standard to support the management  of legal, regulatory, reputational and environmental and social  risks associated with greenwashing. It provides information on  communications with potential for greenwashing risk, and review  considerations and requirements in managing greenwashing risk.  During FY2024, 3,275 employees completed an online training  module that accompanies this standard.

Since its  inception in 2022, 13% of Associate Directors and 16% of Division  Directors have participated in the DLP globally. Overall, the DLP  continues to receive favourable feedback, with the program  delivering on its objectives, demonstrating a commercial impact,  and resonating strongly with participants from across Macquarie.  Executive Directors continue to have access to 3-day Executive  Director Leadership Program (EDLP) workshops. During FY2024,  newly promoted and lateral hire Executive Directors attended  a workshop focused on building self-awareness and conscious  impact, and the skills needed to inspire and develop others.  Experienced Executive Directors were offered the Leading a  Purpose Driven Culture workshop, which equips participants with  the knowledge and tools to embed a purpose-driven culture across  Macquarie. These workshops build a shared understanding of  leadership at Macquarie and facilitate strong connections across  the organisation. Since its inception in 2017, 84% of Executive  Directors have participated in at least one EDLP workshop globally. Digital upskilling The talent market remains tight for certain skillsets and Macquarie  remains committed to giving employees the opportunity to develop  skills that build their careers and that remain in demand in the  changing world of work. Macquarie continues to deliver digital  upskilling opportunities for in-demand transformation skills such  as Agile ways of working, human-centred design, data skills and  process improvements to increase organisational efficiencies, with  more than 5,800 attendances globally in FY2024.(44) Training During FY2024, 3,200 instructor-led courses were delivered globally;  93% of these were non-mandatory, covering topics including:  management and leadership; personal effectiveness; and wellbeing.

Macquarie is a signatory to the  Australian Board of Taxation’s voluntary Tax Transparency Code. More detailed information on Macquarie’s approach  to tax transparency is available at macquarie.com/ fy24-tax-transparency Political engagement and public policy Macquarie believes we need to be engaged and understand the  evolving policy, political and regulatory environments in Australia  and other jurisdictions in which we operate, as these factors impact  our business as well as those of our clients. As a listed financial institution operating in highly regulated sectors,  we have a responsibility to our shareholders, clients, counterparties  and employees to understand and contribute to public policy and to  ensure that our organisation and operating environments are well  understood by parliamentarians and policy makers. Additionally,  our clients, many of whom also operate in regulated sectors, expect  us to have detailed current knowledge of public policy issues and  drivers when we provide them with advice and services. Macquarie contributes to public policy in the markets in which we  operate in the following ways: •	 making submissions to industry consultation processes and  inquiries, where appropriate. These may be processes established  by parliaments, government departments or government  agencies such as regulators. Submissions may be made by  Macquarie directly or as part of a broader industry group •	 participating in government and other policy advisory panels  when invited to do so, and where we can make a differentiated  contribution based on our expertise •	 engaging with parliamentarians and policy-makers through  avenues such as formal meetings, attending events, speaking  in public forums and appearing before parliamentary inquiries  where appropriate •	 contributing to the advocacy work done by industry groups in  key markets around the world.

Cybersecurity Macquarie acknowledges the inherent cyber risks associated with  employing technology platforms to support our business activities. Macquarie manages cyber and information security risk through  Macquarie’s operational risk management framework. The  Board Risk Committee receives regular technology and cyber  reporting updates.  Throughout FY2024, Macquarie observed the evolving threat  landscape including: •	 the potential for cyber attacks due to geopolitical tensions •	 increasing regulation to protect individual, organisational and  national security •	 a continued increase in instances of data breaches and  high-profile ransomware attacks against supply chains,  companies and individuals. The cyber threat landscape includes financially motivated entities,  nation states and hacktivists who attempt to gain access directly  to systems or data from anywhere in the world. We continuously  monitor for changes in this threat landscape, assess the potential  impact on Macquarie, implement controls to mitigate the risks  identified and manage residual risks appropriately. Data privacy The Macquarie Group Privacy Policy sets out why we need to collect  personal information, how we collect it, what we do with it, how  it is stored and who we might share it with.

Our commitment In the second year of implementing our FY2023–26 Global Diversity,  Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Strategy we have continued to focus our  action and measure our progress in three areas: our diverse people,  our equity commitment, and our inclusive culture. The global  strategy is implemented through DEI strategies that are led by our  group and regional leaders. Our efforts to level the playing field for talent from  underrepresented groups are global and focused on maintaining  equitable talent processes, mitigating bias, gathering and  monitoring data, and evaluating appropriate outcomes at all stages  of the talent lifecycle. These efforts are enhanced by building  manager capability and maintaining an inclusive culture. Macquarie’s Workforce Diversity Policy is available at  macquarie.com/diversity-and-inclusion  Diversity, Equity and  Inclusion objectives The Executive Committee and Board Remuneration Committee  (BRC) monitor the diversity, equity and inclusion objectives and the  progress of each group and region. The Workforce Diversity Policy  requires that each year the BRC will set measurable objectives for  increasing the diversity of Macquarie’s workforce and maintaining a  culture of respect and inclusion. Executive Committee members have DEI objectives in their  performance assessment criteria. Leadership teams globally, in  each Operating and Central Service Group and region, are also  accountable for achieving Macquarie’s DEI objectives. The Board and  BRC receive regular updates on progress against Macquarie’s DEI  commitments and encourage continuous improvement. Macquarie’s BRC has endorsed the FY2023–2026 DEI objectives as  set out in the global strategy.

Progress – Our diverse people We measure the diversity of our workforce by encouraging  our employees to confidentially self-identify across a range of  dimensions, including gender, race, cultural identity, gender identity,  sexual orientation, and parenting and caring responsibilities. Gender Equity The outcome of our ongoing commitment to gender equity is  demonstrated in Table 1. Female representation on the MGL Board  of Directors has stayed at 62.5% with the retirement of Nicola  Wakefield Evans and the appointment of Susan Lloyd-Hurwitz, who  is currently also President of Chief Executive Women (CEW)  in Australia. Female representation has increased year-on-year across  Macquarie’s total workforce and senior executive population.  There was a temporary increase in female representation at the  Executive Committee level because Nicholas O’Kane stepped down  as Group Head of CGM and from the Executive Committee before  31 March 2024, whereas new CGM Group Head Simon Wright was  not appointed to Executive Committee until 1 April 2024. Female  representation in the Division Head population decreased because  of some senior male appointments.

We were the first organisation in Australia to achieve a  National Level 3 carer accreditation from Carers+Employers and  have retained accreditation as a Family Friendly Workplace. Macquarie’s global return to work rate was 97% in FY2024 and we  continue to achieve high retention rates for employees who have  taken parental leave. To support the transition back to work after  a period of parental leave, our employees can choose to take 12  paid transition days in the first 12 weeks of returning to work. This  benefit, and other forms of flexibility are available to parents and  carers in all regions. Cultural diversity and racial equity Cultural diversity and racial equity continue to be priorities for  Macquarie, and we take an active and localised approach to drive  progress in our business and communities. We continue to invest  in internship and recruitment channels that expand our reach and  better connect with talent from under-represented racial groups  around the world. Macquarie was shortlisted for ‘Company of the Year’ in the  European Diversity Awards 2023 and ranked a top 10 exemplary  employer in the Ethnicity Awards in the UK. Our regional  sponsorship program connected high potential ethnically diverse  individuals with experienced leaders.  ===== PAGE 76 ===== 76 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Continued In the US, we offered targeted leadership development programs  for Black, Latinx and Asian talent to accelerate their careers and  implement strategies to increase contribution and personal growth.  We continued to partner with Seizing Every Opportunity (SEO) and  Hive Diversity, growing the talent pipeline for the future.  In Australia, in line with our inaugural Reconciliation Action Plan  (RAP), Macquarie held sessions to support staff in informing and  educating themselves on the proposed Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander Voice to Parliament. The sessions featured Greg Ward,  Group Head of BFS, in conversation with Indigenous ABC  commentator Dan Bourchier, and Group General Counsel, Evie Bruce,  in conversation with University of Sydney Professor Emerita, Anne  Twomey. More than 4,000 Australian employees (approximately 40%  of the ANZ workforce) also completed an eLearning program made  available to them on this topic. LGBTQ+ Once again, Macquarie has been recognised by external community  partners as a leading LGBTQ+ inclusive organisation. Macquarie  achieved a perfect score (one hundred) for the fifth consecutive  year on the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index in  the US. In Asia, Macquarie was recognised as a Gold Employer by the  India Workplace Equality Index 2023, Silver Standard, Community  Business’ 2023 LGBT+ Inclusion Index in Hong Kong and Gold  Standard in Singapore. Jay Adams, Louise McNaughton, and Cameron Mangnall co-chairs of Pride ANZ Accessibility Macquarie is a member of The Valuable 500, a global collective  focused on disability inclusion. This year we participated in the pilot  of the global Generation Valuable mentoring program, where a  senior leader was matched with an employee living with disability to  share insights and experiences. We have progressed our work on a  global Accessibility Action Plan (AAP). Elements of the plan address  candidate, employee and customer experiences, global offices,  and technology. Progress – Our equity commitment Our equity commitment extends beyond candidate and employee  experience to customers and our supply chain. It also guides the  work of the Macquarie Group Foundation (Foundation), which has  taken steps to evolve its grantmaking processes and practices  globally with the goal of becoming a more equitable funder. The  Foundation also funds organisations that focus on promoting a  more equitable and just society for underrepresented people. We monitor diversity data to ensure equitable outcomes in  candidate and employee experiences such as recruitment,  performance, remuneration and promotion. Macquarie conducts annual pay equity reviews, provides  comprehensive data to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency  (WGEA) in Australia, and is also required to adhere to regulatory  requirements in other locations where we operate. Macquarie has continually ensured that we have pay equity across  the organisation for men and women performing the same  roles, similar roles, or work of equal or comparable value. This is  reviewed on an annual basis, during which we work with all groups  as part of Macquarie’s commitment to ensure there is no bias in  how we pay our people and to maintain pay equity for like roles  and performance. Progress – Our inclusive culture Macquarie has a range of Employee Network Groups (ENGs) and DEI  committees in each region. Their focus spans culture and heritage,  First Nations, gender, LGBTQ+, race and ethnicity, families and  carers, neurodiversity, and military veterans. They amplify the  voices of under-represented people, enhance networks, and support  our DEI strategy.  Allies are essential to inclusion. Macquarie continues to  offer Allyship and Inclusive Leadership training, especially  to Management.  Every employee is held accountable for contributing to our inclusive  culture through the Macquarie Standards and Objectives, which  include DEI.  Inclusion remains a strong component of Macquarie’s culture.  Progress is measured through an annual employee engagement  survey, which also informs local and regional action plans.  ===== PAGE 77 ===== 77 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Directors’ Report About Governance Diversity, Equity & Inclusion awards  In FY2024 Macquarie was recognised for its commitment to and progress towards creating an inclusive workplace for all employees and  supporting our communities in each of our regions.

(5)	 Data was supplied and not independently verified between 1 April 2023 – 31 March 2024 for activities undertaken by Macquarie’s employment focused partners with philanthropic  and impact investment support from Macquarie Group. ‘Into employment’ is defined by our partners using one or more of these categories: type of work, hours of work, living wage  work, meaningful work, secure work, career progression, income progression, jobs created, jobs maintained. It is possible for a person to be counted as employed more than once  (for example: if they move to another employment position within the reporting period). ‘Support’ is defined by our partners using one or more of these categories: direct help,  indirect help, giving information. Into employment is a subset of the total number of people supported. Together with Macquarie employees, the Macquarie Group  Foundation (the Foundation) has contributed $A641 million  to thousands of non-profit organisations since its inception in 1985.  During FY2024, $A67 million was contributed to 3,000 non-profits  around the world through employee donations and fundraising,  Foundation matching and donations, grants and social impact  investments, marking a significant increase on FY2023 and a  record year of giving.  Our people  The Foundation’s impact reflects Macquarie’s biggest asset:  its people.  Macquarie encourages employees to support the causes that  matter to them by providing a range of benefits including  donation matching, paid volunteer leave and charitable donations  in recognition of time spent volunteering or serving on a  non-profit board. In FY2024, 36% of eligible employees globally were engaged in  the community by giving their time, financial support or skills.  Employees donated or fundraised a record $A19.5 million in  FY2024 and took over 1,900 days of paid volunteer leave to  support community organisations.  In October 2023 a record $A10 million was raised during Macquarie’s  10th annual Foundation Week, during which additional matching  incentives are available. Macquarie employees organised or  participated in over 320 initiatives, spanning 42 offices in 25  markets and supporting more than 240 non-profits globally.  For more information about how our people contribute  to the community see pages 80 and 81. Our businesses  As well as providing advice on philanthropic giving, the Foundation  is partnering with Macquarie businesses to integrate a shared value  approach into existing business models and identify upcoming  projects that can deliver both increased social value and enhanced  commercial advantage. To catalyse this work within Macquarie, the Foundation  created the Macquarie Shared Value Award, in memory of  Macquarie’s former Managing Director and Executive Chairman  David Clarke AO (1942–2011). The Award recognises a Macquarie  team driving social impact through a business-led shared  value project and the inaugural winner was the Pennsylvania  Department of Transportation Major Bridge P3 Initiative managed  by Macquarie Capital in the Americas. This project is developing  major bridges throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania  while also deploying an enduring workforce development initiative.  Philadelphia Works, the non-profit involved in the project, was  awarded a $A100,000 grant to help increase the scope and scale  of social impact.  Our communities  The Foundation supports community organisations through  its global focus on breaking down barriers to employment, its  commitment to promoting a more equitable and just society for  underrepresented people and its special grants programs.  Breaking down barriers to employment Recognising that many people around the world face systemic  barriers to employment, the Foundation uses a range of tools,  including grants and social impact investments, to break down  these barriers and build effective pathways to employment.  The Foundation’s grantmaking efforts in each region focus on  issues of local relevance, and garner additional support from  employees through mentoring, training, knowledge sharing and  employability programs.  In FY2024, the Foundation provided $A13.4 million in philanthropic  and impact investment funding to 54 employment focused  partners. The Foundation’s existing employment focused partners  reported supporting 1,300 people into employment, with a  total of 21,000 people supported through training, skilling and  employment programs.(5) In FY2024, World YMCA joined Generation,  You Employed as the Foundation’s second global grant partner.   ===== PAGE 79 ===== 79 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Directors’ Report About Governance Grant funding for World YMCA will support pilot interventions that  use digital solutions and innovative financing to move historically  underserved young people beyond skilling and into work. New  regional grant partners in FY2024 also include social enterprises  through the Lord Mayor’s Charitable Foundation, The Majurity Trust  and An Cosán. In FY2024, the Foundation announced that Pursuit, based in the  USA, would receive both a philanthropic grant and a social impact  investment. These two complementary forms of catalytic capital  will enable Pursuit to scale its impact supporting low-income  individuals without a college degree into long-term careers.  The Foundation also made a social impact investment into the  Growth Impact Fund in the United Kingdom. Capital provided  through social impact investments aim to be patient, risk-tolerant  and flexible, with any financial returns to be re-invested into future  Foundation social impact projects. Promoting a more equitable and just society The Foundation takes an equitable approach to its grantmaking, and  also funds organisations that focus on promoting a more equitable  and just society for underrepresented people. These grants include  the Centre for Social Impact (ANZ), Asia Pacific Mission for Migrants  (Asia), Baobab Foundation (EMEA) and four Racial Equity Fund  grantees in the Americas.  Now in its fourth year, the Racial Equity Fund supports four partners  as well as this year’s four People’s Choice grant recipients selected  by employees. In FY2024, the Foundation provided a grant to the  Bullard Center for Environmental & Climate Justice to fund a new  HBCU (Historically Black College or University) Climate Corps at  Texas Southern University. The program will equip young people  with the tools they need to become the next generation of leaders  and educate them on climate change and its impact on communities  of colour. Macquarie 50th Anniversary Award  Throughout FY2024 the five organisations awarded $A10 million  each as part of the Macquarie 50th Anniversary Award in 2019  continued to make progress against each of the project milestones.  One award recipient, the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute’s  World Scabies Program (WSP) rolled out world-first, nation-wide  mass drug administration (MDA) programs to treat scabies in both  Fiji and the Solomon Islands. These MDAs have positioned WSP to  help drive similar programs across the globe, surfacing best practice  scabies management and advocacy to replicate the outcomes seen  in Fiji and the Solomons thus far. Another award recipient, Social Finance US, continued to scale its  talent finance portfolio, expanding high quality career training to  help unemployed and underemployed people participate in the  modern economy.  Over the past year, Social Finance launched a Pay It Forward Fund  in Colorado to prepare residents for in-demand, well-paying jobs  in industries including IT, cybersecurity, and health care. Seeded  with over $A12 million from multiple philanthropic sources, the  Colorado Pay It Forward Fund provides different kinds of financing  for learners, training providers, and employers. For each kind of  financing, all loan repayments are recycled back into the fund to  support future learners. Responding to humanitarian needs In support of humanitarian relief efforts in Israel and the Palestinian  Territories, employees and the Foundation contributed over  $A3 million to organisations working to provide vital support. In  addition, the Foundation also provided $A1 million in grant funding  to two aid agencies – Anera and IsraAID – both providing critical  humanitarian relief in the region. Our broader community Macquarie Sports Macquarie Sports aims to engage young Australians by improving  access to sporting opportunities. In FY2024, Macquarie Sports  supported 36 sporting clinics in communities around Australia,  reaching over 1,500 participants.  Aligned with the Foundation’s focus of breaking down barriers  to employment, in FY2024 Macquarie Sports renewed grants  to Surfing Australia and Clontarf Foundation, organisations  that support young people through education, training and  employment-based programs. During calendar year 2023 this  funding supported 60 young people and provided pathways for  29 people into employment.  Macquarie Sports also awarded four corporate scholarships to  elite sportspeople, to assist with their transition into the financial  services sector following their sporting careers.  Macquarie Group Collection The Macquarie Group Collection (Collection) is a unique  philanthropic corporate collecting model comprising 940 works.  Featuring art in all media, the theme of the Collection is The Land  and Its Psyche. The Collection promotes the talent and diversity of  Australian emerging artists by acquiring and displaying their art in  44 Macquarie offices worldwide.  Planning is underway for the opening of the new public gallery,  The Art Space, in Macquarie’s new global headquarters at  1 Elizabeth Street, Sydney (1 Elizabeth). The Art Space will  host the 2024 Macquarie Group Emerging Artist Prize opening  night and exhibition.

Through a range  of Foundation benefits, Macquarie encourages  employees to give their time, financial support  or skills to the causes that matter to them.  Fundraising for a cause  In Asia, Teng Ee Teoh, Jamie Chung and The Majurity Trust working group in  Macquarie’s Singapore office held a fundraising event on World Alzheimer’s  Day. Designed to uncover the fastest thinking team, 13 teams took part in a  series of quizzes over three rounds of intense competition.  Together with matching from the Foundation, over $A4,000 was raised  for The Majurity Trust’s Silver is Gold program, which supports innovative  solutions and services to meet the needs of persons living with dementia and  tackles public stigma surrounding dementia. “The quiz was a fun way to engage our colleagues and fundraise for a good  cause. With matching from the Foundation, it doubles our fundraising  efforts and means a larger donation for The Majurity Trust. Many of us know  someone living with dementia so it was meaningful to be able to contribute in  this way.” Teng Ee Teoh  Commodities and Global Markets, Singapore Giving time  Macquarie encourages volunteering by offering two days of paid volunteering  leave to all eligible employees, and the Foundation recognises time spent  volunteering by providing volunteer rewards and board service rewards in the  form of charitable donations. Employees can explore hands-on, skills sharing  or pro bono volunteering opportunities.  In Sydney, a popular team building activity is spending a day volunteering at  Our Big Kitchen, which prepares and distributes meals to shelters for people  suffering from homelessness, extreme illness, and domestic violence. Sohan  Pujarand and his colleagues recently spent a day volunteering and received  volunteer rewards.  “Together we made over 200 meals for people in need. After a fun day,  everyone returned home with their newfound cooking skills but more  importantly with a feeling of fulfilment. We also received volunteer rewards of  $A25 per hour to donate to a charity of our choice, so this was another way we  could support Our Big Kitchen’s vital services.” Sohan Pujarand  Financial Management Group, Sydney  Sharing skills  Many employees around the world volunteer as board members for  non-profit organisations and are eligible to receive a $A10,000 charitable  donation for the non-profit organisation they support. Matt Osborn has  been a longtime volunteer with Noah’s House, an organisation dedicated  to providing opportunities for growth, fulfillment, and independence for  adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities.  “Having a son with Down Syndrome, Noah’s House’s mission is one I’m  passionate about and it’s incredible to see how a few people can come  together and have such a big impact.

CRBF funds clinical  research into sarcoma, an aggressive form of cancer, whilst also raising  awareness to promote early diagnosis, and providing support for  patients and their families. In FY2024, the team were recognised with a Macquarie Award  (Community category) for their fundraising.  “It was a thrill to win the Macquarie Award and receive an additional  charitable donation for CRBF. This is a close and personal cause for  many at Macquarie, especially for those who knew Cooper personally  before his passing in 2017. To raise over $A158,000 including matching  from the Foundation for such a meaningful cause was an honour and it  has truly been one of the highlights of our Macquarie journey.” Avantika Pratap   Banking and Financial Services, Sydney  Our businesses  Driving shared value  The Foundation is partnering with Macquarie businesses to integrate  a shared value approach into existing business models and identify  upcoming projects that can deliver both increased social value and  commercial advantage. Geoff Segal was part of the Macquarie Capital team who won the  inaugural Macquarie Shared Value Award for their Pennsylvania  Department of Transportation Major Bridge P3 Initiative. “As well as having a direct positive impact on the local economy, this  project will establish an enduring workforce development program.  When we commenced work on the proposal, we sought advice from the  Foundation team on how we could maximise the benefit of the project  for jobseekers in the local community. It’s a great example of how our work can build a better future for the  communities in which we operate by delivering both economic and  social outcomes.” Geoff Segal   Macquarie Capital, New York  Our communities  Macquarie’s support for grant and social impact investment partners  expands beyond funding thanks to our people. Supporting Macquarie 50th Anniversary Award winners  The Macquarie 50th Anniversary Award Ambassador Network was  established to engage employees to further support and contribute to  each of the five causes. Emily Mellett volunteers her time on The Ocean  Cleanup Ambassador network, which brings together colleagues from  across the globe.  “As a network, we have organised a range of initiatives to raise  awareness and funds for The Ocean Cleanup’s mission. We’ve also  supported them to progress a global research study, which aims to  identify global and political incentives to fund the cleanup efforts.  The strength of Macquarie’s networks and connectivity allowed us to  provide essential and different insights to support them to progress  their analysis and research and develop their industry connections.” Emily Mellett  Corporate Operations Group, London Supporting our Racial Equity Fund grant partners  In addition to funding for grant partners, the Foundation creates  opportunities for staff engagement through mentoring, training,  knowledge sharing and employability programs. In November 2023, nearly 50 college sophomores in Houston and  New York celebrated completion of Macquarie’s first ever Racial  Equity Fund externship, designed to expose students that have  historically been underrepresented in the sector to financial services.  Through the externship, students spent eight weeks meeting with  Macquarie colleagues, building their skills and confidence and growing  their knowledge of the business. “During their time at Macquarie, the externs toured our offices, visited  Macquarie-owned assets and connected with over 40 Macquarie  colleagues for mentorship, networking, mock interviews and  informational sessions. Students also completed a final project to  develop an investment pitch in the green energy sector, meeting with  colleagues from across Macquarie to refine their presentations and  deliver a final pitch. It was fantastic to see Macquarie’s Racial Equity  Fund make such an impactful experience for the students.”  Nicole Spaur  Risk Management Group, Houston  Working groups dedicated to breaking down barriers to  employment  Across Asia there are several working groups made up of passionate  employees who come together to support a non-profit organisation.  In Manila, one working group supports the Fair Training Center (FTC),  which focuses on ending the forced labour of migrant workers by  reinventing domestic worker training. The working group has organised  fundraising and volunteering throughout the year for FTC and recently  collaborated with a local designer to help FTC revamp its video training  materials.  “Being part of a group of volunteers focused on creating better  migration outcomes for migrant workers is a meaningful way to make  a difference. I’ve taken volunteer leave and sought matching from the  Foundation to further contribute to FTC, so I’m grateful that Macquarie  supports me to give back in this way.”  Camille Andrada  Corporate Operations Group, Manila  Pro bono contributions enabling social impact investments  Every social impact investment the Foundation makes utilises  knowledge and expertise from across Macquarie. The Foundation  collaborates with small teams of colleagues from around the world  who conduct various forms of due diligence, incorporating impact,  commercial and risk considerations. During FY2024 Courtney Lollback and James Gardner from Macquarie’s  Asset Management Group and Legal and Governance Group provided  their expertise on Macquarie’s investment into the Growth Impact Fund  social impact investment, announced in October 2023.  “The opportunity to work alongside the Foundation on commercial  and financial due diligence of the Growth Impact Fund investment was  a highlight of my year. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and the  chance to put my skills to use to help create positive social change.” Courtney Lollback   Macquarie Asset Management, London “Working on the Growth Impact Fund transaction was brilliant in many  ways. It’s been helpful from a professional perspective, great to work  with different people and to be running towards something that feels  purposeful and tangible.” James Gardner  Legal and Governance Group, Macquarie Asset Management, London  ===== PAGE 82 ===== 82 Risk Management Risk governance at Macquarie Role of the Board The role of the Board is to promote the long-term interests of  Macquarie, taking into account Macquarie’s specific and broader  responsibilities to its shareholders, funders, clients, staff and the  communities in which it operates. In accomplishing its role with  respect to risk management, among the Board’s key responsibilities  are oversight of management’s operation of Macquarie’s risk  management framework, approving risk appetite and the risk  management strategy, engagement with key regulators and forming  a view of risk culture. Role of Management The Group Heads of the Operating and Central Service Groups  are responsible for the implementation of the risk management  framework in their Groups. They are required semi-annually to attest  that key risks have been identified and are adequately controlled  in their Groups. These management representations support the  sign-off of the half-year and full-year financial statements. Three lines of defence Macquarie’s approach to risk management adopts the ‘three  lines of defence’ model, which sets risk ownership responsibilities  functionally independent from oversight and assurance: •	 primary responsibility for day-to-day risk management lies  with the business. The risk owner is the first line of defence.  All staff throughout Macquarie are expected to manage risks  in accordance with the risk management framework •	 the Risk Management Group (RMG) forms the second line of  defence and provides independent and objective review and  challenge, oversight, monitoring and reporting in relation to  Macquarie’s material risks •	 Internal Audit, as the third line, provides independent and objective  risk-based assurance on the compliance with, and effectiveness of,  Macquarie’s financial and risk management framework. Risk management framework  Macquarie’s risk management framework is the totality of systems,  structures, policies, processes and people within Macquarie that  identify, measure, evaluate, monitor, report and control or mitigate  all internal and external sources of material risk. Macquarie  maintains a single risk management framework that is applied  appropriately throughout the Operating and Central Service Groups. In determining those risks that are material to Macquarie, we assess  the potential for a risk to affect our earnings resilience and financial  strength across market cycles, our ability to meet regulatory  obligations, our stakeholders, and our reputation. Macquarie’s material risks include asset, conduct, country, credit,  environmental and social, equity, financial crime, legal, liquidity,  market, operational, regulatory and compliance, strategic, tax,  technology and cyber, and work health and safety risks.  Details about the risks we manage are available at  macquarie.com/risk‑management Details on Environmental and Social risks, and Work Health  and Safety risks, are set out in the ESG section of this  Annual Report. Key components Risk management principles Macquarie’s approach to risk management is based on stable and  robust core risk management principles. These are: •	 ownership of risk at the business level: Group Heads are  responsible for ownership of material risks that arise in, or  because of, their business’ operations, including identification,  measurement, evaluation, monitoring, control and mitigation of  these risks. Before making decisions, clear analysis of the risks  is sought to ensure those decisions are consistent with the risk  appetite and strategy of Macquarie •	 understanding worst-case outcomes: Macquarie’s risk  management approach is based on examining the consequences  of worst-case outcomes and determining whether these are  acceptable and within Macquarie’s risk appetite. This approach  is adopted for all material risk types and is often achieved by  stress testing. Macquarie operates a number of sophisticated  quantitative risk management processes, but the foundation of  the approach is the informed consideration of both quantitative  and qualitative inputs by experienced professionals •	 requirement for an independent sign-off by RMG: Macquarie  places significant importance on having a strong, independent  risk management function to review, challenge and sign-off  all material risk acceptance decisions. It is essential that RMG  has the capability to do this effectively. RMG has invested in  recruiting skilled professionals from a range of industries,  including those with trading or advisory and capital markets  experience. For all material proposals, RMG’s opinion must be  sought at an early stage in the decision-making process. The  approval document submitted to Senior Management must  include independent input from RMG on risk and return.  ===== PAGE 83 ===== 83 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Directors’ Report About Governance Risk Management Group RMG, which forms the second line of defence, is an independent  and centralised function responsible for independent and objective  review and challenge, oversight, monitoring and reporting in  relation to Macquarie’s material risks. RMG designs and oversees  the implementation of the risk management framework. RMG is  structured into specialist functional divisions (depicted below) and  employs an integrated approach to risk analysis and management  across risk classes. RMG’s assessment and monitoring of risks  involves a collaborative effort across the divisions to ensure a  detailed analysis takes place both at the individual and aggregate  risk level. RMG’s oversight of risk is based on five principles: •	 independence: RMG is independent of Macquarie’s Operating  Groups and other Central Service Groups. The Head of RMG, as  the CRO, reports directly to the CEO with a secondary reporting  line to the BRiC. RMG approval is required for all material risk  acceptance decisions •	 centralised risk management: RMG’s responsibility  covers the whole of Macquarie. It assesses risks from a  company-wide perspective and provides a consistent approach  across Macquarie •	 approval of all new business activities: the Operating and  Central Service Groups may not undertake new businesses or  activities, offer new products, enter new markets, or undertake  significant projects without first consulting RMG. RMG reviews  and assesses risks and sets limits. Where appropriate, these  limits are approved by the Executive Committees and the Board •	 continuous assessment: RMG continually reviews risks to  account for changes in market circumstances and developments  within Macquarie’s business •	 frequent monitoring and reporting: the risk profile of  Macquarie with respect to all material risks is monitored by RMG  on an ongoing basis. Centralised systems exist to allow RMG  to monitor financial risks daily. For the valuation of all trading  positions and deals, daily revaluation factors are sourced, where  possible, from independent market sources. Reporting on all  material risks is provided to Senior Management, the Board and  relevant Board Committees. Internal audit The Internal Audit Division (IAD), as the third line, provides  independent and objective risk-based assurance to the Board Audit  Committee (BAC), Board, other relevant Board Committees and  Senior Management on the compliance with, and effectiveness of,  Macquarie’s financial and risk management framework, including  its governance, systems, structures, policies, processes and  people for managing material risks. The Internal Audit Division  assesses whether material risks have been properly identified  by management and reported to the Board or relevant Board  Committees, and whether key internal controls have been properly  designed and are operating effectively and sustainably to mitigate  those material risks. The BAC has primary power of direction over the IAD and is  accountable for reviewing the effectiveness of the IAD. The Head  of Internal Audit reports functionally to the BAC and is primarily  accountable to it. The Head of Internal Audit has unrestricted  access to the BAC (and its Chair) and meets privately with the  BAC members at least annually. The BAC monitors and reviews  the performance, objectives, rating, remuneration and degree of  independence of the Head of Internal Audit. The BAC also approves  any appointment and removal of the Head of Internal Audit.  The Head of Internal Audit reports operationally to the CRO for  day-to-day management. For audit matters relating to RMG, the  role of the CRO is substituted by the CEO.

Macquarie’s  Board-approved Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) defines the  overarching risk-taking settings of Macquarie through risk appetite  and risk tolerances.  As part of the Annual Strategy Review and Business Planning process,  RMG undertakes an independent review of Macquarie’s strategy  and considers how risks identified could individually or in aggregate  impact Macquarie’s risk profile and risk appetite. Macquarie’s strategy  and the outcome of RMG’s review together inform the annual review  of Macquarie’s risk appetite and tolerance settings.  Stress testing Stress testing is a key component of Macquarie’s risk management  framework and is integrated with Macquarie’s strategy review and  financial forecasting. Stress testing, including scenario analysis  and sensitivity analysis, is a key tool that informs the calibration  of Macquarie’s risk tolerances; provides insights into the Annual  Strategy Review and Business Planning process; and tests and  informs whether Macquarie’s strategy remains, and is forecast to  remain, in line with its risk appetite. Policies Policies are key tools for ensuring that risks taken are consistent  with Macquarie’s risk appetite. They are designed to set out the  principles that govern decision-making across Macquarie. New product and business approval process All new businesses, new products, major organisational projects,  and significant changes to existing businesses, products, processes  or systems which will expose Macquarie to new or significantly  varied risks must be assessed against the applicable risk appetite  and tolerances. This formal process sets out the requirement for each Operating  and Central Service Group to have a demonstrable robust change  management process to ensure material risks are appropriately  identified, assessed and within Macquarie’s risk appetite as defined  in the RAS. The Operating and Central Service Groups may not  undertake the proposed activity without first consulting RMG. RMG  reviews and assesses risk and sets limits. Where appropriate, these  limits are approved by the Executive Committee and the Board. RMG is also responsible for reviewing that all relevant internal  approvals are obtained prior to commencement. Risk culture A sound risk culture has been integral to Macquarie’s risk  management framework since inception. Macquarie sets, promotes,  monitors and reflects on the effectiveness of our risk culture. All  staff have a role in managing risk. Ownership of risk, including risk  culture, is at the business level. The Board, assisted by the BRiC,  is responsible for forming a view on Macquarie’s risk culture and  the extent to which it supports the ability of Macquarie to operate  consistently within its risk appetite. The Board also identifies  and monitors any necessary or desirable actions to change the  risk culture. Macquarie’s approach to maintaining a sound risk culture is based  on three components: Setting behavioural expectations Senior Management, with oversight from the Board, set behavioural  expectations. The way we fulfil Macquarie’s purpose is defined by  our principles of What We Stand For: Opportunity, Accountability  and Integrity. Staff are made aware that these principles must  form the basis of all behaviours and actions. These behavioural  expectations are specified in the Board-approved Code of Conduct,  which is actively promoted by Management and cascaded through  the organisation. Leading and executing Management implements behavioural expectations through: •	 leadership actions and communication •	 organisational governance •	 incentives and consequence management •	 organisational and individual capability. Monitoring, measuring and reporting Macquarie monitors and measures its risk culture to gauge  its effectiveness while promoting continuous improvement.  Mechanisms include: •	 reports incorporating behavioural indicators (such as policy,  limit and training breaches) prepared by all Operating and  Central Service Groups, including reports prepared by RMG, HR  and Macquarie’s Integrity Office, and escalated where relevant,  in accordance with our governance framework. These include  regular reports relating to risk culture which are provided to  Senior Management, the Board and relevant Board Committees •	 risk culture teams in both RMG Prudential Risk and IAD  undertake a range of business level and thematic assessments of  risk culture and behaviour. These mechanisms facilitate a feedback loop of sharing good  practice and lessons learnt to enable cultural alignment.  ===== PAGE 85 ===== 85 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Directors’ Report About Governance Remuneration and consequence management The Board considers that the effective alignment of remuneration  with prudent risk-taking is fundamental to Macquarie’s  remuneration approach. Risk considerations are embedded  throughout the remuneration process, including through the  determination of individual profit share allocations, business  group and company-wide profit share pools, as well as through the  way in which remuneration is structured and delivered. Effective  consequence management is a key component of Macquarie’s risk  culture. Macquarie aims to apply consequences for non-compliance  in a timely manner, and as fairly and consistently as possible. See the Remuneration Report for more details on  Macquarie’s remuneration framework and consequence  management process Conduct risk Macquarie defines conduct risk as the risk of behaviour, action or  omission by individuals employed by, or on behalf of, Macquarie  or taken collectively in representing Macquarie that may have a  negative outcome for our clients, counterparties, the communities  and markets in which we operate, our staff, or Macquarie. Such behaviour, actions or omissions may include: •	 breaches of laws or regulations •	 disregard for Macquarie’s principles of What We Stand For or the  Code of Conduct •	 negligence and/or a lack of reasonable care and diligence •	 failure to escalate improper conduct •	 inadequate product design and distribution. Conduct risk can arise inadvertently or deliberately in any of  Macquarie’s Operating and Central Service Groups. Macquarie’s approach to conduct risk management is integrated  in our risk management framework and is consistent with our  three lines of defence model. Risk-taking must be consistent  with Macquarie’s principles of What We Stand For and the  Board-approved Code of Conduct. Macquarie has a range of controls and processes in place to identify  and manage conduct risk, including: •	 new and emerging conduct risks are identified through the  annual strategy and business planning process •	 conduct risks that may arise when Macquarie establishes a new  business or product, or makes a significant change to an existing  business, product, process or system are identified and assessed  through the new business and product approval process •	 independent monitoring and surveillance conducted by RMG,  in addition to front line supervisory activities performed by  the business •	 the Risk and Control Self-Assessment requires businesses to  identify and assess their key conduct risks •	 supporting the efficient operation of markets through  appropriate controls and monitoring •	 where incidents occur, businesses investigate the underlying  contributing behaviours and  are responsible for recording all  conduct related issues and incidents in Macquarie’s Governance,  Risk and Compliance system, and escalating within the  set timeframes •	 performance-based remuneration reflects an individual’s  performance, which is assessed against a range of financial and  non-financial factors including approach to risk management  and compliance •	 an Integrity Office that is an independent point of contact  for staff to safely raise concerns about misconduct,  unethical behaviour or breaches of the Code of Conduct,  and protects those who raise concerns under Macquarie’s  Whistleblower Policy •	 a global Staff Hotline for staff who wish to speak up anonymously •	 a Customer Advocate Office (ANZ only) to promote fair and  reasonable customer complaint outcomes and to review and  assist with determining escalated customer complaints.  ===== PAGE 86 ===== 86 Risk Management Continued Market and credit risk Year-end performance indicators Macquarie monitors and measures a range of risks as outlined above in the risk management framework overview. The following graphs  provide historical and current year information on key market and credit risks. Trading revenue The effectiveness of Macquarie’s market risk management framework can be partially measured by Macquarie’s daily trading results. These  are daily profit and loss results that are directly attributable to market-based activity from Macquarie’s trading desks. Macquarie’s market risk activities continue to be based on earning income from client-facing businesses. The majority of trading income is  derived from client activities rather than outright proprietary trading activity. Macquarie’s trading results over time have shown consistent profits and low volatility. In FY2024, Macquarie made a net trading profit on 221  out of 260 trading days (FY2023 results: 208 out of 261 trading days).

The magnitude of VaR reflects changes in positions as well  as changes in market volatility, correlations and enhancements to the model. The integrity of the VaR model is regularly tested against daily  profit and loss. Macquarie’s market risk decreased compared to the previous year, primarily driven by lower commodity exposure from gas and power as well  as decreasing market volatility. VaR remains modest in comparison to capital and earnings, representing less than 0.2% of total equity.

As permitted by AASB 9, prior year  comparative information was not restated. AASB 9 contains requirements for the classification and measurement of certain financial  instruments, hedge accounting requirements and, from a credit provisioning perspective, introduced an expected credit loss methodology,  which differed to the incurred loss methodology applied prior to FY2019. For AASB 9 disclosures refer to Note 36.1 Credit risk to the financial statements including disclosure of loan asset exposures by stage of  credit performance. Note 13 Expected credit losses to the financial statements discloses expected credit losses on loan assets by stage of  credit performance. The FY2024 numbers presented below are calculated with reference to this information. Loan assets categorised as  Stage 3 in terms of AASB 9 are defined as ‘credit impaired’. As noted, AASB 9 did not require the restatement of comparative information,  and for that reason the comparative numbers in the graph below have not been restated. Underlying credit quality in FY2024, remains broadly unchanged relative to FY2023, with the reduction in Stage 1 & 2 Provisions, and Net  Credit Losses, being the result of a more favourable forward looking economic outlook as at 31 March 2024 compared to 31 March 2023 (as  disclosed in the Notes to the financial statements). The increase in Stage 3 Loan Assets, is the result of inflationary pressure on wages and  costs in addition to the higher interest rate environment.

Principal activities The principal activity of MGL during the financial year ended  31 March 2024 was to act as a Non-Operating Holding Company  (NOHC) for the Consolidated Entity.

Events subsequent to balance date At the date of this report the Directors are not aware of any  matter or circumstance, other than transactions disclosed in the  financial statements, that has arisen and has significantly affected  or may significantly affect the operations of the Consolidated  Entity, the results of those operations or the state of affairs  of the Consolidated Entity in the financial years subsequent to  31 March 2024. State of affairs There were no other significant changes in the state of affairs of the  Consolidated Entity that occurred during the financial year under  review that are not otherwise disclosed in this report. Operating and financial review Please refer to section 1 of this Annual Report for the following in  respect of the Consolidated Entity: •	 a review of operations during the year and the results of those  operations •	 likely developments in the operations in future financial years  and the expected results of those operations •	 comments on the financial position •	 comments on business strategies and prospects for future  financial years. In respect of likely developments, business strategies and prospects  for future financial years, material which if included would be likely  to result in unreasonable prejudice to the Consolidated Entity, has  been omitted. Environmental regulations The Consolidated Entity has policies and procedures in place that  are designed to ensure that, where operations are subject to any  particular and significant environmental regulation under a law of  the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, those obligations are  identified, appropriately addressed and material breaches notified. The Directors have determined that there has not been any material  breach of those obligations during the financial year.  ===== PAGE 93 ===== 93 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Governance About Directors’ Report Directors At the date of this report, the Directors of MGL are: Independent Directors G.R. Stevens AC, Chair J.R. Broadbent AC P.M. Coffey M.A. Hinchliffe S.J. Lloyd-Hurwitz R.J. McGrath M. Roche Executive Voting Director S.R. Wikramanayake, Managing Director and Chief Executive  Officer (CEO) Other than Ms Lloyd-Hurwitz, the Directors listed above each  held office as a Director of MGL throughout the financial year  ended 31 March 2024. Ms Lloyd-Hurwitz was appointed as an Independent Director on  1 June 2023. Ms N.M. Wakefield Evans AM retired as an Independent  Director on 29 February 2024. Those Directors listed as Independent Directors have been  independent throughout the period of their appointment.  Details of the qualifications, experience and special  responsibilities of the Directors and qualifications and  experience of the Company Secretaries at the date of this  report are set out on pages 96 to 100.  Directors’ and officers’ indemnification  and insurance Under MGL’s Constitution, MGL indemnifies all past and present  directors and secretaries of MGL and its wholly-owned subsidiaries  (including at this time the Directors named in this report and the  Secretaries), against certain liabilities and costs incurred by them  in their respective capacities. The indemnity covers the following  liabilities and legal costs (subject to the exclusions described  as follows): •	 every liability incurred by the person in their respective capacity •	 all legal costs incurred in defending or resisting (or otherwise  in connection with) proceedings in which the person becomes  involved because of their respective capacity •	 legal costs incurred by the person in good faith in obtaining  legal advice on issues relevant to the performance and discharge  of their duties as an officer of MGL and its wholly-owned  subsidiaries, if that has been approved in accordance with  MGL policy. This indemnity does not apply to the extent that: •	 MGL is forbidden by law to indemnify the person against the  liability or legal costs, or •	 an indemnity by MGL of the person against the liability or legal  costs, if given, would be made void by law. MGL has also entered into a Deed of Access, Indemnity, Insurance  and Disclosure (as amended from time to time) (Deed) with each of  the Directors. Under the Deed, MGL agrees to, among other things: •	 indemnify the Director upon terms broadly consistent with the  indemnity contained in MGL’s Constitution •	 take out and maintain an insurance policy against liabilities  incurred by the Director acting as an officer of MGL or its  wholly-owned subsidiaries. The insurance policy must be for  an amount and on terms and conditions appropriate for a  reasonably prudent company in MGL’s position. Insurance must  be maintained for seven years after the Director ceases to be a  Director or until any proceedings commenced during that period  have been finally resolved (including any appeal proceedings) •	 grant access to the Director to all relevant company papers  (including Board papers and other documents) for seven  years after the Director ceases to be a Director or until any  proceedings commenced during that period have been finally  resolved (including any appeal proceedings). In addition, MGL made an Indemnity and Insurance Deed Poll on  12 September 2007 (Deed Poll). The benefit of the undertakings  made by MGL under the Deed Poll have been given to each of the  directors, secretaries, persons involved in the management and  certain other persons, of MGL and its wholly-owned subsidiaries  and other companies where the person is acting as such at the  specific request of MGL and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The  Deed Poll provides for broadly the same indemnity and insurance  arrangements for those persons with the benefit of the Deed Poll  as for the Deed described above. However, the Deed Poll does not  provide for access to company documents. The indemnities and insurance arrangements provided for under  the MGL Constitution, the Deed and the Deed Poll, are broadly  consistent with the corresponding indemnities and insurance  arrangements provided under the MBL Constitution and deeds  entered into by MBL.  Macquarie maintains a Directors’ and Officers’ insurance policy that  provides cover for each person in favour of whom such insurance  is required to be taken out under the Deed and the Deed Poll and  for MGL in indemnifying such persons pursuant to the Deed and  the Deed Poll. Relevant individuals pay the premium attributable  to the direct coverage under the policy and MGL pays the premium  attributable to the company reimbursement coverage under the  policy. The Directors’ and Officers’ insurance policy prohibits  disclosure of the premium payable under the policy and the nature  of the liabilities insured. To the extent permitted by law, MGL has agreed to reimburse its  auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), for any liability (including  reasonable legal costs) PwC incurs in connection with any claim by  a third party arising from MGL’s breach of the letter of engagement  dated 5 July 2023.  ===== PAGE 94 ===== 94 Directors’ Report For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Directors’ equity participation and other relevant interests As at the date of this report, the Directors have relevant interests in MGL ordinary shares, MGL securities, or managed investment schemes  made available by related companies of MGL and other relevant disclosable interests, as notified by the Directors to ASX in accordance with  the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act), in the following: EQUITY PARTICIPATION OTHER RELEVANT INTERESTS Name and position MGL   ordinary shares RSUs held   in MEREP(1)  PSUs held  in MEREP(1) Direct and  Indirect Interests Number held Executive Voting Director S.R.

Against a backdrop of challenging market conditions during the  2024 financial year (FY2024), Macquarie has continued to deliver  on its strategy. The fundamentals of our businesses remain sound,  as demonstrated by the strength and diversity of the underlying  franchises, strong and conservative balance sheet, proven risk  management framework and our distinct culture.  Macquarie remains well positioned to deliver long-term sustainable  value for shareholders, consistent with our track record. In less  supportive markets, financial results in FY2024 are down from a record  FY2023. Consistent with our established remuneration framework  that rewards performance across a range of financial and non-financial  measures and aligns outcomes for staff with those of our shareholders,  total profit share awarded to staff is substantially down on the  prior year. Performance and remuneration outcomes  for FY2024 The Board remains focused on ensuring there is a robust and rigorous  process in place to determine remuneration outcomes. Significant  oversight and judgement are applied so that our remuneration  outcomes are aligned with both individual and company-wide financial  and non-financial performance and Macquarie’s ongoing success. In considering Macquarie’s non-financial performance, the Board  recognises the importance of sound ESG practices as part of their  responsibility to clients, shareholders, employees and the communities  in which Macquarie operates.  Financial performance Following record financial results in FY2023, Macquarie delivered: •	 net profit after tax (NPAT) of $A3,522 million in FY2024 (down 32%  from FY2023) •	 return on equity (ROE) of 10.8% (down compared to FY2023’s 16.9%) •	 earnings per share (EPS) of 916.6 cents per share (down 32%  compared to FY2023) •	 the FY2024 full-year dividend is down 15% compared to FY2023 Consistent with  our established  remuneration  framework that rewards  performance across a  range of financial and  non-financial measures  and aligns outcomes  for staff with those of  our shareholders, total  profit share awarded  to staff is substantially  down on the prior year.” Letter from the Chair of the Board  Remuneration Committee  ===== PAGE 107 ===== 107 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Governance About Directors’ Report The total compensation expense is in line with the prior year, impacted  by the higher average number of staff during the year, wage inflation  and unfavourable foreign exchange movements. These factors, as  well as lower overall revenue, led to the significant increase in the  compensation expense to income ratio to 43.1%.  Non-financial performance  In addition to financial performance, the Board’s determination of  remuneration outcomes for FY2024 for the CEO and other Executive  KMP reflects the following non-financial factors which the Board sees  as essential drivers of long-term sustainable growth:  •	 the strong leadership of the Executive Committee, led by the CEO,  to effectively role model our purpose and principles and to embed a  strong risk culture  •	 Executive Committee collaboration to solve challenges and   maximise opportunities across Operating and Central  Service Groups •	 the continued evolution of our businesses to remain well positioned  to deliver long-term sustainable value, including alignment  with areas of structural growth globally (e.g. energy transition,  infrastructure for digital and demographic shifts) •	 the continued focus on non-financial risks, including in areas such  as climate, sustainability and technology, while also uplifting our  risk management frameworks across trading, technology, cyber  and data. While there were no systemic risk issues identified during  the year, a legacy risk matter in MAM was taken into account in  determining the MGL CEO’s remuneration •	 a focus on streamlining investment programs and driving greater  returns on investment, following a period of significant investment  in our platform •	 investment in renewable energy solutions at scale, supporting the  next wave of climate technologies  •	 maintaining strong engagement and focus on meeting regulator  expectations including progress against the remediation program  with APRA to ensure there is appropriate focus on Macquarie Bank  Limited (MBL) •	 the refresh of our global employee value proposition to evolve in line  with shifts in talent expectations and ensure we accurately reflect  the career experience and distinct culture that Macquarie offers. In addition to assessing the performance of the CEO and other  Executive KMP, the BRC is also very aware of competitive market  pressures when determining remuneration outcomes. The attraction  and retention of high-performing, diverse talent, with deep industry  expertise, is a key element of Macquarie’s strategy. Macquarie’s  remuneration framework plays an important role in achieving this.  As part of determining remuneration outcomes, the BRC considers  relativities in the global markets in which each business competes  for talent, including in industries that are not publicly listed with  undisclosed remuneration outcomes.  Remuneration outcomes The Board and the BRC have given careful consideration to both  financial and non-financial factors, and we believe the following  outcomes for the year are appropriate: •	 MGL CEO awarded profit share has decreased 26% on the prior year  to $A23.75 million, which reflects the decrease in financial results  while considering her strong leadership and ongoing commitment to  fostering a positive culture •	 MBL CEO awarded profit share of $A3.75 million, reflecting efforts to  uplift the role of the MBL CEO •	 total comparable Executive KMP awarded profit share of  $A80.20 million (down 15% on the prior year)(1) (1)	 Comparable Executive KMP are KMP who are members of the Executive Committee for the full year in both FY2024 and FY2023. •	 Performance Share Unit (PSU) allocations of $A4.0 million for the  MGL CEO and $A2.8 million for each Executive KMP, in line with the  prior year. Changes to the remuneration framework Changes to our remuneration framework, including those previously  announced in the 2022 and 2023 Remuneration Reports, have been  implemented for FY2024 to meet the requirements of APRA Prudential  Standard CPS 511 Remuneration (CPS 511). These changes are  referenced throughout the relevant sections of this report and include: •	 fixed remuneration increases, effective 1 April 2023, the first  since 2010, other than adjustments made at the time of a new  appointment to the Executive Committee •	 a reduction in retention rates and vesting periods (to reflect that  awards from FY2024 will no longer be accelerated over two years in  the case of retirement or redundancy and will instead vest on their  original vesting schedule).  These changes are reflected in the awarded pay outcomes for Executive  KMP set out on pages 130-139. We engaged with APRA during the year in regard to our implementation  of CPS 511 and remain committed to ensuring our remuneration  framework complies with and considers the spirit and intent of CPS 511  and remains fit for purpose. Culture, accountability and remuneration Our approach to remuneration plays an important role in promoting  Macquarie’s culture. Our framework supports our purpose by  motivating staff to be innovative and build businesses but also be  accountable for their decisions, behaviours and associated risk  management, customer, economic and reputational consequences.  Our purpose and core principles of Opportunity, Accountability and  Integrity remain pivotal to our culture and effectively guide our staff  in balancing risk and reward when making decisions that realise  opportunities for the benefit of our clients, our shareholders, our  people and the communities in which we operate. The Board recognises  the importance of continually assessing Macquarie’s culture formally  through surveys and Board reporting and informally through direct  interactions with staff.  Risk management is a fundamental part of everyone’s role at  Macquarie. Staff understand that they are rewarded for their  performance, including the identification and management of risk,  and that there are consequences for non-compliance with Macquarie’s  behavioural expectations.  In FY2024, there were 131 (FY2023: 129) matters involving conduct or  policy breaches that resulted in formal consequences. Consistent with  prior years, further details regarding these matters are disclosed on  page 122.  The BRC assessed and determined that there were no instances that  required the application of malus or clawback during the year. I look forward to receiving your views and support at the 2024 Annual  General Meeting. Jillian Broadbent AC  Chair  Board Remuneration Committee Sydney  3 May 2024  ===== PAGE 108 ===== 108 This page has been intentionally left blank.  ===== PAGE 109 ===== 109 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Governance About Directors’ Report Remuneration Report Remuneration framework This section explains the link between our purpose, our remuneration objectives and principles, and how these are reflected in the  remuneration framework. Our purpose statement, ‘Empowering people to innovate and invest  for a better future,’ articulates why Macquarie exists and what we  do. It supports our What We Stand For principles of Opportunity,  Accountability and Integrity, which express how we do business. Our  longstanding and consistent approach to remuneration continues  to support this purpose and aligns with our What We Stand  For principles. Our remuneration framework has been a key driver of our  sustained success as an international organisation. Staff are  motivated to grow businesses over the medium to long-term,  taking accountability for all decisions and their accompanying risk  management, customer, economic and reputational outcomes.  Their interests are aligned with shareholders to meet the needs of  clients and customers, while ensuring that the spirit and intent of  regulatory requirements are upheld. This framework has been fundamental in ensuring we can continue  to attract, motivate and retain exceptional and entrepreneurial  people with deep industry expertise across the 34 markets in which  we operate. These people come from organisations that broadly  operate in the same markets and compete for the same people  as Macquarie in various industry sectors (including hedge funds,  private equity firms, global investment banks, fund managers,  advisory boutiques, commodity houses and other banks, as well  as industries that are not specific to banking or financial services,  for example, technology, accounting, and engineering) across  many jurisdictions.  This broad approach has been in place since Macquarie’s inception  and is reviewed regularly to ensure the framework continues to  meet our remuneration objectives and aligns with our remuneration  principles and the expectations of our stakeholders. The table below shows the link between our purpose, What We Stand For principles and our remuneration objectives and principles. Our purpose:  Empowering people to innovate and invest for a better future Opportunity Accountability Integrity  Remuneration objectives  Remuneration principles Macquarie’s remuneration framework is designed to: •	 attract, motivate and retain exceptional people with deep  industry expertise •	 deliver strong company performance over the short and  long-term whilst prudently managing risk •	 promote effective management of financial and non-financial  risks, and Macquarie’s long-term soundness •	 align the interests of staff and shareholders to deliver  sustained results for our customers, clients and community  •	 promote innovation and the building of sustainable businesses •	 drive behaviours that reflect Macquarie’s culture and the  principles of What We Stand For and support the prevention  and mitigation of conduct risk •	 foster a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment. These objectives are achieved by:  •	 emphasising performance-based remuneration  •	 determining an individual’s variable remuneration based on a  range of financial and non-financial factors  •	 having the ability to adjust performance-based remuneration  to reflect risk outcomes, where appropriate •	 retaining a significant proportion of performance-based  remuneration to enable risk outcomes to be considered over a  longer period •	 delivering retained profit share in equity to ensure the  interests of staff and shareholders are aligned over  the long-term •	 remunerating high-performing staff appropriately, relative to  global peers •	 providing consistent arrangements over time to give staff the  confidence to pursue multi-year initiatives.  ===== PAGE 110 ===== 110 Remuneration Report Continued Remuneration framework for FY2024 The remuneration framework operates as an integrated whole. An individual’s remuneration comprises fixed remuneration, profit share and,  for Executive Committee members (our Executive KMP), Performance Share Units (PSUs).  The table below and diagram opposite summarise the framework for FY2024. FY2024 remuneration framework Fixed remuneration •	 primarily comprises base salary, as well as superannuation contributions and standard country-specific benefits in line with local  market practice •	 for Executive KMP, is set at a comparatively low level, relative to the industry, and is a low proportion of total remuneration but  sufficient to avoid inappropriate risk-taking •	 is reviewed annually and reflects technical and functional expertise, role scope, market practice and regulatory requirements •	 for risk and financial control staff, is generally a higher proportion of total remuneration than for revenue-generating staff. Performance-based remuneration Criteria Profit share  Performance Share Units Eligibility •	 all permanent employees •	 Executive Committee members Determination •	 allocations reflect an individual’s performance,  which is assessed against a range of financial and  non-financial factors including: 	– financial/business results 	– risk management and compliance 	– business leadership including outcomes for  customers and the community 	– people leadership and professional conduct •	 individual allocations reflect their role as members  of the Executive Committee and their contribution  to driving the collective performance of Macquarie •	 allocations are based on the face value of shares  on the grant date •	 allocations are subject to Board discretion Structure •	 significant proportion is retained (70% for the  CEO, 60% for the MBL CEO and 50% for other  Executive KMP) •	 long deferral periods (three to five years for  the CEO and other Executive KMP) •	 retained profit share is invested in a combination  of Macquarie equity and Macquarie-managed  fund equity •	 PSUs are structured as Deferred Share Units (DSUs)  with no exercise price(2) •	 PSUs vest after five years for the CEO and MBL  CEO and four years for other Executive KMP,  subject to the achievement of two performance  hurdles (no retesting of hurdles) and, new from  FY2024, a pre-vest assessment (see page 117)  •	 PSU holders have no right to dividend  equivalent payments Malus  and Clawback •	 malus applies to all awards  •	 clawback applies to all Executive KMP and certain  employees identified under CPS 511 or UK and  European remuneration regulations •	 malus and clawback apply to all awards Forfeiture •	 retained profit share is subject to forfeiture upon  leaving Macquarie except in certain circumstances •	 unvested PSUs are subject to forfeiture upon  leaving Macquarie except in certain circumstances (2)	 A DSU is a Deferred Share Unit and is an award type under the Macquarie Group Employee Retained Equity Plan (MEREP).

Annual process to determine profit share outcomes Profit share allocations are determined through a principles-based approach, which considers individual, business group and company-wide  performance. At all levels, profit share determinations take into account risk management, compliance and conduct. Individual profit share allocations Individual profit share allocations reflect an employee’s performance against their objectives, which are formally assessed annually. At the  beginning of the performance cycle, employees set performance objectives based on four factors (three non-financial and one financial),  as relevant to their role. At the end of the year, permanent employees are required to have a formal Year in Review conversation with their  manager. The Year in Review comprises two core components: •	 What was achieved over the past 12 months, measured against their objectives under the four factors •	 How the objectives were achieved, measured against Macquarie’s cultural/behavioural standards.  The below table outlines the areas considered under each factor when assessing performance and determining remuneration outcomes. Areas considered Financial/  business results •	 for revenue-generating staff, based on individual contribution to business profitability (including consideration  of capital and risk-adjusted returns) •	 for risk and financial control staff, primarily based on delivery of or contribution to high quality risk and control  functions, services and outcomes •	 for other Central Service Group staff, delivery of or contribution to high quality services to support  the businesses •	 for all staff, the management of costs and investment in people and technology to ensure the ongoing  robustness of the risk management framework. Risk management  and compliance •	 demonstrating and applying a strong understanding of relevant regulatory obligations  •	 the identification, escalation, ownership and successful management of financial and non-financial risks •	 motivating a culture of disciplined risk management, and regulatory, policy and business compliance •	 fostering an environment where staff feel comfortable to admit mistakes and raise issues or concerns. Business leadership •	 focuses on sustainable business growth and innovation by prioritising long-term and scalable solutions over  tactical fixes •	 delivering appropriate solutions and services to our customers and the communities in which we operate •	 maintaining and leveraging relationships with external and internal stakeholders (includes regulators,  customers, clients, communities and suppliers) •	 seeking out and valuing collaboration and diverse perspectives (internally and externally), including  collaborating with others to solve issues and challenges across Operating and Central Service Groups. People leadership  and professional  conduct •	 upholding Macquarie’s What We Stand For values and complying with all operational requirements, regulatory  obligations, relevant laws, policies and procedures, including the Code of Conduct •	 promoting institutional knowledge-sharing, talent development and succession planning •	 fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment, including alignment with Macquarie’s  DEI strategy •	 for all people managers, performance against a people management objective aligned to our purpose  and culture. Three of these four factors are non-financial, with considerations given to each in varying proportions to reflect an individual’s role and  responsibilities. Individual profit share allocations also consider relativities in the markets in which each business competes for talent. When determining individual profit share allocations, consideration is given to any matters raised in the independent reports provided to the  BRC by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and the Head of Internal Audit, or matters raised through the consequence management process, which  may result in downward adjustments to profit share allocations for relevant individuals (see page 122). Significant judgement is applied in  determining remuneration outcomes to ensure all factors that may potentially impact the quantum of profit share allocations are considered.  ===== PAGE 113 ===== 113 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Governance About Directors’ Report Profit share pools  The initial business group profit share pools are determined through a combination of a top-down and bottom-up approach. The  company-wide profit share pool is an aggregate of the assessments conducted at both the business group and individual level.  The profit share pools reflect consideration of the factors below: Operating/Central Service Group level Financial performance For Operating Groups: •	 contribution to  company-wide profits •	 returns on economic and  regulatory capital  •	 funding requirements  and usage. For Central Service Groups,  based on the quality and  integrity of control functions  and support services and not  primarily determined with  reference to profitability. Risk management •	 risk profile of the business  (e.g. capital usage) •	 extent and nature of financial  and non-financial risks  including any significant  reputational, cultural or  compliance matters •	 regulatory environment  and regulatory risk  considerations. Business-specific  considerations •	 innovation, new business  development (including  acquisitions) and maturity of  the business •	 reliance on intellectual versus  financial capital •	 customer, client and  community outcomes •	 impact of one-time  gains/losses. Market position and trends •	 overall remuneration levels  in the market in which each  business operates •	 staff retention  considerations. Macquarie Group/Macquarie Bank level Additional considerations at a Macquarie Group and Macquarie Bank level include: •	 profitability, including the balance of profit distribution between employees and shareholders •	 capital metrics (including prudential ratios) and liquidity considerations •	 impact of the profit share pool on Macquarie’s capital position and the ability to strengthen its capital base, as confirmed by the Chief  Financial Officer (CFO) •	 reasonableness of the resultant estimated compensation expense to income ratio and how it compares to that of external comparators  •	 regulatory considerations, including any company-wide risk and conduct matters  •	 factors that impact the macro environment in which Macquarie operates, including those that may affect its ability to attract and  retain high-performing staff •	 CRO and Head of Internal Audit confirmation as to whether there have been any matters of systemic concern during the year. The Board retains discretion to amend the profit share pool as determined in accordance with the above process to ensure all relevant  factors, including risk and conduct matters, have been appropriately taken into consideration.  ===== PAGE 114 ===== 114 Remuneration Report Continued Retained profit share: retention and vesting A percentage of each individual’s annual profit share allocation is retained (retained profit share) above certain thresholds. While they  are employed, an individual’s retained profit share vests and is released over a period that reflects the scope and nature of their role and  responsibilities.(3) These arrangements ensure that Macquarie continues to retain high-performing staff, provide significant long-term  alignment to shareholders and customers, as well as enable risk outcomes to be considered over a longer period.  Retention and vesting arrangements are determined by the BRC according to prevailing market conditions, remuneration trends, and  regulatory requirements (including CPS 511, the Banking Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR) and the Financial Accountability Regime  (FAR)). For each year’s allocation, once the vesting period has been determined it remains fixed for that allocation.  As previously announced, there have been changes to the retention rates and vesting periods for certain senior employees (including the CEO,  Executive KMP and other roles specified under CPS 511) for profit share allocations made in respect of FY2024 onwards.  The table below summarises the standard retention and vesting arrangements applicable for FY2024. These vesting periods do not include  the performance year but begin following the date remuneration is awarded.  Standard profit share retention and vesting arrangements for FY2024 Role Profit share retention (%) Vesting and release of profit share CEO 70 One-third in each of years 3–5 MBL CEO 60 Executive Committee members 50 Other Executive Directors(4),(5)  40 Staff other than Executive Directors(5),(6)  25–40 One-third in each of years 2–4 The Board’s discretion to change remuneration arrangements, as noted above, includes changes to profit share retention levels provided that  at least 30% of profit share is retained for all Executive Directors.  (3)	 Profit share that is not retained (available profit share) is delivered in cash except for certain staff subject to requirements under UK or European remuneration regulations, where  50% of available profit share is delivered in Macquarie equity and is subject to either a 6-month or 12-month hold period, as applicable. (4)	 Other Executive Directors include staff other than the CEO and Executive KMP who are specified under CPS 511 as Senior Managers or Material Risk Takers. (5)	 For certain staff subject to UK or European remuneration regulations, up to 60% may be retained. Retained profit share invested in Macquarie equity may be subject to a further  6-month or 12-month hold post the vesting period. (6)	 Above certain monetary thresholds.  ===== PAGE 115 ===== 115 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Governance About Directors’ Report Investment of retained profit share An individual’s retained profit share is invested in a combination of MGL ordinary shares under the Macquarie Group Employee Retained  Equity Plan (MEREP) and Macquarie-managed fund equity notionally invested under the Directors’ Profit Share (DPS) Plan.(7) The allocation  reflects the nature of their role and responsibilities as set out in the table below.

For example, this may include investment in funds or products of a specific business group where there is a  need to directly align the interests of staff with those of their clients. Forfeiture – malus and clawback The Board has the ability to reduce or eliminate unvested retained profit share in certain circumstances (malus). In FY2024, the population  subject to malus was expanded to include all staff (previously malus applied to senior employees). For certain employees identified under CPS  511 or UK and European remuneration regulations, the Board also has the ability to recover (in whole or in part) vested profit share in certain  circumstances (clawback). For more details on Macquarie’s malus and clawback framework, see page 121. Vesting and release of retained profit share upon departure from Macquarie The standard policy is that staff who cease employment with Macquarie will forfeit their unvested retained profit share. The Board may  exercise discretion for the vesting and release of a departing employee’s retained profit share after their employment has ended including,  for example, in the case of retirement from Macquarie, redundancy, death, serious incapacitation, disability, or serious ill health. Where such  discretion is exercised, the release of any profit share may be subject to malus and/or clawback, as applicable, and the Board may impose  such other conditions as it considers appropriate. For Executive Directors, the Board’s discretion for the vesting and release of retained profit  share under these circumstances is subject to the conditions of release as set out below. Discretion may be exercised in certain other limited exceptional circumstances on the grounds of business efficacy, in relation to strategic  business objectives, including in connection with the divestment or internalisation of Macquarie businesses, or when an employee resigns to  fulfil a public service role in a governmental organisation or agency. This year, such discretion has been exercised and retained profit share  was approved to be released for eight executives due to their transition during FY2024 to employment, engagement or appointment, with or  for an asset or a portfolio company of a Macquarie-managed fund or an operationally segregated subsidiary. (7)	 Both the MEREP and DPS Plan are fundamental tools in Macquarie’s retention, alignment and risk management strategies, encompassing both long-term retention arrangements  and equity holding requirements. The MEREP has a flexible plan structure that offers different types of equity grants depending on the jurisdiction in which the participating  employees are based. In most cases, the equity grants are in the form of units comprising a beneficial interest in MGL ordinary shares held in a trust for the staff member  (Restricted Share Units or RSUs). For further details on the MEREP, refer to Note 32 Employee equity participation to the financial statements in the Financial Report. The DPS  Plan comprises exposure to a notional portfolio of Macquarie-managed funds. Retained amounts are notionally invested over the retention period. This investment is described as  ‘notional’ because Executive Directors do not directly hold securities in relation to this investment. (8)	 For certain Executive Directors subject to UK or European remuneration regulations, retained profit share is invested 60% in Macquarie equity and 40% in the DPS Plan. (9)	 For certain Executive Directors with funds responsibilities subject to UK or European remuneration regulations, retained profit share is invested 50% in Macquarie equity and 50% in  the DPS Plan. (10)	 For staff other than Executive Directors, retained profit share is generally 100% invested in Macquarie equity with the exception of those staff with funds responsibilities where  retained profit share is invested in a combination of Macquarie equity and Macquarie-managed fund equity.  ===== PAGE 116 ===== 116 Remuneration Report Continued Conditions of release to departing Executive Directors – Post Employment Events Where discretion has been exercised for the vesting and release of retained profit share to a departing Executive Director, the Board may  reduce or eliminate their retained profit share if it is determined that, at any time during their employment or the relevant release periods  after their employment, a Malus Event has occurred (as set out on page 121) or they have: (a)	 taken staff to a competitor of Macquarie or been instrumental in causing staff to go to a competitor, or (b)	 joined a competitor of Macquarie or otherwise participated in a business that competes with Macquarie. Each of the above is a Post Employment Event. For retained profit share awarded in respect of FY2023 and subsequent years, where the release relates to relevant circumstances other  than death or serious disability, the release will occur over the period from 12 months to 24 months after the Executive Director leaves, in  accordance with the table below.(11),(12) For profit share allocations made to Executive KMP and other Executive Directors specified in CPS 511 (including those in risk and financial  control functions) in respect of FY2024 onwards, the release of unvested retained profit share will be kept in line with its original vesting  schedule (where it relates to relevant circumstances other than death or serious disability). This may result in final vesting being up to five  years from the end of employment. There is no change in the timeframe for application of the Post Employment Events set out below. First Period Second Period Time post-departure 12 months 12 months to 24 months Unvested retained  profit share released From all but the last 24 months of employment From the last 24 months of employment Subject to malus No Malus Event during employment or the First Period No Malus Event during employment, the First Period or the  Second Period Subject to Post  Employment Events No Post Employment Event during employment or  during the period expiring 6 months following the end of  employment, and No Post Employment Event during employment or  during the period expiring 6 months following the end of  employment, and No Post Employment Event (a) during the period from 6  months to 12 months following the end of employment  No Post Employment Event (a) during the period from 6  months to 12 months following the end of employment Where the release is by  reason of retirement  from Macquarie As above and in addition, the release is subject to no Post  Employment Event (b) during the First Period As above and in addition, the release is subject to no Post  Employment Event (b) during the First or Second Period In addition to the above, for Accountable Persons under the FAR (Accountable Persons), the exercise of discretion for any release of retained  profit share following the end of employment will be subject to minimum deferral periods. Where an Executive Director has a tax liability  on termination of employment in respect of any unvested retained profit share, the Board has discretion to release unvested retained  profit share up to an amount equal to the Executive Director’s tax liability at an earlier time than noted above subject to any legal or  regulatory requirements. (11)	 In the case of death or serious incapacitation, the Board will typically accelerate the vesting of retained profit share and immediately release it. (12)	 Awards in respect of FY2022 and earlier will remain subject to their original conditions of release to a departing Executive Director, as previously disclosed.  ===== PAGE 117 ===== 117 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Governance About Directors’ Report Performance Share Units This section describes the way in which PSUs are determined, structured and delivered.  Allocation and structure Executive Committee members are the only staff eligible to receive PSUs, which are determined with reference to Macquarie’s performance  as a whole. As such they provide an additional incentive to Executive Committee members to drive company-wide performance over the  long-term and beyond their Operating and Central Service Group responsibilities. PSU awards are a meaningful incentive but are generally not  the major element of an Executive Committee member’s total remuneration.  As previously announced, for awards in respect of FY2024 onwards, the vesting period for PSUs granted to the CEO and the MBL CEO has  been extended by a year, to five years. In addition, prior to the vesting of PSUs, the Board will conduct a pre-vest assessment of the Executive  Committee’s collective performance over the vesting period. The table below summarises the approach to PSU allocations in respect  of FY2024. 1. Pre-grant period (Financial Year (FY)) •	 Individual PSU allocations are based on performance over the financial year prior to grant (taking into consideration both financial and   non-financial factors). Considerations include their role as members of the Executive Committee and their contribution to driving  the collective performance of Macquarie, including their collaboration across businesses, progress on company-wide programs and  maintaining Macquarie’s risk culture.  •	 The face value of PSUs awarded to each Executive Committee member is approved by the Board as part of the annual remuneration  review process. Shareholder approval is also sought at MGL’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) to allocate PSU awards to the MGL CEO,  who is an Executive Voting Director. •	 PSUs are granted in August each year, after MGL’s AGM, in respect of the previous financial year. The number of PSUs allocated is  calculated by dividing the face value of the award by the price of MGL ordinary shares on or around the date of grant. •	 PSUs are structured as DSUs with no exercise price. Holders have no right to dividend equivalent payments. 2. Performance period (FY+1 to FY+4) •	 PSUs will only become exercisable to the extent that two equally weighted ROE and EPS performance hurdles are achieved over a  four-year performance period. Details of, and the rationale for, the ROE and EPS hurdles are set out below. •	 The ROE and EPS performance hurdles attached to PSUs are tested at the end of the performance period and the results are reported  to the BRC. 3. Additional vesting period (FY+5) •	 For the CEO and the MBL CEO, an additional one-year period applies before PSUs may vest following the end of the four-year  performance period. •	 For other Executive KMP, PSUs may vest on 1 July following the end of the four-year performance period. 4. Pre-vest assessment (At end of vesting period) •	 Prior to vesting of PSU awards, the Board will conduct a holistic assessment of the Executive Committee’s collective contribution to  driving the performance of Macquarie over the vesting period, based on the extent to which the Executive Committee has: 	– promoted behaviour that is consistent with and reflects Macquarie’s risk culture, Code of Conduct and the principles of   What We Stand For 	– overseen the effectiveness of Macquarie’s risk management framework, regulatory compliance, policies and practices in managing  key financial and non-financial risks, and 	– overseen funding, liquidity and capital management to ensure Macquarie’s financial soundness. •	 Where the Board forms a negative overall assessment of the relevant Executive Committee’s collective performance, it will consider  whether an adjustment is appropriate, taking into account any mitigating and aggravating factors. •	 To assist the Board with their determination of an adjustment to the PSU vesting outcome, and to ensure that the determination  encompasses all relevant considerations, the BRC will receive regular reporting over the vesting period.  ===== PAGE 118 ===== 118 Remuneration Report Continued Performance hurdles PSUs will only become exercisable to the extent that the following performance hurdles are achieved: EPS CAGR hurdle ROE hurdle Application 50% of PSU award 50% of PSU award Performance  measure Compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in EPS over the  four-year performance period Relative average annual ROE over the four-year  performance period compared to a reference group of  international financial institutions. The reference group comprises Bank of America  Corporation, Barclays PLC, Citigroup Inc.,  Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,  JP Morgan Chase & Co., Lazard Ltd, Morgan Stanley and  UBS AG.(13),(14)  Hurdle Sliding scale applies: •	 50% becoming exercisable at EPS CAGR of 7.5% •	 100% at EPS CAGR of 12% For example, if EPS CAGR was 9.75%, 75% of the  relevant awards would become exercisable Sliding scale applies: •	 50% becoming exercisable above the 50th percentile •	 100% at the 75th percentile For example, if ROE achievement was at the 60th  percentile, 70% of the relevant awards would become  exercisable Rationale for hurdles (13)	 Company comparator information is presented in the same order throughout the Remuneration Report (14)	 For unvested PSU awards made prior to FY2023, the reference group included Bank of America Corporation, Barclays PLC, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Inc.,  JP Morgan Chase & Co., Lazard Ltd, Morgan Stanley and UBS AG. The PSU hurdles are periodically reviewed by the BRC to ensure  they continue to align the interests of staff and shareholders  and provide a challenging but meaningful incentive to Executive  Committee members. The BRC’s review includes consideration  of the most relevant performance metrics to be used as hurdles  as well as the levels at which the hurdles are achieved. The  international reference group used for the ROE hurdle is also  reviewed to determine whether our comparators remain suitable for  Macquarie’s diversified business interests and global footprint. The  BRC also considers historical and forecast market data, the views of  corporate governance groups, shareholders and regulators, as well  as market practice.  In the FY2024 annual review, both the absolute EPS and relative  ROE hurdles were considered to still be appropriate for the  following reasons: •	 EPS and ROE growth drive long-term shareholder value and are  appropriate as the Executive Committee can affect outcomes  on both measures. In contrast, Total Shareholder Return (TSR) is  influenced by many external factors over which executives have  limited control •	 EPS and ROE can be substantiated using information that is  disclosed in Macquarie’s annual reports •	 a sliding scale diversifies the risk of not achieving the hurdles and  provides rewards proportionate to performance for shareholders  and is preferable to an all-or-nothing test, which some have  argued could promote excessive risk-taking •	 the hurdles are designed to reward sustained strong  performance and are relatively well-insulated from  short-term fluctuations  •	 the EPS targets are confirmed as rigorous when market  performance is considered, with the EPS threshold hurdle  exceeding the performance of most of the ASX20, the  international reference group and relevant indices over time •	 for the EPS element to fully vest, Macquarie needs to achieve at  least 12% CAGR over the vesting period. Supporting the rigour  of the hurdle, cumulative EPS growth of 57% over four years is  required to achieve full vesting  •	 the ROE vesting thresholds and sliding scale are in line with  the domestic market and are particularly challenging when  compared to international practice.   ===== PAGE 119 ===== 119 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Governance About Directors’ Report The charts below display Macquarie’s historical EPS and ROE PSU outcomes, highlighting that since their introduction in 2009, 48% of the EPS  tranches and 56% of the ROE tranches have resulted in full vesting.

Use of an international reference group The BRC has given careful consideration to the appropriate  reference group to use for the relative ROE measure, recognising  that Macquarie’s combination of business activities, size and  global footprint means that there are few direct comparators.  The BRC’s view is that simplistic comparator groups based on a  company’s country of listing, broad industry categorisation and/or  market capitalisation do not accurately reflect the businesses and  competitive markets for talent in which we operate.  When assessing and determining the appropriate reference group,  the BRC considers the overall size of the reference group, the  degree of internationalisation (including the degree to which they  compete for shareholder capital, clients and talent in each market),  each comparator’s overlap with Macquarie’s revenue mix and  the resulting business mix when considered in aggregate. Taking  into account these factors, the BRC has selected an international  reference group that recognises the extent of Macquarie’s  diversification and internationalisation.  The BRC is mindful that some of Macquarie’s businesses compete  with other types of financial institutions, including asset managers,  retail banks, hedge funds and commodity trading houses. However,  given differences in business mix, regulatory environment, or  the unavailability of public financial information, it does not  consider these institutions appropriate for inclusion in the PSU  reference group.  The BRC considers the international reference group to be  appropriate on the basis that: •	 total international income represented approximately  66% of Macquarie’s total income as at 31 March 2024,  with approximately 51% of Macquarie’s staff located  outside Australia(15) •	 the international reference group is currently most  representative of Macquarie’s business operations and talent  pool. These firms broadly operate in the same markets and in  similar business segments and compete for the same people  as Macquarie •	 the international reference group members share broadly  comparable risk, compliance and regulatory profiles •	 Macquarie has no directly comparable Australian-listed peers. While the BRC considers it important not to intervene reactively to  remove under-performers or over-performers in order to provide  relative stability and transparency across market cycles, it reviews  and adapts the reference group as companies, markets and other  situations evolve.  Risk adjustment, malus and clawback The Board may determine that a downward adjustment to PSU  allocations prior to grant may be appropriate, including a collective  adjustment where there has been an adverse outcome for MGL,  MBL or their stakeholders. Risk considerations also form part of the  pre-vest assessment, as set out above. In addition, Macquarie’s malus and (from FY2024) clawback  provisions apply to all PSUs granted, as set out on page 121. Departure from Macquarie or change in control  The standard policy is that unvested PSUs will be forfeited upon  termination of employment. In the case of retirement from  Macquarie, redundancy, death, serious incapacitation, disability,  serious ill-health or other limited exceptional circumstances, the  Board or the BRC has the ability to accelerate the vesting of PSUs  (to the extent permitted by law or regulation, for example in the  case of death or serious incapacitation) or to take other action,  for example to permit the PSUs to continue to vest in accordance  with the original award schedule and remain subject to the same  performance hurdles. Should a change of control occur, the Board or the BRC has  discretion to determine how unvested PSUs should be treated,  having regard to factors such as the length of time elapsed in the  performance and vesting periods, the level of performance to date,  the circumstances of the change in control and any relevant legal or  regulatory requirements.  ===== PAGE 120 ===== 120 Remuneration Report Continued Culture, accountability and remuneration This section describes how risk and conduct are considered throughout Macquarie’s remuneration approach. Risk culture Our purpose of ‘Empowering people to innovate and invest for a  better future’ and What We Stand For principles of Opportunity,  Accountability and Integrity remain pivotal to our culture. Our  purpose and principles effectively guide our staff in balancing risk  and reward and making decisions that realise opportunity for the  benefit of our clients, shareholders, partners, and the communities  in which we operate. Staff are continually made aware that these  principles must form the basis of all behaviours and actions. These  behavioural expectations are outlined in the Board approved  Code of Conduct, which is actively promoted by management and  cascaded through the organisation through multiple mechanisms.  We invest significant time and effort in communicating and  reinforcing our culture through communications from senior  management, policy reminders, training, and learning and  development activities. The Board is able to assess Macquarie’s  culture in a number of ways including through staff survey results,  human capital reporting, strategy presentations, risk culture  reports, consequence management reports as well as through  personal observation of management, and staff behaviour  and actions. Prudent risk management is a fundamental part of everyone’s role  at Macquarie. Staff understand they are rewarded not just for their  contribution to financial results, but also for how those results are  achieved. This includes an assessment of an individual’s approach  to managing risk, and adherence with the What We Stand For  principles. Staff are aware of the consequences for non-compliance  with the risk management framework and Macquarie’s Code  of Conduct. Staff training and communications emphasise the  link between risk, conduct, policy breaches and consequence  management outcomes, including, where appropriate, adjustments  to performance-based remuneration. Alignment of remuneration with risk outcomes The Board considers that the effective alignment of remuneration  with prudent risk-taking is fundamental to Macquarie’s  remuneration approach. Risk considerations are embedded  throughout the remuneration process including through the  determination of individual profit share allocations, business group  and company-wide profit share pools as well as through the way in  which remuneration is structured and delivered.  The Board is aware of the increasing focus of regulators and  shareholders on ensuring risk-related matters that come to light  subsequent to remuneration being awarded are appropriately  factored into remuneration decisions. Macquarie’s retention and  vesting arrangements provide a mechanism for the Board to  consider risk outcomes over a longer period. Furthermore, where an  investigation has commenced into a risk or conduct-related matter  that may result in forfeiture, malus or clawback (where applicable  – see page 122), Macquarie may further defer the payment, vesting  and/or release of profit share to allow for the investigation to  be completed.   ===== PAGE 121 ===== 121 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Governance About Directors’ Report Culture, accountability and remuneration continued (16)	 A “Group within Macquarie” is a reference to any Operating Group or Central Service Group within MGL or MBL. The following mechanisms exist to adjust FY2024 remuneration outcomes for risk and conduct outcomes: In-year adjustments Applies to all staff •	 for profit share, determined as part of assessing an individual’s performance each year, which includes consideration of compliance  with the risk management framework and with the behavioural expectations outlined in the Code of Conduct  •	 for PSUs, determined as part of the assessment of Executive Committee members’ roles and their contribution to driving the collective  performance of Macquarie •	 in addition, any outcomes from the consequence management process (such as a formal warning) or the independent reporting from  the CRO, Head of Internal Audit, and Group General Counsel (GGC) are also considered for both profit share and PSUs. Forfeiture Applies to all staff •	 where an individual’s employment is terminated due to a compliance or conduct concern (or they resign), unvested remuneration is  forfeited, as per our standard policy. Malus Applies to all staff Malus provisions provide the Board with the ability to reduce or eliminate in full unvested remuneration (including retained profit share,  and for Executive Committee members, unvested PSUs), where it is determined: •	 there was a significant error in or a significant misstatement of criteria on which the remuneration determination was based, or •	 the employee has at any time:  	– engaged in misconduct leading to significant adverse outcomes 	– acted dishonestly (including, but not limited to, misappropriating funds or deliberately concealing a transaction) 	– significantly failed in or breached their compliance, accountability or fitness and propriety requirements, or 	– acted or failed to act in a way that contributed to, and/or by virtue of their role or seniority is accountable for: 	– a breach of a significant legal or significant regulatory requirement relevant to Macquarie 	– MGL or MBL making a material financial restatement  	– MGL, MBL or any Group within Macquarie incurring significant reputational harm(16) 	– MGL, MBL or any Group within Macquarie incurring a significant unexpected financial loss, impairment charge, cost or provision 	– a significant failure of financial or non-financial risk management, or 	– a significant adverse outcome for customers, beneficiaries or other stakeholders. Clawback Applies to certain senior employees Clawback provisions provide the Board with the ability to recover in exceptional circumstances (in part or whole) variable remuneration  that has already been paid or vested for up to two years from the point of payment or vesting, if it is determined that: •	 there was a significant error in or a significant misstatement of criteria on which the remuneration determination was based •	 the employee has at any time engaged in misconduct leading to significant adverse outcomes •	 the employee has at any time significantly failed in or breached their compliance, accountability or fitness and propriety  requirements, or •	 the employee has at any time acted or failed to act in a way that contributed to: 	– a significant failure of financial or non-financial risk management, or 	– a significant adverse outcome for customers, beneficiaries or other stakeholders. Additional provisions may apply to staff in certain jurisdictions to ensure compliance with local regulations. This includes UK and European  staff who are subject to additional malus and clawback provisions under local regulatory requirements. The BRC considers whether, and the extent to which, to apply malus or clawback, taking into account local employment laws, the nature and  circumstances of the event and any other redress that has been or may be applied.   ===== PAGE 122 ===== 122 Remuneration Report Continued Risk adjustment processes There are robust processes in place to ensure that all risk, reputation, and conduct-related matters are specifically considered when  determining remuneration outcomes. These processes may result in a downward adjustment to group and/or individual profit share  allocations where appropriate. A wide range of risks that could have a financial or non-financial impact on Macquarie are considered, including  any detriment to customers or impact on prudential standing.  To assist the Board and BRC when determining remuneration outcomes, independent control functions provide input as follows: Independent control function input when determining remuneration outcomes Risk Management Group Internal Audit Legal The CRO provides the BRC with an  independent report detailing significant  risk matters (financial and non-financial)  including those relating to incidents, issues,  and regulatory and litigation matters. The Head of Internal Audit provides the  BRC with an independent report detailing  notable internal audit issues and any trends  at company-wide or business group level. The GGC provides a further source of  independent input and, in conjunction  with HR, considers whether there are any  incidents (including any breach of the  BEAR or FAR obligations) that should be  reviewed that might lead to a malus or  clawback determination. Human Resources The Global Head of HR discusses the reports from RMG and Internal Audit with the Group Heads to ensure any matters listed in the  reports are appropriately reflected in remuneration outcomes for relevant staff and provides a report to the joint committee meeting of  the BRC, Board Risk Committee (BRiC), Board Audit Committee (BAC) and Board Governance and Compliance Committee (BGCC) on how  this has been achieved. The Global Head of HR also annually reports to the BRC on the outcomes from the consequence management process and confirms that  these matters have been considered in determining remuneration and promotion outcomes where appropriate. Consequence management process Incidents, breaches of policy and misconduct issues are regularly reported to senior management. There are a number of processes  in place to ensure consistency (across business groups and staff levels) in the application of consequences and the determination of  remuneration outcomes, including the review and challenge by senior management of consequence management outcomes at year end. Where an investigation has commenced into a risk or conduct-related matter, vesting, payment and/or release of profit share (including  available and/or retained amounts) to an employee may be deferred to allow for the investigation to be completed. Consequence management outcomes Macquarie’s Consequence Management Guideline applies wherever a breach of internal policy or regulatory requirement is identified,  including where there has been a breach of FAR (or prior to 15 March 2024, BEAR) accountability obligations. Consequences may include  further training, removal of delegated authorities or permissions, adjustments to performance-based remuneration, impact on promotion,  formal warnings or termination.  Where an employee has received a formal warning, their performance-based remuneration will likely be impacted and in some cases, reduced  to zero. Promotion decisions may also be impacted. Impacts may also be applied where a formal warning has not been issued. In each case,  judgement is exercised as to the appropriate consequence(s) based on all the relevant circumstances.  In FY2024, there were 131 (FY2023: 129) matters involving conduct or policy breaches that resulted in formal consequences. These included  84 (FY2023: 71) Code of Conduct or appropriate workplace behaviour related matters and 47 (FY2023: 58) other policy matters including risk  management and technology breaches. Of the 131:  •	 for 48 matters, termination of employment was the outcome (FY2023: 49) •	 for 83 matters, a formal warning was issued (FY2023: 80). Additional consequences were applied as appropriate including additional  training, adjustments to profit share and/or proposed fixed remuneration increases, and/or impact to promotion (22 individuals who  received a formal warning subsequently left Macquarie before year-end outcomes were applied and 60 individuals had their profit share  reduced by an average of 39%).  The 131 matters were considered isolated incidents and there was no evidence of broader systemic conduct issues.  ===== PAGE 123 ===== 123 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Governance About Directors’ Report Further details on the remuneration framework This section describes other key features of the remuneration framework and of the employment contracts for Executive  Committee members. Other features of the remuneration framework Role-based  allowances •	 Role-based allowances are a component of fixed remuneration that may be awarded to certain employees,  including those identified as Material Risk Takers under UK or European regulatory requirements. These  allowances are determined based on the role and organisational responsibility of the individuals. Minimum  shareholding  requirement •	 Executive Directors are required to hold a relevant interest in MGL ordinary shares that have a value equal to  5% of an Executive Director’s aggregate profit share allocations for each of the past five years (10 years for  Executive Committee members), which can be satisfied by the profit share retention requirements  •	 For Executive Committee members with a minimum of 10 years of service at the Executive Director level,  compliance with this policy equates to a minimum shareholding requirement of between 70% to 620% of fixed  remuneration based on share values unadjusted for market price changes. Promotion and  New Hire Awards •	 Staff who are promoted to or hired at Associate Director, Division Director or Executive Director level receive an  allocation of MEREP awards set with reference to an Australian dollar value. Currently these awards range from  the equivalent of $A25,000 to $A175,000 depending on the Director level. Performance fees  (carried interest) •	 Under Macquarie Asset Management’s carried interest arrangements, certain individuals with funds  responsibilities may receive a portion of their deferred performance-based remuneration as a share of  performance fees paid by Macquarie-managed funds •	 The company-wide profit share pool is adjusted downwards to reflect these deferred remuneration  arrangements, which are also taken into account in determining the individual’s profit share allocation •	 Consistent with market practice, these individuals are allocated an entitlement to a share of performance fees  paid by a particular fund. This allocation is based on performance (including consideration of non-financial  factors), seniority and the extent of the individual’s involvement with and expected contribution to the  particular fund •	 An individual will not receive their entitlement until Macquarie has received performance fees towards the end  of the fund’s life, which is typically upwards of 10 years. For arrangements implemented prior to September  2022, the entitlement will be forfeited if their employment ceases before five years from the date of allocation  For arrangements implemented from September 2022, vesting generally starts from 3 years from fund final  close. Entitlements are subject to similar forfeiture conditions as profit share •	 Prior to joining the Executive Committee, Mr Way (who joined the Executive Committee on 1 April 2021)  participated in these arrangements for certain funds in his former role. Upon joining the Executive Committee,  he maintained his participation in these existing funds, but he has not been allocated any additional  entitlements. No other Executive Committee members currently participate in these arrangements. Hedging •	 Macquarie prohibits staff from hedging shares held to meet the minimum shareholding requirement and  unvested equity held in the MEREP. Employment contracts The following table summarises key features of the employment contracts for Executive Committee members including the CEO. Length of contract Permanent open-ended. Remuneration  review period 1 April to 31 March annually. Profit share  participation Executive Committee members are eligible to be considered for a profit share allocation that ensures a large part  of their remuneration is ‘at risk’. Refer to pages 112-116 for details. PSU participation Executive Committee members are eligible to receive PSUs. Refer to pages 117-119 for details. Termination of  employment Requires no more than three months’ notice by Macquarie or the Executive Committee member (Post employment  restrictions apply). Post employment  restrictions Restrictions include non-solicitation provisions applicable for six months, and paid non-competition provisions  applicable, at Macquarie’s election, for up to three months post-termination.  ===== PAGE 124 ===== 124 Remuneration Report Continued Pay for performance (17)	 Headcount for both FY2024 and FY2023 includes staff employed in certain operationally segregated subsidiaries (OSS).

Macquarie’s results Compared to the exceptionally strong prior year, Macquarie’s NPAT and EPS both decreased by 32%, while ordinary dividends decreased  by 15%. Consistent with our established remuneration framework that rewards performance across a range of financial and non-financial  measures and aligns outcomes for staff with those of our shareholders, CEO awarded profit share decreased by 26% and total comparable  Executive KMP awarded profit share is down 15% on the prior year. The overall decline has not resulted in a corresponding decrease in  statutory remuneration, which is calculated on a different basis to awarded pay and includes the vesting of historical share-based awards  from prior years. The total compensation expense is in line with the prior year, impacted by the higher average number of staff during the year, wage inflation  and unfavourable foreign exchange movements. These factors, as well as lower overall revenue, led to the significant increase in the  compensation expense to income ratio (compensation ratio) to 43.1%.

Tenure of Executive KMP(27) One of the primary goals of our remuneration framework is to  attract, motivate and retain high-performing staff. The Board’s  view is that we continue to achieve this goal as demonstrated by  the following: •	 Macquarie’s Executive KMP had an average tenure of 23 years  with Macquarie as at 31 March 2024.(28) Their strong leadership  and deep expertise have been integral to driving company and  business performance in FY2024  •	 as at 31 March 2024, 49% of Director-level staff had more than  ten years’ experience with Macquarie, while a further 24% had  between five and ten years’ experience with Macquarie(29) •	 the 4% Director-level voluntary turnover rate in FY2024 is lower  than the prior year’s rate of 5% and well below the voluntary  turnover rate across Macquarie overall.(30) 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 B.

Wikramanayake Number of years at Macquarie  ===== PAGE 127 ===== 127 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Governance About Directors’ Report Executive KMP remuneration outcomes for FY2024 This section details the process for determining Executive KMP remuneration outcomes for FY2024 and demonstrates the link between  pay and performance. (31)	 For US-based Executive KMP, this is equivalent to $US750,000. Process to determine Executive KMP  remuneration outcomes  There is a consistent and comprehensive process for the Board and  the BRC to assess the performance of the CEO and each Executive  KMP during the year to enable them to determine remuneration  outcomes at the end of the year. The Board is always mindful of  the external focus on overall remuneration levels and has spent  considerable time determining remuneration outcomes. The BRC  recognises the range of expectations and has made decisions that  take into consideration the perspectives of all key stakeholders.  Significant judgement is applied to ensure that remuneration  outcomes are aligned both with individual and company-wide  performance and with outcomes delivered to our shareholders, our  clients and the communities in which we operate. As part of the Board’s annual review of the Macquarie CEO’s  performance, the CEO meets with the Board towards the end of the  financial year to consider formal documentation that outlines her  views of Macquarie’s and her own performance. The presentation  includes a broad range of Macquarie’s activities covering the  following main areas: •	 financial/business results •	 risk management and compliance •	 business leadership including customer and  community outcomes •	 people leadership and professional conduct consistent with the  Code of Conduct and the principles of What We Stand For. Over the course of the year the Board receives regular reports and  updates on many of these areas. These are summarised in the CEO’s  presentation, together with additional information on matters the  Board has identified for further discussion as a part of the review  process. The Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) of the Board then  consider the CEO’s performance and progress against all of these  topics in determining the CEO’s remuneration for the year. A similar  process is followed for the CEO of Macquarie Bank focused on  MBL-specific measures. The MGL CEO annually evaluates the performance of the other  Executive KMP and considers the same factors set out above.  The Board and the BRC review formal performance assessment  documentation for each Executive KMP.  For the CRO and CFO, the Board and the BRC seek to ensure  that their performance and remuneration outcomes reflect the  independence and purpose of their functions and have not been  unduly influenced by the performance of wider business activities. The BRC also considers risk-related matters raised in the  independent reports from the CRO and the Head of Internal Audit.  To ensure all matters are appropriately brought to the BRC’s  attention and to achieve an integrated approach to remuneration  that reflects prudent and appropriate risk management, there is a  joint meeting of the BRC, BRiC, BAC and the BGCC.  Finally, the BRC considers remuneration levels for organisations that  broadly operate in the same markets and compete for the same  people as Macquarie. Annual remuneration outcomes reflect: •	 achievements against a range of financial and  non-financial factors  •	 the recognition that our people are our greatest asset, and the  importance of retaining key people to encourage innovation and  pursue growth opportunities •	 alignment to the outcomes delivered to shareholders •	 risk management, compliance and conduct outcomes. Details on specific factors for FY2024 are discussed below. Executive KMP fixed remuneration outcomes In line with our pay for performance approach to remuneration,  fixed remuneration for our Executive KMP in FY2024 comprised  approximately 13% of total awarded remuneration, with the balance  at risk and explicitly linked to performance.  As noted in the 2023 Remuneration Report, fixed remuneration for  Executive KMP in FY2024 increased for the first time since 2010,  other than adjustments made when they were first appointed  to the Executive Committee. The fixed remuneration levels in  the table below include salary and, for Australia-based Executive  KMP, superannuation. Role FY2023 ($Am) FY2024 ($Am) CEO 0.8 1.5 MBL CEO 0.7 1.3 Executive KMP 0.7-0.75 1.1(31)  Fixed remuneration remains set at a comparatively low level,  relative to the industry, and at a lower proportion of total  remuneration, but sufficient to avoid inappropriate risk-taking.  No increases are planned for FY2025.  ===== PAGE 128 ===== 128 Remuneration Report Continued FY2024 Executive KMP profit share outcomes The Board’s determination of remuneration outcomes for FY2024  for the CEO and Executive KMP reflect the following factors: •	 lower overall financial results compared to the record FY2023,  reflective of the challenging market conditions during the year •	 the financial performance of each Operating Group, which  reflected a period of transition for some businesses amid less  supportive markets •	 the strong leadership of the Executive Committee, led by the  CEO, to effectively role model our purpose and principles and to  embed a strong risk culture  •	 Executive Committee collaboration to solve challenges  and maximise opportunities across Operating and Central  Service Groups •	 the continued evolution of our businesses to remain well  positioned to deliver long-term sustainable value, including  alignment with areas of structural growth globally (e.g. energy  transition, infrastructure for digital and demographic shifts) •	 the continued focus on non-financial risks, including in areas such  as climate, sustainability and technology, while also uplifting our  risk management frameworks across trading, technology, cyber  and data. While there were no systemic risk issues identified  during the year, a legacy risk matter in MAM was taken into  account in determining the MGL CEO’s remuneration •	 a focus on streamlining investment programs and driving  greater returns on investment, following a period of significant  investment in our platform •	 investment in renewable energy solutions at scale, supporting  the next wave of climate technologies  •	 maintaining strong engagement and focus on meeting regulator  expectations including progress against the remediation  program with APRA to ensure there is appropriate focus on MBL •	 the refresh of our global employee value proposition to  evolve in line with shifts in talent expectations and ensure we  accurately reflect the career experience and distinct culture that  Macquarie offers. Executive KMP remuneration outcomes have also been considered  in the context of the wider workforce. The BRC receives extensive  reporting on remuneration outcomes and individually reviews and  approves the remuneration of staff who hold regulated roles and  other senior staff and has reviewed overall total remuneration  levels across each business to ensure appropriate distribution of  remuneration across the organisation. The BRC has also considered  the compensation expense to income ratio as a guide as to  whether the share of profits distributed to staff and shareholders  is reasonable.  Through a challenging economic and market environment, we have  given careful consideration of all these factors and we believe the  following outcomes for the year are appropriate: •	 CEO awarded profit share has decreased 26% on the prior year to  $A23.75 million •	 total comparable Executive KMP awarded profit share of  $A80.20 million (down 15% on the prior year) •	 PSU allocations of $A4.0 million for the CEO and $A2.8 million for  other Executive KMP.  Link between ESG considerations and  remuneration outcomes The Board and management recognise the importance of  sound ESG practices as part of their responsibility to clients,  shareholders, employees and the communities in which  Macquarie operates. The Board’s and the BRC’s assessment  of each Executive KMP’s performance against the three  non-financial performance factors when determining  profit share outcomes includes progress on relevant  ESG initiatives. For ESG considerations relevant to specific Executive KMP,  see the commentary on pages 130-139. In addition to the process for Executive KMP, ESG  considerations are assessed as part of other employees’  individual performance and remuneration determinations  where relevant to the responsibilities of their role.  More detailed information on our ESG approach,  including our eight focus areas, is available on  pages 53-55 in the ESG section of this Annual  Report and at macquarie.com/esg.  ===== PAGE 129 ===== 129 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Governance About Directors’ Report To demonstrate the alignment between pay and performance, the following graphs show the multi-year alignment between CEO and total  Executive KMP awarded profit share and Macquarie NPAT over a ten-year period.

The key elements of Macquarie’s remuneration  governance framework are described below. BOARD Board Remuneration Committee Board Risk Committee, Board Audit Committee &  Board Governance and Compliance Committee Oversees remuneration policies and practices,   and makes recommendations to the Board Discusses any relevant matters that may impact remuneration in a  joint meeting with the Board Remuneration Committee Strong Board oversight The Board oversees Macquarie’s remuneration framework and  its effective application. The Board has a BRC whose objective is  to assist the Board with Macquarie’s remuneration policies and  practices. The BRC currently comprises three independent NEDs as  set out earlier in the Directors’ Report. The BRC members have the required experience and expertise in  human resources, remuneration and risk to enable them to achieve  effective governance of the remuneration framework. The BRC  has a regular meeting cycle and met seven times during FY2024.  Attendance at meetings by the BRC members is set out on page  95. Strict processes are in place to ensure conflicts of interest are  appropriately managed. The MBL BRC (established in 2022) works closely with the BRC to  assist the MBL Board with its oversight of remuneration policies and  practices applying to staff of Macquarie Bank. BRC responsibilities The BRC pays close attention to the design and operation of  remuneration practices for all Macquarie staff, not just for the most  senior executives. The responsibilities of the BRC are outlined in its  Charter, which is reviewed and approved annually by the Board.  The Charter is available at   macquarie.com/corporate-governance Some of the responsibilities include: •	 overseeing the process for the annual review by the Board of the  CEO’s, MBL CEO’s and other Executive KMPs’ performance  •	 recommending to the Board the remuneration outcomes for all  Executive KMP, other roles specified under CPS 511 and other  senior executives  •	 assessing the effectiveness of the Remuneration Policy to ensure  compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, as well as to  support the alignment of remuneration with prudent risk-taking  and professional conduct across the organisation •	 recommending the Remuneration Policy to the Board  for approval. Alignment to risk The BRC liaises with the BRiC, BAC and BGCC to ensure there  is effective co-ordination between the Committees to assist in  producing an integrated approach to remuneration that reflects  prudent and appropriate risk management.  As set out on page 122, the CRO and the Head of Internal Audit  provide the BRC with independent reports detailing significant risk  and internal audit matters (financial and non-financial) including  those relating to incidents, issues, and regulatory and litigation  matters. A joint meeting of the BRC, BRiC, BAC and BGCC is held to  discuss these matters, with the CRO and the Head of Internal Audit  in attendance. The GGC attends as required to provide a further  source of independent input, including on matters that might lead  to a malus or clawback determination.  Engagement with external stakeholders The Chair of the Board and the BRC Chair undertook a series of  meetings with investors and proxy advisors during the year to  communicate our remuneration approach and to hear any concerns  raised by the investor community.  They also engaged with APRA during the year regarding Macquarie’s  implementation of CPS 511.  ===== PAGE 142 ===== 142 Remuneration Report Continued Independent remuneration review The BRC has retained Pay Governance as its independent  remuneration consultant, for the use of the Board to obtain advice  on the appropriateness of Macquarie’s remuneration framework. The only service that Pay Governance provides to Macquarie is  executive compensation consulting to the BRC. Pay Governance has  not made any remuneration recommendations, as defined by the  Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act). The BRC is responsible for  making decisions within the terms of its Charter. Pay Governance’s  terms of engagement set out their independence from members of  Macquarie’s management. This year, Pay Governance: •	 provided information on global remuneration and  regulatory trends •	 considered alignment with shareholder interests •	 compared individual remuneration for Executive KMP where  relevant comparator company information was available •	 considered Macquarie’s overall remuneration approach  compared to comparator company organisations. Pay Governance’s findings included that: •	 the objectives of Macquarie’s remuneration framework are  similar to those cited by other leading global investment banks •	 Macquarie’s remuneration components support its remuneration  objectives and principles and are largely consistent with  practices at other leading global investment banks, including  that performance-based remuneration takes risk management  into account.  ===== PAGE 143 ===== 143 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Governance About Directors’ Report Non-Executive Director remuneration The Board seeks to appoint and appropriately remunerate high calibre NEDs. Reflecting the Board’s role, the remuneration arrangements  applicable to NEDs, as outlined in this section, differ significantly from the arrangements applicable to executives. (38)	 MGL has five standing Board Committees.  (39)	 Where applicable, annual director fees include all fees payable by MGL to a NED for acting as a director of MGL and MBL, including attending and participating in any board  committee meetings. (40)	 The Chair of the Board does not receive Board Committee membership fees. Non-Executive Director remuneration Non-Executive Director fees are set acknowledging the level  required to appropriately remunerate highly qualified NEDs who  have the relevant skills and experience to govern as a member of  the Board. The NED remuneration framework seeks to remunerate high calibre  directors by: •	 setting an overall fee that reflects the scale and complexity of  Macquarie including additional risk management and regulatory  responsibilities and the global financial nature of Macquarie’s  activities •	 setting Board and Board Committee fees to reflect the time  commitment to meet the responsibilities involved in the annual  scheduled calendar, taking into account market rates for relevant  organisations and market trends  •	 paying separate fees for additional responsibilities that may arise  on an ad hoc basis  •	 delivering these fees in a form that is not contingent on  Macquarie’s performance •	 setting a minimum shareholding requirement to align the  interests of NEDs with MGL shareholders.  The Board ensures that MGL NED remuneration does not exceed the  Macquarie shareholder approved maximum amount. Shareholders  approved the current limit ($A5.0 million per annum) at MGL’s 2019  AGM. Where MGL NEDs are also members of the MBL Board, their  fees include those payable for acting as a director of MBL.  Board and Board Committee fees are reviewed annually.(38) An  internal review of NED fees was completed during the year. The  Boards determined, following this review, that Board and Board  Committee fees would remain unchanged.  The CEO is not remunerated separately for acting as an Executive  Voting Director. Unlike Macquarie executives, NEDs are not granted equity, nor are  they eligible to receive profit share payments. There are no  termination payments to NEDs on their retirement from office  other than payments relating to their accrued superannuation  contributions comprising part of their remuneration, if any. NEDs may elect to receive their remuneration, in part, in the form of  superannuation contributions over and above the minimum level of  contribution required under applicable legislation. Minimum shareholding requirement for   Non-Executive Directors To align the interests of the Board with shareholders, the Board  has a minimum shareholding requirement for MGL NEDs to have a  meaningful direct shareholding in Macquarie.  The minimum shareholding requirement for: •	 NEDs other than the Chair: an investment equivalent to one  times the average annual aggregate NED fee for the financial  year ending prior to their appointment. Where a MGL NED is also  on the MBL Board, this calculation will reflect the aggregate fee  for acting as a MGL NED and MBL NED •	 the Chair: an investment equivalent to one times the annual  Chair fee. Where the Chair is also the MBL Chair, this calculation  will reflect the aggregate fee for the role of MGL Chair and  MBL Chair.  The above requirements are to be met within three years from  appointment with one third of the requirement to be held after one  year, two thirds after two years and in full after three years.

To secure Ms Bruce’s appointment, the Board determined it was  necessary and appropriate to provide competitive remuneration arrangements. This included awarding a minimum profit share allocation of $A2.619 million for the performance  year ending 31 March 2023 (subject to Macquarie’s standard remuneration arrangements) and a minimum PSU allocation of face value $A2.0 million for FY2023 (subject to the  performance hurdles and other conditions applicable to the PSU allocations awarded to other Executive Committee members).  (43)	 Mr Silverton is paid in US dollars. As a US tax resident, Mr Silverton’s remuneration is subject to US social security and Medicare taxes, payable by Macquarie. Amounts of  $A217,665 and $A189,509 were paid during FY2023 and FY2024, respectively, and are not included in Mr Silverton’s statutory remuneration. (44)	 Mr Way is paid in US dollars. As a US tax resident, Mr Way’s remuneration is subject to US social security and Medicare taxes, payable by Macquarie. An amount of $A18,843 and  $A132,130 was paid during FY2023 and FY2024, respectively, and are not included in Mr Way’s statutory remuneration. (45)	 Mr O’Kane ceased to be a member of the Executive Committee on 27 February 2024 and resigned from Macquarie effective 18 March 2024. In compliance with Macquarie’s  standard remuneration arrangements and as a result of his resignation, Mr O’Kane forfeited his unvested retained profit share and unvested PSUs. In accordance with  accounting requirements this resulted in a net reversal of previously recognised remuneration expense consisting of $A10.3 million for forfeited retention notionally invested in  Macquarie-managed fund equity and $A33.4 million of amortisation for forfeited equity awards during FY2024.

Under the requirements of AASB 124 Related Party Disclosures, the  remuneration disclosures for the years ended 31 March 2024 and  31 March 2023 only include remuneration relating to the portion of  the relevant periods that each person was an Executive KMP.  The following information provides more detail regarding some of  the column headings in this Appendix: 1.	 Short-term employee benefits: (a)	 Salary: includes salary, superannuation, any accrual for long  service leave and other benefits. (b)	 Performance-related remuneration: this represents the  cash portion of each person’s profit share allocation for the  reporting period as an Executive KMP. 2.	 Long-term employee benefits: (a)	 Restricted profit share: this represents the amount of  retained profit share awarded for the current period that is  deferred to future periods and held as a notional investment  in Macquarie-managed fund equity (DPS Plan). (b)	 Earnings on prior years’ restricted profit share: Profit  share amounts retained under the DPS Plan are notionally  invested in Macquarie-managed funds, providing Executive  Directors with an economic exposure to the underlying  investments. Executive Directors are each entitled to  amounts equivalent to the investment earnings (dividends/ distributions and security price appreciation) on the  underlying securities. The notional returns are calculated  based on Total Shareholder Return. Where these amounts  are positive, they may be paid to Executive Directors and  are included in these remuneration disclosures as part of  ‘Earnings on prior years’ restricted profit share’. If there is  a notional loss, this loss will be offset against any future  notional income until the loss is completely offset and is  reported as a negative amount in the same column. These  earnings reflect the investment performance of the assets  in which prior years’ retained amounts have been notionally  invested. Their inclusion in the individual remuneration  disclosures on the previous pages may, therefore,  cause distortions when year-on-year remuneration  trends are examined. They do not reflect remuneration  review decisions made about the individual’s current  year performance. 3.	 Share-based payments: (a)	 Equity awards including shares: This represents the current  year expense for retained profit share that is invested in  MGL ordinary shares under the MEREP as described on page  115. This is recognised as an expense over the respective  vesting periods, or service period if shorter, as described  on page 114 and includes amounts relating to prior years  equity awards that have been previously disclosed. Equity  awards in respect of FY2024 performance will be granted  during FY2025; however, Macquarie begins recognising an  expense for these awards (based on an initial estimate) from  1 April 2023. The expense is estimated using the price of  MGL ordinary shares as at 31 March 2024 and the number  of equity awards expected to vest. In the following financial  year, Macquarie will adjust the accumulated expense  recognised for the final determination of the accounting fair  value for each equity award when granted and will use this  validation for recognising the expense over the remaining  vesting period. (b)	 PSUs: This represents the current year expense for PSUs  that is recognised over the vesting period as described on  page 117. This includes amounts relating to prior years’ PSU  awards. PSU awards in respect of FY2024 will be granted  during FY2025; however, Macquarie begins recognising an  expense for these awards (based on an initial estimate) from  1 April 2023. The expense is estimated using the price of  MGL  ordinary shares as at 31 March 2024 and the number  of PSUs expected to vest. The estimate also incorporates  an interest rate to maturity of 3.97% per annum (3.99% for  grants to the CEO and the MBL CEO), expected vesting date  of 1 July 2028 (1 July 2029 for the CEO and the MBL CEO),  and a dividend yield of 3.76% per annum. In the following  financial year, Macquarie will adjust the accumulated  expense recognised for the final determination of the  accounting fair value for each PSU when granted and will  use this validation for recognising the expense over the  remaining vesting period. Performance hurdles attached to  the PSUs allow for PSUs to become exercisable upon vesting  only when the relevant performance hurdles are met. The  current year expense is reduced for previously recognised  remuneration expense where performance hurdles have  not been met, have been partially met or are not expected  to be met.  ===== PAGE 149 ===== 149 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Financial Report Governance About Directors’ Report Appendix 3: Non-Executive Director remuneration The remuneration arrangements for all the persons listed below as NEDs are described on page 143 of the Remuneration Report.

(63)	 For RSUs, this represents RSUs vesting during the current financial year in respect of grants made while a KMP. Grants made prior to individuals becoming a KMP are not disclosed. The following table sets out details of the RSU awards associated  with Macquarie equity granted to Executive KMP. Grants made to  Executive KMP prior to their joining the Executive Committee are  not disclosed. PSUs are disclosed in a separate table. A significant portion of an Executive KMP’s retained profit share  is invested in Macquarie equity, delivered as RSUs. RSUs are units  comprising a beneficial interest in MGL ordinary shares held in a  trust for the staff member. For further details, refer to Note 32  Employee equity participation to the financial statements in the  Financial Report. There have been no alterations to the terms or  conditions of the grants set out below since the grant date.  RSU awards are subject to forfeiture as set out on page 115.  The maximum potential value of unvested awards could vary  significantly and is dependent on the MGL ordinary share price at  the time of vesting. Retention rates, the vesting profiles and service  and performance criteria for the current year are set out on pages  114-115. RSUs are granted in the financial year following the year of  Macquarie’s performance to which the grant relates. For example,  RSUs granted to KMP in June 2023 relate to their performance in  FY2023. All awards that were eligible to vest, vested during the year.  No awards were forfeited during the year, other than 615,729 RSU  awards held by Mr O’Kane which were forfeited upon his resignation  from Macquarie.

PSUs awarded from FY2020 vest in four years as set out on page 117 while PSUs awarded prior to FY2020 vest  on a pro-rata basis as set out on page 140, footnote 36.

Further details  of amounts paid or payable to PwC and its related practices  are disclosed in Note 41 Audit and other services provided by  PricewaterhouseCoopers in the Financial Report. The Voting Directors are satisfied that the provision of non-audit  services did not compromise the auditor independence  requirements of the Act for the following reasons: •	 the operation of the Consolidated Entity’s Audit and Assurance  Independence Policy, restricts the external auditor from  providing non-audit services under which the auditor assumes  the role of management, becomes an advocate for the  Consolidated Entity, audits its own professional expertise, or  creates a mutual or conflicting interest between the auditor  and the Consolidated Entity. The policy also provides that  significant permissible non-audit assignments awarded to the  external auditor must be approved in advance by the Board Audit  Committee (BAC) or the BAC Chair, as appropriate •	 the BAC has reviewed a summary of non-audit services provided  by PwC, including details of the amounts paid or payable, and  has provided written advice to the Board of Directors. Consistent with the advice of the BAC, the Voting Directors are  satisfied that the provision of non-audit services during the year by  the auditor and its related practices is compatible with the general  standard of independence for auditors imposed by the Act. This report is made in accordance with a resolution of the Directors.

Macquarie Group  Limited is a for-profit company for the purposes of preparing this  Financial Report.  The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of this  Financial Report are set out in Note 44 Material accounting  policies. These policies have been consistently applied to all the  financial years presented and are applicable to both the  Consolidated Entity (Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries)  as well as the Company (Macquarie Group Limited), unless  otherwise stated. (i) Compliance with IFRS as issued by the IASB Compliance with Australian Accounting Standards ensures that  this Financial Report complies with International Financial  Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International  Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Consequently, this Financial  Report is compliant with IFRS. (ii) Basis of measurement This Financial Report has been prepared on a going concern basis  using the historical cost convention except for the following items,  as disclosed in the respective accounting policy: • financial instruments (including derivatives) required to be  measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL); financial  assets classified as fair value through other comprehensive  income (FVOCI) and financial instruments that have been  designated as FVTPL (DFVTPL) • financial assets and liabilities that are otherwise measured on  an amortised cost basis but adjusted for changes in fair value  attributable to the risk being hedged in qualifying fair value hedge relationships • non-current assets and disposal groups that have been  classified as held for sale and where a disposal group has been  impaired to its fair value less costs to sell • commodity inventories that are measured at fair value less  costs to sell in accordance with the broker-trader exemption • certain other non-financial assets and liabilities that are  measured at fair value, such as investment property. (iii) Critical accounting estimates and significant judgements The preparation of this Financial Report in compliance with  Australian Accounting Standards requires the use of certain critical  accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise  judgement in the process of applying the accounting policies. The  notes to the financial statements set out areas involving a higher  degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions  are significant to the consolidated Financial Report such as: • determining the appropriate business model for a group of  financial assets which includes determining the level at which  the business model condition is applied and whether past or  expected sales activity is consistent with a held to collect  business model (Note 44(vii)) • assessing whether the cash flows generated by a financial asset  constitute solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) may  require the application of judgement, particularly for certain  subordinated or non-recourse positions, and in the  determination of whether compensation for early termination  of a contract is reasonable (Note 44(vii)) • choice of inputs, estimates and assumptions used in the  measurement of Expected Credit Loss, including the  determination of significant increase in credit risk (SICR),  forecasts of economic conditions and the weightings assigned  thereto (Note 44(xxii) and Note 13) • timing and amount of impairment of interests in associates and  joint ventures and investment in subsidiaries, including the  reversal thereof (Note 44(i), Note 44(xxii), Note 14 and Note 17) • timing and amount of impairment of goodwill and other  identifiable intangible assets and, where applicable, the reversal  thereof (Note 44(xxii) and Note 16) • determining fair value of assets and liabilities where  market-observable inputs are not available including the  determination of non-recurring fair values and accounting for  day 1 profits or losses for financial instruments (Note 44(vii),  Note 44(x) and Note 38) • distinguishing between whether assets or a business is acquired  under a business combination, particularly the determination of  whether a substantive process exists that, together with an  integrated set of activities and assets, significantly contributes  to the ability to create an output (Note 44(ii)) • determination of significant influence over associates, joint  control over arrangements and control over subsidiaries,  including the assessment of whether certain rights are  protective or substantive in nature, whether these rights are  held in the capacity as agent or principal, and whether the level  of involvement in an investee’s relevant activities is sufficient  to significantly affect the returns generated (Note 44(i)) • recoverability of tax receivables, deferred tax assets and  measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities can require  significant judgement, particularly where the recoverability of  such tax balances relies on the estimation of future taxable  profits and management’s determination of the likelihood that  uncertain tax positions will be accepted by the relevant  taxation authority (Note 44(vi), Note 4 and Note 18) • recognition and measurement of certain revenue streams  including performance fees from Macquarie-managed funds  and other capital market investments and transactions  (Note 44(iv)) • recognition and measurement of provisions related to actual  and potential claims, and the determination of contingent  liabilities (Note 44(iv), Note 44(xvii) and Note 33) • application of hedge accounting principles, including the  assessment that a forecast transaction is highly probable  (Note 44(x) and Note 35) • determination of the loss of control of a subsidiary, joint  control over a joint arrangement or loss of significant influence  over an associate including the timing of derecognition of  assets and liabilities following the disposal of an investment  and, the measurement of the associated gain or loss  (Note 44(i)).  ===== PAGE 168 ===== 168 Notes to the financial statements  For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Note 1 Basis of preparation continued (iii) Critical accounting estimates and significant  judgements continued Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based  on historical experience and other factors, including reasonable  expectations of future events. Management believes that the estimates used in preparing this  Financial Report are reasonable. Notwithstanding, it is possible  that outcomes within the next financial year differ from  management’s assumptions and estimates, which may result in an  adjustment to the carrying amounts of the reported assets and  liabilities in future reporting periods. (iv) New Australian Accounting Standards and amendments to  Australian Accounting Standards and interpretations that are  effective in the current financial year (a) AASB 17 Insurance Contracts (AASB 17) AASB 17 amends the accounting for insurance contracts and  replaces AASB 4 Insurance Contracts, AASB 1023 General  Insurance Contracts and AASB 1038 Life Insurance Contracts.  The adoption of AASB 17, mandatorily effective for the current  annual reporting period did not have a material impact on this  Financial Report. (b) AASB 2023-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting  Standards - International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules  (AASB 2023-2) The Pillar Two Model Rules are part of the Organisation for  Economic Co-operation and Development’s inclusive framework  designed to address the tax challenges arising from the  digitalisation of the economy. The Pillar Two Model Rules: • aim to ensure that large multinational groups pay a minimum  amount of tax on income arising in each jurisdiction in which  they operate; and • would achieve that aim by applying a system of top-up taxes  that results in the total amount of taxes payable on Global  Anti-Base Erosion Rules (GloBE) income in each jurisdiction  representing at least the minimum rate of 15%. The Consolidated Entity’s Pillar Two Project During 2022, the Consolidated Entity initiated a project to manage  the impact of the Pillar Two rules globally. The project’s scope is to  ensure the Consolidated Entity and its subsidiaries can meet their  Pillar Two compliance obligations.  As part of the project, the Consolidated Entity is monitoring the  progress of the implementation of the model rules into domestic  legislation and certain jurisdictions in which the Consolidated  Entity has operations and have started to enact the rules generally  with operational effect from the Consolidated Entity's 31 March  2025 financial year.  Impacts on financial reporting In June 2023, the AASB issued AASB 2023-2 which makes  amendments to AASB 112 Income Taxes with immediate effect.  The standard provides a mandatory temporary exception to  accounting for deferred taxes arising from the implementation of  the Pillar Two Model Rules published by the Organisation for  Economic Co-operation and Development. The Consolidated Entity  has applied this exception in preparing its annual Financial Report. The Consolidated Entity will ultimately be subject to Pillar Two  legislation in various jurisdictions. Applicable Pillar Two legislation  was not effective at the reporting date and as a result the  Consolidated Entity has no related current tax exposure as at  31 March 2024. Due to the complexities in applying the legislation and calculating  GloBE income and covered taxes, the quantitative impact of the  enacted or substantively enacted legislation has to date been  estimated using historical data over a number of years. Based on  this assessment it is not anticipated that there will be a material  impact to current tax expense of the Consolidated Entity or the  Company on implementation of the changes. The impact of the  Pillar Two income taxes legislation on future financial performance  will continue to be assessed. (c) Other amendments made to existing standards The amendments made to other existing standards that were  mandatorily effective for the annual reporting period beginning on  1 April 2023 did not result in a material impact on this Financial  Report.  (v) New Australian Accounting Standards and amendments to  Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that are  not yet effective for the financial year (i) IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements In April 2024, the International Accounting Standards Board issued  IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements  (IFRS 18) which sets out requirements for the presentation and  disclosure of information in general purpose financial statements.  IFRS 18 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or  after 1 January 2027. The transition provisions of IFRS 18 require  retrospective application. The AASB is expected to issue the  Australian equivalent of the standard in June 2024. The  Consolidated Entity is continuing to assess the full impact of  adopting IFRS 18. (ii) Other amendments made to existing standards Other amendments to existing standards that are not mandatorily  effective for the annual reporting period beginning on 1 April 2023  and have not been early adopted, are not likely to result in a  material impact to the Consolidated Entity’s financial statements.  ===== PAGE 169 ===== 169 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Directors’ Report Governance About Financial Report Note 1 Basis of preparation continued (vi) Other developments (a) ISSB sustainability reporting standards During the year, the International Sustainability Standards Board  (ISSB) published the following sustainability reporting standards: • IFRS S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability- related Financial Information (IFRS S1), which sets out the  overall requirements for sustainability-related financial  disclosures, and • IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures (IFRS S2), which will  require the disclosure of information that enables the users of  financial statements to understand the reporting entity's  governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and  targets in relation to climate-related risks and opportunities.  In Australia, the proposed sustainability standards have been  issued for exposure and comment while proposed legislation has  been tabled in Parliament under the Treasury Laws Amendment  (Financial Market Infrastructure and Other Measures) Bill 2024  (Cth). In the present form, these requirements would have the  Consolidated Entity commence reporting for its financial year  commencing on 1 April 2025. The Consolidated Entity  acknowledges the growing importance of sustainability-related  disclosures and continues to progress its established project to  assess and prepare for future sustainability and climate-related  reporting obligations. (b) IBOR reform: Transition from interbank offered rates (IBOR) to  alternative reference rates (ARRs) IBOR interest rate benchmarks that are used in a wide variety  of financial instruments (such as derivatives and lending  arrangements) have undergone, or are undergoing, reform. The  nature of such reforms varies by benchmark and jurisdiction. IBOR including the GBP, JPY, EUR, CHF and USD London Interbank  Offered Rate (‘LIBOR’), as well as IBOR for certain other minor  currencies, have ceased publication. The Consolidated Entity’s  IBOR reform project oversaw the transition of such exposures and  the Consolidated Entity ceased the use of LIBOR in new products in  accordance with industry and regulatory guidance. The Consolidated Entity continues to have certain exposures  referencing IBOR undergoing reform (including the Canadian Dollar  Offer Rate (CDOR) and Mexican Interbank Equilibrium Interest Rate  (TIIE)). Information regarding these exposures is disclosed in  Note 36.3 Market Risk.   ===== PAGE 170 ===== 170 Notes to the financial statements  For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Note 2 Operating profit before income tax CONSOLIDATED COMPANY 2024 2023 2024 2023 $m $m $m $m Net interest income Interest and similar income:1 Effective interest rate method - Amortised cost   12,961   8,349   1,598   1,217  Effective interest rate method - FVOCI   2,790   1,402   52   –  Other - FVTPL   741   388   267   186  Interest and similar expense: Effective interest rate method - Amortised cost   (12,988)   (7,075)   (1,880)   (1,366)  Other - FVTPL   (45)   (36)   (3)   –  Net interest income   3,459   3,028   34   37  Fee and commission income Base, portfolio administration and other asset management fees: Base fees   2,895   2,804   –   –  Portfolio administration fees   298   271   –   –  Other asset management fees   200   198   –   –  Mergers and acquisitions, advisory and underwriting fees   743   991   –   –  Brokerage and other trading-related fees   791   715   –   –  Performance fees   632   692   –   –  Other fee and commission income   690   729   7   13  Total fee and commission income   6,249   6,400   7   13  Net trading income2 Commodities3   4,099   6,443   –   –  Credit, interest rate and foreign exchange products   712   666   (305)   (227)  Equities   637   464   –   4  Net trading income/(loss)   5,448   7,573   (305)   (223)  Share of net losses from associates and joint ventures   (49)   (113)   –   –  1 Prior year comparatives for interest income have been re-presented between Effective Interest rate and Other to conform with the presentation in the current year in alignment with  the accounting policy. 2 Includes gains/losses for Trading Assets, Derivatives and Other Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities held at fair value including any ineffectiveness recorded on hedging  transactions.  3 Includes $859 million (2023: $684 million) of transportation, storage and certain other trading-related costs and $25 million (2023: $20 million) depreciation on right-of-use (ROU)  assets held for trading-related business.  ===== PAGE 171 ===== 171 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Directors’ Report Governance About Financial Report Note 2 Operating profit before income tax continued CONSOLIDATED COMPANY 2024 2023 2024 2023 $m $m $m $m Credit and other impairment reversals/(charges) Credit impairment (charges)/reversals Loan assets   107   (343)   –   –  Off balance sheet exposures   11   (72)   –   (4)  Financial investments and other assets4   (27)   (25)   4   (11)  Margin money and settlement assets   16   42   –   –  Loans to associates and joint ventures   27   5   –   –  Gross credit impairment reversals/(charges)   134   (393)   4   (15)  Recovery of amounts previously written off   –   5   –   –  Net credit impairment reversals/(charges)   134   (388)   4   (15)  Other impairment reversals/(charges) Interests in associates and joint ventures   263   (47)   –   –  Intangible and other non-financial assets   (28)   (19)   –   –  Net other impairment reversals/(charges)   235   (66)   –   –  Net other operating income Investment income Net gain/(loss) from: Interests in associates and joint ventures   284   1,806   –   –  Interests in businesses and subsidiaries5   303   407   –   –  Non-financial assets   18   8   –   –  Financial investments   505   (53)   –   –  Dividends from subsidiaries (Note 30)   –   –   2,079   2,749  Net investment income   1,110   2,168   2,079   2,749  Operating lease income Rental income   1,023   860   –   –  Depreciation   (470)   (395)   –   –  Net operating lease income   553   465   –   –  Subsidiaries and businesses held for investment purposes:6 Net operating revenue7   749   421   –   –  Expenses8   (1,131)   (608)   –   –  Net loss from subsidiaries and businesses held for investment purposes   (382)   (187)   –   –  Other income   130   242   10   –  Total net other operating income   1,411   2,688   2,089   2,749  Net operating income   16,887   19,122   1,829   2,561  4 Balance under Company represents ECL reversals/(charges) on amounts Due from subsidiaries. 5 Includes any gain/(loss) recognised on deconsolidation of subsidiaries due to a loss of control.

The financial information is reported on the  same basis as used internally by Senior Management for evaluating  Operating Segment performance and for deciding how to allocate  resources to Operating Segments. Such information may be  produced using different measures to that used in preparing the  statutory income statement. For internal reporting, performance measurement and risk  management purposes, the Consolidated Entity is divided  into Operating Groups and a Corporate segment  (reportable segments).  The financial information disclosed relates to the Consolidated  Entity’s ordinary activities. These segments have been set up based on the different core  products and services offered. The Operating Groups comprise: • MAM which provides investment solutions to clients across a  range of capabilities including real assets, real estate, credit,   equities & multi-asset and secondaries • BFS which provides a diverse range of personal banking, wealth  management and business banking products and services to  retail clients, advisers, brokers and business clients • CGM which is a global business offering capital and financing,  risk management, market access, physical execution and  logistics solutions to its diverse client base across  Commodities, Financial Markets and Asset Finance • Macquarie Capital which has global capability in advisory and  capital raising services, providing clients with specialist  expertise and flexible capital solutions across a range of  sectors. It also has global capability in specialist investing  across private credit, private equity, real estate, growth equity,  venture capital, and in infrastructure and energy projects and  companies. Macquarie Capital’s Equities brokerage business  provides clients with access to equity research, sales, execution  capabilities and corporate access. The Corporate segment, which is not considered an Operating  Group, comprises head office and Central Service Groups, and  holds certain legacy and strategic investments, assets and  businesses that are not allocated to any of the Operating Groups. Items of income and expense within the Corporate segment  include the net result of managing Macquarie’s liquidity and  funding requirements, earnings on capital and the residual  accounting volatility relating to economically hedged positions  where hedge accounting is applied, as well as accounting volatility  for other economically hedged positions where hedge accounting  is not applicable.  Other items of income and expense within the Corporate segment  include earnings from investments, changes in central overlays to  credit and other impairments or valuation of assets, provisions for  legacy matters, unallocated head office costs and costs of Central  Service Groups. The Corporate segment also includes  performance-related profit share and share-based payments  expense and income tax expense. Below is a selection of key policies applied in determining the  Operating Segment results. Internal funding arrangements Group Treasury has the responsibility for managing wholesale  funding for the Consolidated Entity, and Operating Groups obtain  their required funding from Group Treasury. The Operating Groups  are assumed to be fully debt funded for the purposes of internal  funding charges. The interest rates charged by Group Treasury are  determined by the currency and term of the funding.  Generally, with the exception of deposit funding, Operating Groups  may only source funding directly from external sources where the  funding is secured by the Operating Group’s assets. In such cases,  Operating Groups bear the funding costs directly and Group  Treasury may levy additional charges, where appropriate. Transactions between Operating Segments Operating Segments that enter into arrangements with other  Operating Segments must do so on commercial terms or as agreed  by the Consolidated Entity’s Chief Executive Officer or Chief  Financial Officer.  Internal transactions are recognised in each of the relevant  categories of income and expense and eliminated on consolidation  as appropriate.  ===== PAGE 174 ===== 174 Notes to the financial statements  For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Note 3 Segment reporting continued (i) Operating segments continued Accounting for derivatives that economically hedge interest rate  risk With respect to businesses that predominantly earn income from  lending activities, derivatives that hedge interest rate risk are  measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Changes in  the fair value are presented in net trading income and give rise to  income statement volatility unless designated in hedge accounting  relationships. If designated in fair value hedge accounting  relationships, the carrying value of the hedged items are adjusted  for changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risks to reduce  volatility in the income statement. If designated in cash flow  hedge accounting relationships, the effective portion of the  derivatives' fair value gains or losses are deferred in the cash flow  hedge reserve as part of Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), and  subsequently recognised in the income statement at the time at  which the hedged items affect the income statement for the  hedged risks. For segment reporting, derivatives are accounted for  on an accrual basis in the results of the Operating Groups to the  extent that the Corporate segment manages the derivative  volatility, either through the application of hedge accounting or  where the derivative volatility may offset the volatility of other  positions managed within the Corporate segment. Central Service Groups The Central Service Groups provide a range of functions  supporting MGL’s Operating Groups, ensuring they have the  appropriate workplace support and systems to operate effectively  and the necessary resources to meet their regulatory, compliance,  financial, legal and risk management requirements. Central Service Groups recover their costs from Operating Groups  generally on either a time and effort allocation basis or a fee for  service basis. Central Service Groups include the Corporate  Operations Group (COG), Financial Management Group (FMG), Risk  Management Group (RMG), Legal and Governance Group (LGG) and  Central Executive. Performance-related profit share and share-based payments  expense Performance-related profit share and share-based payments  expense relating to the Macquarie Group Employee Retained  Equity Plan (MEREP) are recognised in the Corporate segment and  are not allocated to Operating Groups. Income tax The income tax expense and benefit is recognised in the Corporate  segment and are not allocated to the Operating Groups. However,  to recognise an Operating Group’s contribution to permanent  income tax differences, the internal management revenue/charge  category is used.  This internal management revenue/charge category, which is  primarily used for permanent income tax differences generated by  the Operating Groups, is offset by an equal and opposite amount  recognised in the Corporate segment such that they are  eliminated on consolidation. Presentation of segment income statements The income statements on the following pages for each of the  reported segments are in some cases summarised by grouping  non-material balances together. Where appropriate, all material or  key balances have been reported separately to provide users with  information relevant to the understanding of the Consolidated  Entity’s financial performance. The financial information disclosed  relates to the Consolidated Entity’s ordinary activities. Reportable segment assets Segment assets are the external operating assets that are  employed by a segment in its operating activities.  ===== PAGE 175 ===== 175 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Directors’ Report Governance About Financial Report This page has been intentionally left blank.  ===== PAGE 176 ===== 176 Notes to the financial statements  For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Note 3 Segment reporting continued (i) Operating segments continued The following is an analysis of the Consolidated Entity’s revenue and results by reportable segment.

The Company’s Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) remains active. The DRP is optional and offers ordinary shareholders in Australia and  New Zealand the opportunity to acquire fully paid ordinary shares without transaction costs. A shareholder can elect to participate in or  terminate their involvement in the DRP at any time. Ordinary shares purchased on the market or issued by the Consolidated Entity under  the DRP in the current and prior year were allocated as fully paid ordinary shares pursuant to the DRP, details of which are included in  Note 27 Contributed equity. (ii) Dividends not recognised at the end of the financial year Since the end of the financial year, the Directors have resolved to pay a final dividend of $3.85 per fully paid ordinary share, 40% franked based  on tax paid at 30%. The aggregate amount of the proposed dividend expected to be paid on 2 July 2024 from retained profits, but not  recognised as a liability at the end of the financial year is $1,471 million.

Model inputs The Consolidated Entity segments its credit portfolio between  retail and wholesale exposures, and further splits these portfolios  into representative groupings which are typically based on shared  risk characteristics. The Consolidated Entity has developed several models to predict  the ECL. These models incorporate a range of components  notably that of Exposure at Default (EAD), Probability of Default  (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD) (‘credit inputs’) as well as  Forward-Looking Information (FLI). For retail portfolios, behavioural variables are also considered in  the determination of inputs for ECL modelling. The key model inputs used in measuring the ECL include: • Exposure at Default (EAD): The EAD represents the estimated  exposure in the event of a default • Probability of Default (PD): The calculation of PDs for retail  and wholesale exposures is generally performed at a facility  level. Retail exposures are segmented based on product type  and shared characteristics that are highly correlated to  credit risk such as region, product, counterparty groupings,  loan-to-value ratio and other similar criteria. Wholesale  portfolio PDs are a function of industry type, internal credit  ratings and transition matrices used to determine a point in  time PD estimate. PD estimates for both retail and wholesale  portfolios are also adjusted for FLI • Loss Given Default (LGD): The LGD associated with the PD  used is the magnitude of the ECL in a default event. The LGD is  estimated using historical loss rates considering relevant  factors for individual exposures or portfolios. Significant increase in credit risk (SICR) The Consolidated Entity periodically assesses exposures to  determine whether there has been a SICR, which may be evidenced  by either qualitative or quantitative factors. Qualitative factors  include, but are not limited to material change in internal credit  rating or whether an exposure has been identified and placed on  CreditWatch, an internal credit monitoring mechanism supervised  by Senior Management to closely monitor exposures showing signs  of stress. All exposures on CreditWatch are classified as Stage II or,  if defaulted, as Stage III. SICR thresholds, which require judgement, are used to determine  whether an exposure’s credit risk has increased significantly. The  SICR methodology is based on a relative credit risk approach which  considers changes in an underlying exposure’s credit risk since  origination. This may result in exposures being classified in Stage II  that are of a higher credit quality than other similar exposures that  are classified as Stage I. Accordingly, while similar increases in the  quantum of Stage II exposures will suggest a relative deterioration  of credit quality, it should not necessarily be inferred that the  assets are of a lower credit quality.  Retail exposures Exposures are assigned a behavioural score which considers the  exposures’ lifetime PD on initial recognition. This behavioural score  is periodically assessed and updated to reflect changes in the  underlying exposures’ credit behaviour. SICR movement thresholds  between origination and reporting date of behavioural score  movements have been established that, where exceeded, result in  the exposure being categorised as Stage II. Wholesale exposures The Consolidated Entity assigns an internal credit rating to each  exposure at origination based on information available at that  date. These internal ratings are broadly aligned to external credit  rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. Where an exposures’ assigned credit rating deteriorates beyond  pre-defined thresholds per credit rating at origination, the  exposure is categorised as Stage II. The methodology has been  calibrated so that a larger change in rating is required for higher  quality credit rated exposures than for lower quality credit rated  exposures to be classified as Stage II. For both retail and wholesale portfolios: • the AASB 9 ‘low credit risk’ exemption is not applied by the  Consolidated Entity to material portfolios • for material retail portfolios, the credit risk for an exposure or  portfolio is generally deemed to have increased significantly if  the exposure is more than 30 days past due, unless there are  product specific characteristics that indicate that this  threshold should be rebutted. Definition of default The Consolidated Entity’s definition of default determines the  reference point for the calculation of the ECL components, and in  particular the PD. Default is generally defined as the point when  the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full, without  recourse by the Consolidated Entity to actions such as realisation  of available security; or the borrower is 90 days or more past due  on an obligation to the Consolidated Entity.  ===== PAGE 187 ===== 187 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Directors’ Report Governance About Financial Report Note 13 Expected credit losses continued The Consolidated Entity periodically monitors its exposures for  potential indicators of default such as significant financial  difficulty of the borrower including breaches of lending covenants;  it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other  financial reorganisation; the disappearance of an active market for  that financial asset because of financial difficulties; or the  purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that  reflects the incurred credit losses. Forward-looking information (FLI) The inclusion of FLI in calculating ECL allowances adjusts the PD,  the determination of SICR in retail portfolios as well as the LGD  (that is relevant to the determination of the recovery rates on  collateral). The predicted relationships between these key  indicators and the key model components (EAD, PD and LGD) in  measuring the ECL have been developed by analysing historical  data as part of the development of internal models, and the  calibration and validation process. The Consolidated Entity applies its professional judgement in  determining whether there are any inherent risks in the models’  predictive outcomes. The overlays primarily reflect management’s  assessment of the current economic and credit environment  relative to the FLI credit cycle model. These overlays account for  the risk that underlying credit risk events have occurred, but  observable modelled inputs are yet to reflect those events, as well  as risks that are specific to regions, counterparties or industries  which are difficult to account for within the modelled outcomes.  Over time the credit models are recalibrated to enhance the  predictive capability. At the reporting date this overlay was  approximately $175 million (2023: $475 million). These  judgements are reviewed by FMG and RMG at each reporting date. RMG is responsible for the FLI including the development of  scenarios and recommending the range of probability weights to  apply to those scenarios. For this purpose, four possible economic  scenarios have been developed for this period, being an upside,  downside, severe downside and baseline scenario. In calculating  the ECL, each of the scenarios is probability weighted and then  applied to the exposures’ PDs and LGDs. The scenarios have been developed using a combination of publicly  available data, internal forecasts and third-party information to  form the initial baseline. Internal specialists within the  Consolidated Entity are consulted to assist in refining and  challenging the baseline and the alternative scenarios. For the  current reporting period, the Consolidated Entity has generated  three alternative scenarios in addition to the baseline scenario,  where the alternative scenarios are anchored to the baseline on a  relative basis. Refinement of the scenarios includes benchmarking to external  data from reputable sources. These sources include, forecasts  published from a range of market economists and official data  sources, including major central banks, where available. Where there are limited official data sources against which to  benchmark key economic indicators on a forward-looking basis,  management exercises judgement when determining the duration,  severity and impact of the macroeconomic scenarios used by the  Consolidated Entity. Assigning probabilities to these scenarios requires professional  judgement. This judgement draws on internal risk and economics  specialist input, comparison to general market outlooks and  publicly available market commentary. The scenarios and the associated probabilities are ultimately  approved by senior risk and finance executives. The scenarios for each of the key regions where the Consolidated  Entity’s ECL is derived have been set out on the following pages.  Noting the diversity of possible scenarios and macroeconomic  outcomes, and the continuing uncertainty regarding the  implications of geopolitical events, broader inflationary pressures  and the path of monetary policy, these scenarios represent  plausible forward-looking views as at the reporting date. These scenarios impact the modelled ECL provisioning levels  through determination of probabilities of default and  determination of losses that may be incurred should a default  occur. The ability of borrowers to service their obligations through  personal or business income is generally estimated using  unemployment rates, GDP, commodity prices and interest rates.  The losses that the Consolidated Entity may incur should a default  occur, and the collateral utilised is generally estimated through  property price and share price index outlooks. Future economic conditions may differ to the scenarios outlined,  the impact of which will be accounted for in future reporting  periods.  ===== PAGE 188 ===== 188 Notes to the financial statements  For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Note 13 Expected credit losses continued Forward-looking information (FLI) continued Scenario Weighting Expectation Baseline A 100% weighting to this scenario  would result in a total expected credit  loss provision on balance sheet at the  reporting date of ~$1,600 million1 Probable Global: The baseline scenario forecasts a 2.6% year-on-year expansion in global GDP in 2024 as  global recession fears recede. Interest rates cuts are expected in the second half of 2024,  supporting an acceleration in real GDP growth to 3.1% year-on-year in 2025. Australia: GDP growth is anticipated to slow to 1.3% year-on-year in 2024 before picking up to  2.4% in 2025. Unemployment rates are forecast to increase moderately, peaking at 4.4% in the  first quarter of 2025. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is expected to start lowering the  cash rate in the second half of 2024, cutting by 125 basis points from current levels by  end-2025. House prices are projected to continue their upward trend, rising by 9% by end of  2025, supported by a policy of monetary loosening. United States: Real GDP growth is projected to moderate to 2.1% by December 2024 and  remain stable at 2.2% through to December 2025. The unemployment rate is expected to  remain at 3.8% in 2025. The first policy rate cut from the Federal Reserve is expected in the  second half of 2024. Europe: The scenario projects a modest growth of 0.9% until late 2024, followed by a 1.8%  year-on-year expansion in 2025. Unemployment is forecast to increase throughout 2024 and  peak at 7.0% through the first half of 2025. Downside A 100% weighting to this scenario  would result in a total expected credit  loss provision on balance sheet at the  reporting date of ~$1,950 million1 Possible Global: The downside scenario projects annual GDP growth that is approximately 1 percentage  point lower than the baseline until mid 2025. Australia: The scenario forecasts GDP to grow by 0.4% by the first quarter of 2025 and rise to  2.8% by mid-2026. Unemployment will trend upwards peaking at 5.6% in first quarter of 2025.  The RBA cash rate is forecast to rise by a further 25 basis points in the first half of 2024,  followed by 250 basis points of cuts by mid-2026. House prices are projected to fall 15% by  mid-2026. United States: The scenario projects GDP growth of 0.4% by the end of 2024 followed by a  modest 1.1% growth in mid-2026. High inflation is expected to force the US Federal Reserve to  increase interest rates by 50 basis points in 2024, before a cut in Q2 2025 as the economy  slows. The unemployment rate is projected to peak at 5.2% in mid 2025. Europe: The scenario projects sequential real GDP contraction through to the first quarter of  2025, declining to 0.5% followed by growth of 1.8% in mid 2026. Unemployment rates are  projected to peak at 8.7% in mid-2025. 1 This number provides ECL provision information as at the reporting date assuming the scenarios outlined, but does not reflect changes in the credit rating of the counterparties that  may occur if these scenarios were to occur. Changes in credit ratings may have a material impact on these ECL provisions.  ===== PAGE 189 ===== 189 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Directors’ Report Governance About Financial Report Note 13 Expected credit losses continued Forward-looking information (FLI) continued Scenario Weighting Expectation Severe Downside A 100% weighting to this scenario  would result in a total expected credit  loss provision on balance sheet at the  reporting date of ~$2,450 million2 Unlikely Global: The scenario projects a sharp slowdown in annual GDP growth, around 3 to 3.5  percentage points lower than the baseline. Australia: The scenario projects four consecutive quarters of contraction in real GDP, followed  by 1.8% growth in mid 2026. Unemployment rises sharply, peaking at 6.9% in mid-2025 and  remaining elevated throughout the forecast period. The RBA cash rate is cut sharply, though  house prices still fall 19% in the two years to mid-2026. United States: The scenario projects three consecutive quarters of contraction in real GDP  followed by 0.8% growth in mid-2026. High inflation drives 100 basis points in rate increases in  2024, followed by significant cuts in 2025 as the US Federal Reserve attempts to stimulate the  economy. Unemployment rises sharply to 7.2% in mid-2025 and falls slowly thereafter. Europe: The scenario projects GDP to decline by 2.3% in 2024, with quarterly growth not  returning until mid-2026. Unemployment peaks at 9.9% in the second quarter of 2025.  Upside  A 100% weighting to this scenario  would result in a total expected credit  loss provision on balance sheet at the  reporting date of ~$1,425 million2 Possible Global: The upside scenario projects annual GDP growth that is approximately 1 percentage  point higher than the baseline in 2024 and into 2025. Australia: The scenario forecasts GDP to grow by 1.7% year-on-year in 2024 and 3.2% in  mid-2025. Interest rate cuts start in the second quarter of 2024. Unemployment rises only  modestly and peaks at 4.3% in late 2024. House prices rise 14% to the end of 2025. United States: The scenario projects real GDP growth of 3.7% year-on-year in 2024 and 3.6% in  mid-2025. The US Federal Reserve is able to cut interest rates by 50 basis points in 2024,  holding the target rate at 4.75-5.00% until 2026. Unemployment drops to 3.2% in the first  quarter of 2025. Europe: The scenario projects a return to growth in the third quarter of 2024. Annual growth in  2024 remains flat before recovering to 1.9% in mid-2025. Unemployment increases slowly,  peaking at around 7.2% by mid-2026. 2 This number provides ECL provision information as at the reporting date assuming the scenarios outlined, but does not reflect changes in the credit rating of the counterparties that  may occur if these scenarios were to occur. Changes in credit ratings may have a material impact on these ECL provisions.  ===== PAGE 190 ===== 190 Notes to the financial statements  For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Note 13 Expected credit losses continued The table below presents the gross exposure and related ECL allowance for assets measured at amortised cost or FVOCI and off balance sheet  exposures subject to the impairment requirements of AASB 9 Financial Instruments.

In accordance with the Consolidated Entity’s accounting policies, assets with an indefinite useful life are tested on an annual basis for  impairment, and additionally, along with assets with a finite useful life, whenever an indication of impairment exists. An impairment loss is  recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset or cash generating unit (CGU) exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the  higher of its fair value less costs of disposal or its value-in-use. Where required, the recoverable amount is determined either with reference to  external valuations or estimated using discounted cash flow techniques. In this case, estimates specific to the asset or CGU are required to be  determined, including forecast cash flows, long-term growth rates and discount rates (ranged from 10.5%–13.0%). There was no material  impairment or reversal of existing impairment recognised during the year. The movement in the carrying value of the Consolidated Entity’s intangible assets is as follows.

Where its investments had indicators of impairment, the  investment's carrying value was compared to its recoverable value which was determined as the higher of value-in-use and fair value less cost to sell (valuation). The valuations, which  are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy (as defined in Note 38 Fair value of assets and liabilities), have been calculated using a valuation technique with significant  unobservable inputs including the subsidiary's maintainable earnings, growth rates and relevant earnings multiples. A range of valuations of the investments in the subsidiaries, under  different scenarios, was used that demonstrated that the recoverable value was either equivalent to or exceeded the current carrying value.  ===== PAGE 198 ===== 198 Notes to the financial statements  For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Note 17 Investment in subsidiaries continued BANK GROUP NON-BANK GROUP Macquarie B.H.

Additionally, these include the major employing entities, entities that are key providers of funding  to other subsidiaries and other operating entities considered key for each Operating Group and region. The list of notable subsidiaries has been categorised based on the geographic region of their incorporation. The country of incorporation has  been stated in brackets. For entities in the Australia region, the country of incorporation is Australia. Overseas subsidiaries and their branches  conduct business predominantly in the place of incorporation and location of their branches. Notable subsidiaries may conduct business in other  geographic regions through branches. The branches have not been separately included in the list of notable subsidiaries. All notable subsidiaries have a 31 March reporting date, except for specific cases covered above. Significant restrictions  During the year, the Company’s subsidiaries did not experience any significant restrictions on paying dividends, accessing or using assets and  settling liabilities of the Group. There are no foreseen restrictions envisaged with regard to planned dividends or payments. However, the ability  of subsidiaries to pay dividends or advance monies to the Group depends on, among other things, their respective local regulatory capital and  banking requirements, exchange controls, statutory reserves, and financial and operating performance. Non-controlling interest  Details of non-controlling interest are covered in Note 28 Reserves, retained earnings and non-controlling interests.  ===== PAGE 199 ===== 199 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Directors’ Report Governance About Financial Report Note 18 Deferred tax assets/(liabilities) The balance comprises temporary differences attributable to: CONSOLIDATED COMPANY 2024 2023 2024 2023 $m $m $m $m Other assets and liabilities   1,743   1,800   43   3  Financial investments and interests in associates and joint ventures   461   475   –   –  Tax losses   506   358   –   –  Intangible assets   304   283   –   –  Property, plant and equipment   144   112   –   –  Loan assets and derivatives   176   268   4   –  Operating and finance leases   31   43   –   –  Set-off of deferred tax liabilities   (1,288)   (1,542)   (6)   –  Net deferred tax assets   2,077   1,797   41   3  Intangible assets   (391)   (419)   –   –  Operating and finance leases   (289)   (359)   –   –  Financial investments and interests in associates and joint ventures   (647)   (444)   –   –  Loan assets and derivatives   (112)   (274)   (6)   –  Other assets and liabilities   (181)   (205)   –   –  Property, plant and equipment   (51)   (37)   –   –  Set-off of deferred tax assets   1,288   1,542   6   –  Net deferred tax liabilities    (383)   (196)   –   –  The above amounts are expected to be recovered more than 12 months after the balance date by the Consolidated Entity and the Company.

During the  current year, these include matters in the Commonwealth of Australia, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and the Federal Republic of Germany. The civil claims may  result in settlements or damages awards. The regulatory enforcement actions may result in outcomes such as penalties, fines, disgorgement of profits and non‑monetary sanctions.  This amount includes provisions for such outcomes. The amount and timing of the outcomes are uncertain and may differ from the provisions recognised. Based on existing  information, the range of likely outcomes, the matters did not have and are not currently expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Entity. The Consolidated Entity and  the Company consider the risk of there being a material adverse effect in respect of claims and actions that have not been provided for to be remote. 2 Revenue authorities undertake risk reviews and audits as part of their normal activities. The Consolidated Entity has assessed these and other taxation claims and litigation, including  seeking external advice where appropriate, and considers that it holds appropriate provisions.   ===== PAGE 202 ===== 202 Notes to the financial statements  For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Note 24 Issued debt securities and other borrowings CONSOLIDATED COMPANY 2024 2023 2024 2023 $m $m $m $m Bonds   57,233   50,972   35,242   31,050  Commercial paper   26,025   23,466   –   –  Securitised notes1   11,621   11,424   –   –  Structured notes2,3   2,550   2,413   1,470   1,063  Certificates of deposits   1,333   2,274   –   –  Total issued debt securities   98,762   90,549   36,712   32,113  Borrowings   21,116   18,912   6,423   6,942  Total issued debt securities and other borrowings   119,878   109,461   43,135   39,055  The Consolidated Entity and the Company have not had any defaults of principal, interest or other breaches with respect to its issued debt  securities and other borrowings during the financial years reported.

The Consolidated Entity’s capital management objectives are to  maintain sufficient capital resources to: • support the Consolidated Entity’s business and operational  requirements; • safeguard interest of depositors’ and the Consolidated Entity’s  ability to continue as a going concern; • exceed regulatory capital requirements; and • support the Consolidated Entity’s credit ratings. The Consolidated Entity’s capital management strategy uses  both internal and external measures of capital. Internally, the  Consolidated Entity has developed an Economic Capital Adequacy  Model (ECAM) that complements the management of specific risk  types such as equity, credit, market and operational risk by  providing an aggregate view of the Consolidated Entity’s risk  profile. Externally, the Consolidated Entity is subject to minimum  capital requirements imposed by APRA. Measures of capital used to support business decision-making  include: • capital adequacy assessment • risk appetite setting • risk-adjusted performance measurement Regulatory capital framework Regulatory capital requirements are imposed and measured at  three levels of consolidation within the Consolidated Entity: • Level 1: MBL and certain subsidiaries which meet the APRA  definition of Extended Licensed Entities. • Level 2: MBL, its subsidiaries and its immediate parent less  certain subsidiaries of MBL which are deconsolidated for APRA  reporting purposes. These include entities conducting  insurance, funds management and non-financial operations. • Level 3: The Level 2 group, other bank entities excluded from  Level 2 plus the Non-Bank Group. In determining the capital  requirements, transactions internal to the Consolidated Entity  are eliminated. MBL, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is an APRA  regulated ADI and is subject to the prevailing APRA ADI Prudential  Standard requirements. MBL is accredited by APRA to apply the  Basel III Foundation Internal Ratings Based Approach for credit risk  and the Internal Model Approach for market risk and interest rate  risk in the banking book. The Company and Consolidated Entity, as an APRA authorised and  regulated NOHC, is regulated on a Level 3 basis and is required to  maintain minimum regulatory capital calculated as the sum of: • MBL’s minimum Tier 1 capital requirement, based on a  percentage of risk-weighted assets (RWAs) plus Tier 1  deductions per the prevailing APRA ADI Prudential Standards. • The Non-Bank Group capital requirement, per the Consolidated  Entity’s ECAM. The Consolidated Entity’s Level 3 eligible capital consists of  ordinary equity, retained earnings, certain reserves and  hybrid instruments. The overall Level 3 capital position is  reported as an excess over the regulatory minimum capital  adequacy requirement. The Consolidated Entity has complied with minimum capital  requirements at Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 throughout the  financial year.  ===== PAGE 204 ===== 204 Notes to the financial statements  For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Note 26 Loan capital Subordinated debt Subordinated debt comprises of agreements between the Consolidated Entity and its lenders that provide that, in the event of liquidation,  entitlement of such lenders to repayment of the principal sum and interest thereon is and shall at all times be and remain subordinated to the  rights of all other present and future creditors of the Consolidated Entity.

Award types under the MEREP Restricted Share Units (RSUs) A RSU is a beneficial interest in a MGL ordinary share held on behalf of a MEREP participant by the plan trustee (Trustee). The participant is entitled to receive dividends on the share and direct the Trustee how to exercise voting rights of the share. The participant  also has the right to request the release of the share from the MEREP Trust, subject to the vesting and forfeiture provisions of the MEREP.

Deferred Share Units (DSUs) A DSU represents the right to receive on exercise of the DSU either a share held in the Trust or a newly issued share (as determined by the  Company in its absolute discretion) for no cash payment, subject to the vesting and forfeiture provisions of the MEREP. A MEREP participant  holding a DSU has no right or interest in any share until the DSU is exercised. The Company may issue shares to the Trustee or direct the Trustee  to acquire shares on-market, or via a share acquisition arrangement for potential future allocations to holders of DSUs. Generally, where permitted by law, DSUs will provide for cash payments in lieu of dividends paid on MGL ordinary shares before the DSU is  exercised. Further, the number of shares underlying a DSU will be adjusted upon any bonus issue or other capital reconstruction of the Company  in accordance with the ASX Listing Rules, so that the holder of a DSU does not receive a benefit that holders of the Company’s shares do not  generally receive. These provisions are intended to provide the holders of DSUs, as far as possible, with the same benefits and risks as holders of  RSUs. However, holders of DSUs will have no voting rights with respect to any underlying MGL ordinary shares. DSUs will only be offered in jurisdictions where legal or tax rules make the grant of RSUs impractical, or where PSUs are structured as DSUs (see  PSUs). DSUs have been granted with an expiry period of up to nine years.

Restricted Shares A Restricted Share is an MGL ordinary share transferred from the MEREP Trust and held by a MEREP participant subject to restrictions on  disposal, vesting and forfeiture rules. The participant is entitled to receive dividends on, and to exercise the voting rights of, the Restricted  Shares. Restricted Shares are only offered in jurisdictions where legal or tax rules make RSU/DSU awards impractical.

Participation in the MEREP is currently provided to the following Eligible Employees: • Executive Directors with retained Directors’ Profit Share (DPS), a proportion of which is allocated in the form of MEREP awards (Retained  DPS Awards) • staff other than Executive Directors with retained profit share above a threshold amount (Retained Profit Share Awards) and staff who were  promoted to Associate Director, Division Director or Executive Director, who received a fixed Australian dollar value allocation of MEREP  awards (Promotion Awards) • Macquarie staff with retained commission (Commission Awards) • new Macquarie staff who commence at Associate Director, Division Director or Executive Director level and are awarded a fixed Australian  dollar value (New Hire Awards) • members of the MGL and MBL Executive Committees who are eligible for PSUs (PSU awards) • in limited circumstances, Macquarie staff may receive an equity grant instead of a remuneration or consideration payment in cash. Current  examples include individuals who become employees of the Consolidated Entity upon the acquisition of their employer by a Macquarie entity  or who receive an additional award at the time of joining Macquarie (also referred to above as New Hire Awards).  ===== PAGE 220 ===== 220 Notes to the financial statements  For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Note 32 Employee equity participation continued Award types under the MEREP continued Vesting periods are as follows: Award type Level Vesting Retained Profit Share Awards  and Promotion Awards Below Executive Director 1/3rd in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th year following the year of grant1 Retained DPS Awards granted in  relation to years 2013 to 2023 Executive Committee members  and Designated Executive Directors 1/5th in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th year following the year of grant2 Retained DPS Awards granted in  relation to years 2013 to 2023 All other Executive Directors 1/3rd in the 3rd, 4th and 5th year following the year of grant2 Retained DPS Awards granted in  relation to 2024 and following  years Executive Committee members and  other Executive Directors 1/3rd in the 3rd, 4th and 5th year following the year of grant2 PSU Awards granted in relation to  years 2017 to 2019 Executive Committee members  (including CEO and MBL CEO) 50% in the 3rd and 4th years following the year of grant3 PSU Awards granted in relation to  2020 and following years Executive Committee members  (excluding CEO and MBL CEO) 100% in the 4th year following the year of grant3 PSU Awards granted in relation to  years 2020 to 2023 CEO and MBL CEO 100% in the 4th year following the year of grant3 PSU Awards granted in relation to  2024 and following years CEO and MBL CEO 100% in the 5th year following the year of grant3 Commission Awards Below Executive Director 1/3rd in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th year following the year of grant1 New Hire Awards All Director-level staff 1/3rd in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th year following the year of grant1 In limited cases, the invitation or application form for awards may set out a different vesting period, in which case that period will be the vesting  period for the award. For example, staff in certain jurisdictions may have a different vesting period due to local regulatory requirements. For Retained Profit Share awards representing 2023 retention, the allocation price was the weighted average price of the shares acquired for  the 2023 purchase period, which was 15 May 2023 to 21 June 2023. That price was calculated to be $179.17 (2022 retention: $168.81). 1 Vesting will occur during an eligible staff trading window. 2 Vesting will occur during an eligible staff trading window. If an Executive Director has been on leave without pay (excluding leave to which the Executive Director may be eligible under  local laws) for 12 months or more, the vesting period may be extended accordingly. 3 Subject to achieving certain performance hurdles.  ===== PAGE 221 ===== 221 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Directors’ Report Governance About Financial Report Note 32 Employee equity participation continued Performance Share Units (PSUs) PSUs will only be released or become exercisable upon the achievement of certain pre-vest assessment4 and performance hurdles. Only  members of the MGL and MBL Executive Committees are eligible to receive PSUs. For the PSUs allocated to Executive Committee Members,  two performance hurdles have been determined and each will apply individually to 50% of the total number of PSUs awarded. Hurdles are  periodically reviewed by the Board Remuneration Committee (BRC) to ensure they continue to align the interests of staff and shareholders and  provide a challenging but meaningful incentive to Executive Committee members. The BRC considers historical and forecast market data, the  views of corporate governance groups, shareholders and regulators as well as market practice. No change has been made to the hurdles for this  financial year. The hurdles are outlined below. Performance hurdle 1 Hurdle Reference group 50% of the PSUs based solely on the relative average annual return on  ordinary equity (ROE) over the vesting period compared to a reference group  of global financial institutions. A sliding scale applies with 50% becoming exercisable above the 50th  percentile and 100% vesting at the 75th percentile. The current reference group comprises Bank of America Corporation, Barclays  PLC, Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan  Chase & Co., Lazard Limited, Morgan Stanley and UBS AG.5 Performance hurdle 2 Hurdle Required result 50% of the PSUs based solely on the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in  earnings per share (EPS) over the vesting period. A sliding scale applies with 50% becoming exercisable at EPS CAGR of 7.5% and  100% at EPS CAGR of 12%. For example, if EPS CAGR were 9.75%, 75% of the  relevant awards would become exercisable. Under both performance hurdles, the condition is examined once only. Testing occurs annually on 30 June immediately before vesting on 1 July,  based on the most recent financial year-end results available. To the extent that a condition is not met when examined, the PSUs due to vest  will not be exercisable upon vesting, resulting in no benefit to Executive Committee members. Pre-vest assessment (At end of vesting period)4 Prior to vesting of PSU awards, the Board will conduct a holistic assessment of the Executive Committee's collective contribution to driving the  performance of Macquarie over the vesting period, based on the extent to which the Executive Committee has: 1. promoted behaviour that is consistent with and reflects Macquarie’s risk culture and Code of Conduct and the principles of What We  Stand For 2. overseen the effectiveness of Macquarie’s risk management framework, policies and practices in managing key financial and non-financial risks 3. overseen funding, liquidity and capital management to ensure Macquarie’s financial soundness. Where the Board forms a negative overall assessment of the relevant Executive Committee’s collective contribution, it may consider whether  an adjustment is appropriate, taking into account any mitigating and aggravating factors. To assist the Board with their determination of an adjustment to the PSU vesting outcome, and to ensure that the determination encompasses  all relevant considerations, the BRC will receive reporting over the vesting period. 4 Pre-vest assessment applicable for awards to be granted in relation to 2024 and following years. 5 For unvested PSU awards made prior to 2023, the reference group included Bank of America Corporation, Barclays PLC, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Inc., JP  Morgan Chase & Co., Lazard Ltd, Morgan Stanley and UBS AG.  ===== PAGE 222 ===== 222 Notes to the financial statements  For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Note 32 Employee equity participation continued Assumptions used to determine fair value of MEREP awards RSUs and DSUs are measured at their grant dates based on their  fair value6 and for each PSU, the awards expected to vest are  measured on the basis of the assumptions below. This amount is  recognised as an expense over the respective vesting periods. RSUs, DSUs and PSUs relating to the MEREP plan for Executive  Committee members have been granted in the current financial  year in respect of the 2023 performance. The accounting fair value  of each of these grants is estimated using the Company’s share  price on the date of grant and for each PSU also incorporates a  discounted cash flow method using the following key assumptions: • interest rate to maturity: 4.25% per annum • expected vesting dates of PSUs: 1 July 2027 • dividend yield: 3.54% per annum. While RSUs, DSUs and PSUs (for Executive Committee members)  for FY2024 will be granted during FY2025, the Company begins  recognising an expense for these awards (based on an initial  estimate) from 1 April 2023 related to these future grants.  The expense is estimated using the estimated MEREP retention  for FY2024 and applying the amortisation profile to the retained  amount. For PSU, the estimate also incorporates an interest rate to  maturity of 3.97% per annum (3.99% for grants to the CEO and the  MBL CEO), expected vesting date of 1 July 2028 (1 July 2029 for  the CEO and the MBL CEO), and a dividend yield of 3.76% per  annum. In the following financial year, the Consolidated Entity will  adjust the accumulated expense recognised for the final  determination of fair value for each RSU, DSU and PSU when  granted and will use this valuation for recognising the expense  over the remaining vesting period. The Consolidated Entity  annually reviews its estimates of the number of awards (including  those delivered through MEREP) that are expected to vest. It  recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any,  in the employment expenses in the income statement, with a  corresponding adjustment to equity (for equity settled awards), or  a corresponding adjustment to liabilities (for cash settled awards). For the financial year ended 31 March 2024, compensation  expense relating to the MEREP totalled $831,043 thousand  (2023: $760,289 thousand). For the equity settled awards, the estimated future withholding  tax outflow is $642,312 thousand (2023: $534,218 thousand). Employee Share Plan The Consolidated Entity continues to operate the Macquarie Group  Employee Share Plan (ESP) whereby each financial year eligible  employees are offered up to $1,000 worth of fully paid MGL  ordinary shares for no cash consideration. Shares allocated under the ESP cannot be sold until the earlier of  three years after allocation or the time when the participant is no  longer employed by the Consolidated Entity. In all other respects,  shares allocated rank equally with all other fully paid ordinary  shares then on issue. The latest offer under the ESP was made during November 2023.  A total of 2,391 (2023: 2,195) staff participated in this offer. On 1 December 2023, the participants were each allocated 6  (2023: 5) fully paid ordinary shares based on the offer amount of  $1,000 and the average market share price of $166.34  (2023: $178.23), resulting in a total of 14,346 (2023: 10,975)  shares being allocated. The shares were allocated to staff for no  cash consideration. The aggregate value of the shares allocated  was deducted from staff profit share and commissions. For the financial year ended 31 March 2024, compensation  expense relating to the ESP totalled $2,388 thousand  (2023: $1,968 thousand). Other plans The Consolidated Entity operates other local share-based  compensation plans, none of which, individually or in aggregate  are material. Shares purchased on-market/issued for the purpose of an  employee incentive scheme During the financial year ended 31 March 2024, the Consolidated  Entity purchased 3,180,994 (2023: 3,600,455) shares on-market  and 2,556,543 (2023: 1,870,038) shares via off-market transfer  from its employees during the Staff Trading window for MEREP.

SEs are generally established with restrictions on their ongoing activities in order to achieve narrow and well-defined objectives. SEs  are classified as subsidiaries and are consolidated when control exists. The Consolidated Entity engages with SEs for securitisation, asset-backed financing and structured financing arrangements in order to diversify  its sources of funding for asset origination and capital efficiency purposes. The Consolidated Entity also engages with SEs when providing  investment management and other fiduciary activities. The Consolidated Entity’s involvement with SEs is primarily of the following nature. Type Details Securitisations Securitisations involve transferring assets into a vehicle that sells beneficial interests to investors through the issue  of debt and equity notes with varying levels of subordination. The notes are collateralised by the assets transferred  to these vehicles and pay a return based on the returns of those assets, with residual returns paid to the most  subordinated investor. These vehicles are created for securitising assets, including mortgages, and finance leases. The Consolidated Entity also establishes SEs on behalf of customers to securitise their loans or receivables and may  manage these securitisation vehicles or provide liquidity or other support. The Consolidated Entity may serve as a sponsor, servicer, underwriter, liquidity provider, derivative counterparty,  purchaser of notes and/or purchaser of residual income units. The Consolidated Entity may also provide redraw  facilities or loan commitments to securitisation vehicles. Asset-backed financing Asset-backed vehicles are used to provide tailored lending for the purchase or lease of assets transferred by the  Consolidated Entity or its clients. The assets are normally pledged as collateral to the lenders. The Consolidated  Entity engages in raising finance for assets such as vessels, electronic and IT equipment. Structured financing and  other arrangements Includes: • financing for prepaid commodity delivery contracts. The Consolidated Entity has contractually guaranteed the  performance obligation under these arrangements • financing through loans and reverse repurchase agreements for short-term term funding requirements of SEs  which are sponsored by third parties. Funds management and  administration activities The Group conducts investment management and other fiduciary activities as responsible entity, trustee, custodian,  advisor or manager of investment funds or trusts, including superannuation and approved deposit funds, wholesale  and retail trusts. Certain funds meet the definition of a structured entity. The Consolidated Entity’s interests in these funds includes holding units in funds, receiving fees for services,  providing lending facilities and derivative.  ===== PAGE 225 ===== 225 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Directors’ Report Governance About Financial Report Note 34 Structured entities continued The following table presents the carrying value and maximum exposure to loss (before the benefit of collateral and credit enhancements) of the  Consolidated Entity’s interests in unconsolidated SEs.

These exposures are typically managed  under credit and market risk limits described in Note 36.1 Credit risk and Note 36.3 Market risk. For these reasons, information on the size and  structure for these SEs is not considered meaningful for understanding the related risks, and have not been presented in the table above. In respect of the Consolidated Entity’s loan assets exposure in securitisation, asset-backed financing entities and structured financing, the total  size of the unconsolidated SEs is $74,580 million (2023: $44,114 million). Size is based on the latest available information representing either  the total assets of the SE (measured either at amortised cost excluding impairments or fair values if readily available), outstanding notional of  issued notes or the principal amount of liabilities if there is nominal equity.  For the above exposures, the Consolidated Entity does not sponsor or control these SEs, nor is it a significant user of the services of these SEs. Additionally, as part of its funds management and administration activities the Consolidated Entity has interests in certain funds including  investments, receivables, contract assets and undrawn commitments which represent the Consolidated Entity’s maximum exposure to loss. In  certain cases the Consolidated Entity invests alongside its own managed funds to demonstrate further alignment with investors. The carrying  value of the Consolidated Entity’s investments in funds is disclosed in Note 14 Interests in associates and joint ventures. Interests in the nature  of receivables, contract assets and undrawn commitments are disclosed in Note 30 Related party information and Note 11 Other assets. The  Assets Under Management (AUM) of $938.3 billion (2023: $878.6 billion) represent the indicative size of these funds and is measured as the  proportional ownership interest in the underlying assets of funds and mandated assets that Macquarie actively manages or advises on. Private  Markets AUM includes equity yet to deploy. 1 Prior period comparative information has been re-presented, or additional information provided, to conform to changes in the current period 2 Includes non-investment grade interests of $829 million (2023: $544 million) in securitisation activities, $1,269 million (2023: $1,267 million) in asset-backed financing activities and  $886 million (2023: $474 million) in structured financing and other arrangements. 3 Excludes $3,039 million (2023: $3,074 million) of guarantees provided by the Company in respect of a subsidiary to fulfil its obligations for certain prepaid commodity contracts  towards unconsolidated structured entities. On consolidation, these guarantees are accounted for as part of borrowings that represent the subsidiary obligations in terms of these  commodity contracts.  ===== PAGE 226 ===== 226 Notes to the financial statements  For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Note 35 Hedge accounting Hedging strategy The use of derivative and non-derivative instruments to  economically hedge non-traded positions potentially gives rise to  income statement volatility as a result of mismatches in the  accounting treatment between the derivative and non-derivative  instruments and the related exposure. The Consolidated Entity’s  objective is to reduce the risk of volatility in earnings, within  pre-defined thresholds. This volatility is managed through  designation of hedge accounting relationships and the use of  naturally offsetting positions in the income statement. Hedging instruments Detail on hedging instruments, the nature of hedged risks, as well  as the notional and the carrying amount of derivative financial  instruments and, in the case of hedges of net investment in  foreign operations, the notional of foreign currency denominated  borrowings and other balance sheet items, for each type of hedge  relationship, is shown in the respective sections. The maturity  profile for the hedging instruments’ notional amounts are  reported based on their contractual maturity. Where a cross  currency swap has been dual designated in both a cash flow and a  fair value hedge, the notional is shown more than once. Increases  in notional profiles of hedging instruments are presented as  negative figures, with decreases and maturities presented as  positive figures. Hedging ineffectiveness In the case of a fair value hedge, hedge ineffectiveness is the  extent to which the changes in the fair value of the hedging  instrument differ to that of the hedged item for the hedged risk. In  the case of a cash flow hedge, hedge ineffectiveness is the extent  to which the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument  exceeds, in absolute terms, that of the hedged item. In the case of  hedges of net investment in foreign operations, hedge  ineffectiveness is the extent to which the change in the carrying  amount of foreign currency denominated borrowings and other  balance sheet items attributable to the change in exchange rates  exceeds, in absolute terms, that of the hedged item. Sources of  hedge ineffectiveness primarily arise from basis and timing  differences between the hedged items and hedging instruments,  and designating existing derivatives with a non-zero fair value as  hedging instruments. Hedge ineffectiveness is reported in net  trading income in the income statement.  ===== PAGE 227 ===== 227 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Directors’ Report Governance About Financial Report Note 35 Hedge accounting continued Cash flow hedges The cash flow hedge reserve, representing the effective portion of the movements in the hedging instrument, is disclosed in  Note 28(i) Reserves. Changes in this reserve are reported in the Consolidated Entity’s statements of comprehensive income. The cumulative  gains and losses remaining in the cash flow hedge reserve for hedging relationships that have ceased, but for which the hedged cash flows are  still expected to occur is $1 million gain (2023: $2 million gain) for the Consolidated Entity and $nil (2023: $nil) for the Company. This amount  will be transferred to the income statement when the hedged item affects profit and loss.

The risk of changes in the NIFO for movements in  foreign exchange rates may be hedged by the Consolidated Entity using a combination of derivatives, foreign currency denominated borrowings  and other balance sheet items. Refer to Note 36 Financial risk management: Non-traded risk for further information on the Consolidated  Entity’s risk management strategy. In order to reflect the Consolidated Entity’s risk management strategy, hedge accounting is applied where changes in the derivatives and  foreign denominated borrowings and other balance sheet items are recognised, together with the related foreign currency translation reserve,  in the Consolidated Entity’s other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified to the income statement or re-attributed within  equity as defined in Note 44(iii) Foreign currency translation: Subsidiaries and other equities. Hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is recognised in the  income statement. Given that the Consolidated Entity’s NIFO frequently changes, the hedge designations are reviewed on a monthly basis or  more frequently where required.

As a result, the  notional value of hedging instruments presented in the table above of $31,448 million (2023: $29,558 million) represents the notional of  Foreign currency denominated borrowings, Foreign exchange contracts and other foreign currency denominated balance sheet items. The  notional of the underlying hedged component of the Consolidated Entity’s net investment in foreign operations is $24,486 million  (2023: $23,001 million).  Hedge ineffectiveness is the extent to which the absolute change in either the fair value of the derivative or the carrying amount of foreign  currency denominated borrowings attributable to the change in exchange rates exceeds that of the hedged item. There was no ineffectiveness  recognised in the income statement by the Consolidated Entity in the current year (2023: $nil). 2 Where the fair value of the derivative is positive/(negative), the notional of the derivative has been similarly included in the table as an asset/(liability).  ===== PAGE 231 ===== 231 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Directors’ Report Governance About Financial Report Note 35 Hedge accounting continued Fair value hedges The fair value attributable to the hedged risk is recognised as a fair value adjustment to the hedged item on the balance sheet. In an effective  fair value hedge relationship, movements in this fair value adjustment are largely offset by movements in the fair value of the hedging  instrument. Any residual is recognised as ineffectiveness in net trading income in the income statement.

The material risks faced by the Consolidated Entity include  aggregate, asset, conduct, credit, environmental and social, equity,  financial crime, legal, liquidity, market, operational (including cyber  and information security), regulatory and compliance,  reputational, strategic, tax, and work health and safety risks. The primary responsibility for risk management lies with the  business. An important part of the role of all staff throughout  Macquarie is to ensure they manage risks appropriately. RMG is independent of other areas of the Consolidated Entity.  RMG approval is required for all material risk acceptance decisions.  RMG reviews and assesses risks and sets limits. Where appropriate,  these limits are approved by the Executive Committee and the  Board. The Head of RMG, as Macquarie’s CRO, is a member of the  Executive Committee of MGL and MBL and reports directly to the  CEO with a secondary reporting line to the Board Risk Committee.  Further details on the Risk Management Framework in the  Consolidated Entity can be found in the Risk Management Report  of this Annual Report. Note 36.1 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will fail to complete its  contractual obligations when they fall due. The consequential loss  is the amount of the financial obligation not paid back, or the loss  incurred in replicating a trading contract with a new counterparty. Credit risk assessment and approval Exercise of credit authority within Macquarie is undertaken under  authority delegated by the MGL and MBL Boards directly. Credit risk assessment includes a comprehensive review of the  creditworthiness of the counterparty and related entities, key risk  and mitigants, and that the downside risk is properly understood  and acceptable.  After this analysis is undertaken, limits are set for an acceptable  level of potential exposure. All wholesale limits and ratings are  reviewed at least once a year or more frequently if required. Retail credit exposures are monitored by the business units and  overseen by RMG Credit on a portfolio basis. All credit exposures are monitored regularly against limits. For  limit monitoring, credit exposures for loan assets are reported at  amortised cost. Derivative exposures are measured using high  confidence potential future underlying asset prices. To mitigate credit risk, where appropriate, the Consolidated Entity  makes use of margining and other forms of collateral or credit  enhancement techniques (including guarantees, letters of credit  and the purchase of credit default swaps).  Ratings and reviews Refer to Note 13 Expected credit losses for details regarding the  manner in which the Consolidated Entity has adopted and applied  AASB 9’s expected credit loss impairment requirements.  For the purpose of presenting the credit risk associated with  assets on the Consolidated Entity’s Statements of financial  position in accordance with the requirements of AASB 9, the  following methodology has been adopted.  Wholesale rating  Macquarie wholesale ratings broadly correspond to Standard &  Poor’s credit ratings as follows. Credit  Profile Internal  Rating Standard & Poor’s  Equivalent Investment grade MQ1 to MQ8 AAA to BBB- Non-investment grade MQ9 to MQ16 BB+ to C Default MQ99 Default Retail rating  Retail pools are mapped to the credit quality grades based on  their PDs.  Mapping retail portfolios to the credit grades has been done for  comparability of the overall portfolio presentation and does not  reflect the way that the retail portfolio is segmented for  management purposes. Management reviews a range of  information, including past due status for the portfolio, to assess  the credit quality of these assets. Due from subsidiaries  Balances with subsidiaries are mapped to the rating grades  assigned internally to these counterparties for the pricing of  internal funding arrangements on an arm’s length basis. Portfolio and country risk A review of the credit portfolio analysing credit concentrations by  counterparty, geography, risk type, industry and credit quality is  carried out quarterly and reported to the Board semi-annually.  Policies are in place to regulate large exposures to single  counterparties or groups of counterparties. The Consolidated Entity has a country risk management  framework which covers the assessment of country risk and the  approval of country risk limits. Where appropriate the country risk  may be mitigated or transferred by parent company guarantees,  bank letters of credit, or political risk insurance.  ===== PAGE 234 ===== 234 Notes to the financial statements  For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Note 36 Financial risk management continued Note 36.1 Credit risk continued Credit quality of financial assets The table below discloses, by credit rating grades and ECL impairment stage, the gross carrying amount1 of assets measured at amortised cost  or FVOCI and off balance sheet exposures of the Consolidated Entity subject to the impairment requirements of AASB 9 Financial Instruments.

For off balance sheet instruments, the maximum  exposure to credit risk is a function of the contractual notional  amount, except for certain usage-based guarantees in which case  the maximum exposure is determined with respect to the fair  value of the underlying exposure and is disclosed in Note 13  Expected credit losses. Collateral and credit enhancements held Cash collateralised lending and reverse repurchase agreements The Consolidated Entity enters into securities and commodities  borrowing and reverse repurchase transactions with  counterparties which require lodgement of collateral. These  arrangements include: • securities and commodities borrowed in return for cash,  for which the fair value of the securities and commodities  borrowed is equal to or less than the cash deposited with  the counterparty • reverse repurchase agreements (collateralised financing  arrangements), for which the fair value of the securities and  commodities received as collateral is generally in excess of the  principal amount • securities received as collateral in return for the transfer of  other securities; and • securities borrowed on an unsecured basis in return for a fee. The non-cash collateral received is not recognised by the  Consolidated Entity in the Statements of financial position, as the  risks and rewards of ownership remain with the counterparty. The  Consolidated Entity is permitted to sell or repledge the securities  and commodities received. In the absence of default by the  counterparty, the Consolidated Entity has an obligation to return  the non-cash collateral received to the counterparty.  For securities and commodities borrowed in return for cash and  reverse repurchase arrangements, the fair value of non-cash  collateral received is $60,082 million (2023: $55,834 million). For  securities borrowed in return for other securities, the fair value of  the securities received is $19,012 million (2023: $11,807million).  For securities borrowed on an unsecured basis, the fair value of the  securities received is $7,530 million (2023: $7,899 million).  Out of the above, the fair value of securities repledged is  $22,320 million (2023: $20,933 million). The fair value attributed to non-cash collateral held is judgmental  and measured with reference to quoted prices in active markets  where available (for example, listed securities). If quoted prices in  active markets are not available, the fair value are estimated using  pricing models or other recognised valuation techniques that  maximise the use of quoted prices and observable market inputs.  The fair value of these securities and commodities were  determined when last assessed and have been determined  periodically.   ===== PAGE 243 ===== 243 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Directors’ Report Governance About Financial Report Note 36 Financial risk management continued Note 36.1 Credit risk continued Loan assets Home loans Macquarie purchases risk protection for its home loans portfolio consistent with the risk appetite. Macquarie has diversified its risk protection  coverage to a global panel of reinsurers with diverse lines of business coverage and ratings ranging from AA+ to A– from external rating  agencies. The length of risk protection cover is up to 10 years from the year of origination with the type of cover including excess of loss and  quota share.

Of the term lending of $47,645 million (2023: $39,835 million), the credit exposure after considering the estimated value of  collateral and credit enhancements is $7,123 million (2023: $6,129 million). Asset financing The Consolidated Entity leases assets and provides asset-related financing to corporate and retail clients. Titles to the underlying assets are  held by the Consolidated Entity as collateral. Of the asset finance portfolio of $7,942 million (2023: $9,320 million), the credit exposure after  considering the depreciated value of collateral is $2,820 million (2023: $3,661 million). Derivative instruments Derivatives may be traded on an exchange (exchange traded) or they may be privately negotiated contracts, which are referred to as  Over-the-Counter (OTC) derivatives. The Consolidated Entity’s and the Company’s OTC derivatives are cleared and settled either through central  clearing counterparties (OTC-cleared), or bilateral contracts between two counterparties. The Consolidated Entity’s approach to financial risk management includes entering into margining and collateralisation arrangements and  enforceable master netting arrangements (MNA) with counterparties. The MNAs allow for net settlement with counterparties in the event of  default or other pre-determined events, such that their potential effects on the Consolidated Entity’s financial position in that circumstance is  to settle these contracts as one arrangement. The Consolidated Entity receives both cash and non-cash collateral in relation to margining arrangements. Refer to Note 39 Offsetting financial  assets and financial liabilities for impact of master netting arrangements, cash margins and other financial collateral held against the positions  as at balance date. Refer Note 40 Pledged assets and transfers of financial assets for non-cash collateral received and repledged as part of derivative margining  arrangements.  ===== PAGE 244 ===== 244 Notes to the financial statements  For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Note 36 Financial risk management continued  Note 36.1 Credit risk continued Financial investments Debt securities held by the Consolidated Entity carrying a credit  risk are primarily in the nature of bonds, NCDs, floating rate notes  (FRN), commercial paper and other debt securities for liquidity  management purposes and other securities for short-term gains. Settlement assets Security and commodity settlements of $6,875 million  (2023: $6,476 million) and $4,094 million (2023: $4,383 million)  respectively presented in Note 8 Margin money and settlement  assets, represent amounts owed by an exchange (or a client) for  equities, commodities and other securities sold. These assets are  secured with the underlying securities, commodities or cash held  by the Consolidated Entity until the date of settlement. The period  between trade and settlement date varies as per regional  regulatory and business norms. Other financial assets Commodity related receivables under other financial assets are  typically either collateralised with the underlying commodity  held by the Consolidated Entity until the date of settlement or  short-term receivables with standard credit terms which would be  backed by a bank guarantee where required to remain within  credit limits. Credit commitments Undrawn facilities and lending securities commitments of $33,333 million (2023: $28,760 million) are secured through  collateral and credit enhancement. The remaining credit exposure  after considering the estimated value of collateral is $9,931 million  (2023: $5,877 million). Additional collateral Apart from collateral details disclosed above, the Consolidated  Entity also holds other types of collateral, such as unsupported  guarantees. While such mitigants have value as a credit risk  mitigant often providing rights in insolvency, their assignable  values are uncertain and therefore are assigned no value for  disclosure purposes. For all collateral, in the event of default realised collateral values  may be lower than the value of collateral as at the reporting date. Repossessed collateral In the event of a customer default, the Consolidated Entity may  either take possession of the underlying collateral held as security  and/or exercise its right to dispose of the customer’s asset. At the  reporting date, the Consolidated Entity did not have any material  amounts of such collateral recognised in its Statements of  financial position. Note 36.2 Liquidity risk Governance and oversight Macquarie’s liquidity risk management framework is designed to  ensure that it is able to meet its obligations as they fall due under  a range of market conditions. Liquidity management is performed centrally by Group Treasury,  with oversight from the MGL and MBL Asset and Liability  Committees (ALCO), the MGL and MBL Boards and RMG.  Macquarie’s liquidity policies are approved by the MGL and MBL  Boards after endorsement by the respective ALCO and liquidity  reporting is provided to the Boards on a regular basis. The MGL  and MBL ALCOs include the MGL CEO, MBL CEO, CFO, CRO, COO,  Group General Counsel, Co-Heads of Group Treasury and relevant  Operating Group Heads. RMG provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management,  including ownership of liquidity policies and key limits and approval  of material liquidity scenario assumptions. Liquidity policy and risk appetite The MGL and MBL liquidity policies are designed so that each of  Macquarie, the Bank Group and the Non-Bank Group maintains  sufficient liquidity to meet their obligations as they fall due. The  MBL Liquidity Policy outlines the standalone framework for the  Bank Group and its principles are consistent with the  MGL Liquidity Policy. Macquarie’s liquidity risk appetite is intended  to ensure that Macquarie is able to meet all of its liquidity  obligations during a period of liquidity stress: a twelve month  period with constrained access to funding markets for MBL, no  access to funding markets for MGL and with only a limited  reduction in Macquarie’s franchise businesses. Reflecting the longer-term nature of the Non-Bank Group asset  profile, MGL is funded predominantly with a mixture of capital and  long-term wholesale funding. MBL is an authorised deposit-taking  institution and is funded mainly with deposits, long-term liabilities  and capital. Liquidity contingency plan Group Treasury maintains a Liquidity Contingency Plan for MGL  and a Liquidity Contingency Plan for MBL, which outline how a  liquidity crisis would be managed for the Group and Bank,  respectively. The plans define roles and responsibilities and actions  to be taken in a liquidity event, including identifying key  information requirements and appropriate communication plans  with both internal and external parties.  ===== PAGE 245 ===== 245 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Directors’ Report Governance About Financial Report Note 36 Financial risk management continued Note 36.2 Liquidity risk continued Specifically, the plans detail: • factors that may constitute a crisis • the officers responsible for invoking each plan • a committee of senior executives responsible for managing  a crisis • the information required to effectively manage a crisis • a communications strategy • a high level checklist of possible actions to conserve or raise  additional liquidity for the Group or Bank; and • contact lists to facilitate prompt communication with all key  internal and external stakeholders. In addition, Macquarie monitors a range of early warning indicators  on a daily basis that might assist in identifying emerging risks in  Macquarie’s liquidity position. These indicators are reviewed by  Senior Management and are used to inform any decisions  regarding invoking the plan. The Liquidity Contingency Plans are subject to regular review by  both Group Treasury and RMG. They are submitted annually to the  MGL and MBL ALCO and respective Boards for approval. Macquarie is a global financial institution, with branches and  subsidiaries in a variety of countries. Regulations in certain  countries may require some branches or subsidiaries to have  specific local contingency plans. Where that is the case, the  Liquidity Contingency Plans contain either a supplement or a  reference to a separate document providing the specific  information required for those branches or subsidiaries. Funding strategy Macquarie prepares a Funding Strategy for MGL and a Funding  Strategy for MBL on an annual basis and monitors progress  against the strategies throughout the year. The Funding Strategies aim to maintain diversity of funding  sources for MGL and MBL, ensure ongoing compliance with all  liquidity requirements and facilitate forecast asset growth. The Funding Strategies are reviewed by the MGL and MBL ALCO  and approved by the respective Boards. Scenario analysis Scenario analysis is central to Macquarie’s liquidity risk  management framework. In addition to regulatory defined  scenarios, Group Treasury models additional liquidity scenarios  covering both market-wide and Macquarie name-specific crises. These scenarios use a range of assumptions, which Macquarie  intends to be conservative, regarding the level of access to capital  markets, deposit outflows, contingent funding requirements and  asset sales. As an example, one internal scenario projects the expected cash  and liquid asset position during a combined market-wide and  Macquarie name-specific crisis over a twelve month time frame.  This scenario assumes no access to wholesale funding markets, a  significant loss of customer deposits and contingent funding  outflows resulting from undrawn commitments, market moves  impacting derivatives and other margined positions combined with  a multiple notch credit rating downgrade. Macquarie’s cash and  liquid asset portfolio must exceed the minimum requirement as  calculated in this scenario at all times. Liquid asset holdings Group Treasury centrally maintains a portfolio of highly liquid  unencumbered assets which are intended to ensure adequate  liquidity is available under a range of market conditions. The  minimum level of cash and liquid assets is calculated with  reference to internal scenario analysis and regulatory  requirements. The cash and liquid asset portfolio contains only unencumbered  assets that can be relied on to maintain their liquidity in a crisis  scenario. Specifically, cash and liquid assets held to meet minimum  internal and regulatory requirements must be cash balances  (including central bank reserves and overnight lending to financial  institutions), qualifying High-Quality Liquid Assets and other  Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) repo eligible securities.  Composition constraints are also applied to ensure appropriate  diversity and quality of the assets in the portfolio. The cash and  liquid asset portfolio is held in a range of currencies consistent  with the distribution of liquidity needs by currency, allowing for an  acceptable level of currency mismatches. Funds transfer pricing An internal funds transfer pricing framework is in place that has  been designed to produce appropriate incentives for business  decision-making by reflecting the funding costs arising from  business actions and the separate funding tasks and liquidity  requirements of the Bank and Non-Bank Groups. Under this  framework, each business is allocated the appropriate cost of the  funding required to support its products and business lines,  recognising the actual and contingent funding-related exposures  their activities create. The Operating Groups are assumed to be  fully debt funded for the purposes of internal funding charges.  ===== PAGE 246 ===== 246 Notes to the financial statements  For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Note 36 Financial risk management continued Note 36.2 Liquidity risk continued Contractual undiscounted cash flows The following tables summarise the maturity profile of the Consolidated Entity’s financial liabilities as at 31 March based on a contractual  undiscounted repayment basis and hence would vary from the carrying value as reported on the Statements of financial position at the balance  date.

Any position not deemed to be trading book is  considered to be ‘banking book’, and covered by either the  non-traded market risk or equity risk frameworks. Traded market risk Market risk is the risk of adverse changes in the value of the  Consolidated Entity’s trading positions as a result of changes in  market conditions. The Consolidated Entity is exposed to the  following risks: • price: The risk of loss due to changes in price of a risk factor  (interest rates, foreign exchange, commodities etc.) • volatility: The risk of loss due to changes in the volatility of  a risk factor • basis: The risk of imperfect correlation between offsetting  investments in a hedging strategy • correlation: The risk that the actual correlation between two  assets or variables is different from the assumed correlation • illiquid market: The risk of inability to sell assets or close out  positions in thinly-traded markets at close to the last market  prices • concentration: The risk of over concentration of trading  exposures in certain markets and products • valuation adjustments: The risk of actual valuation  adjustments to derivative positions; specifically Credit  Valuation Adjustment (CVA), Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA)  and Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA).  It is recognised that all trading activities contain calculated  elements of risk taking. The Consolidated Entity is prepared to  accept such risks provided they are within agreed limits,  independently and correctly identified, calculated and monitored  by RMG, and reported to Senior Management on a regular basis.  RMG monitors positions within the Consolidated Entity according  to a limit structure which sets limits for all exposures in all  markets. Limits are for both individual trading desks and divisions  as well as in aggregate. RMG sets three complementary limit structures: • contingent loss limits: Worst-case scenarios that shock prices  and volatilities by more than that which has occurred  historically. Multiple scenarios are set for each market to  capture the non-linearity and complexity of exposures arising  from derivatives. A wide range of assumptions about the  correlation between markets is applied • position limits: Volume, maturity and open position limits are  set on a large number of market instruments and securities in  order to constrain concentration risk and to avoid the  accumulation of risky, illiquid positions • Value-at-Risk (VaR) limits: A statistical measure based on a  10-day holding period and a 99% confidence level, as stipulated  by the APRA capital adequacy standard. The model is validated  daily by back testing a one-day VaR against hypothetical and  actual daily trading profit or loss.  ===== PAGE 250 ===== 250 Notes to the financial statements  For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Note 36 Financial risk management continued Note 36.3 Market risk continued Value-at-Risk figures (1-day, 99% confidence level) The table below shows the average, maximum and minimum VaR over the financial year for the major markets in which the Consolidated Entity  operates. The VaR shown in the table is based on a one-day holding period being the mark-to-market loss that could be incurred over that  period. The aggregated VaR includes the effects of correlation between risk factors. 2024 2023 Average Maximum Minimum Average Maximum Minimum $m $m $m $m $m $m Equities   5.74   8.04   3.59   4.15   7.75   1.91  Interest rates   5.21   8.00   3.56   6.57   11.24   2.98  Foreign exchange   3.37   8.05   1.41   3.71   9.07   0.89  Commodities and commodity contracts   32.02   50.26   17.18   54.71   118.42   33.99  Aggregate   33.26   53.17   20.36   55.51   115.88   34.48  Value-at-Risk The VaR model uses a Monte Carlo simulation where price and volatility risk factors are derived from multiple normal distributions, based on  three years of historical data. The following factors can limit the effectiveness of VaR in predicting future price moves: • the use of historical data means that the current model parameters may not reflect future market conditions especially when entering a  period of heightened volatility. The model utilises exponential weighting to place emphasis on the most recent market movements to more  accurately reflect current conditions • VaR is calculated at the 99% level of confidence and does not account for losses that could occur beyond this point. For capital adequacy purposes, debt-specific risk is measured using APRA’s standard method, whilst all other exposures are captured by the VaR  model. This combined approach has been approved by APRA. Non-traded market risk The Consolidated Entity has exposure to non-traded market risks arising from transactions entered into during its normal course of business  and as a result of its investments in foreign operations. These risks include: • interest rate: changes in the level, shape and volatility of yield curves, and/or client behaviour given these changes • foreign exchange: changes in the spot exchange rates. The Consolidated Entity has limited appetite for non-traded market risks. Where commercially feasible, these risks are transferred into the  trading books of CGM and Group Treasury and governed within the traded market risk framework described above. Responsibility for managing  exposures rests with individual businesses, with independent monitoring performed by RMG and FMG. Accounting considerations arising from hedging activities The use of derivative and other financial instruments to hedge non-traded positions potentially gives rise to income statement volatility due to  difference in accounting treatments. The Consolidated entity manages this volatility through hedge accounting and use of naturally offsetting  positions in the income statement as set out in Note 44(x) Derivative instruments and hedging activities and Note 35 Hedge accounting.  ===== PAGE 251 ===== 251 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Directors’ Report Governance About Financial Report Note 36 Financial risk management continued Note 36.3 Market risk continued Interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) Macquarie measures and monitors interest rate risk on both an economic value and earnings basis, which are modelled as the worst-case  contingent loss from a set of six severe interest rate shocks, including both parallel and non-parallel shocks. Aggregate IRRBB exposures for the  Consolidated Entity are constrained on both measures: • Economic Value Sensitivity (EVS): the EVS metric measures the change in net present value of the interest-bearing portfolios in the  banking book as a result of changes in interest rates.  • Earnings at Risk (EaR): the EaR model constrains the impact on reported net income over 12 months for a change in interest rates. A central objective of the Consolidated Entity’s Non-traded Market Risk Policy is to reduce earnings volatility to interest rate movements. A key  component of this arises where shareholders' equity invested in interest bearing assets are managed by holding a portfolio of ‘receive fixed’  interest rate swaps. The duration of this hedging program is constrained by Board-approved limits, and subject to independent oversight  by RMG. Foreign exchange risk The Consolidated Entity is active in various currencies globally. A key objective of the Consolidated Entity’s Non-traded Market Risk Policy is to  reduce this sensitivity of regulatory capital ratios to foreign currency movements.  This is achieved by leaving specific investments in foreign operations exposed to foreign currency translation movements and captured in the  foreign currency translation reserve, a component of regulatory capital, which aligns the foreign exchange sensitivity of capital supply with that  of foreign currency capital requirements.  The table below presents the sensitivity of the Consolidated Entity’s net investment in foreign operations to the most material currencies. As a  result of the policy described above, these movements will not have a material impact on the capital ratios. 2024 2023 Movement in exchange  rates Sensitivity of other  comprehensive income  after tax Movement in exchange  rates Sensitivity of other  comprehensive income  after tax % $m % $m CONSOLIDATED United States dollar  +10   (1,312)   +10   (1,254)  Pound sterling  +10   (220)   +10   (201)  Euro  +10   (145)   +10   (111)  Total   (1,677)    (1,566)  United States dollar  -10   1,312   -10   1,254  Pound sterling  -10   220   -10   201  Euro  -10   145   -10   111  Total   1,677    1,566   ===== PAGE 252 ===== 252 Notes to the financial statements  For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Note 36 Financial risk management continued Note 36.3 Market risk continued Interest rate risk – Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (IBOR) During 2018, the Consolidated Entity initiated a group-wide  project to manage the impacts of IBOR reform, including  overseeing the transition from LIBOR to ARRs.  The Consolidated Entity’s reform project oversaw the successful  transition of contracts referencing LIBORs that ceased publication  on 30 June 2023 and 31 December 2021 in accordance with  industry and regulatory guidance. This included the transition of  the Consolidated Entity's exposures in GBP, JPY, EUR, CHF and USD  LIBOR, as well as IBOR for other minor currencies. The remaining transition focus is on the Canadian Dollar Offered  Rate (CDOR) which will cease publication on 28 June 2024. The  Consolidated Entity has actively begun to engage with clients to  support them through the transition from CDOR to the Canadian  Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA). The Consolidated Entity also continues to have exposures to the  28-day term Mexican Interbank Equilibrium Interest Rate (TIIE).  The transition risk for these contracts is low, given that the TIIE  will be calculated synthetically from 1 January 2025 and  amendments to existing contracts are not required. Whilst the transition of contracts referencing CDOR and other  minor IBORs continues to expose the Consolidated Entity to  inherent risks, the remaining IBOR transition efforts and risk has  significantly reduced. The operating groups manage remaining  IBOR transition risks within the Consolidated Entity’s existing risk  management framework. Exposure yet to be transitioned to ARRs: The notional value of  the Consolidated Entity’s financial instruments which are yet to  transition to ARRs as at the reporting date includes: • derivatives: gross exposure of $19,342 million in MXN TIIE,  $3,942 million in CDOR and $884 million in other currencies  (2023: $79,673 million in USD LIBOR, $14,886 million in MXN  TIIE, $3,573 million in CDOR and $618 million in other  currencies) • non-derivative financial assets: exposure of $470 million  in CDOR and $103 million in other currencies (2023:  $5,231 million in USD LIBOR, $704 million in CDOR and  $152 million in other currencies). • non-derivative financial liabilities: $nil exposure (2023:  $3,637 million in USD LIBOR). The scope of the above-mentioned exposures has been  determined as follows: • the benchmark will be replaced, and the replacement date is  known. Only exposures with contractual maturities extending  beyond the replacement date have been included • the gross notional values for derivatives and both on-balance  sheet and off-balance sheet exposures have been included • for contracts that reference more than one benchmark, such as  a cross currency swap, the exposure includes both benchmarks  to reflect the absolute exposure to different reference rates • derivative contracts of $nil (2023: $9,664 million) designated in  hedge accounting relationships have synthetically transitioned  and have been excluded, primarily relating to the USD LIBOR to  SOFR transition.  ===== PAGE 253 ===== 253 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Directors’ Report Governance About Financial Report Note 36 Financial risk management continued Note 36.3 Market risk continued Equity price risk The below table indicates the income statement effect of the Consolidated Entity’s equity exposures held as part of its non-trading investment  portfolio, due to a reasonably possible change in equity prices, with all other variables held constant.

Quoted prices or rates are used to determine fair value where an active market exists. If the market for a financial and non-financial instrument  is not active, fair values are estimated using present value or other valuation techniques, using inputs based on market conditions prevailing at  the measurement date. The values derived from applying these techniques are affected by the choice of valuation model used and the underlying assumptions made  regarding such inputs. Items measured at fair value are categorised in their entirety, in accordance with the levels of the fair value hierarchy as outlined below. Level 1: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly  (i.e. derived from prices). Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). The appropriate fair value hierarchy level for an item is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value  measurement. AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement requires the use of the price within the bid-offer spread that is most representative of fair value. Valuation  systems will typically generate mid-market prices. The bid-offer adjustment reflects the extent to which bid-offer costs would be incurred if  substantially all of the residual net exposure to market risks were closed, on a portfolio basis, using available hedging instruments. The following methods and significant assumptions have been applied in determining the fair values of the following items carried at amortised  cost in the Statements of financial position. Asset or liability Valuation techniques, inputs and other significant assumptions Cash and bank balances, Cash  collateralised lending and reverse  repurchase agreements, Cash  collateralised borrowing and repurchase  agreements The fair value of cash and bank balance, cash collateralised lending and reverse repurchase agreements, cash  collateralised borrowing and repurchase agreements approximates their carrying amounts as these are highly  liquid and short-term in nature. Loan assets and Deposits The fair value of fixed rate loan assets and term deposits is determined with reference to changes in interest  rates and credit spreads. The fair value of variable rate loan assets and deposits approximates their carrying amounts, subject to any  adjustment for changes in the credit spreads.  The fair value of demand deposits with no fixed maturity approximates their carrying amount as they are short- term in nature or are payable on demand. Financial investments The fair value of liquid assets and other instruments maturing within three months are approximate to their  carrying amounts.  The fair value of fixed rate debt investments is estimated by reference to current market rates offered on similar  securities and the creditworthiness of the borrower.  The fair value of variable rate investments approximate their carrying amounts, subject to any adjustment for  changes in credit spreads.  Issued debt securities and other  borrowings, and Loan capital The fair value of issued debt securities, borrowings and loan capital is based on quoted prices in active markets,  where available. Where quoted prices are not available the fair value is based on discounted cash flows using  rates appropriate to the term and incorporates changes in the Consolidated Entity’s own credit spread. Margin money, settlement assets and  settlement liabilities, Other financial  assets and financial liabilities The fair value of margin money, settlement assets, settlement liabilities, other financial assets and financial  liabilities approximate their carrying amounts.  ===== PAGE 259 ===== 259 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Directors’ Report Governance About Financial Report Note 38 Fair value of assets and liabilities continued The following methods and significant assumptions have been applied in determining the fair values of following items carried at fair value in  the Statements of financial position. Asset or liability Valuation techniques, inputs and other significant assumptions Trading assets, Trading liabilities  and Derivatives Trading assets, including commodities and commodity contracts, trading liabilities, derivative financial  instruments and other transactions undertaken for trading purposes are measured at fair value by reference to  quoted prices in active markets, where available (for example, listed securities). If quoted prices in active markets  are not available, then fair values are estimated on the basis of other recognised valuation techniques. The Consolidated Entity has incorporated the market implied funding costs for uncollateralised derivative  positions as a Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA). FVA is determined by calculating the net expected exposures  at a counterparty level and applying the Consolidated Entity’s internal Treasury lending rates as an input into the  calculation.  Reverse repurchase and  repurchase agreements Reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements, being collateralised financing arrangements, are measured at  fair value with reference to current market rates and giving considerations to the fair value of securities held or  provided as the collateral. Financial investments Financial investments classified as FVTPL or FVOCI are measured at fair value by reference to quoted prices in  active markets, where available (for example, listed securities). If quoted prices in active markets are not  available, the fair values are estimated on the basis of other recognised valuation techniques that maximise the  use of quoted prices and observable market inputs. Loan assets and Issued debt securities and  other borrowings Fair values of loans and issued debt securities are measured by reference to quoted prices in active markets,  where available. If quoted prices are not available in active markets, the fair values are estimated with reference  to current market rates. Investment property Investment property is measured at fair value based on the discounted future cash flow approach or the  capitalisation approach and is supported by recent market transactions, where available. The adopted discount  rates and capitalisation rates are determined based on industry expertise. Other financial assets and financial  liabilities Fair values of other financial assets and financial liabilities are based upon data or valuation techniques  appropriate to the nature and type of the underlying instruments. For financial assets carried at fair value, in order to measure counterparty credit risk, an adjustment is incorporated into the valuation. Where  exposures are managed on a portfolio basis, the adjustment is calculated on a counterparty basis for those exposures. For financial liabilities  carried at fair value, in order to measure the Consolidated Entity’s own credit risk, an adjustment is incorporated into the valuations. Where valuation techniques are used to determine fair values, they are validated and periodically reviewed by qualified personnel independent  of the area that created them. The output of a valuation technique is always an estimate of a fair value that cannot be measured with complete  certainty. Models are reviewed and calibrated periodically to test the outputs and reflect the prices from observable current market  transactions in same instrument or other available observable market data.  To the extent possible, models use only observable market data, however management is required to make assumptions for certain inputs that  are not supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument such as volatility and correlation.  ===== PAGE 260 ===== 260 Notes to the financial statements  For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Note 38 Fair value of assets and liabilities continued Assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost The fair values calculated for financial instruments which are carried in the Statements of financial position at amortised cost are for disclosure  purposes only. The methods and assumptions applied to derive these fair values can require significant judgement by management and  therefore may not necessarily be comparable to other financial institutions. Where information on the significance of unobservable inputs to  the fair value measurement is not readily available, financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are presented on the  basis that unobservable inputs are significant to the position.

Transfers into Level 3 were due to the lack of observable valuation inputs for certain investments and trading balances. Transfers out of Level 3  were principally due to valuation inputs becoming observable during the financial year. Financial assets reclassified into/out of the fair value  hierarchy disclosure due to recognition and measurement category changes, or where there have been changes in significant influence or  control but some form of interest in the assets are still retained, are also presented as transfers into/out of Level 3. Unrecognised gains or losses The best evidence of fair value at initial recognition is its transaction price, unless its fair value is evidenced by comparison with other  observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on a valuation technique for which variables include only data from  observable markets (or when inputs from unobservable markets are insignificant). Where such alternative evidence exists, the Consolidated  Entity recognises profit or loss immediately when the asset or liability is recognised (‘day 1 profit or loss’). When significant unobservable inputs  are used to determine fair value, the day 1 profit or loss is deferred and is recognised in the income statement over the life of the transaction or  when the inputs become observable. The table below summarises the deferral and recognition of profit or loss where a valuation technique has been applied in which significant  unobservable inputs are used.

Interest rate and other products Discount rate – Credit spreads: Loans are generally valued using discount rates. Significant unobservable inputs may include interest rates and  credit spreads of counterparties and original issue discounts on primary debt issuances. Credit spread is the premium over a benchmark interest  rate required by the market to accept lower credit quality which increase the discount factor applied to future cash flows thereby reducing the  value of the asset. Credit spreads may be implied from the market prices and may not be observable in more illiquid markets. Price in %: Comparable transactions are leveraged to price the fair value of the assets and liabilities and a percentage is applied to ascertain the  proportion of the transaction price that is comparable with the specific asset/liability. This price percentage is an unobservable input and  judgemental depending on the characteristics of the asset/liability. 5 The range of inputs in NAV is not disclosed as the diverse nature of the underlying investments results in a wide range of inputs.  ===== PAGE 265 ===== 265 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Directors’ Report Governance About Financial Report Note 38 Fair value of assets and liabilities continued Commodities Commodity margin curves: Certain commodities are valued using related observable products from the market and a margin is applied to the  observable market inputs to mitigate the impact of differences in the products. Judgement is involved in the calculation of these margin curves  depending on the quality of the commodity or delivery location and other economic conditions.  Correlation: Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of input variables (i.e. how the change in one variable  influences a change in the other variable). It is expressed as a percentage between –100% and +100%, where 100% represents perfectly  correlated variables and –100% represents inversely correlated variables. Correlation is a key input into the valuation of derivatives with more  than one underlying (e.g. interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchanges rates, inflation rates or equity prices) and is generally used to value  hybrid and exotic instruments. Volatility: Volatility is a measure of the variability or uncertainty in returns for a given underlying input and is generally expressed as a  percentage, which represents an estimate of the amount a particular underlying instrument, parameter or index will change in value over time.  Volatility is an input in the valuation of derivatives containing optionality. Volatility is impacted by the underlying risk, term and strike price of  a derivative. Correlations and volatilities are derived through the extrapolation of observable volatilities, recent transaction prices, quotes from other market  participants and historical data adjusted for current conditions. Equity and equity-linked products Unlisted equity securities are generally valued based on earnings or revenue multiples, referencing market transactions which are not directly  comparable or quantifiable and are adjusted as appropriate for current economic conditions. Other significant unobservable inputs may include  NAV and discount rates determined using inputs specific to the underlying investment and forecast cash flows and earnings/revenues of  investee entities. Sensitivity analysis of valuations using unobservable inputs  The table below shows the sensitivity to reasonably possible alternative assumptions for Level 3 instruments whose fair values are determined  in whole, or in part, using unobservable inputs. The impact of the sensitivity of instruments which hedge the Level 3 positions but are classified  as Level 1 or 2 is not included in the table below.

The following tables provide information on the impact of  offsetting of financial instruments in the Statements of financial position, as well as amounts subject to enforceable netting arrangements that  do not meet all the criteria for offsetting and therefore presented gross in the Statements of financial position. Enforceable netting  arrangements may allow for net settlement of specified contracts with a counterparty only in the event of default or other pre-determined  events, such that their potential effects on the Consolidated Entity’s and the Company’s financial position in that circumstance is to settle  these contracts as one arrangement.  The Consolidated Entity uses a variety of credit risk mitigation strategies in addition to netting and collateral arrangements, therefore amounts  presented in this note are not intended to represent the credit risk exposure of the entity.

For the financial years ended 31  March 2024 and 31 March 2023, there were no material transfers  of financial assets where the Consolidated Entity has had  continuing involvement. Transferred financial assets that are not derecognised The Consolidated Entity did not derecognise any financial assets to  the extent of continuing involvement in the years ended 31 March  2024 and 31 March 2023. The following transactions typically  result in the transferred assets continuing to be recognised  in full. Repurchase and securities lending agreements Securities and commodities sold under an agreement to  repurchase and securities subject to lending agreements continue  to be recognised in the Statements of financial position and an  associated liability is recognised for the consideration received. Where securities are transferred in return for the loan of other  securities or on an unsecured basis in return for a fee, the  transferred asset continues to be recognised in full. There is no  associated liability as the securities received are not recognised on  the balance sheet. The Consolidated Entity is unable to use, sell or  pledge the transferred assets for the duration of the transaction  and remains exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk on  these assets. In certain arrangements the transferee cannot otherwise sell or  pledge the transferred securities, however, the assets may be  substituted if the required collateral is maintained. Other financial transfers not derecognised Includes loans and leases sold or lent to an external funder where  the Consolidated Entity retains full economic exposure. In such  instances, the Consolidated Entity has a right to receive cash from  the lessee and an obligation to pay those cash flows to the  external funder. Also, includes trading assets and financial investments that have  been transferred as margin against future trades. The  Consolidated Entity is unable to use, sell or pledge the transferred  assets for the duration of open position and remains exposed to  interest rate risk and credit risk on these assets.  ===== PAGE 270 ===== 270 Notes to the financial statements  For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Note 40 Pledged assets and transfers of financial assets continued The following tables provide a summary of financial assets that have been transferred in such a way that part or all of the transferred financial  assets do not qualify for derecognition, together with the associated liabilities.

Note 43 Events after the reporting date There were no material events subsequent to 31 March 2024 and  up until the authorisation of the financial statements for issue,  that have not been disclosed elsewhere in the financial  statements.  ===== PAGE 273 ===== 273 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Directors’ Report Governance About Financial Report Note 44 Material accounting policies (i) Principles of consolidation Subsidiaries The consolidated Financial Report reflects the financial  performance and financial position of the Consolidated Entity.  Subsidiaries are all those entities (including structured entities)  which the Consolidated Entity controls. The Consolidated Entity  controls an entity where it has: • power to direct the relevant activities • exposure, or rights, to variable returns, and • the ability to utilise power to affect the entity’s returns. The determination of control is based on current facts and  circumstances and is continuously assessed. The Consolidated  Entity has power over an entity when it has existing substantive  rights that provide it with the current ability to direct the entity’s  relevant activities, being those activities that significantly affect  the entity’s returns. The Consolidated Entity also considers the  entity’s purpose and design. If the Consolidated Entity determines  that it has power over an entity, the Consolidated Entity then  evaluates its exposure, or rights, to variable returns by considering  the magnitude and variability associated with its economic  interests. All variable returns are considered in making that assessment  including, but not limited to, returns from debt or equity  investments, guarantees, liquidity arrangements, variable fees and  certain derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Consolidated  Entity has determined that it controls entities that it has less than  half of the voting rights on the basis of its ability to direct the  relevant activities of those entities. Structured entities Structured Entities (SEs) are those entities that have been  designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant  factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when voting  rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities  of the SE are directed by means of contractual arrangements.  When assessing whether the Consolidated Entity controls (and  therefore consolidates) a SE, judgement is required as to whether  the Consolidated Entity has power over the relevant activities as  well as exposure, or rights, to variable returns of the SE. Where the Consolidated Entity has power over the SE’s relevant  activities, has assessed that its exposure to variable returns  (including through the residual risk associated with its involvement  in SEs) is sufficient, and is able to affect its returns, the SE is  consolidated. Refer to Note 34 Structured entities for further  information related to both consolidated and unconsolidated SE's. Consolidation The effects of all transactions between subsidiaries in the  Consolidated Entity are eliminated in full. Unrealised losses are  eliminated in the same manner as unrealised gains but only to the  extent that there is no evidence of impairment. Non-controlling interests (NCI) in the results and equity of  subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated Income  statements, consolidated Statements of comprehensive income,  consolidated Statements of changes in equity and consolidated  Statements of financial position and are determined on the  basis of the Consolidated Entity’s present ownership interest in  the entity. Where control of an entity was obtained during the financial year,  its results are included in the consolidated Income statements  from the date on which control was obtained. Where control of an  entity ceased during the financial year, its results are included for  that part of the financial year during which control existed. The Consolidated Entity determines the dates of obtaining control  (i.e. acquisition date) and losing control (i.e. disposal date) of  another entity based on an assessment of all pertinent facts and  circumstances that affect the ability to direct the relevant  activities and the extent of the Consolidated Entity’s exposure to  the entity’s variable returns. Facts and circumstances that have  the most impact include the contractual arrangements agreed  with the counterparty, the manner in which those arrangements  are expected to operate in practice and whether regulatory  approval is required (including the nature of such approval). The  acquisition or disposal date does not necessarily occur when the  transaction is closed or finalised under law. Subsidiaries held by the Company are carried in its financial  statements at cost less accumulated impairment. Interests in associates and joint ventures Associates and joint ventures are entities over which the  Consolidated Entity has significant influence or joint control.  Existing ownership interests (including in substance ownership  interests) in associates and joint ventures are accounted for under  the equity method. In-substance ownership interests are interests  that are substantially similar to an investee’s ordinary shares.  Equity accounting of the ownership interests is applied from the  date that the Consolidated Entity has significant influence or joint  control and ceases when the Consolidated Entity no longer has  significant influence or joint control. The Consolidated Entity determines the dates of obtaining or  losing significant influence or joint control of another entity based  on an assessment of all pertinent facts and circumstances that  affect the ability to significantly influence the financial and  operating policies or jointly control the relevant activities of that  entity. Facts and circumstances that have the most impact include  the contractual arrangements agreed with the counterparty, the  manner in which those arrangements are expected to operate in  practice, and whether regulatory approval is required (including the  nature of such approval). The acquisition or disposal date does  not necessarily occur when the transaction is closed or finalised  under law.  ===== PAGE 274 ===== 274 Notes to the financial statements  For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Note 44 Material accounting policies continued (i) Principles of consolidation continued The equity method of accounting is applied in the consolidated  Financial Report and requires the recognition of the Consolidated  Entity’s share of its associates’ and joint ventures’ post acquisition  profits or loss (including impairments of the associates’ or joint  ventures’ assets) in the consolidated income statement, and the  share of the post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive  income in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.  Dividends received by the Consolidated Entity from associates and  joint ventures are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount  of the investment. Transactions reported directly in equity  (besides those reflected in other comprehensive income) are  accounted for by the Consolidated Entity in accordance with the  substance of the transaction and whether the transaction is  dilutive to the Consolidated Entity’s ownership interest. Where the  transaction is dilutive, the impact is recorded as part of the  Consolidated Entity’s share of profits or losses of associates and joint ventures. Equity accounting of losses is restricted to the Consolidated  Entity’s interests in its associate or joint venture, unless the  Consolidated Entity has an obligation or has made payment on  behalf of the entity. Long-term interests in an associate or joint venture, to which the  equity method is not applied but in-substance form part of the net  investment in the associate or joint venture, are accounted for in  accordance with the Consolidated Entity’s financial instruments’  accounting policies, which includes accounting for expected credit  losses, where applicable. Subsequently, the loss allocation and  impairment requirements in AASB 128 Investments in Associates  and Joint Ventures are applied to long-term interests. Where necessary, accounting policies of associates and joint  ventures have been changed to ensure consistency with those  adopted by the Consolidated Entity. At the end of each reporting period, management reviews the  Consolidated Entity’s investments in associates and joint ventures  for indicators of impairment. Where there is an indicator of  impairment, the carrying amount of the investment is tested for  impairment by comparing its recoverable amount with its carrying  value. Impairment losses and reversals are recognised in other  impairment charges/reversals. A reversal of a previously  recognised impairment loss is recognised only to the extent that  the investment’s carrying value does not exceed the carrying  amount that would have been determined (including consideration  of any equity accounted losses) if no impairment loss had been  recognised. Interests in associates and joint ventures are classified as held for  sale when the Consolidated Entity determines that the interest will  be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than  through continuing use. Equity accounting is suspended when the  interest is classified as held for sale. On disposal of an investment in an associate or a joint venture, the  difference between the sales consideration, any retained interest  and the carrying value is recognised as a gain or loss in investment  income as part of other operating income and charges together  with any gains and losses in OCI that is related to the associate or  joint venture. Changes in ownership interests When acquiring additional interests: • of a financial asset (such that it becomes an associate, joint  venture or subsidiary), or • in an investment in an associate or joint venture (such that it  becomes a subsidiary), where the underlying entity constitutes a business, previously held interests are revalued to their fair value and any  gain or loss is recognised in investment income as part other  operating income and charges. Similarly, when selling ownership interests of a subsidiary, where  the underlying constitutes a business (such that control is lost), or  an investment in an associate or joint venture (such that it  becomes a financial asset), retained ownership interests are  revalued to their fair value and any gain or loss is recognised in  investment income as part of other operating income and charges.  Retained ownership interests are not revalued where the sale  represents a contribution to an associate or joint venture, nor in  certain circumstances where the partial sale of an investment in  associate or joint venture, which continues to be equity accounted  post the sale, is affected through a holding company subsidiary. Increases and decreases in the Consolidated Entity’s interest in a  subsidiary (that do not result in the loss of control) are accounted  for directly within equity. Increases in the Consolidated Entity’s  ownership interest in an associate or joint venture are accounted  for as an increase in the carrying value of the interest in associate  or joint venture. The difference between the reduction in the  Consolidated Entity’s interest in an associate or joint venture that  remains an associate or joint venture and the fair value of  consideration received is accounted for as a gain or loss within  investment income as part of other operating income and charges.  A proportionate amount of associated OCI is reclassified to profit  or loss, or reclassified within equity, as would otherwise be  required on disposal of the underlying position. (ii) Business combinations Distinguishing between whether assets or a business is acquired  involves judgement. The Consolidated Entity identifies a business  where an acquired integrated set of activities and assets includes  an economic resource (input) and a substantive process that  together significantly contribute to the ability to provide goods or  services to customers, generate investment income or other  income from ordinary activities (outputs). On a transaction-by-transaction basis, the Consolidated Entity  may use a practical expedient to determine that an acquired set of  activities is not a business. Under this assessment, the transaction  is accounted for as an asset acquisition if substantially all of the  fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single  identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets.  ===== PAGE 275 ===== 275 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Directors’ Report Governance About Financial Report Note 44 Material accounting policies continued (ii) Business combinations continued Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition  method. The consideration exchanged is measured as the  aggregate of the acquisition-date fair values of assets transferred,  equity instruments issued, and liabilities incurred. Transaction  costs of a business combination are recognised directly in the  consolidated income statement as part of other operating  expenses. Identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities  assumed in a business combination are measured at fair value on  the acquisition date. The Consolidated Entity elects, on a  transaction-by-transaction basis, to initially measure NCI either at  fair value or at the NCI’s proportionate share of the fair values of  the identifiable assets and liabilities. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the consideration  exchanged, recognised NCI, and the fair value of previously held  equity interests over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of  the business acquired and is recognised as part of Intangible assets  in the Statements of financial position. Goodwill is subsequently  measured at cost less accumulated impairment. If the consideration is less than the Consolidated Entity’s share of  the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the business  acquired, the difference is recognised in investment income as  part of other operating income and charges, but only after a  reassessment of the identification and measurement of the net  assets acquired. Contingent consideration that is dependent on any subsequent  event is measured at fair value with changes in its fair value  recognised in investment income as part of other operating  income and charges. Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred,  the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present  values as at the acquisition date. The discount rate used is the  Consolidated Entity’s incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at  which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent  financier under comparable terms and conditions. (iii) Foreign currency translation Functional and presentation currency The functional currency of each entity (including branches) in the  Consolidated Entity is determined as the currency of the primary  economic environment in which the entity operates. The  Consolidated Entity and the Company’s financial statements are  presented in Australian dollars (the presentation currency), which  is also the Company’s functional currency. Transactions and balances At initial recognition, a foreign currency transaction is translated  into the entity’s functional currency using the spot exchange rate  between the functional currency and the foreign currency at the  date of the transaction. At the end of each reporting period: • foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated  using the closing exchange rate • non-monetary items (including equity) measured in terms of  historical cost in a foreign currency remain translated using the  spot exchange rate at the date of the transaction, and • non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign  currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date  that the fair value was measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the settlement or  translation of monetary items, or non-monetary items measured  at fair value, are recognised in net trading income with one  exception being where such monetary items are designated as  hedging instruments in qualifying cash flow hedge or net  investment hedge relationships. In such circumstances, the foreign  exchange gains and losses may be deferred in OCI to the extent  the hedge is effective (refer to Note 35 Hedge accounting and  Note 44(x) Derivative instruments and hedging activities). Subsidiaries and other entities The results and financial position of all entities that have a  functional currency other than Australian dollars are translated  into Australian dollars as follows: • assets and liabilities for each Statements of financial position  presented are translated at the closing exchange rate at the  date of that Statements of financial position. Goodwill and fair  value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign  operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign  operation and are translated at the closing exchange rate • income and expenses for each income statement are  translated at actual or average exchange rates at the dates of the transactions • all resulting exchange differences are recognised in OCI within a  separate component of reserves, being the foreign currency  translation reserve (FCTR). Foreign currency gains and losses on intragroup loans are  recognised in the income statement except where the loan is in  substance part of the Consolidated Entity’s net investment in the  foreign operation, in which case the foreign currency gains and  losses are recognised in the Consolidated Entity’s FCTR. The exchange gains or losses recognised in FCTR are reclassified to  the income statement or reattributed within equity as follows: • if there is a disposal of a foreign operation, then the  accumulated FCTR is reclassified from OCI to investment  income within other operating income and charges • if there is a partial disposal of a foreign operation that is an  associate or joint arrangement, without loss of significant  influence or joint control, then a proportionate share of the  accumulated FCTR is reclassified to investment income • if there is a partial disposal of a foreign operation that is a  subsidiary, without loss of control, then a proportionate share  of the accumulated FCTR is reattributed within equity to non- controlling interests.  ===== PAGE 276 ===== 276 Notes to the financial statements  For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Note 44 Material accounting policies continued (iv) Revenue and expense recognition Net interest income Interest income and interest expense (with the exception of  borrowing costs that are capitalised on a qualifying asset which is  not measured at fair value) are recognised using the effective  interest rate (EIR) method for financial assets and financial  liabilities carried at amortised cost, and debt financial assets  classified as at fair value through OCI. The EIR method calculates  the amortised cost of a financial instrument at a rate that  discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments through the  expected life of the financial instrument to the gross carrying  amount of the financial asset or liability. Fees and transaction  costs that are integral to the lending arrangement are recognised  in interest income or interest expense, as applicable, over the  expected life (or, when appropriate, a shorter period) of the  instrument in accordance with the EIR method. When the estimates of payments or receipts of a financial  instrument are subsequently revised, the carrying amount is  adjusted to reflect the actual or revised cash flows with the  remeasurement recognised as part of interest income (financial  assets) or interest expense (financial liabilities). The calculation of the EIR does not include ECL, except for financial  assets which on initial recognition are classified as purchased or  originated credit impaired (POCI). Interest income on these assets  is determined using a credit adjusted EIR by discounting the  estimated future cash receipts, including credit losses expected at  initial recognition, through the expected life of the financial  instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.  Interest income on financial assets that are subsequently classified  as credit-impaired (Stage III), is recognised by applying the EIR to  the amortised cost carrying value (being the gross carrying value  after deducting the impairment loss). Interest income and expense  on financial assets and liabilities that are classified as FVTPL is  accounted for on a contractual rate basis and included in Other  Interest Income. Fee and commission income Revenue earned by the Consolidated Entity from its contracts with  customers primarily consists of the following categories of fee and  commission income: Base and other asset management fees, and performance fees The Consolidated Entity earns base and other asset management  and performance fees for providing asset management services  for listed and unlisted funds, managed accounts and co- investments arrangements. It has been determined that the  provision of asset management services is typically a single  performance obligation. Base management fees are recognised over the life of the contract  as the asset management services are provided. Any associated  performance fees are deemed to be a variable component of the  same asset management service and are recognised only when it is  highly probable that the performance hurdles are met, and a  significant reversal of cumulative fees recognised to date will not  occur. Determining the amount and timing of performance fees to  be recognised involves judgement, the use of estimates (including  management estimates of underlying asset values) and  consideration of a number of criteria relating to both the fund or  managed account in which the asset(s) are held, as well as the  underlying asset(s), such as: • the extent to which performance fee liabilities have been  accrued by the fund or managed account to date or  consideration of the current valuation case of the assets in  relation to the related performance fee hurdle rate • the proportion of assets realised and returns on those assets • nature of remaining underlying fund or managed account’s  assets and potential downside valuation risks on each • time remaining until realisation of the assets and the fund’s life  or asset management services’ timeline • consideration of the ability to dispose of the asset, including  any barriers to divest. Mergers and acquisitions, advisory and underwriting fees The Consolidated Entity earns revenue through its role as advisor  on corporate transactions as well as through its role as manager  and underwriter of equity and debt issuances. The revenue from  these arrangements is recognised at a point in time, and when it  has been established that the customer has received the benefit of  the service such that the performance obligation is satisfied. For  advisory services this is typically at the time of closing the  transaction. Where mandates contain rights to invoice upon reaching certain  milestones, the Consolidated Entity assesses whether distinct  services have been transferred at these milestones and  accordingly recognises revenue. If not, the fee recognition will be  deferred until such time as the performance obligation has been  completed. Management of capital raisings and underwriting of  debt or equity capital raisings are each considered distinct  performance obligations that are typically satisfied on the  allocation date of the underwritten securities. Brokerage and other trading-related fee income The Consolidated Entity enters into contracts with customers to  act as an agent to buy and sell securities. The brokerage and  commission income related to this service is recognised on trade  date and is presented net of any rebates. Other fee and commission income Other fee and commission income includes fees earned on a range  of banking products and services platforms, wealth services, credit  cards, structuring fees, lending services, stock borrow and lending  activities and income on structured products which is recognised  when the performance obligation is satisfied.  ===== PAGE 277 ===== 277 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Directors’ Report Governance About Financial Report Note 44 Material accounting policies continued (iv) Revenue and expense recognition continued Net operating lease income Operating lease income is recognised on a straight-line basis over  the lease term and is presented net of the related depreciation  expense. Other operating income and charges Other operating income and charges includes investment income,  and other income/charges. Investment income includes gains and losses arising from  subsequent changes in the fair values of equity and debt  investment securities that are classified as FVTPL and dividends or  distributions on these securities which represent the return on  such investments. Gains or losses on the change of control, joint control and/or  significant influence and reclassifications to/from held for sale also  forms part of investment income. Refer to Note 44(i) Principles of  consolidation for details on the timing of recognition of such gains or losses. Dividends Dividends or distributions are recognised when the right to receive  a dividend or distribution is established, it is probable the  economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the  Company and/or Consolidated Entity and the dividend can be  measured reliably. Dividends or distributions from HFT assets are recognised in net  trading income, as investment income as part of other operating  income and charges for other financial assets measured at FVTPL  or FVOCI, or as a reduction to the carrying amount of the  investment in associates and joint ventures in the Consolidated  Entity’s Statements of financial position. Where associates and  joint ventures are classified as held for sale, dividends or  distributions are recognised within other income as part of other  operating income and charges. In the Company's financial statements, judgement may be applied  in determining whether distributions from subsidiaries, associates  and joint ventures are to be recognised as dividend income or as a  return of capital. Distributions that represent a return of capital  are accounted for by the Company as a reduction to the cost of its  investment and are otherwise recognised by the Company within  investment income as part of other operating income and charges  when the recognition criteria are met. Expenses Expenses are recognised in the income statement as and when the  provision of services is received. (v) Segment reporting Operating Segments are identified on the basis of internal reports  to Senior Management about components of the Consolidated  Entity that are regularly reviewed by Senior Management who have  been identified as the chief operating decision makers, in order to  allocate resources to the segment and to assess its performance.  Information reported to Senior Management for the purposes of  resource allocation and assessment of performance is specifically  focused on core products and services offered, comprising five  reportable segments as disclosed in Note 3 Segment reporting. Information about products and services is based on the financial  information used to produce the Consolidated Entity’s financial  statements. Information about geographical segments is based on  the jurisdiction of the respective entities. (vi) Taxation The balance sheet approach to tax effect accounting has been  adopted whereby the income tax expense for the financial year is  the tax payable on the current year’s taxable income adjusted for  changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to  temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and  liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements,  and unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised when temporary differences  arise between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their  respective carrying amounts which give rise to a future tax benefit,  or when a benefit arises due to unused tax losses. In both cases,  deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is  probable that future taxable amounts will be available against  which to utilise those temporary differences or tax losses. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised when such temporary  differences give rise to taxable amounts that are payable in future  periods. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised at the  tax rates expected to apply when the assets are recovered, or  the liabilities are settled under enacted or substantively enacted  tax law. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities that would  otherwise arise following the enactment or substantive enactment  of Pillar Two legislation are not recognised in the financial  statements in accordance with a mandatory exception to the  Accounting Standards, as disclosed in Note 1(iv) New Australian  Accounting Standards and amendments to Australian Accounting  Standards and interpretation that are effective in the current  financial year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally  enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and  when the deferred tax balances relate to the same  taxation authority. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally  enforceable right to offset and an intention to either settle on a  net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Current and deferred taxes attributable to amounts recognised in  OCI are also recognised in OCI. The Consolidated Entity exercises judgement in determining  whether deferred tax assets, particularly in relation to tax losses,  are probable of recovery.  ===== PAGE 278 ===== 278 Notes to the financial statements  For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Note 44 Material accounting policies continued (vi) Taxation continued Factors considered include the ability to offset tax losses within  the tax consolidated group in Australia or groups of entities in  overseas jurisdictions, the nature of the tax loss, the length of  time that tax losses are eligible for carry forward to offset against  future taxable profits and whether future taxable profits are  expected to be sufficient to allow recovery of deferred tax assets. The Consolidated Entity undertakes transactions in the ordinary  course of business where the income tax treatment requires the  exercise of judgement. The Consolidated Entity estimates the  amount expected to be paid to/(recovered from) tax authorities  based on its understanding and interpretation of the law.  Uncertain tax positions are presented as current or deferred tax  assets or liabilities with reference to the nature of the underlying  uncertainty. Tax consolidation The Consolidated Entity’s Australian tax liabilities are determined  according to tax consolidation legislation. The Company, together with all eligible Australian resident wholly  owned subsidiaries, comprise a tax consolidated group (TCG) with  the Company as the head entity. As a consequence, the relevant  subsidiaries are not liable to make income tax payments and do  not recognise any current tax balances or any deferred tax assets  arising from unused tax losses or credits. The TCG recognises its current and deferred taxes using the ‘group  allocation approach’ detailed in AASB UIG Interpretation 1052  Tax Consolidation Accounting. Under the terms and conditions of  a tax funding agreement, the Company charges each subsidiary for  all current tax liabilities incurred in respect of their activities and  reimburses each subsidiary for any tax assets arising from unused tax losses. Should the Company be in default of its tax payment obligations,  or a default is probable, the current tax balances of its subsidiaries  will be determined in accordance with the terms and conditions of  a tax sharing agreement between the Company and entities in  the TCG. Goods and Services tax (GST) Where an amount of GST (or other value added tax) is not  recoverable from global tax authorities, it is either capitalised to  the Statements of financial position as part of the cost of the  related asset or is recognised as part of other operating expenses.  Where GST (or other value added tax) is recoverable from or  payable to global tax authorities, the net amount is recorded as a  separate asset or liability in the Statements of financial position. (vii) Financial instruments Recognition of financial instruments Financial instruments are recognised when the Consolidated Entity  becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial instrument is initially recognised at fair value and is  adjusted (in the case of instruments not classified at FVTPL) for  transaction costs that are incremental and directly attributable to  the acquisition or issuance of the financial instrument, and fees  that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Transaction  costs and fees paid or received relating to financial instruments  carried at FVTPL are recorded in the income statement. The best evidence of a financial instrument’s fair value at initial  recognition is its transaction price, unless its fair value is evidenced  by comparison with other observable current market transactions  in the same instrument or based on a valuation technique for  which variables include only inputs from observable markets  (or when inputs from unobservable markets are insignificant).  Where such alternative evidence exists, the Consolidated Entity  recognises profit or loss immediately when the instrument is  recognised (day 1 profit or loss). When significant unobservable  inputs are used to determine fair value, the day 1 profit or loss is  deferred and is recognised in net trading income over the life of  the transaction or when the inputs become observable. Financial instruments arising in multiple transactions are  accounted for as a single arrangement if this best reflects the  substance of the arrangement. Factors considered in this  assessment include whether the financial instruments: • are entered into at the same time and in contemplation of  one another • have the same counterparty • relate to the same risk • there is no apparent economic need or substantive business  purpose for structuring the transactions separately that could  not also have been accomplished in a single transaction, or • whether each of the financial instruments has its own terms  and conditions and may be transferred or settled separately. Derecognition of financial instruments Financial assets Financial assets are derecognised from the Statements of financial  position when: • the contractual rights to cash flows have expired, or • the Consolidated Entity has transferred the financial asset such  that it has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of  ownership of the financial asset. A financial asset is transferred if, and only if, the  Consolidated Entity: (i) transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the  financial asset, or  (ii) retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the  financial asset, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the  cash flows to one or more recipients in an arrangement where  the Consolidated Entity is: • not obligated to pay amounts to the eventual recipients  unless it collects equivalent amounts from the original asset • prohibited from selling or pledging the original asset other  than as security to the eventual recipients, and • obligated to remit any cash flows it collects on behalf of the  eventual recipients without material delay, generally  considered to be within 1 to 3 months.  ===== PAGE 279 ===== 279 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Directors’ Report Governance About Financial Report Note 44 Material accounting policies continued (vii) Financial instruments continued In transactions where the Consolidated Entity neither retains nor  transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a  financial asset, the asset is derecognised if control over the asset  is lost. Any interest in the transferred and derecognised financial  asset that is created or retained by the Consolidated Entity is  recognised as a separate asset or liability. In transfers where control over the asset is retained, the  Consolidated Entity continues to recognise the asset to the extent  of its continuing involvement as determined by the extent to  which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred  asset. Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are derecognised from the Statements of  financial position when the Consolidated Entity’s obligation has  been discharged, cancelled or has expired. Gains and losses on the derecognition of debt financial assets and  liabilities Gains and losses arising from the derecognition of debt financial  assets or financial liabilities are recognised in: • net trading income in respect of trading-related balances that  are subsequently measured at amortised cost • investment income within other operating income and charges  in respect of financial investments and loans to associates • other income and charges as part of other operating income  and charges for all other financial assets and financial liabilities. Financial guarantee contracts issued Financial guarantee contracts are recognised as a financial liability  at the time the guarantee is issued. The liability is initially  measured at fair value and subsequently at the higher of: • the amount determined in accordance with the expected credit  loss model under AASB 9, or • the amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, the  cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with  the principles of AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with  Customers. Modification of financial instruments A financial instrument is modified when its original contractual  cash flows are renegotiated or modified. A financial asset that is  renegotiated is derecognised if the rights to receive cash flows  from the existing agreement have expired, either through  replacement by a new agreement or the existing terms are  substantially modified. To determine whether the existing terms  are substantially modified, both qualitative and quantitative  factors may be considered. Qualitative factors would, for example,  include a consideration of whether and to what extent the  modification is driven by financial difficulties of the borrower or  where the terms are modified such that the instrument no longer  meets the SPPI requirements. A financial liability that is renegotiated is derecognised if the  existing agreement is cancelled and a new agreement is made on  substantially different terms or if the existing terms are modified  such that the renegotiated financial instrument is a substantially  different financial instrument. The assessment on whether the  terms are substantially different consider both quantitative and  qualitative factors. Where the modification results in  derecognition of the original financial instrument, the new  financial instrument is recorded initially at its fair value and the  resulting difference is recognised in the income statement in  accordance with the nature of the financial instrument as  described in the derecognition of financial instruments policy. For financial instruments measured at amortised cost, and for  debt financial assets measured at FVOCI, when the modification  does not result in derecognition, the gross carrying amount of the  financial instrument is recalculated and a modification gain or loss  is recognised in the income statement. The gain or loss is  measured as the adjustment of the gross carrying amount to  reflect the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows,  discounted at the instrument’s original EIR. Classification and subsequent measurement Financial assets Financial assets are classified based on the business model within  which the asset is held and on the basis of the financial asset’s  contractual cash flow characteristics. Business model assessment The Consolidated Entity uses judgement in determining the  business model at the level that reflects how groups of financial  assets are managed together to achieve a particular business  objective. In determining the business model, all relevant evidence  that is available at the date of the assessment is used including: • how the performance of the business model and the financial  assets held within that business model is evaluated and  reported to the Consolidated Entity’s Senior Management  personnel and senior executives • the risks that affect the performance of the business model  (and the financial assets held within that business model) and,  in particular, the way in which those risks are managed • how managers of the business are compensated (for example,  whether the compensation is based on the fair value of  the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows  collected), and • Frequency, value, timing of and reasons for sales of assets in  the portfolio and expectations about future sales activity. Solely payment of principal and interest (SPPI) The contractual cash flows of a financial asset are assessed to  determine whether these represent SPPI on the principal amount  outstanding, consistent with a basic lending arrangement. This  includes an assessment of whether the cash flows primarily reflect  consideration for the time value of money and credit risk of the  principal outstanding. Interest may also include consideration for  other basic lending risks and costs including a reasonable profit  margin.  ===== PAGE 280 ===== 280 Notes to the financial statements  For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Note 44 Material accounting policies continued (vii) Financial instruments continued In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, the  Consolidated Entity considers the contractual terms of the  instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset  contains contractual terms that could change the timing or  amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet the  SPPI criteria. Such an assessment would consider, for example, the  impact of any of the following features: • Contingent events that could change the amount and/or timing  of cash flows; • Leverage features that could change the economic  characteristics of principal and interest cash flows introducing  volatility inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement; • Prepayment features, to determine whether the amount due  on early repayment substantially represents unpaid amounts of  principal and accrued interest which may include reasonable  compensation for the early termination of the contract; • Terms that limit the Consolidated Entity's claim to cash flows  from specified assets - for example, through non-recourse or  limited recourse arrangements - in a way that is inconsistent  with a basic lending arrangement. Amortised cost A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortised cost using  the EIR method where: • the financial asset is held within a business model whose  objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect  contractual cash flows • the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on  specified dates to cash flows that meet the SPPI  requirements, and • the financial asset has not been classified as DFVTPL. Interest income is determined in accordance with the EIR method  and recognised as part of interest and similar income. Fair value through other comprehensive income A financial asset is subsequently measured at FVOCI if the  following conditions are met: • the financial asset is held within a business model whose  objective is to both collect contractual cash flows and to sell  the financial assets • the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on  specified dates to cash flows that meet the SPPI requirements • the financial asset has not been classified as DFVTPL. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in OCI, with the  exception of interest (which is recognised as part of interest  income), ECL (which is recognised in credit and other impairment  charges/reversal) and foreign exchange gains and losses (which are  recognised in net trading income) and is net of any related hedge  accounting adjustments. When debt financial assets classified as  at FVOCI are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously  recognised in OCI is reclassified from OCI to investment income in  respect of debt financial investments and loans to associates, or  to other income and charges as part of other operating income  and charges for all other financial assets. Fair value through profit or loss Financial assets that do not meet the criteria to be measured at  amortised cost or FVOCI are subsequently measured at FVTPL. For the purposes of the Consolidated Entity’s financial statements,  the FVTPL classification consists of the following: • financial assets that are held for active trading (held for trading  (HFT)). This classification includes all derivative financial assets,  except those that are designated as hedging instruments in  qualifying hedge relationships and are classified as FVTPL • financial assets in a business model whose objective is achieved  by managing the financial assets on a fair value basis in order to  realise gains and losses as opposed to a business model in  which the objective is to collect contractual cash flows (FVTPL) • financial assets that fail the SPPI test (FVTPL), and • financial assets that have been designated to be measured at  fair value through profit or loss to eliminate or significantly  reduce an accounting mismatch (DFVTPL). Equity financial assets that are not held for active trading are  measured at FVTPL. Subsequent changes in fair value are  recognised as investment income within other operating income  and charges. Subsequent changes in the fair value of debt financial assets  measured at FVTPL are presented as follows: • changes in the fair value of financial assets that are classified  as HFT and financial assets managed on a fair value basis are  recognised in net trading income • changes in the fair value of debt financial investments and  loans to associates and joint ventures that fail SPPI are  recognised in investment income as part of other operating  income and charges • changes in the fair value of all other FVTPL and DFVTPL  financial assets are recognised as part of other income and  charges within other operating income and charges. Where applicable, the interest component of these financial assets  is recognised as interest and similar income. Reclassification of financial instruments The Consolidated Entity reclassifies debt financial assets when and  only when its business model for managing those assets changes.  Financial assets that are reclassified are subsequently measured  based on the financial asset’s new measurement category. The Consolidated Entity does not reclassify financial liabilities after  initial recognition. Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost,  unless they are either HFT, or have been designated to be  measured at FVTPL (DFVTPL). A financial liability may be  DFVTPL if: • such a designation eliminates or significantly reduces an  accounting mismatch that would otherwise have arisen • a group of financial liabilities, or financial assets and financial  liabilities, is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair  value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management  or investment strategy, or  ===== PAGE 281 ===== 281 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Directors’ Report Governance About Financial Report Note 44 Material accounting policies continued (vii) Financial instruments continued • the liability contains embedded derivatives which must  otherwise be separated and carried at fair value. All derivative financial liabilities are classified as HFT, except those  that are designated as hedging instruments in qualifying hedge  relationships and are classified as FVTPL. Refer to Note 44(x)  Derivative instruments and hedging activities for the detailed  hedge accounting policy. Changes in the fair value of financial liabilities that are not  classified as HFT, with the exception of changes relating to the  Consolidated Entity’s own credit risk, are recognised in net trading  income, or other income and charges as part of other operating  income and charges, depending on the nature of the underlying  transaction. Changes in fair value relating to changes in the  Consolidated Entity’s own credit risk are presented separately in  OCI and are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss. Where applicable, the interest component of these financial  liabilities is recognised as interest and similar expense. Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net  amount reported in the Statements of financial position, when  there is a current legally enforceable right to offset the amounts  and either there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise  the financial asset and settle the financial liability simultaneously. (viii) Cash collateral on securities borrowed and lent and  repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements As part of its trading, financing and liquidity management  activities, the Consolidated Entity borrows and lends securities,  commodities and other assets (the underlying) on a collateralised  basis. The underlying that is subject to the arrangement is not  derecognised from the Statements of financial position of the  relevant parties, as the risks and rewards of ownership remain with  the initial holder. These transactions include: • reverse repurchase transactions, where the Consolidated Entity  purchases an underlying under an agreement to resell • repurchase transactions, where the Consolidated Entity sells  an underlying under an agreement to repurchase. The Consolidated Entity continually reviews the fair values of the  underlying on which the above transactions are based and where  appropriate, requests or provides additional collateral to support  the transactions, in accordance with the terms of the  respective agreements. Reverse repurchase agreements are subsequently measured as  follows by the Consolidated Entity: • agreements that are collateralised with commodities are  measured at amortised cost when they are held in a business  model to collect contractual cash flows and AASB 9’s SPPI  criteria are met • agreements that are held within the Consolidated Entity’s cash  and liquid assets portfolio are measured at FVOCI as they are  held in a business model to both collect contractual cash flows  and with the intention to sell • all other reverse repurchase agreements are measured at  FVTPL to reflect the Consolidated Entity’s business model to  realise fair value gains and losses as opposed to a business  model in which the objective is to collect contractual  cash flows. Also refer to Note 37 Measurement categories of financial  instruments. Repurchase agreements are subsequently measured at amortised  cost, except where they are DFVTPL to eliminate an accounting  mismatch created by managing the agreements together with the  associated reverse repurchase agreements that are measured at FVTPL. (ix) Trading assets and liabilities Trading assets and liabilities are those assets and liabilities that  the Consolidated Entity acquires or incurs principally for the  purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term, or held as part  of a portfolio that is managed together with short-term profit or  position taking. The Consolidated Entity uses trade date accounting when  recording regular way purchases and sales of financial assets and  liabilities that are classified as HFT. At the date a purchase  transaction is entered into (trade date), the Consolidated Entity  recognises the resulting financial asset or liability and any  subsequent unrealised gain or loss arising from revaluing that  contract to fair value as part of net trading income, except for  interest income on HFT debt financial assets which is recognised in  interest income. Refer to Note 44(vii) Financial instruments. Trading assets (long positions) comprise financial instruments such  as debt and equity securities, bank bills, treasury notes, and loans,  commodity contracts and commodities purchased with the intent  of being actively traded either individually or as part of a portfolio. Trading liabilities comprise obligations to deliver assets (short  positions) across the same trading categories and which the  Consolidated Entity intends to actively trade. Commodity inventory is recognised when the Consolidated Entity  controls the commodity, the determination of which includes  consideration of price risk. Commodity inventory is measured at  fair value less costs to sell in accordance with the broker-trader  exemption, on the basis that such assets are held with the purpose  of selling in the near future and generating a profit from  fluctuations in price or broker traders’ margin. Commodity  contracts reflect agreements for the purchase and sale of  commodities where, despite the Consolidated Entity having  control over the commodity, the Consolidated Entity has no  intention to exercise its control, and where the expected outcome  is that the commodity will be sold back to the initial holder or sold  on to the intended acquirer (in the case of intermediary trades).  Such contracts are measured at FVTPL.  ===== PAGE 282 ===== 282 Notes to the financial statements  For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Note 44 Material accounting policies continued (ix) Trading assets and liabilities continued When the Consolidated Entity becomes party to a sale contract,  and the derecognition criteria are met (refer to Note 44(vii)  Financial instruments), it derecognises the trading asset or liability  and recognises a trade receivable or trade payable from trade date  until settlement date. (x) Derivative instruments and hedging activities Derivative instruments entered into by the Consolidated Entity  include futures, forwards and forward rate agreements, swaps and  options in the interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity, credit  and equity markets. These derivative instruments are principally  used by the Consolidated Entity for the purposes of risk  management of existing assets and liabilities and forecast  transactions and are also entered into for client trading purposes. Derivatives are recognised in the Statements of financial position  as an asset where they have a positive fair value at the reporting  date or as a liability where they have a negative fair value at the reporting date. Derivatives that may have both positive or negative values must  meet both the asset and liability derecognition tests before being  derecognised from the Statements of financial position. Fair values are obtained from quoted prices in active markets  where available, or valuation techniques including discounted cash  flow models and option pricing models, as appropriate. The  accounting for derivatives is subject to the application of the day 1  profit or loss policy as described in Note 44(vii) Financial  instruments). The Consolidated Entity applies trade date accounting to the  recognition and derecognition of derivative financial instruments. Hedge accounting As part of its ongoing business, the Consolidated Entity is exposed  to several financial risks, principally that of interest rate, foreign  exchange and commodity price risks (collectively referred to as the  hedged risk or exposure). The Consolidated Entity has limited  appetite for such risks and has policies and practices in place to  ensure that these risks are effectively managed. The Consolidated  Entity mitigates these risks through the use of derivative  financial instruments, and, in the case of foreign exchange risk,  foreign-denominated debt issued (collectively referred to as  hedging instruments). The Consolidated Entity applies hedge  accounting to manage accounting mismatches arising from the  difference in measurement bases or location of the gains and  losses recognised between the exposure that is being hedged and  the hedging instrument. Refer to details provided in the table on  the following page.  ===== PAGE 283 ===== 283 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Directors’ Report Governance About Financial Report Note 44 Material accounting policies continued (x) Derivative instruments and hedging activities continued 1 Fair value hedge Cash flow hedge Net investment hedge Nature of hedge The hedge of the change in fair value of a  recognised asset or liability. The hedge of the change in cash flows of a  financial asset or liability or a highly  probable forecast transaction. The hedge of changes in the Consolidated  Entity’s foreign denominated net assets  for changes in foreign currency rates. Nature of material  hedged risks • Interest rate risk • Foreign exchange risk • Commodity price risk. • Interest rate risk1 • Foreign exchange risk • Commodity price risk. • Foreign exchange risk. Material hedged items • Fixed interest rate financial assets and liabilities • Property, plant and equipment. • Floating interest rate financial assets  or liabilities • Highly probable forecast floating  interest rate financial assets and liabilities • Highly probable forecast foreign  currency payments and receipts • Highly probable forecast commodity sales • Foreign currency denominated interest  bearing financial liabilities. • Net investment in foreign operations. Material hedging  instruments • Interest rate swaps • Basis swaps • Cross currency swaps • Commodity derivatives • Foreign exchange forwards. • Interest rate swaps and options • Cross currency swaps • Foreign currency denominated  borrowings • Commodity derivatives. • Foreign exchange contracts • Foreign currency denominated issued debt. Designation and  documentation At inception of the hedge relationship, documentation is required of the risk management objective and strategy for the hedge, the  hedging instrument, hedged item, hedged risk and how the hedge relationship will meet the hedge effectiveness requirements. Hedge effectiveness  method All hedge relationships are assessed for prospective hedge effectiveness both at the inception of the hedge, at each reporting period  and following any significant change in circumstances affecting the hedge, by demonstrating that: • an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and the hedging instrument • credit risk does not dominate the changes in value of either the hedged item or the hedging instrument • the hedge ratio is reflective of the Consolidated Entity’s risk management approach. The hedge effectiveness assessment is performed by a combination of qualitative and, where applicable, quantitative assessments.  Changes in the hedge ratio, or rebalancing, may be required to adjust the designated quantities of either the hedged item or the hedging instrument. Accounting treatment  for the hedging  instrument Fair value through the income statement,  aligned to the presentation of the hedged item. Fair value through the cash flow hedge  reserve as part of OCI, and then recognised  in the income statement at the time at  which the hedged item affects the income  statement for the hedged risk. Foreign exchange gains and losses are  recognised in the Net Investment Hedge  Reserve (NIHR), a separate component of  FCTR in OCI. Accounting treatment  for the hedged item Adjustments to the carrying value are  recognised in the income statement for  changes in fair value attributable to the  hedged risk. Accounted for on an amortised cost basis,  FVOCI, or under other accounting  standards as appropriate (such as  executory contracts for the sale of  commodities). Foreign exchange gains and losses are  recognised in the Consolidated Entity’s  foreign currency translation reserve as  part of OCI. 1 The Company designates selected hedge accounting relationships that only meet the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting in the Company financial statements (but not the  Consolidated Entity).  ===== PAGE 284 ===== 284 Notes to the financial statements  For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Note 44 Material accounting policies continued (x) Derivative instruments and hedging activities continued Fair value hedge Cash flow hedge Net investment hedge Accounting treatment  for hedge  ineffectiveness Recognised as part of net trading income  in the income statement to the extent  that changes in fair value of the hedged  item attributable to the hedged risk are  not offset by changes in fair value of the  hedging instrument. Recognised as part of net trading income in the income statement to the extent to  which changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument exceed, in absolute terms,  the change in the fair value of the hedged item. Accounting treatment if  the hedge relationship  is discontinued Where the hedged item still exists and is a  financial instrument carried at amortised  cost, adjustments to the hedged item are  amortised to the income statement on an  EIR basis. For non-financial items, the  adjustment continues as part of the  carrying value of the asset up until it is  recovered through use or sale, or the item  becomes impaired. The gain or loss remains in the cash flow  hedge reserve to the extent that the  hedged cash flows are still expected to  take place and subsequently recognised in  the income statement at the time at which  the hedged item affects the income  statement for the hedged risk. Where the hedged cash flows are no  longer expected to take place, the gain or  loss in the cash flow hedge reserve is  recognised immediately in the  income statement. The exchange gains or losses recognised  in the NIHR within FCTR are reclassified to  the income statement or reattributed  within equity as follows: • if the hedge is discontinued due to a  disposal of the hedged foreign  operation, then the accumulated NIHR  is reclassified from OCI to investment  income within other operating income  and charges • if there is a partial disposal of a  foreign operation that is an associate  or joint arrangement, without loss of  significant influence or joint control,  then a proportionate share of the  accumulated NIHR is reclassified to  investment income • if there is a partial disposal of a  foreign operation that is a subsidiary,  without loss of control, then a  proportionate share of the  accumulated NIHR is reattributed  within equity to non-controlling  interests. Other  accounting policies Certain components of the hedging instrument such as the forward element of a forward contract, the time value of an option and  the foreign currency basis spread (being the liquidity charge for exchanging different currencies), may be excluded from the hedge  designation. These elements are deferred in the cost of hedging reserve and released to the income statement either at the time at  which the hedged exposure affects the income statement, or on a systematic basis over the life of the hedge.  ===== PAGE 285 ===== 285 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Directors’ Report Governance About Financial Report Note 44 Material accounting policies continued (xi) Margin money and settlement assets and liabilities Margin money and settlement assets and liabilities includes trade  settlement balances, margin monies and balances with clearing  houses. Margin monies primarily represent deposits placed with  clearing houses in relation to futures trading and other derivatives  transactions. The balance includes both initial and variation margin  which varies based on trading activities. The balance also includes  client margin calls which are funded by the Consolidated Entity.  Settlement balances represent outstanding trade timing balances  as at the reporting date due to the timing difference between  trade and settlement date. Balances are carried at amortised cost  except for certain margin money and certain settlement balances  which are carried at FVTPL. (xii) Financial investments Investment securities in this category include investments in  equity or debt securities which are not actively traded by the  Consolidated Entity. Debt investment securities in this category comprise liquid asset  holdings, bonds, money markets and other debt securities. Financial investments are initially recognised on trade date at fair  value (adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs for debt  investments subsequently measured at amortised cost or FVOCI)  and subsequently measured in accordance with Note 44(vii)  Financial instruments). (xiii) Loan assets This category includes loans that are not held for trading purposes  and typically includes the Consolidated Entity’s lending activities  to its customers. Loan assets are initially recognised on settlement date at fair value  (adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs for loan assets  subsequently measured at amortised cost or FVOCI) and  subsequently measured in accordance with Note 44(vii) Financial  instruments). Certain finance lease receivables are also presented as part of  asset financing within loan assets. For the detailed policy on  financial instruments, including treatment of derecognition, refer  to Note 44(vii) Financial instruments). (xiv) Property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost (which  includes, where applicable, directly attributable borrowing costs  and expenditure directly attributable to the acquisition of the  asset) less, accumulated depreciation and, where applicable,  accumulated impairment losses. Right-of-use (ROU) assets are initially measured at cost and  comprise of the amount that corresponds to the amount  recognised for the lease liability on initial recognition together  with any lease payments made at or before the commencement  date (less any lease incentives received), initial direct costs and  restoration-related costs. Subsequently, it is stated at historical  cost less accumulated depreciation and, where applicable,  impairment losses, and adjusted for remeasurement of lease  liabilities. Property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets includes  assets leased out under operating leases. Depreciation is the process to allocate the difference between  cost and residual values over the estimated useful life. Where the  residual value exceeds the carrying value, no depreciation is  charged. Depreciation is calculated on the following bases: • unit of production method for certain infrastructure assets • straight-line basis for all other assets. A ROU asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter  of the asset’s useful life and the lease term.  Annual depreciation rates are summarised below: Property, plant and equipment Depreciation rates Buildings 2.5 to 3.3% Furniture, fittings and leasehold improvements2 10 to 20% Infrastructure assets and equipment3 2.5 to 33% Aviation 4% Meters 5 to 55% Telecommunications 24 % Equipment and other operating lease assets 2.5 to 30% Useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed  annually and reassessed in the light of commercial and  technological developments. Gains and losses on disposal are  determined by comparing the proceeds with the asset’s carrying  amount and are recognised in other income as part of other  operating income and charges. The depreciation charge is recognised as part of: • net operating lease income for assets given on operating lease • occupancy expenses for corporate buildings, furniture, fittings  and leasehold improvements • non-salary technology expenses for technology assets • net trading income for depreciation relating to leased assets  held by trading-related businesses for the purpose of  facilitating trading activities • other operating expenses for all other assets. The Consolidated Entity does not recognise a ROU asset for  short-term or low value leases, instead the expense is recognised  over the lease term as appropriate as part of operating expenses. 2 Where remaining lease terms are less than five years, leasehold improvements are depreciated over the remaining lease term. 3 Includes infrastructure assets, for which depreciation is calculated on a unit of production basis.  ===== PAGE 286 ===== 286 Notes to the financial statements  For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Note 44 Material accounting policies continued (xv) Goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration, recognised  NCI, and the fair value of previously held equity interests over the  fair value of the identifiable net assets of the business acquired.  Goodwill arising from business combinations is included in  intangible assets. Other acquired identifiable intangible assets At the time at which the Consolidated Entity determines that it  has acquired a business, the Consolidated Entity identifies  intangible assets that are required to be initially recognised at fair  value. An intangible asset is considered to have an indefinite useful  life where it is expected to contribute to the Consolidated Entity’s  net cash inflows indefinitely. The following intangible assets are typically identified and  recognised by the Consolidated Entity: • licences and trading rights: generally carried at cost less  accumulated impairment loss. Where no contractual or legal  limitation exists, these assets are not amortised because they  are considered to have an indefinite useful life • management rights: carried at cost less accumulated  amortisation and accumulated impairment loss. Certain  management right intangible assets, which have indefinite  useful lives as the underlying income stream is related to the  management of funds that have no defined end date and are  expected to operate perpetually, are not amortised. For  management rights that have a finite useful life, amortisation is  calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost  of management rights over the estimated useful life usually  being a period not exceeding 20 years • customer and servicing contracts acquired with a finite useful  life: carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and  accumulated impairment loss. Amortisation is calculated over  the period for which the customer relationship is expected  to exist • customer and servicing contracts with an indefinite useful life:  carried at cost less accumulated impairment loss. Certain other intangible assets held for trading, including emission  certificates, are measured at fair value less costs to sell in  accordance with the broker-trader exemption (on the basis that  such assets are held with the purpose of selling in the near future  and generating a profit from fluctuations in price or broker  traders’ margin). Amortisation of intangible assets held by trading related business  is recorded in net trading income and for others is recognised in  other operating expenses. Impairments (reversal of impairments)  of intangible assets are recognised in other impairment charges/ reversal. Development expenditure Development expenditure is recognised as an asset when the  Consolidated Entity is able to demonstrate that the project is  technically feasible, it is probable the asset will generate future  economic benefits, the Consolidated Entity has the intention and  ability to complete the development of the project or sell it, and  the costs incurred can be reliably measured. All other costs are  expensed in the period incurred.  Software Certain internal and external costs directly incurred in acquiring  and developing certain computer software programmes are  capitalised and amortised over the estimated useful life, usually a  period of three to seven years on a straight-line basis. The  capitalised software asset is subject to impairment testing on an  annual basis. Costs incurred on the maintenance of software is expensed as  incurred and recognised in other operating expenses. (xvi) Deposits Deposits include customer deposits, business banking and home  loan related deposits, deposits from financial institutions and  other balances such as client monies. These deposits are initially  recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs  and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. (xvii) Other assets and liabilities Contract assets, contract liabilities and capitalised expenses  Where the Consolidated Entity provides services to clients and the  consideration is unconditional, a receivable is recognised. Where  the consideration is conditional on something other than the  passage of time, such as performance fees, these are recorded as  contract assets. Both receivables and contract assets are assessed  for impairment in accordance with AASB 9. Commodity-related  receivables are accounted for in accordance with Note (vii)  Financial Instruments. The Consolidated Entity, as permitted by AASB 15, has applied the  practical expedient that allows for costs incurred to obtain a  contract to be expensed as incurred where the amortisation period  for any asset recognised would be less than 12 months. The  Consolidated Entity also applies the practical expedient not to  adjust consideration for the effects of a significant financing  component, where the period between transferring a good or  service and when the customer pays for that good or service is  expected to be one year or less. Contract liabilities relate to prepayments received from  customers where the Consolidated Entity is yet to satisfy its  performance obligation.  ===== PAGE 287 ===== 287 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Directors’ Report Governance About Financial Report Note 44 Material accounting policies continued (xvii) Other assets and liabilities continued Non-current assets and liabilities of disposal groups classified as  held for sale This category includes non-current assets and disposal groups  (groups of assets and directly associated liabilities to be disposed  in a single transaction) for which the carrying amount will be  recovered principally through a sale or distribution transaction  rather than continuing use. This line includes assets and liabilities  of businesses and subsidiaries, investments in associates and joint  ventures, other assets and liabilities, and subsidiaries that are  acquired exclusively with a view to sell or distribute. These assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale  when they are available for immediate sale in their present  condition, the sale or distribution is highly probable and is  expected to occur within 12 months. Where there is a planned  partial disposal of a subsidiary resulting in loss of control, but the  Consolidated Entity retains an interest in the disposed subsidiary,  the entire disposal group is classified as held for sale. Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale  are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value  less costs to sell. Equity accounting, depreciation and amortisation  is suspended when the held for sale criteria are met. An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent  write down of the asset to fair value less costs to sell and is  recognised in other impairment charges/reversal. A gain is  recognised for any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to  sell, limited to the cumulative impairment loss previously  recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of  sale is recognised at the date of sale. Financial assets and liabilities that are classified as held for sale are  measured in accordance with the Consolidated Entity’s financial  instruments’ policies. Provisions, contingent liabilities and commitments A provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount. Provisions  are recognised when it is probable that an outflow of economic  benefits will be required to settle a present legal or constructive  obligation that has arisen as a result of past events and for which a  reliable estimate can be made. Contingent liabilities are either possible obligations whose  existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events not  wholly within the control of the Consolidated Entity, or are present  obligations where an outflow of economic resources is not  probable or cannot be reliably measured. Contingent liabilities are  not recognised on the balance sheet but are disclosed unless an  outflow of economic resources is remote. Contingent liabilities  generally include performance-related contingents and certain  types of letters of credit and guarantees. Credit related commitments are the Consolidated Entity's firm  commitments to provide credit facilities under pre-specified terms  and conditions. These generally include loan commitments,  financial guarantee contracts and certain types of letters of credit.  Such contracts are recognised in the Statements of financial  position only when drawn upon, and may expire without being  called. Credit related commitments are subject to expected credit  loss requirements disclosed in Note 13 Expected Credit Loss. Contingent liabilities and commitments are disclosed in Note 33  Contingent liabilities and commitments. Employee benefit provisions Employee benefit provisions are recognised by the Consolidated  Entity as and when the service has been rendered after deducting  amounts already paid. The Consolidated Entity accrues for costs  arising under applicable staff carry plans based on the expected  cash outflows. Liabilities for unpaid salaries, salary-related costs and provisions  for annual leave are recorded in the Statements of financial  position at the salary rates which are expected to be paid when the  liability is settled. Provisions for long service leave and other long- term benefits are recognised at the present value of expected  future payments to be made. In determining this amount, consideration is given to expected  future salary levels and employee service histories. Expected  future payments are discounted to their net present value using  discount rates on high quality corporate bonds, except where  there is no deep market, in which case rates on Government  securities are used. Such discount rates have terms that match as  closely as possible the expected future cash flows. Provisions for unpaid employee benefits are derecognised when  the benefit is settled or is transferred to another entity and the  Company and Consolidated Entity are legally released from the  obligation and do not retain a constructive obligation. Dividends Where a dividend is determined or resolved by the Company’s  Board of Directors, consideration is given to the record date when  determining the date on which the provision for the dividend is  recognised in the Statements of financial position as a liability,  with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings.  ===== PAGE 288 ===== 288 Notes to the financial statements  For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Note 44 Material accounting policies continued (xviii) Borrowings Borrowings include loans and other payables to banks and financial  and non-financial institutions. These balances are:  • initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable  transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised  cost, or  • when DFVTPL, initially recognised and subsequently measured  at fair value. (xix) Due to/from subsidiaries Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries principally  arise from the provision of lending arrangements, acceptance of  funds on deposit, intercompany services and transactions and the  provision of financial guarantees. Intercompany services and  transactions are accounted for in accordance with Note 44(iv)  Revenue and expense recognition where they are transacted in a  principal capacity. Financial assets, financial liabilities and financial  guarantee contracts are accounted for in accordance with  Note 44(vii) Financial instruments. Financial assets and financial  liabilities are presented net where the offsetting requirements are  met, such that the net amount is reported in the Statements of  financial position. (xx) Debt issued Debt issued includes debt securities issued by the Consolidated  Entity. These balances are:  • initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable  transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised  cost, or  • when DFVTPL, initially recognised and subsequently measured  at fair value in accordance with the Consolidated Entity’s  accounting policy for financial instruments, refer to Note 44(vii)  Financial instruments. (xxi) Loan capital Loan capital represents issued debt with terms and conditions that  qualify for inclusion as capital under Australian Prudential  Regulation Authority (APRA) Standards. Capital instruments are first assessed to determine whether the  Consolidated Entity is required to deliver cash or another financial  asset on the occurrence of a contingent event that is considered  genuine and beyond the control of both the issuer and the holder  (such as Common Equity Tier 1 Trigger Events or Non-Viability  Trigger Events). Where such a contingent event exists, then the  Consolidated Entity does not have the unconditional right to avoid  delivering cash or another financial asset and the capital  instrument is classified as a financial liability. The financial liability  is initially measured at fair value plus directly attributable  transaction costs and is subsequently measured at amortised cost. For compound instruments that have both equity and liability  features, the liability component is initially measured at fair value  plus directly attributable transaction costs (and is thereafter  measured at amortised cost using the EIR method), with the  residual being accounted for within the Consolidated Entity’s  equity. (xxii) Impairment Expected credit losses The ECL requirements apply to financial assets measured at  amortised cost or FVOCI, lease receivables, amounts receivable  from contracts with customers, loan commitments, certain letters  of credit and financial guarantee contracts issued that are not  DFVTPL. The Consolidated Entity applies a three-stage approach  to measuring the ECL based on changes in the financial asset’s  underlying credit risk and includes forward looking information  (FLI). ECL is measured as the product of probability of default (PD), the  loss given default (LGD) and the exposure at default (EAD). The  calculation of ECL requires judgement and the choice of inputs,  estimates and assumptions. Refer to Note 13 Expected credit  losses for further information. Outcomes within the next financial  period that are different from management’s assumptions and  estimates could result in changes to the timing and amount of ECL  to be recognised. The ECL is determined with reference to the following stages: (i) Stage I—12 month ECL At initial recognition, and for financial assets for which there has  not been a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial  recognition, ECL is determined based on the probability of default  (PD) over the next 12 months adjusted for FLI. Stage I also includes  financial assets where the credit risk has improved and has been  reclassified from Stage II. (ii) Stage II—Not credit-impaired When there has been a SICR since initial recognition, the ECL is  determined with reference to the financial asset’s lifetime PD  adjusted for FLI. The Consolidated Entity exercises judgement in  determining whether there has been a SICR since initial recognition  based on qualitative, quantitative, and reasonable and supportable  information that includes FLI. Detail on the Consolidated Entity’s  process to determine whether there has been a SICR is provided in  Note 13 Expected credit losses. Use of alternative criteria could result in significant changes to the  timing and amount of ECL to be recognised. Lifetime ECL is  generally determined based upon the contractual maturity  adjusted, where appropriate, for prepayments, extension, call and  similar options, of the financial asset. For revolving facilities, the  Consolidated Entity exercises judgement based on the behavioural,  rather than contractual characteristics of the facility type. Stage II  may include financial assets where the credit risk has improved  and has been reclassified from Stage III.  ===== PAGE 289 ===== 289 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Directors’ Report Governance About Financial Report Note 44 Material accounting policies continued (xxii) Impairment continued (iii) Stage III—Credit-impaired Financial assets are classified as Stage III where they are  determined to be credit impaired, which generally matches the  APRA definition of default. This includes exposures that are at  least 90 days past due and where the obligor is unlikely to pay  without recourse against available collateral. The ECL for credit impaired financial assets is generally measured  as the difference between the contractual and expected cash  flows from the individual exposure, discounted using the EIR for  that exposure.  Presentation of ECL allowances The ECL allowances are presented in the Statements of financial  position as follows: • loan assets, loans to related body corporate entities and  subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures measured at  amortised cost – as a deduction to the gross carrying amount • loan assets, loans to associates and joint ventures, and debt  financial investments measured at FVOCI – as a reduction in the  FVOCI reserve within equity. The carrying amount of the asset  is not adjusted as it is measured at fair value • lease receivables, contract receivables and other assets  measured at amortised cost – as a deduction to the gross  carrying amount • undrawn credit commitments and financial guarantees issued  (not measured at FVTPL) – as a provision included in other  liabilities. When the Consolidated Entity concludes that there is no  reasonable expectation of recovering cash flows from the financial  asset, and all possible collateral has been realised, the financial  asset is written off, either partially or in full, against the related  provision. Recoveries of loans previously written off are recorded  based on the cash received. Impairment of interests in associates and joint ventures The Consolidated Entity performs an assessment at each reporting  date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that its  interests in associates or joint ventures are impaired. The main  indicators of impairment are significant changes with an adverse  effect that have taken place in the technological market, economic  or legal environment and a significant or prolonged decline in fair  value below cost. In making this judgement, the Consolidated Entity evaluates,  among other factors, the normal volatility in share price and the  period of time for which fair value has been below cost. If there is  an indication that an investment in an associate or joint venture  may be impaired, then the entire carrying amount of the  investment in the associate or joint venture is tested for  impairment by comparing the recoverable amount, being the  higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use, with its  carrying amount. Impairment losses recognised in the income statement for  investments in associates and joint ventures are subsequently  reversed through the income statement if there has been a change  in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount since  the impairment loss was recognised. The impairment losses  (reversal of impairments) on investments in associates and joint  ventures are recognised in the income statement as part of other  impairment charges/reversal. Fair value less costs to sell is estimated using market-based  approaches using revenues, earnings and assets under  management and multiples based on companies deemed  comparable as well as other publicly available information relevant  to the business. Value-in-use is calculated using pre-tax cashflow projections of  operating revenue and expenses. Forecasts are extrapolated using  a growth rate and discounted using a pre-tax discount rate  incorporating market risk determinants, adjusted for specific risks  related to the cash generating units, if any, and the environment in  which it operates. Impairment of investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries in the Company’s financial statements  are reviewed annually for indicators of impairment or more  frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the  carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment is  recognised in other impairment charges/reversal, for the amount  by which the investment’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable  amount, being the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value- in-use. At each reporting date, investments in subsidiaries that  have been impaired are reviewed for possible reversal of  impairment. The amount of any reversal of impairment recognised  must not cause the investment’s carrying value to exceed its  original cost. Impairment of other non-financial assets including  cash-generating units Intangible assets with indefinite lives (goodwill and certain  intangible assets) are not subject to amortisation but are tested  annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in  circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not  be recoverable. For intangible assets that have a finite useful life and property,  plant and equipment and ROU assets, an assessment is made at  each reporting date for indications of impairment. Impairment losses are recognised in other impairment charges as  part of other operating income and charges for the amount by  which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.  The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s fair value less  costs to sell and value-in-use.  ===== PAGE 290 ===== 290 Notes to the financial statements  For the financial year ended 31 March 2024 continued Note 44 Material accounting policies continued (xxii) Impairment continued For the purposes of assessing impairment, non-financial assets are  grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately  identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash  inflows from other assets or groups of assets (cash-generating  units). Intangible assets (other than goodwill) for which an  impairment loss has been recognised are reviewed for possible  reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. A reversal is  recognised only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount  does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been  determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment  loss had been recognised for the asset in prior years. (xxiii) Performance based remuneration Employee equity participation The Consolidated Entity operates share-based compensation  plans, which include awards (including those delivered through the  Macquarie Group Employee Retained Equity Plan (MEREP)) granted  to employees under share acquisition plans. Information relating  to these schemes is set out in Note 32 Employee equity  participation. The Consolidated Entity accounts for its share-based payments as  follows: Equity settled awards: The awards are measured at their grant  date fair value and based on the number of equity instruments  expected to vest. Expenses are recognised as part of employment  expenses with a corresponding increase in equity with reference to  the vesting period of those awards. Performance hurdles attached  to Performance Share Units (PSUs) under the MEREP are not taken  into account when determining the fair value of the PSUs at the  grant date. Instead, these vesting conditions are taken into  account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected  to vest. For the Company, the accounting is dependent on whether  the Company is compensated for its obligations under the MEREP  award. To the extent that employing subsidiaries compensate the  Company for the MEREP offered to their employees, a recharge  liability due to subsidiaries is recognised by the Company at grant  date representing the payment received in advance of the award  being settled. This liability reduces over the vesting period with a  corresponding increase in the share-based payments reserve.  MEREP liabilities are recognised and disclosed in Note 30 Related  party information. To the extent that employing subsidiaries do  not compensate the Company for the MEREP offered to their  employees’, the Company reflects the provision of the equity  settled award as a contribution to its subsidiary and as a result  increases its investment in the subsidiary with a corresponding  increase in the share-based payments reserve. On vesting,  amounts recognised in the share-based payments reserve are  transferred to contributed equity. Cash settled awards: The awards are measured at their grant  date fair value and based on the number of instruments expected  to vest. Expenses are recognised as part of employment expenses  with reference to vesting period of those awards which are settled  in cash. The award liability is measured with reference to the  number of awards and the fair value of those awards at each  reporting date. Changes in the fair value of the liability are  recognised in employment expenses.  Profit share remuneration The Consolidated Entity recognises a liability and an expense for  profit share remuneration to be paid in cash with reference to the  performance period to which the profit share relates. (xxiv) Leases At the inception of a contract, the Consolidated Entity assesses  whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. At inception, or on  reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the  Consolidated Entity allocates the consideration in the contract to  each lease component unless an election is made to account for  the lease and non lease components as a single lease component. (i) Accounting where the Consolidated Entity is the lessee The Consolidated Entity leases office premises, commodity  storage facilities, technology and other equipment for which  contracts are typically entered into for fixed periods of 12 months  to 15 years and may include extension options. Leases are  recognised as an ROU asset (as explained in Note 44(xiv) Property,  plant and equipment and right-of-use assets) and a corresponding  liability at the commencement date, being the date the leased  asset is available for use by the Consolidated Entity. Lease liability Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the  future lease payments at the commencement date, discounted  using the interest rate implicit in the lease (or if that rate cannot  be readily determined, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate).  Lease payments are allocated between principal and interest  expense. Interest expense is, unless capitalised on a qualifying asset which is  not measured at fair value, recognised as part of interest and  similar expense over the lease period on the remaining lease  liability balance for each period. Any variable lease payments not  included in the measurement of the lease liability are also  recognised in the income statement in the period in which the  event or condition that triggers those payments occurs. Lease liabilities are remeasured when there is a change in future  lease payments arising from a change in lease term, an assessment  of an option to purchase the underlying asset, an index or rate, or  a change in the estimated amount payable under a residual  value guarantee. When the lease liability is remeasured, a corresponding adjustment  is made to the carrying value of the ROU asset, or, in the income  statement, where the carrying value of the ROU asset has been  reduced to zero.  ===== PAGE 291 ===== 291 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Directors’ Report Governance About Financial Report Note 44 Material accounting policies continued (xxiv) Leases continued Presentation The Consolidated Entity presents ROU assets in Property, plant  and equipment and right-of-use assets (refer to Note 15) and lease  liabilities in Other liabilities (refer to Note 23) in the Statements of  financial position. (ii) Accounting where the Consolidated Entity is a lessor Leases where the lessee has substantially all the risks and rewards  incidental to ownership of the leased assets are classified as  finance leases. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Finance lease Where finance leases are granted to third parties, the present  value of the minimum lease payments plus an estimate of the  value of any unguaranteed residual value is recognised as a  receivable and included in loan assets. Interest income is recognised over the term of the lease using the  EIR method, which reflects a constant rate of return. Finance lease  income is presented within interest and similar income in the  income statement. Operating lease Where the Consolidated Entity is the lessor under an operating  lease, the underlying asset is carried at cost and depreciated over  its useful life in accordance with the rates specified in Note 44(xiv)  Property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets. Operating  lease income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period  of the lease unless another systematic basis is more appropriate.  Assets leased out under operating leases are included in property,  plant and equipment and right of-use assets. Certain right-of-use  assets are disclosed as investment property, as applicable. When the Consolidated Entity is an intermediate lessor, it  accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub lease  separately. The lease classification of the sublease is determined  with reference to the ROU asset arising from the head lease. (xxv) Contributed equity Ordinary shares and other similar instruments are classified as  equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new  shares are recorded in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the  issue proceeds. If the Consolidated Entity reacquires its own equity instruments,  those instruments (treasury shares) are recorded at cost and  deducted from contributed equity. In cases where treasury shares  are acquired and held by the Consolidated Entity, the  consideration paid, including any directly attributable transactions  costs net of tax, is deducted from contributed equity. Where the  instruments are no longer held as treasury shares, any net  consideration received is included in contributed equity, after  deducting directly attributable transaction costs net of tax. (xxvi) Fiduciary assets and client money The Consolidated Entity engages in trust, fund or other fiduciary  activities as well as certain brokerage and other trading-related  activities that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf of  third parties. Where such assets are controlled, and future  economic benefits are expected to be realised by the Consolidated  Entity, such assets and the income thereon are reflected in the  Statements of financial position and income statement  respectively. Where this is not the case, these assets and the income thereon  are excluded from the Consolidated Entity’s financial statements  as they are not the assets of the Consolidated Entity. Fee income  earned by the Consolidated Entity relating to its responsibilities  from fiduciary and brokerage and other trading-related activities is  included as part of fee and commission income. (xxvii) Cash and bank balances Cash and bank balances includes currency on hand, demand  deposits and short-term balances with Central and other banks  including unallocated precious metal balances. These balances are  subsequently measured at amortised cost except unallocated  precious metals which are held at FVTPL. (xxviii) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise of cash and bank balances  (except unallocated precious metal balances) as well as certain  liquid financial investments and non trading reverse repurchase  agreements that have a contractual maturity of three months or  less from the date of acquisition and which are readily convertible  to known amounts of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of  changes in value, and are available to meet the Consolidated  Entity’s short-term cash commitments. Cash and cash equivalents  exclude margin money balances, trading assets and certain  client-related balances which are segregated from the  Consolidated Entity’s own funds and are thus restricted from use. (xxix) Investment property Investment properties are initially recognised at cost and  subsequently stated at fair value at each reporting date. Any  change in fair value, in addition to any lease income generated,  is recognised in other income as part of other operating income  and charges. (xxx) Comparatives Where necessary, comparative information has been re-presented  to conform to changes in presentation in the current year. (xxxi) Rounding of amounts In accordance with ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/ Directors’ Reports) Instrument 2016/191, amounts in the  Directors’ Report and Financial Report have been rounded off to  the nearest million Australian dollars unless otherwise indicated.  ===== PAGE 292 ===== 292 Directors’ declaration  Macquarie Group Limited In the Directors’ opinion: (a) the financial statements and notes set out on pages 161 to 291  are in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)  including: (i) complying with Australian Accounting Standards, and (ii) giving a true and fair view of the Company’s and the  Consolidated Entity’s financial positions as at 31 March  2024 and their performance for the financial year ended  on that date, and (b) there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Company will  be able to pay its debts as and when they become due and  payable.

What we have audited The Consolidated Entity and Company financial report comprises: • the Consolidated and Company statements of financial position  as at 31 March 2024 • the Consolidated and Company statements of comprehensive  income for the year then ended • the Consolidated and Company statements of changes in  equity for the year then ended • the Consolidated and Company statements of cash flows for  the year then ended • the Consolidated and Company income statements for the year  then ended • the notes to the financial statements, including material  accounting policy information and other explanatory  information • the directors’ declaration. Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing  Standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are further  described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the  financial report section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient  and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Independence We are independent of the Company and the Consolidated Entity  in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the  Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and the ethical requirements of the  Accounting Professional & Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110  Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including  Independence Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our audit  of the financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other  ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. Our audit approach for the Consolidated Entity An audit is designed to provide reasonable assurance about  whether the financial report is free from material misstatement.  Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are  considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could  reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of  users taken on the basis of the financial report. We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed  enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial report  as a whole, taking into account the geographic and management  structure of the Consolidated Entity, its accounting processes and  controls and the industry in which it operates. The Consolidated Entity is structured into four Operating Groups  and a Corporate segment, which includes Group Treasury. It  undertakes operational activities that are important to the  financial reporting process in multiple locations overseas, including  sites in Gurugram in India, Jacksonville in the United States of  America and Manila in the Philippines.  ===== PAGE 294 ===== 294 Independent auditor’s report  To the members of Macquarie Group Limited continued Consolidated Entity Audit scope Key audit matters Our audit focused on where the Consolidated Entity made subjective  judgements; for example, significant accounting estimates involving  assumptions and inherently uncertain future events. We aligned our audit to the Consolidated Entity's structure by instructing a  component audit team for each of the four Operating Groups, Group Treasury  and the remainder of the Corporate segment. These component audit teams,  in consultation with the group audit team, established an audit strategy  tailored for each Operating Group, Group Treasury and the Corporate segment.  Given the extent of the overseas operations of the Consolidated Entity, the  component audit teams instructed a number of other member firms of the  PwC global network to perform audit procedures. The group audit team  determined the level of supervision and direction needed over the audit work  performed by component audit teams, including the component audit teams'  review and supervision of the overseas audit teams they, in turn, instructed.  The work performed by the component audit teams, together with additional  audit procedures performed by the group audit team, such as procedures over  the Consolidated Entity's consolidation and the financial report disclosures,  provided us with the evidence we needed for our opinion on the Consolidated  Entity's financial report as a whole. Amongst other relevant topics, we communicated the following key audit  matters to the Board Audit Committee: • Provision for expected credit losses on loan assets • Valuation of complex or illiquid financial instruments carried at fair value  through profit and loss which are based on significant unobservable inputs  (level 3 financial instruments) • Valuation of interests in associates and joint ventures • IT systems and controls over financial reporting • Estimation of tax payable relating to tax uncertainties • Recognition of performance fees and fee income. These are further described in the Key audit matters section of our report.  ===== PAGE 295 ===== 295 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Directors’ Report Governance About Financial Report Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report for the  current period. The key audit matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion  thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Further, any commentary on the outcomes of a particular audit procedure  is made in that context. The key audit matters identified below relate only to the audit of the Consolidated Entity, unless otherwise noted. Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Provision for expected credit losses on loan assets (Refer to Note 13) Under the credit impairment model required by AASB 9: Financial  Instruments (AASB 9), losses are recognised on an Expected Credit  Loss (ECL) basis. ECLs are required to incorporate forward-looking  information, reflecting the Consolidated Entity’s view of potential  future economic scenarios. The level of estimation uncertainty and judgement has remained  high during the year ended 31 March 2024 as a result of  uncertainties in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment  and persistently high levels of inflation in some territories, as well  as developments in the economy more broadly. In order to meet the ECL requirements of AASB 9, the  Consolidated Entity has developed models that involve judgement  including determining assumptions such as defining a significant  increase in credit risk (SICR). The ECL models of the Consolidated  Entity rely on numerous data elements and certain post model  overlays are applied based on the Consolidated Entity’s judgement.  Given the extent of judgement involved, we consider this to be a  key audit matter. Our procedures included assessing the design and testing the operating effectiveness of  certain controls supporting the Consolidated Entity’s estimate of the ECL including  controls relating to: • review, challenge and approval of certain forward-looking macroeconomic assumptions  and scenario weightings, including specifically the consideration of impacts of rising  inflation and interest rates • monitoring the effectiveness of models used to support ECL estimates, and the  validation of new and revised models  • assessing the credit quality of counterparties • accuracy of certain critical data elements used in key ECL models, and • review and challenge forums to assess the ECL output and post model overlays. In addition to controls testing, we performed substantive procedures including: • together with PwC credit modelling experts, assessing the appropriateness of relevant  conclusions reached by the Consolidated Entity from monitoring performed on key  models. This included assessing key model components such as SICR and reperforming  certain tests carried out as part of the model monitoring • together with PwC credit modelling experts, testing the appropriateness of a selection  of changes to key models • together with PwC credit modelling experts, assessing whether the list of critical data  elements identified by the Consolidated Entity was appropriate for key models • together with PwC economics experts, assessing the appropriateness of relevant  macroeconomic scenarios and certain forward-looking economic data developed by the  Consolidated Entity • testing the completeness and accuracy of certain critical data elements used in key ECL  models • assessing a selection of post model overlays identified by the Consolidated Entity,  including developing an understanding of the methodology used for overlay derivation  and testing the underlying datasets used for the calculations, and • considering the impacts on the ECL events occurring subsequent to balance date. For credit impaired loan (stage III) provisions, we examined a sample of individual loan  exposures to consider the appropriateness of provisions recognised. We assessed the reasonableness of the Consolidated Entity’s disclosures in the financial  report against the Australian Accounting Standards.  ===== PAGE 296 ===== 296 Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Valuation of complex or illiquid financial instruments carried at fair value through profit and loss which are based on significant unobservable inputs  (level 3 financial instruments) (Refer to Note 38) The Consolidated Entity exercises judgement in valuing certain  financial assets and liabilities at fair value where there are  significant unobservable inputs for the valuation of these assets  and liabilities. These assets and liabilities are known as Level 3  financial instruments. For the Consolidated Entity, these Level 3 financial instruments  predominantly consist of derivative financial instruments, trading  assets, financial investments and loan assets. Judgement is  required in estimating the fair value of these financial instruments  in determining appropriate models, assumptions and inputs. Given the extent of judgement involved in valuing these Level 3  financial instruments, we considered this to be a key audit matter. Our procedures included assessing the design and testing the operating effectiveness of  certain controls relating to Level 3 financial instruments, including controls over: • approval and validation of the models adopted • accuracy of inputs to models • the price verification process performed by the Consolidated Entity using prices and  model inputs sourced from third parties • calculation and approval of key valuation adjustments, and • governance, review and challenge forums. Together with PwC valuation experts, we tested the Consolidated Entity’s estimate for a  sample of level 3 derivative financial instruments and trading assets. We considered a  sample of collateral disputes, gains and losses on disposals and other events to help assess  the reasonableness of the valuations. We tested a sample of valuation adjustments at  period end, including evaluating the methodology applied and underlying assumptions. For a sample of level 3 financial investments and loan assets, together with PwC valuation  experts, we assessed the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies applied, as well  as the appropriateness of significant inputs used such as forecasts and comparable market  information. We assessed the reasonableness of the Consolidated Entity’s disclosures in the financial  report against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards. Valuation of interests in associates and joint ventures (Refer to Note 14) In accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, interests in  associates and joint ventures need to be assessed by the  Consolidated Entity for indicators of impairment or reversal of  impairment at the reporting date. If indicators of impairment or  reversal of impairment exist, the recoverable amount for each  asset needs to be estimated. These assessments involve  significant judgements such as estimating future cash flows,  discount rates applied to future cash flows and evaluating fair  value less costs to sell. Given the financial significance of the Consolidated Entity’s  recorded interests in associates and joint ventures, and the  judgement and subjectivity involved in determining assumptions,  we considered this to be a key audit matter. We evaluated the Consolidated Entity’s valuation methodologies used to estimate the  recoverable amount of a sample of interests in associates and joint ventures and the  process by which they were developed. Assisted where relevant by PwC Valuation experts,  for a sample of interests in associates and joint ventures, our procedures included: • evaluating the Consolidated Entity’s assessment of whether there were any indicators  of impairment or whether impairment losses recognised in prior periods should be  reversed • evaluating the appropriateness of the impairment assessment methodology and  significant assumptions applied in calculating the recoverable amount, where indicators  of impairment or reversal of impairment have been identified • comparing previous cashflow forecasts to actual results, or comparing previous net  asset values to underlying investment values, to assess the ability of the Consolidated  Entity to forecast accurately • assessing the appropriateness of discount rates used in valuations • assessing certain underlying data used in determining the carrying value and  recoverable amount, and • testing the mathematical accuracy of the Consolidated Entity’s discounted cashflow  models which were used to determine the recoverable amount of the asset. We assessed the reasonableness of the Consolidated Entity’s disclosures in the financial  report against the requirements of the Australian Accounting Standards. Independent auditor’s report  To the members of Macquarie Group Limited continued  ===== PAGE 297 ===== 297 Macquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries 2024 Annual Report Further Information Directors’ Report Governance About Financial Report Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter IT systems and controls over financial reporting (Consolidated Entity and Company) The Consolidated Entity's and Company’s operations and financial  reporting processes are heavily dependent on IT systems for the  processing and recording of a significant volume of transactions. A fundamental component of these IT systems and controls is  ensuring that risks in relation to inappropriate user access  management, unauthorised program changes and IT operating  protocols are managed. Due to this, we consider the operation of IT systems and controls  over financial reporting to be a key audit matter. For material financial statement balances we developed an understanding of the business  processes, IT systems used to generate and support those balances and associated IT  application controls and IT dependencies in manual controls. Our procedures included  evaluating the design and, where relevant, testing the operating effectiveness of certain  controls over the continued integrity of the IT systems that are relevant to financial  reporting. This involved assessing, where relevant to the audit: • change management: the processes and controls used to develop, test and authorise  changes to the functionality and configurations within systems • system development: the project disciplines which ensure that significant  developments or implementations are appropriately tested before implementation and  that data is migrated/converted and transferred completely and accurately • security: the access controls designed to enforce segregation of duties, govern the use  of generic and privileged accounts or ensure that data is only changed through  authorised means, and • IT operations: the controls over operations are used to ensure that any issues that arise  are managed appropriately. Within the scope of our audit where technology services are provided by a third party, we  obtained assurance through independent testing or, where available, considered assurance  reports from the third party’s auditor on the design and operating effectiveness of relevant  controls for the reporting period. We also carried out tests, on a sample basis, of IT application controls and IT dependencies  in manual controls that were key to our audit testing in order to assess the accuracy of  certain system calculations, the generation of certain reports and the operation of certain  system enforced access controls. Where we identified design or operating effectiveness matters relating to IT systems or  application controls relevant to our audit, we performed alternative or additional audit  procedures, which included considering mitigating controls in order to respond to the  impact on our overall audit approach. Estimation of tax payable relating to tax uncertainties (Refer to Note 23) The Consolidated Entity is subject to taxation in a number of  jurisdictions. The assessment of the amounts expected to be paid  to tax authorities is considered initially by the Consolidated Entity  in each local territory, and then reviewed centrally, with  consideration given to particular tax positions in certain  jurisdictions.  In some cases, the treatment of tax positions requires judgement  to estimate the ultimate amounts of tax that will be paid, which  resulted in this being considered a key audit matter. Our procedures included evaluating the analysis conducted by the Consolidated Entity  which sets out the basis for judgements made in respect of the ultimate amounts expected  to be paid to tax authorities. Assisted by PwC tax experts, we read a risk focused selection of correspondence with tax  authorities and external advice obtained by the Consolidated Entity and used our  understanding of the business to assess the completeness and quantum of the provisions  for tax. We considered the likelihood of additional tax exposures occurring based on our  knowledge of tax legislation, applicable precedent and industry developments, noting the  level of judgement involved. We assessed the reasonableness of the Consolidated Entity’s disclosures in the financial  report against the requirements of the Australian Accounting Standards. Recognition of performance fees and fee income (Refer to Note 2) In some cases, judgement is required by the Consolidated Entity to  estimate the timing and amount of fee income and performance  fees recognised in accordance with the requirements of Australian  Accounting Standards. Given the extent of the judgement involved, we considered this to  be a key audit matter. Our audit procedures included evaluating the design of relevant controls relating to the  recognition and measurement of fee income and performance fees. In assessing the appropriateness of the recognition of fee income and performance fees,  we tested the Consolidated Entity’s estimate for a sample of fee income based on relevant  information in supporting documents including contracts, fund constitutions and  management agreements. Specifically for performance fees, we also considered the nature of the underlying fund  assets, the proportion of assets already realised, the returns on the assets realised to date  and the potential for volatility in the valuation of the remaining unrealised assets. We assessed the reasonableness of the Consolidated Entity’s disclosures in the financial  report against the requirements of the Australian Accounting Standards.  ===== PAGE 298 ===== 298 Independent auditor’s report  To the members of Macquarie Group Limited continued Other information The directors are responsible for the other information. The other  information comprises the information included in the annual  report for the year ended 31 March 2024, but does not include the  financial report and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other  information and accordingly we do not express any form of  assurance conclusion thereon through our opinion on the financial  report. We have issued a separate opinion on the remuneration  report. In connection with our audit of the financial report, our  responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,  consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent  with the financial report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or  otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information  that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we  conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other  information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing  to report in this regard. Responsibilities of the directors for the financial report The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation  of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance  with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act  2001 (Cth) and for such internal control as the directors determine  is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that  gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for  assessing the ability of the Company and the Consolidated Entity  to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters  related to going concern and using the going concern basis of  accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the  Company or the Consolidated Entity or to cease operations, or  have no realistic alternative but to do so. Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial  report Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that  includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of  assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in  accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always  detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can  arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually  or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to  influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the  financial report.

This includes the  Acorn project, part of the Scottish Cluster,  which will capture CO2 emissions from  one of Scotland’s largest manufacturing  sites at Grangemouth (pictured), among  others, and transport them to permanent  geological storage under the North Sea.  ===== PAGE 5 ===== 2 Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report Strategy Risk Management  Appendices About this Report Governance Metrics & Targets Foreword from   Macquarie’s CEO Foreword from Macquarie’s CEO Earlier this year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  noted that “human-caused climate change is already affecting many  weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe.”(1)  With the world still well short of meeting its net zero emissions  by 2050 goal, addressing this collective challenge will require  unprecedented collaboration across all levels of society, and across  the world’s regions. Given the magnitude of the economic restructuring required,  governments will need to play a leading role. Encouragingly, we have  seen an intensification of efforts over the past year. In the United  States the Inflation Reduction Act has seen clean energy investment  increase dramatically, while the European Union continues to roll  out the “Green New Deal”, and China has significantly increased  its spending on clean energy solutions. The Australian Parliament  also passed a law supporting the Government’s 2030 43 per cent  emission reduction target, against which various supporting  initiatives have picked up momentum. The corporate sector also has a role to play. At Macquarie, our  response is rooted in our organisational purpose – to empower  people to innovate and invest for a better future. Our teams  continue to explore ways to facilitate the reduction of greenhouse  gas emissions. However, with temperatures already well above  pre-industrial levels and annual global emissions yet to fall, we  are also focused on the urgent need for increased spending on  climate adaptation. In this, our second Net Zero and Climate Risk Report, we provide a  progress update on our Group net zero commitments, as a member  of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, and as a supporter of the Task  Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. For an overview  of progress towards Macquarie Asset Management’s climate  commitments, see the FY2023 Sustainability Report.  I’m pleased to report that we are on track to meet our FY2025  net zero emissions target for our own business operations.(2) We  are also on track to meet our financed emissions target in the  coal sector by next year, and have made progress towards our  2030 interim financed emissions targets for the oil/gas and motor  vehicle sectors.(3) This year we add an interim target for Australian residential  mortgage lending, accounting for over 60 per cent of our on-balance  sheet lending and equity exposures. We are targeting a reduction  in emissions intensity of 50-70 per cent from 2021 to 2030. With  Australia’s population set to grow considerably in coming years,  we plan to continue to increase our lending to this critical sector to  support that growth. It is also important to acknowledge that the  magnitude of emissions reductions achieved by the sector will in  large part be driven by the Australian Government and industry’s  success in decarbonising the national electricity grid. We now have targets in place for over 80 per cent of our dollar  exposures(4) to carbon-intensive sectors and will announce  targets for the remaining material carbon-intensive sectors in our  next Report.

At Macquarie, we believe that we can contribute most positively  to the challenges and opportunities of climate change mitigation  and adaptation through the financing of practical solutions driven  by the core capabilities of our teams. Over the course of 2023, we  continued to drive additional capacity in established clean energy  technologies while also investing in emerging technologies that  seek to reduce emissions across energy, transportation, land use,  buildings, waste and industrial processes. While our fossil fuel financed emissions remain relatively small  compared to global peers, we continue to believe that an effective  transition must be managed, orderly and just. Consistent with  that philosophy, and in recognition that despite efforts, much of  the world will depend on the oil/gas industries for years to come,  we are working with our oil/gas clients to help them reduce their  emissions as well as maintain sufficient energy supply. In addition,  our commodity trading activities are helping clients manage their  transition risks by maintaining and developing deep and liquid  hedging markets, including in emerging commodities essential to  the transition, thereby providing greater price certainty as they  navigate this historic transformation. Like the overall climate challenge, our activities are global, and span  established and nascent sectors of the economy. Beyond our direct  activities, we continue to actively engage on addressing some of  the more significant global challenges to sustained progress. These  include driving practical solutions that channel greater levels of  investment to address climate impacts in emerging markets,  and bringing together public, concessional and private finance  to develop test projects that establish a replicable model that can  scale investment.  In all of these efforts, the learning curve is steep and the glidepath  to net zero is not linear. Across our diverse portfolio of businesses,  and efforts to support clients and global industry initiatives,  we seek to share learnings and adapt quickly to technological  innovation within an ever-changing geopolitical, policy and  commercial landscape. In doing so, we are grateful for the tireless efforts of our teams,  the support of our investors and clients and the partnership of  governments and supra-national bodies around the world. We hope  that this Report gives you a clear sense of how we think about our  contribution to the world’s transition to net zero, the role we play in  driving practical and positive climate solutions and how we manage  climate risk. We will continue to provide you with regular updates on  our progress.

Climate change is one of Macquarie’s eight ESG focus areas(1) and is core to our business and risk management practices. We have therefore  integrated oversight of climate risks and opportunities throughout our governance structure, including at the highest level: For internal reporting and risk management purposes, Macquarie is divided into four Operating Groups, which are supported by four Central  Service Groups. As part of their broader activities, which are described on pages 18-21 of Macquarie’s FY2023 Annual Report, each of the  Operating Groups is engaging in a range of activities aligned to our climate strategy and net zero commitments. To support oversight of net zero and climate risk, climate-related agenda items are tabled throughout the year at our Boards and  management meetings. This includes for our regional entity Macquarie Bank Europe (MBE). Examples are shown below: Agenda item Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec MGL/MBL Boards Net Zero &  Climate Risk ESG Report MGL/MBL Board  Governance  and Compliance  Committees ESR Material  Risk Report  ESG Report MGL/MBL Executive  Risk Committees ESR Material  Risk Report  ESG Report MGL/MBL Executive  Committees Net Zero &  Climate Risk MBE Board Climate Risk  (1)	 Refer to page 50 of Macquarie’s FY2023 ESG Report (PDF) MGL and MBL Boards Internal engagement Net zero commitments Operationalisation of climate risk management MGL and MBL Board Governance and Compliance Committees Banking and Financial Services Commodities and Global Markets Macquarie Capital Macquarie Asset Management Corporate Operations Group Financial Management Group Legal and Governance Group Risk Management Group Chief Risk Officer Head of Net Zero (Net Zero and Climate Risk Program) Net Zero and Climate Risk Steering Group MGL and MBL Senior Management Committees  ===== PAGE 10 ===== 7 Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report Strategy Risk Management  Appendices About this Report Metrics & Targets Foreword from   Macquarie’s CEO Governance Governance Continued The MGL and MBL Boards, in accordance with their respective  charters, approve MGL’s and MBL’s Risk Appetite Statement and  Risk Management Strategy, monitor material risks faced by MGL  and MBL, and review how these are managed. The Boards are  responsible for annually approving Macquarie’s Risk Management  Framework (RMF), which includes our ESG framework and major  ESG policies. The Boards also approve key decisions, targets and  disclosures such as those included in Macquarie’s Net Zero and  Climate Risk Report, and provide oversight of progress towards  meeting targets.  The MGL and MBL Board Governance and Compliance  Committees (BGCCs), in accordance with their respective charters,  assist the MGL and MBL Boards by reviewing and monitoring the  Group’s and Bank’s environmental and social risk management  policies, practices and performance. The BGCCs receive  climate-related reporting from management at least twice a year. The MGL and MBL Senior Management Committees (the MGL and  MBL Executive Committees and the MGL and MBL Executive Risk  Committees) act as escalation and executive bodies for net zero and  climate risk efforts across Macquarie, receiving periodic updates on  progress and providing guidance on next steps. The Risk Management Group (RMG) is an independent group that  provides objective review and challenge, oversight, monitoring  and reporting in relation to Macquarie’s material risks. When new  or evolving risks are identified, the impacted areas of the RMF  are assessed and adjusted where required to ensure the risks  are managed effectively. In addition to the oversight activities  performed by RMG, the Internal Audit Division (IAD) provides  independent and objective risk-based assurance to the Boards or  Board Audit Committees, other relevant Board Committees and  senior management on the compliance with, and effectiveness of,  Macquarie’s financial and risk management framework, including its  governance, systems, structures, policies, processes and people for  managing material risks. IAD regularly reassesses emerging risks,  regulations and trends to ensure that these are adequately  captured within the internal audit plan, including  climate-related risks.  The Financial Management Group (FMG) is responsible for capital,  funding, liquidity, tax and strategic analysis and advice to support  the growth of the Macquarie business. It ensures Macquarie meets  its financial, regulatory and tax reporting compliance obligations,  as well as maintaining relationships with a range of significant  external stakeholders. In line with the growing importance of  sustainability-related disclosures, FMG has recently established  a sustainability reporting function, which aims to consolidate  sustainability reporting across Macquarie as reporting requirements  grow and evolve. To support senior management with their responsibilities  and drive progress, in 2021 Macquarie formed a dedicated  centralised cross-Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Program  (the Program). Reporting to the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and led  by the Head of Net Zero, the central Program team provides a  coordinated approach to net zero and to climate risk across  (2)	 Throughout this Report when we refer to ‘net zero’ in relation to our own business operations Scope 1 and 2 emissions ambition, we are informed by recommendations from the  Science Based Targets initiatives (SBTi) Corporate Net Zero Standard, Net-Zero Banking Alliance Supporting note: The Use of Carbon Credits in Climate Target Setting, and The  Oxford Principles for Net Zero Aligned Carbon Offsetting. See Section 4 — Strategy for further detail. Macquarie, aligning to existing approval forums and bodies. The  Program builds on established capabilities within each Operating  Group. The CRO is responsible for the successful achievement of  the Program’s objectives, while the Head of Net Zero is responsible  for the day-to-day Program operations. Both work closely with the  Executive Committees, Boards and Macquarie’s RMG Environmental  and Social Risk (ESR) function. Supporting the Program is the Net Zero and Climate Risk  Steering Group. This body has senior representatives from each  Operating and Central Service Group, who are responsible for  driving outcomes and steering decisions relevant to the Program.  They provide support to the various working groups and to senior  management in decision-making. Work to meet our net zero commitments: Aligning our financing activities with the global goal of net  zero emissions by 2050: To achieve our net zero ambition,  Macquarie has a Financed Emissions Working Group. This  includes representatives from across Operating and Central  Service Groups to enable the development of approaches,  methodologies, frameworks and governance required to deliver on  our commitment. Each Operating Group has dedicated resources  responsible for analysing industry sectors applicable to their group,  quantifying emissions, assessing targets, and developing strategies  and actions to meet those targets. Senior management and the  Boards approve targets and receive updates of progress towards  meeting them. Net zero emissions in our own business operations by FY2025  (Scope 1 and 2):(2) Macquarie’s Corporate Operations Group (COG)  leads our efforts to reach net zero emissions in our own business  operations. COG has a dedicated governance model to support  these efforts, reporting into Macquarie Group’s Chief Operating  Officer. COG’s Business Services Division leads the execution of  Macquarie’s 2025 Sustainability Plan and net zero efforts in  collaboration with Macquarie’s other functions. Progress updates  are provided to the Boards, Executive Committees, and Net  Zero and Climate Risk Steering Group to ensure coordination of  approaches across Macquarie and enable visibility and support  where needed. Work to operationalise climate risk management: There are clear roles and responsibilities across Macquarie with  respect to climate risk management and a well-established ESR  function in RMG. The RMG ESR team comprises subject matter  experts who coordinate a diverse range of ESG activities across  Operating and Central Service Groups and regions, including  developing and implementing Macquarie-wide and Operating  Group-specific policies, reviewing transactions, providing advice  on climate risks and opportunities, and facilitating training.  Additionally, we have grown our teams within our Operating  Groups to support, assess and manage environmental and social  risks, including climate-related risks. This further embeds the  responsibility and capability of our business teams (‘first line of  defence’) to operationalise climate risk management.  ===== PAGE 11 ===== 8 Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report Strategy Risk Management  Appendices About this Report Metrics & Targets Foreword from   Macquarie’s CEO Governance Governance Continued The Climate Risk Working Group, reporting to the Head of Net Zero  and comprising representatives from all RMG Divisions, provides  an additional level of oversight of climate risk management. This  provides appropriate senior leadership oversight and management  of climate risk and the program of activities to mature our  operationalisation of climate risk across our risk management  frameworks, policies and procedures. The Climate Risk Working  Group is supported by dedicated resourcing across our Compliance  and Prudential Risk teams, which engage in well-established  processes to conduct regulatory horizon scanning and triage,  as referenced in Section 6 — Risk Management. Internal engagement: The Macquarie Climate Solutions Taskforce (CST) is a  committee formed with representatives from all Operating  Groups and Central Service Groups. The CST works to support  Macquarie’s expansion into new climate-aligned technologies such  as hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage, given  Macquarie’s ambition is to strengthen the support it provides to  carbon-intensive industries and clients, like the oil/gas sector, to  enable decarbonisation. The CST is supported by a Climate Intelligence Unit (CIU) which  supports and informs Macquarie’s engagement and growth  in issues related to climate change and the energy transition,  providing weekly briefings on climate matters that are accessible to  all of our people. The CIU provides expert support across Macquarie  on clean technologies, market developments and cross-Group  client opportunities.  In addition to the above, our Operating and Central Service  Groups continue to enhance our climate and energy transition  related capabilities and to support our people to understand  and respond to the changes. Examples include the Banking and  Financial Services (BFS) Net Zero Forum, Commodities and Global  Markets (CGM) Energy Transition Steering Committee, CGM Global  Carbon Business, CGM ESG and Climate Team, Macquarie Capital  ESG Committee, Macquarie Capital Energy Transition Business,  Macquarie Capital Net Zero and Climate Risk Team and the  Macquarie Asset Management Sustainability Team.  ===== PAGE 12 ===== Strategy Eku Energy, Victoria, Australia  Eku Energy, a global battery storage  platform created by Macquarie  Asset Management, holds a 3+ GWh  development pipeline of utility-scale  storage projects that, once built, are  expected to provide grid services in key  markets around the world, including  the UK, Australia, Italy, and Japan.  ===== PAGE 13 ===== 10 Risk Management  Appendices About this Report Governance Metrics & Targets Foreword from   Macquarie’s CEO Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report Strategy Strategy Macquarie’s approach to climate is based around four areas of action: 1 2 3 4 Continue to reduce  the emissions of our  own business operations Leverage our knowledge  and networks to help others  decarbonise Align our financing activity  with the global goal of net  zero emissions by 2050 Increase investment in  climate mitigation and  adaptation solutions Action area 1:  Continue to reduce the emissions of our own business operations (1)	 Emissions Scopes and Categories are defined under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. (2)	 Scope 3 emissions included in our own business operations emissions relate to Categories 1-8, as defined under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3)  Accounting and Reporting Standard. (3)	 The industry guidance we refer to includes the SBTi Corporate Manual, SBTi Criteria and Recommendations for Near-term Targets, SBTi Corporate Net Zero Standard, UNEP-FI  Guidelines for Climate Target Setting for Banks, Net-Zero Banking Alliance Supporting note: The Use of Carbon Credits in Climate Target Setting, and The Oxford Principles for  Net Zero Aligned Carbon Offsetting. (4)	 In FY2022, the calculation of business travel emissions was expanded beyond air travel to include hotels, ground transportation (excluding rail) and food & beverages, and the  calculation of air travel emissions was also refined to reflect the class of ticket flown (e.g., economy, business class). The environmental impact of Macquarie’s own business operations  predominantly relates to the resources we consume in our offices  and data centres, business travel and our procurement activities.  We seek to manage this impact by monitoring and reducing  resource use, developing innovative and sustainable workplaces  and improving the sustainability of our supply chain. We offset  residual Scope 1 emissions, purchase the equivalent of 100 per cent  renewable electricity to cover Scope 2 emissions, and offset Scope 3  Category 6 business travel emissions.(1) Macquarie’s 2025 Sustainability Plan articulates our corporate  sustainability commitments with specific and measurable targets  across environmental and social pillars. In line with this plan, we  have continued to make progress in reducing the emissions of our  own business operations. We have committed to net zero emissions in our own business  operations across Scope 1 and 2 by FY2025, and are progressing  well towards achieving this. Throughout this Report, when we refer  to ‘net zero’ in relation to our own business operations Scope 1  and 2 emissions ambition, we are informed by recommendations  from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Corporate Net Zero  Standard, Net-Zero Banking Alliance Supporting note: The Use of  Carbon Credits in Climate Target Setting, and The Oxford Principles  for Net Zero Aligned Carbon Offsetting.  First, to achieve our net zero commitment, we are aiming to  reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions from a FY2020 baseline, including  purchasing renewable electricity for our office premises in line with  our RE100 commitment. Second, we are purchasing carbon credits  to offset residual Scope 1 emissions that are difficult to abate.  The carbon offsets that we purchase for this purpose will be from  projects that remove carbon from the atmosphere and provide  longer-term storage for this carbon. For our own business operations Scope 3 emissions we are  developing methods to measure and track emissions reduction  strategies and are working towards Scope 3 operational value chain  emissions reduction targets aligned to science.(2) In line with emerging industry guidance, we use credible  carbon offsets for the offsetting of residual emissions and  can use them for end‑state operational net zero targets.(3) Since  FY2010, Macquarie has been offsetting its Scope 1, Scope 2 and  Scope 3 business travel emissions. We are committing to continue  offsetting residual Scope 1 emissions, purchasing 100 per cent  renewable electricity to cover Scope 2 emissions, and offsetting  Scope 3 business travel emissions beyond FY2025.(4)  ===== PAGE 14 ===== 11 Risk Management  Appendices About this Report Governance Metrics & Targets Foreword from   Macquarie’s CEO Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report Strategy Strategy Continued Action area 2:  Leverage our knowledge and networks to help others decarbonise For internal reporting and risk management purposes, Macquarie  is divided into four Operating Groups, which are supported by four  Central Service Groups. As part of their broader activities, which are  described on pages 18-21 of Macquarie’s FY2023 Annual Report,  each of the Operating Groups is engaging in a range of activities  aligned to our climate strategy and net zero commitments. We recognise that the scale of the transition required can  only be achieved with collaboration across a broader range of  stakeholders. That is why each of Macquarie’s Operating Groups is  partnering with its clients and engaging with portfolio companies  in different ways to scale clean energy solutions and support their  decarbonisation journeys. Macquarie Capital has global capability in: •	 Advisory and capital raising services, providing clients with  specialist expertise and flexible capital solutions across a range  of sectors. •	 Specialist investing across private credit, private equity, real  estate, growth equity, venture capital, and in infrastructure and  energy projects and companies. •	 Equities brokerage, providing clients with access to equity  research, sales, execution capabilities and corporate access. Macquarie Capital supports clients who are involved in  decarbonising by advising on green energy investments, while its  cash equities team is able to help asset owners reduce the carbon  intensity of their portfolios through their trading expertise, by  offering diversified portfolio options. Commodities and Global Markets (CGM) is a global business  offering capital and financing, risk management, market access,  physical execution and logistics solutions to its diverse client  base across:  •	 Commodities: provides risk management, lending and financing,  and physical execution and logistics to clients with exposure to  commodity markets (which include power, oil/gas, agriculture,  resources, and carbon). •	 Financial Markets: provides risk management, financing  and capital solutions, and market access to corporate and  institutional clients with exposure to fixed income and equities. •	 Asset Finance: global provider of specialist finance and asset  management solutions.  CGM is developing and deploying climate solutions that meet  its clients’ diverse needs and ambitions and help them with their  decarbonisation pathways. At Macquarie, we believe that the  transition needs to be managed, orderly and just, which is why   CGM is actively supporting carbon-intensive industries, like   oil/gas, to reduce their emissions while maintaining the vital  services they provide and on which our communities and industries  still rely. As its clients’ needs evolve, CGM adapts by drawing on its  long-standing energy and commodities expertise to better align  and expand its capabilities, ensuring it continues to provide the  right support. The scale and breadth of the energy transition is driving the  delivery of holistic solutions across CGM’s activities, markets,  and client sectors, which are captured under the following broad  energy verticals: carbon and emissions, renewable and flexible  power, clean fuels, sustainable transport, critical minerals, and the  circular economy. Macquarie Asset Management (MAM) is a leading specialist global  asset manager, providing investment solutions to clients across  a range of capabilities in Private Markets and Public Investments,  including infrastructure, green investments, agriculture and natural  assets, real estate, private credit, asset finance, equities, fixed  income and multi-asset solutions.  MAM is working with its portfolio companies and clients to reduce  their emissions. The Green Investment Group (GIG), which became  part of MAM on 1 April 2022 (now MAM Green Investments),  continues to provide the energy solutions required to transition to  a low-carbon economy. For more information, refer to the FY2023  Sustainability Report. Banking and Financial Services (BFS) serves the Australian market,  and is organised into the following three business divisions: •	 Personal Banking: provides a diverse range of retail banking  products to clients with home loans, car loans, transaction and  savings accounts and credit cards.  •	 Wealth Management: provides clients with a wide range of  wrap platform and cash management services, investment and  superannuation products, financial advice and private banking. •	 Business Banking: provides a full range of deposit, lending  and payment solutions, as well as tailored services to  business clients, ranging from sole practitioners to corporate  professional firms. BFS is committed to supporting our clients’ efforts to achieve  their decarbonisation goals through empowering them to  make more sustainable daily choices, ranging from the cars  they drive, to connecting them with energy experts to discuss  energy-saving solutions.  ===== PAGE 15 ===== 12 Risk Management  Appendices About this Report Governance Metrics & Targets Foreword from   Macquarie’s CEO Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report Strategy Strategy Continued Action area 2:  Continued (5)	 As a result of APG’s investment, Driveco secured the funding to continue developing its network of charging stations in France and Belgium, and also expand internationally to Germany,  Spain, Italy, Switzerland and the Netherlands. APG, 10 May 2023, https://apg.nl/en/publication/apg-invests-250-million-in-european-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure/ (6)	 Global Infrastructure Hub, 2023, https://outlook.gihub.org/ Recent case studies  Advising on an investment in a leading electric vehicle (EV) charging company Macquarie Capital acted as a financial advisor to APG Asset Management on their €250 million investment in Driveco, a French  EV charging company. This investment aims to support Driveco’s ambition to be a major player in EV charging infrastructure in France and in Europe.(5) The  additional financial resources will enable the company to strengthen its already significant presence – notably by deploying its own  charging stations, accelerating its internationalisation strategy and consolidating its technological innovations to continuously improve  client experience. Executing one of the first Renewable Supply and Offtake Agreements (RSOA) in the market CGM is working with Vertex Energy, Inc. (Vertex) an energy transition company and specialty refiner and marketer of renewable  and conventional products, based in North America.  In order to establish and operate its new renewable diesel facility in Mobile, Alabama, Vertex entered into an RSOA this year with CGM,  whereby CGM holds title to a portion of Vertex inventory to help fund the project. This is similar in nature to the existing Supply and  Offtake Agreement executed in 2022 on the conventional side of the business. The new RSOA helps Vertex manage the liquidity needs required to secure feedstock and monetise the renewable fuels and regulatory  credits for the business. It also helps Vertex to finalise its long-term capital structure, propelling the business forward to capitalise on  the growing demand for renewable fuels. This transaction demonstrates how CGM can develop and enhance its existing capabilities to further support clients’ decarbonisation  pathways and, in this case, establish itself as a provider of structured working capital solutions for clients across the renewable fuels  supply chain.  Scaling sustainable infrastructure investment with the FAST-Infra Label Macquarie Asset Management is working with FAST-Infra and partners to create a globally applicable sustainability labelling  system that aims to transform sustainable infrastructure into a mainstream, liquid asset class. According to the G20’s Global Infrastructure Outlook, the world needs to invest an additional $US18 trillion in infrastructure above  current projections by 2040, including $US3 trillion to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals. An urgent acceleration of  investment into infrastructure is therefore required.(6) Ensuring this investment is channelled into sustainable projects is essential. However, investors currently lack a common framework for  evaluating the sustainability of infrastructure projects. This is the challenge a new initiative, developed by FAST-Infra and co-chaired by  Macquarie, aims to address.  In partnership with FAST-Infra and industry partners, Macquarie Asset Management used its deep experience in green investment and  pioneering approach to sustainability analytics to help develop the label’s assessment framework. By building on existing standards,  frameworks and taxonomies, we helped create a comprehensive set of sustainability criteria that can operate as a one-stop solution for  sustainability labelling.  The FAST-Infra Label is now running an open call for the first set of projects to participate in its rollout. Global Infrastructure Basel  Foundation has been appointed secretariat of the initiative, alongside Bloomberg as its data repository, and the initiative is expected to  be fully operational in 2024. By using the FAST-Infra Label, market participants can demonstrate the positive impact of a project, enabling capital allocations to be  guided towards sustainable infrastructure and ultimately helping to bridge the $US18 trillion investment gap.  ===== PAGE 16 ===== 13 Risk Management  Appendices About this Report Governance Metrics & Targets Foreword from   Macquarie’s CEO Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report Strategy Strategy Continued Action area 2:  Continued (7)	 Compares operational CO2 emissions, those being CO2 emissions released from a vehicle’s tailpipe, and CO2 equivalent emissions from electricity used to charge a vehicle’s battery.

Refer to Section 5 — Metrics & Targets for further details. This year we set an interim target for Australian residential  mortgage lending, accounting for over 60 per cent of our  on-balance sheet lending and equity investment dollar exposures.  We are targeting an emissions intensity of 11.6-19.3 kgCO2e/m2  by 2030, which implies a fall of 50-70 per cent from the FY2021  baseline.  With the Australian population set to grow considerably in coming  years, we plan to continue to increase our lending to this critical  sector to support that growth. It is important to acknowledge that  the magnitude of emissions reductions achieved will primarily be  driven by the Australian Government’s and industry’s success in  decarbonising the national electricity grid. We now have targets in place for over 80 per cent of our in-scope  dollar exposures(8) to carbon-intensive sectors as identified by the  NZBA,(9) and we will announce targets for the remaining material  carbon-intensive sectors in our next Report.

In 2022, we estimated financed emissions and set interim targets for the oil/gas, motor vehicles and coal sectors. This year we add an interim  target for Australian residential mortgage lending, accounting for over 60 per cent of our on-balance sheet lending and equity exposures.  We are targeting an emissions intensity of 11.6-19.3 kgCO2e/m2 by 2030, which implies a fall of 50-70 per cent from the FY2021 baseline.  In addition, for the first time this year, we report historical emissions in the power generation sector. With the movement of MAM Green  Investments’ assets(12) off-balance sheet ongoing, our on-balance sheet lending and equity exposures to the power generation sector will  change materially in the coming year. We plan to announce a target in our next Report, once that process is further progressed. We now have targets in place for over 80 per cent of our dollar exposures(13) to carbon-intensive sectors and, in line with the NZBA Guidelines,  we expect to set targets for all remaining material carbon-intensive sectors in our next Report.

We disclose  our portfolio baselines and targets, where applicable, and provide  details of our performance to date in sectors where we set targets  last year. Key elements of our approach Our framework for analysing Macquarie’s financed emissions  (Scope 3, Category 15) reflects industry recommendations,  including guidance from the GHG Protocol, Glasgow Financial  Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA),  United Nations Environment Program Finance Initiative (UNEP FI)  and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).  It also leverages the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials  (PCAF) Standard,(21) where appropriate, our internal expertise and  the relevant, impactful, and credible data and decision-useful  metrics to drive progress. A key feature of our framework is the use  of sector-specific methodologies – this underpins our approach to  setting targets. We consider activities across all four of our Operating Groups and,  in line with the NZBA Guidelines, include our on-balance sheet  lending and equity investment exposures when determining our  financed emissions.(22) Refer to Appendix 2 for further details. As part of the ongoing review of our data and methodology, this  year we have updated our product scope(23) to exclude exposures  associated with issued guarantees that are not related to any  potential future loans or equity investments – this has resulted in  the exclusion of environmental bonds.(24) This update further aligns  our approach with the PCAF Standard(25) and broader industry  practice.

(30)	 “RapidRate is a tool developed by CSIRO, using Artificial Intelligence techniques, that can quickly rate the energy efficiency of a dwelling using a relatively small number of inputs.  RapidRate generates an estimated Star Rating that is aligned with the Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme (NatHERS). It also generates estimated heating energy and  estimated cooling energy.” ‘RapidRate’, CSIRO, accessed September 2023, https://ahd.csiro.au/ Sector overview The real estate sector accounted for around 33 per cent of global  energy and process-related CO2 emissions in 2022 when including  operational emissions from use of fossil fuels and electricity in  buildings, as well as those related to building construction.(27) Fossil  fuel and electricity used within residential buildings accounted for  around half of this total, demonstrating the critical importance of  this sector in achieving global decarbonisation goals.  Reducing operational emissions in support of a net zero target in  the real estate sector is heavily reliant on the decarbonisation of  the electricity grid. This is critical to achieving a net zero pathway  for Australian residential buildings. It is a challenging and complex  task and will be dependent on the successful implementation of  government policy.  Decarbonisation will also require a large increase in solar panel  installations on residential properties, a reduction in household  gas usage (via electrification) and energy efficiency improvements.  Government reporting has shown recent new homes in Australia  have an average energy rating of 6.1 stars out of a possible 10 stars,  while the historical stock has an average rating of only 1.7 stars.(28)  While there have been welcome changes to national construction  codes to uplift the energy rating of new stock, historically lower  standards will continue to contribute to a larger heating and cooling  need and energy demand on the grid (where households have not  adopted solar or battery solutions). In the Australian context, a coordinated approach across federal,  state and local governments will be required to encourage the  growth of renewable energy supplies, update building standards  and energy codes, and incentivise the acceleration of home  energy retrofits. However, unless and until the grid is substantially  rebalanced to renewable energy supplies, improvements in  any other factor will only make marginal contributions to the  sector’s decarbonisation.  We acknowledge that we are reliant on government policy and  action to materially reduce financed emissions associated with  residential mortgages lending; therefore, we support market and  policy development to encourage an orderly transition. Activities in-scope We include Macquarie’s Australian-only residential mortgages  portfolio originated within Banking and Financial Services (BFS),  which accounts for over 95 per cent of our total Group on-balance  sheet residential mortgages exposure. Our financed emissions  estimates and target for this sector do not include reverse  mortgages, committed exposures where the facility has been  approved but not settled before the reporting period, and non-retail  residential property exposure. Measuring emissions In line with the PCAF Standard, we include Scope 1 and 2 emissions  related to residential mortgages:(29) •	 Scope 1: emissions from on-site fuel combustion (e.g., for  heating and cooking), including natural gas and liquefied  petroleum gas (LPG). •	 Scope 2: emissions from the generation of electricity used on the  property (e.g., for appliances, heating, and cooling). For Scope 1 and 2, we include carbon dioxide (CO2) as well as other  greenhouse gases including methane and nitrous oxide. There are significant data challenges associated with quantifying  financed emissions from residential mortgages, with data quality  and availability currently low. Property-level data on home  energy efficiency and/or actual energy consumption is required  to accurately gauge the emissions associated with the residential  mortgages portfolio but is not yet widely available in Australia. Our  methodology therefore relies on energy consumption proxies and  is based on government sources (see Appendix 2 for further details  on these proxies and financed emissions calculations).  Macquarie is supportive of government efforts in this area to deliver  a national disclosure framework which incorporates a verifiable  energy rating scheme for new and existing buildings. It is equally  important for the government to incentivise the adoption of the  energy rating scheme through mandating disclosure rules as soon  as practical, in order to see the required acceleration in uptake. As  part of our advocacy efforts to improve data quality and availability,  we have been actively engaging with industry through working  groups and have partnered with CoreLogic and CSIRO as part of a  pilot study using the RapidRate(30) tool to understand the thermal  energy efficiency of our residential mortgages portfolio.  We will continue to evaluate our ability to estimate financed  emissions as data quality and availability evolves.  ===== PAGE 29 ===== 26 Risk Management  Appendices About this Report Governance Foreword from   Macquarie’s CEO Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report Strategy Metrics & Targets Metrics & Targets Continued 2030 interim target Our target for this sector is based on physical emissions intensity.  This reflects our commitment to growing our residential mortgage  portfolio and providing Australians with the financing they need to  purchase and build their homes. We are limited in our ability to influence the energy efficiency of  a home or the decarbonisation of the electricity grid. Ultimately,  the emissions intensity of our residential mortgages portfolio and  our ability to meet targets in this sector will depend on federal and  state governments taking a lead position and implementing policies,  plans, actions, and sectoral decarbonisation pathways.  We have set a physical emissions intensity target of 11.6-19.3  kgCO2e/m2 by 2030, which implies a fall of 50-70 per cent from the  FY2021 baseline. The midpoint of our target is informed by the  Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) scenario, which provides  an Australian adaptation of the International Energy Agency’s  science-based net zero by 2050 scenario. In acknowledgement of  the uncertainties described above (including our limited influence),  we consider a target range more appropriate than a point estimate.  We will continue to evaluate our target for this sector by monitoring  the delivery of market and policy developments.

(34)	 Note, we include companies whose primary purpose is the generation of electricity for profit as well as gentailers. Primary purpose means that the majority (greater than  50 per cent) of the electricity generating capacity is operational and therefore revenue generating. (35)	 ‘Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Electricity Generation: Update’, Table 1, NREL, accessed September 2023, https://www.nrel.gov/ (PDF) (36)	 For NREL proxied renewable power generation assets, this also includes immaterial Scope 2 emissions. Sector overview The power generation sector is currently the largest source of  CO2 emissions globally due to continued reliance on fossil fuels,  especially coal.(32) The sector is also leading the transition to net  zero emissions through rapid deployment of renewables, such  as solar and wind. Moreover, electrification is a key part of other  sectors’ strategies for significant emissions reductions, including  transportation, industry and buildings. As a result, demand for  electricity is already growing faster than that for other forms of  energy, and electricity is expected to meet an increased share of  global energy needs through 2030 and beyond. A fully decarbonised  electricity sector is the essential foundation of a net zero energy  system. Navigating this transition will require significant investment  and innovative financing solutions to support new infrastructure,  drive development and commercialisation of new technologies,  manage risk and improve cost-effectiveness. Reflecting the importance of the power generation sector to  the world’s decarbonisation ambitions, Macquarie has invested  significantly in the development and deployment of climate  solutions over the past two decades, with our first investments  dating back to 2005, including through the purchase of the Green  Investment Group (GIG) from the UK Government in 2017. To further support our ambition, GIG moved from Macquarie Capital  to Macquarie Asset Management (MAM) in April 2022 (now MAM  Green Investments). This allows us to combine the market leading  renewables project development and finance expertise of GIG and  its portfolio of specialist development platforms with the fiduciary  capital resources entrusted to MAM, thereby providing access  to larger pools of capital and finance that in turn will allow us to  facilitate the development of renewables projects on a much larger  scale. The transition of MAM Green Investments’ assets off-balance  sheet is ongoing. Activities in-scope Our power generation sector exposure consists of on-balance  sheet lending to, and equity investments in, companies that are  engaged in electricity generation.(33) This includes utility companies,  independent power producers, as well as diversified companies  where power generation is the primary activity.(34) Measuring emissions In line with industry practice and the NZBA Guidelines, we measure  companies’ direct Scope 1 emissions from power generation, which  allows us to focus our analysis on the segment responsible for most  of the sector’s emissions and consequently where the greatest  amount of strategic focus and investment is required. The Scope 2  and Scope 3 emissions for companies that generate electricity from  fossil fuels are generally comparatively small and/or do not relate  directly to power generation activity. To calculate the weighted average emissions intensity of our  portfolio, we have used the emissions data reported by our clients  and supplemented it with our own proxy calculations, where  our clients do not report their emissions. For renewable power  generation (e.g., solar, wind power), where our clients do not report  their emissions, we have used the National Renewable Energy  Laboratory (NREL) emission factors. NREL emission factors do not  currently distinguish between Scope 1 and 2. Therefore, taking  a conservative approach, our calculations of Scope 1 emissions  associated with renewable power generation assets also include  Scope 2 emissions, which are immaterial.(35) Across Macquarie we aim to continue to grow our exposure to green  energy generation. The transition of MAM Green Investments’  assets off-balance sheet will, all other things being equal, reduce  our on-balance sheet exposure to the power generation sector and  increase the emissions intensity of the remaining assets. As at 31 March 2023 our total on-balance sheet exposure to  the power generation sector has fallen to $A0.5 billion, which  is 0.3 per cent of our total on-balance sheet lending and equity  investments. Of this only $A0.3 billion will remain once the  transition of MAM Green Investments’ assets off-balance sheet is  fully complete. In the following table, we disclose our absolute emissions and  emissions intensity for the year ending 31 March 2023, both  including and excluding MAM Green Investments’ remaining  on-balance sheet renewable power generation assets. We plan to publish an interim 2030 emissions target in our next  Report, once the movement of renewable power generation assets  off-balance sheet is further progressed.

(40)	 Last year, our emissions disclosure included only the coal mining segment of the coal sector. FY2023 emissions and percentage change disclosures are aligned to the coal mining  segment as well. This means coal-fired power assets are not included here, and are instead included in power generation sector scope.  ===== PAGE 32 ===== 29 Risk Management  Appendices About this Report Governance Foreword from   Macquarie’s CEO Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report Strategy Metrics & Targets Metrics & Targets Continued Oil/gas We are making progress towards our target of 56.3-59.6 gCO2e/MJ   which implies a 9-14 per cent reduction in physical emissions  intensity by 2030 from the FY2020 baseline. In FY2023 the  physical emissions intensity of our oil/gas sector has decreased  by ~6 per cent to 61.9 gCO2e/MJ, from the FY2020 baseline. This  was primarily due to a bigger proportion of our clients in FY2023  reporting lower operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions. While this reduction is encouraging, as noted last year, given the  small size of our lending and equity exposure to the sector relative  to peers, annual physical emissions intensity outcomes are likely to  exhibit considerable volatility (in both directions) as the portfolio  evolves over time. Such volatility is to be expected and is consistent  with our 2030 target. As noted last year, given the scale of the  needed transition, we recognise that much of the world will depend  on oil/gas for years to come and we will continue to support clients  in these sectors. As part of our ongoing efforts to improve our data and  methodology, this year we have: •	 more closely aligned product scope with PCAF by excluding  exposures relating to issued guarantees (environmental bonds)  as these do not relate to any potential future loans or equity  investments; •	 performed a review of our clients’ sector classifications and  enhanced the associated controls. That process identified two  additional in-scope clients that we have added to our historical  FY2020 baseline; •	 refined one client’s self-reported emissions data to better align  their production and emissions metrics; •	 revised our conversion factor for natural gas liquids to a barrel  of oil equivalent to more closely align with evolving industry  practice.  The aggregate impact of these data and methodology  enhancements is an increase in FY2020 absolute financed emissions  from 3.88 MtCO2e to 4.59 MtCO2e. While the physical emissions  intensity of our portfolio in FY2020 fell modestly from 66.2  gCO2e/MJ to 65.8 gCO2e/MJ, our target for 2030 remains unchanged  at 56.3-59.6 gCO2e/MJ. However, given the lower physical emissions  intensity starting point in FY2020, that target now implies a  reduction of 9-14 per cent between FY2020 and 2030 (previously  10-15 per cent).

This has had an immaterial impact on our FY2020 baseline. (42)	 ‘BITRE Road Vehicles’, Australian Government, January 2023, https://www.bitre.gov.au/ (43)	 VFACTs New Vehicle Sales Data. (44)	 ‘State of Electric Vehicles’, Electric Vehicle Council, July 2023, https://electricvehiclecouncil.com.au/ (PDF) The physical emissions intensity of our motor vehicles portfolio fell  marginally, by 0.5 per cent between FY2020 (base year) and FY2023.  We continue to see pathways to achieve our 2030 interim target for  the motor vehicle sector.(41)  We consider there to be three key factors which will determine  whether we meet our 2030 target for this sector: 1.	 Increasing the electric vehicle (EV) share of our total motor  vehicle financing exposure in line with the market. 2.	 Improvements in internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle  emissions intensity. 3.	 Decarbonisation of the Australian electricity grid via renewable  energy sources. In January 2023, EVs only accounted for around 0.4 per cent of  motor vehicles on Australian roads.(42) With EV sales increasing to  ~4 per cent of total new vehicle sales in FY2023,(43) recent reporting  suggests we are likely to see further electric vehicle uptake,(44)  which is expected to contribute to a reduction in our emissions  intensity in coming years. Our ability to meet our target will be  subject to government and industry support for encouraging EV  supply and uptake, improving vehicle efficiency standards and  decarbonising the grid. To help break down barriers to EV uptake, BFS has developed an  EV savings calculator which complements our existing specialist  EV buying service. The calculator takes into account a number of  factors to support clients to compare the costs associated with, and  environmental benefits of, purchasing and running an EV compared  to an equivalent petrol, diesel or hybrid vehicle.  Macquarie also welcomed the opportunity to make a submission in  relation to Australia’s National Electric Vehicle Strategy, supporting  the federal government’s commitment to encourage the uptake of  EVs in Australia.

For coal, this  relates to environmental bonds (e.g., to rehabilitate a mine at the  end of its life). This methodology enhancement has reduced our  previously reported FY2020 EAD from $A0.3 billion to $A0.2 billion,  and the baseline absolute financed emissions from 4.83 MtCO2e  to 3.58 MtCO2e. It also had an immaterial impact on FY2020  physical emissions intensity, reducing it from 93.7 gCO2e/MJ to  93.6 gCO2e/MJ. There is no impact on our existing coal target. As per last year, given computational challenges associated with  revenue shares (particularly in a world of high and volatile coal  prices), we continue to define a coal company as one that derives  the majority (i.e., more than 50 per cent) of its revenue from coal  (both thermal and metallurgical) production, mine ownership or  operation, or coal‑fired power station ownership or operation. We  acknowledge that the 50 per cent threshold is not in line with the  NZBA Guidelines, which define a coal company as one that derives  more than 5 per cent of revenues directly from thermal coal.  However, Macquarie has committed not to enter into new business  activity with any counterparty where the underlying purpose is to  fund the purchase, development or expansion of a coal mine or  coal‑fired power station.  The global community has recognised the urgent need to reduce  global GHG emissions and the importance of working with  carbon‑intensive industries, such as coal, to help them decarbonise.  Given this, going forward we will continue to maintain the ability to  work with coal companies to finance projects that will significantly  reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in line with  science‑based scenarios, or are for the purpose of diversifying away  from the coal sector in line with a credible transition plan. With only one remaining coal mining client ($A6.7 million EAD),  our absolute financed emissions for coal mining decreased from  3.58 MtCO2e in FY2020 to 0.35 MtCO2e in FY2023. Our emissions  intensity decreased from 93.6 gCO2e/MJ in FY2020 to 91.8 gCO2e/MJ  in FY2023. To align with sector methodologies, emissions from  coal-fired power generation are reported as part of the emissions of  the power generation sector. (45)	 Lending refers to loan assets held at amortised cost and excludes certain items such as leasing, asset finance, trading assets and short-term financing (e.g., inventory finance). (46)	 Our coal target is based on our pre-existing commitment to run-off our limited remaining on-balance sheet lending and equity exposure to coal companies (inclusive of both coal  mining and coal-fired power generation, and covering both metallurgical and thermal coal) by the end of 2024.

To appropriately consider sector-specific targets in financing decisions for our carbon-intensive sectors in institutional-side businesses, we have  developed a Net Zero Risk Assessment (NZRA) process which is currently applied to the upstream oil/gas sector. Over time, we will look to expand to  other sectors where we set targets.  The process uses a combination of quantitative and qualitative factors (where required) to evaluate clients’ climate ambition and performance for new  in-scope transactions.  Quantitative factors include: 	• The client’s historical emissions. 	• Macquarie’s overall sector emissions profile at a point in time and at the maturity of the transaction. 	• Macquarie’s sectoral target. Qualitative factors include: 	• Existence and reasonableness of the client’s decarbonisation plans. 	• Strategic actions taken by the client to achieve decarbonisation plans. 	• Assessment of GHG management practices relative to peers. By considering this process as one element of our transaction-level decision making, we can assess how a given in-scope transaction may affect progress  towards our sector-level targets.  In addition to transaction-level assessments, twice-yearly we determine the collective progress of emissions reductions against our sector-level targets.  The results of this analysis are discussed with representatives of each impacted Operating Group and the Risk Management Group.  Accountability for progress towards targets has been assigned to senior leaders in relevant Operating Groups. This senior-level accountability, coupled  with the NZRA (which includes independent ‘second line’ review by the Risk Management Group) and six-monthly sector-level reviews, serve as a control  and monitoring mechanism to help senior management oversee progress towards achieving our targets. For motor vehicles, we have implemented portfolio review and management reporting, which is presented in business and risk oversight forums to track  and discuss progress with senior leadership. Data quality and ongoing evolution of our methodology Estimating emissions requires the collection and analysis of large sets of new data and, as mentioned last year, there are significant challenges with  both data availability and quality. We therefore produce some of our estimates based on assumptions and extrapolations. Given the urgency of climate  action, we are disclosing emissions and targets based on current methodologies despite these data limitations.  In making the data quality related determinations, we continue to apply the PCAF Standard data quality hierarchies. Refer to Appendix 2 for further  details on data quality determinations.  The data and models used in our methodology are subject to Macquarie’s data governance policies and frameworks. We will continue to assess available  third-party data and service providers and refine our methodology and data collection and analysis capabilities over time.  While we are proud of the progress made in developing and refining our financed emissions methodology, this remains a nascent area, with ongoing  industry development. We will continue to refine our approach as industry guidance matures. Over time, we expect that the availability and quality of the data will improve. As a result, applying these data and modelling capabilities and  continuously pursuing transparency, we may periodically restate our baseline emissions and, possibly, our emissions reduction targets. We note that  scenarios are likely to change with the pace of decarbonisation and we will review our approach as required.  ===== PAGE 36 ===== Risk  Management Endeavour Energy,   New South Wales, Australia  Endeavour Energy, a Macquarie Asset  Management portfolio company, has a  robust resilience strategy that supports  the electricity network operator to  provide safe and reliable power to over  one million homes and businesses.  ===== PAGE 37 ===== 34 Strategy Appendices About this Report Governance Metrics & Targets Foreword from   Macquarie’s CEO Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report Risk Management  Risk Management Macquarie’s Risk Management Framework (RMF) Macquarie’s RMF is the totality of systems, structures, policies,  processes, and people within Macquarie that identify, measure,  evaluate, monitor, report, and control or mitigate all internal and  external sources of material risk. It is underpinned by the Risk  Appetite Statement and Risk Management Strategy: •	 Risk Appetite Statement: Defines the overarching risk-taking  settings of Macquarie and its subsidiaries.  •	 Risk Management Strategy: Serves to set out Macquarie’s  RMF, including describing each material risk identified, and our  approach to managing these risks. Macquarie’s Risk Appetite Statement and Risk Management Strategy  have been updated to reflect our treatment of climate risk. This  ensures qualitative updates are provided to senior management.  The risks of climate change to Macquarie (climate risk) are the  financial and non-financial risks arising from physical climate  risk, transition climate risk or liability climate risk drivers: •	 physical climate risk includes the chronic risk arising from  progressive shifts in climate patterns and the acute risk  presented by changes to the frequency and magnitude  of extreme weather events;  •	 transition climate risk includes risk arising directly or  indirectly from the process of (orderly or disorderly)  adjustment towards a lower-carbon and more  environmentally sustainable economy, including changes  in policy and regulatory settings, technological innovation,  social adaptation and market changes; and  •	 liability climate risk arises from the potential for litigation  or regulatory enforcement due to the failure to adequately  consider or respond to the impacts of climate change. Macquarie continues to embed and enhance the identification,  assessment, monitoring, management and reporting of climate  risks across the RMF. Existing policies and processes that support  the RMF are largely risk agnostic and therefore appropriate for the  management of climate-related risks, examples include:  Risk and Control Management  Macquarie’s Risk and Control Management Policy outlines the  principles that govern our risk practices, ensuring Macquarie  maintains a strong control environment and can effectively  monitor the risk profile of its activities on an ongoing basis. A Risk  and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) is performed semi-annually  to assess all material risks across the organisation, aligned to the  products, services and enterprise-wide activities that Macquarie  performs.  This year, teams responsible for completing the RCSA were provided  guidance on the treatment of climate-related risks to support the  appropriate identification of risks and relevant controls. Incident and Issue Management  Macquarie’s Incidents and Issues Policy aims to ensure suspected  or actual incidents and issues are rectified quickly and effectively  to limit their impact to our clients, counterparties, the markets and  communities in which we operate, our people and our reputation.  A risk event caused by climate change would be captured under  the Policy.  This year, we continued to embed climate risk in our existing  processes and Operational Risk teams received guidance on how  to identify and log climate-related incidents and issues.  New Product and Business Approval  Macquarie’s New Product and Business Approval Policy sets out the  change approval requirements for new products, new businesses,  major organisational projects or significant changes to products,  businesses, processes, or systems. An environmental and social  risk (ESR) review is required for all new business activities, in line  with the ESR Policy requirements. In addition, Macquarie’s Business  Services Division considers environmental obligations for new  or material changes to supplier arrangements.  ===== PAGE 38 ===== 35 Strategy Appendices About this Report Governance Metrics & Targets Foreword from   Macquarie’s CEO Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report Risk Management  Risk Management Continued Climate-related impacts on our material risks (1)	 This table is not an exhaustive list of risk types or climate impacts, rather demonstrative examples. The risks of climate change to Macquarie (climate risk) are considered cross-cutting. This means that we recognise climate risk may impact a  broad range of material risks within our RMF, for example:(1) Material risk type Examples of potential climate-related impacts Risk identification and management processes Credit/ Equity/ Asset Where Macquarie has a direct interest in an asset, potential financial  impacts include: 	• Reduced revenues from production outages. 	• Remediation and repair costs. 	• Reduced revenues from shifts in demand or the introduction of  carbon pricing. 	• Reduction in asset values or stranded assets. 	• Litigation and regulatory-related costs and liabilities. For loan exposures, the impacts on our clients could result in:  	• Loan defaults.  	• Decline in value of assets used as collateral.  	• Increase in utilisation of credit facilities. 	• Credit portfolio analysis and transaction due  diligence processes. 	• Physical and transition risk scenario analysis  (refer to scenario analysis section). Environmental & Social There is a risk of reputational or financial impacts due to failure to  identify or manage material environmental or social issues arising from  climate risks impacting on our investment, financing, client activities or  supply chain. 	• Implementation of the Environmental and  Social Risk Policy. 	• Implementation of the Greenwashing  Standard. Market/ Liquidity The risk of reduction in market value of Macquarie’s assets, or an  increase in the volatility of interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity  prices and commodity prices. 	• Physical and transition risk scenario analysis  (refer to scenario analysis section). Operational Risk Increased frequency and impact of extreme weather events could  result in greater operational disruption at one or more Macquarie  business locations. 	• Our Business Resilience standard protects  against disruption caused by severe  weather events.  Regulatory & Compliance/  Legal/ Conduct Climate risk increases litigation and regulatory enforcement risk, and  the likelihood of reputational damage due to failure to comply with  current or emerging climate risk regulations or market expectations.  This includes the risk of real or perceived misrepresentation during the  creation of new products and public disclosures. 	• Conduct Management and Code of Conduct.  	• Global horizon scanning and triage activities. 	• Implementation of the Greenwashing  Standard. Strategic Strategic risk is the risk of Macquarie’s business model being  inadequate in the medium- to long-term. Transition climate risk directly  impacts Macquarie’s strategic risk. 	• Macquarie’s annual strategy and business  planning process.  Work Health & Safety The risk of incidence of work-related injury, illness or disease or other  events impacting health and safety of employees, contractors, visitors,  and members of the public is heightened by physical climate risks. 	• Implementation of the Work Health and  Safety Policy (refer to page 53 of Macquarie’s  FY2023 ESG Report).  ===== PAGE 39 ===== 36 Strategy Appendices About this Report Governance Metrics & Targets Foreword from   Macquarie’s CEO Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report Risk Management  Risk Management Continued Credit Risk Macquarie regularly conducts sector-specific credit portfolio  analysis, monitoring credit concentration by counterparty, country,  risk type, industry, and credit quality. The assessment of climate  and environmental risks for new transactions and investments  is managed in consultation with ESR teams as part of the credit  approval process. This year, we continued to embed climate into our existing  processes and updated our Credit Risk Management Framework  to include our definitions of climate risk. We are working to embed  the analysis of climate risk, with a particular focus on transition  risk and exploring how climate risk scorecards can support credit  risk assessments. Environmental & Social Risk Our approach to managing climate risk is underpinned by  Macquarie’s group-wide ESR Policy, which describes our approach  to ESR management when onboarding or reviewing clients and  other counterparties across a broad range of transactions including  equity investments, financing, leasing and advisory mandates. The  ESR Policy provides a process for embedding ESR management into  investment decision-making. It takes a precautionary approach to  ESR issues and provides escalated decision-making and approval,  alongside the credit approval process, for material environmental  and social risks. A new transaction review system has also been  implemented to better manage and assess transactions and  clients from an ESR perspective. Over time, it will be enhanced  to incorporate more specific climate and environmental risk  considerations to better support risk assessments, decision-making  and risk reporting. In FY2023, we further developed our analysis of environmental,  social, and climate-related risks, beginning with European entities.  Analysis considers the materiality of climate and environmental  risks on separate legal entities, including considering relevant  regulatory expectations and requirements for that legal entity as  well as the environmental and social risk profile of transactions and  clients of that entity. This is communicated to entity-level boards  as appropriate. In FY2024, we plan to further develop climate-related metrics, to  better inform practices and associated senior management and  Board reporting, as well as evaluate our approach to deforestation  and nature-related risks. Market Risk Macquarie’s trading businesses do not typically take illiquid,  long-dated market risk positions. If market conditions became  unfavourable as a result of physical or transition risk from  climate change, Macquarie could exit the affected markets. This  is applicable whether risk is driven by equity and commodity  prices, interest rates or foreign exchange. Scenario analysis and  stress-testing are used to quantify and constrain our exposure  to market volatility that might result from these risks. For the  treatment of large derivative exposures, refer to the section on  ‘Credit Risk’ above. Operational Risk Macquarie’s Business Resilience Standard helps mitigate  climate-related operational risk. The Standard is aimed to  protect against business disruption caused by events including  severe weather. Business resilience plans document the recovery  strategies, activities and actions to prepare for and manage  disruptions to Macquarie.  Regulatory & Compliance Established functions within the Risk Management Group, namely  Compliance and Prudential Risk, provide oversight and advice on  climate risk regulation and industry guidance (both prudential and  non-prudential) and undertake global horizon scanning to ensure  regulatory requirements and expectations are being met.  To help manage legal, regulatory and reputational risks relating to  greenwashing, in June 2023 Macquarie launched a Greenwashing  Standard to provide guidance to our people on how to identify  and manage greenwashing risk. Greenwashing training and  accompanying Q&A sessions have been provided for targeted  groups/divisions. Strategic Risk Managed through Macquarie’s annual strategy and business planning  process, the business is responsible for regularly reassessing their  business strategy and the potential risk arising from their strategy.  To help mitigate the risk of our strategy/business model not aligning  with our commitment to net zero, Macquarie introduced a Net  Zero Risk Assessment (NZRA) process to appropriately consider  sector-level targets in financing decisions for carbon-intensive  sectors in our institutional-side businesses. For motor vehicles, we  have implemented portfolio review and management reporting  processes. See Section 5 — Metrics & Targets for more detail. In Macquarie Bank Europe (MBE), representatives from across  the business were involved in assessing the implications of  varying transition paths on the existing business strategy, where  the findings of this scenario analysis will be embedded in the  MBE business strategy.  ===== PAGE 40 ===== 37 Strategy Appendices About this Report Governance Metrics & Targets Foreword from   Macquarie’s CEO Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report Risk Management  Risk Management Continued Scenario analysis Since our first climate-specific report in 2019, Macquarie has  continued to conduct scenario analysis to help identify and assess  Macquarie’s exposure to physical and transition risks, in line  with Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)  recommendations. Details of this scenario analysis can be found on  Macquarie’s website and in Macquarie’s Annual Reports. In 2023, we ran two scenarios: an orderly transition scenario and a  rapid transition scenario. We have enhanced our scenario analysis  capabilities, with key areas of uplift being the establishment of a  scenario development process and refinement of our transition risk  modelling capabilities for the oil and gas sector. Additionally, we  have completed further transition risk analysis across all sectors  of MBE exposures to understand any further impacts on this  contained portfolio. Macquarie’s climate scenario analysis efforts have included  strengthening our approaches, methodologies, insights, and  addressing a number of learnings identified from the Australian  Prudential Regulation Authority’s 2022 Climate Vulnerability  Assessment exercise and the initial exploratory analysis conducted  for MBE in 2021. Highlights from the analysis activities undertaken  in 2023 include: •	 assessment of the climate scenario analysis approaches and  methodologies used by international peers and required by  regulators in order to understand emerging best practice; •	 review of data used in climate scenario analysis (both internal  data and external climate scenario data) to better understand  data quality and associated challenges; •	 establishment of overarching scenario analysis objectives to  assist with climate scenario selection and scenario development  across Macquarie; and •	 completion of transition risk focused scenario analysis,  including uplift of the approach, the qualitative and quantitative  methodologies used, and the sector-specific credit modelling  used for the oil and gas sector. The analysis identified the impact of transition risk to the   overall oil and gas sector across the regions and portfolios where we   have exposure. Based on the findings, we concluded that our   business models remain resilient and there are no material  risks in the short-term. It also informed our climate risk model  development, identifying: •	 underlying drivers within the oil and gas portfolio to inform  transition risk model development; •	 the severity and impact of the two scenarios at a global and  regional level; and •	 areas of uncertainty in the climate scenarios to facilitate further  sensitivity analysis. The MBE analysis was extended to capture further impacts at the  entity-level. Highlights include: •	 qualitative assessments of anticipated capital and liquidity  impacts, following the quantitative risk driver assessments  across revenues, exposures, and expected credit losses; and •	 the integration of the findings into business strategy and  forecasting for MBE, including the identification of potential  areas of opportunities and risks. Whilst significant progress has been made to understand the  potential risks presented by climate change in Macquarie’s portfolio  through scenario analysis, we intend to continue to develop our  impact analysis capabilities. The insights we gain will continue  to inform business strategy and forecasting where appropriate  and will support the further enhancement of our risk analysis and  modelling capabilities.  ===== PAGE 41 ===== 38 Strategy Appendices About this Report Governance Metrics & Targets Foreword from   Macquarie’s CEO Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report Risk Management  Risk Management Continued Climate risk reporting As outlined in Section 3 — Governance, we ensure our Boards  and Board Governance and Compliance Committees receive  twice-yearly updates through ESR’s Material Risk Report and  additional interim updates as required. These provide the Boards  and Board Committees with material period-on-period trends in risk  profile and a view of the effectiveness of the ESR Risk Management  Framework. We continue to improve our internal reporting to  management and are now working towards developing relevant  climate risk metrics that our Boards can use to better manage and  oversee climate and environmental related risks. Refer to Section 5 — Metrics & Targets for further detail on  reporting processes in place for our sector-specific targets. In addition to internal reporting, we continue to align our external  disclosures with the TCFD recommendations, related emerging  industry standards and best practices and other reporting  commitments such as those set out in the Net-Zero Banking Alliance  (NZBA) Guidelines. Given the growing range of standards and best  practices, Macquarie welcomes moves by regulators, governments  and strategic industry bodies to support production of increased  harmonised guidance on climate-related risk management and  reporting approaches across the industry. This includes the work of  the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) under the  International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation.  We participate in voluntary external benchmarking initiatives and  surveys, as a means of staying connected to industry best practice  and monitoring our maturity. Macquarie also engages with the  Australian Banking Association on transition planning and climate  risk (among other topics) to support an orderly transition. Providing our people with the resources to   support our climate goals Macquarie has a comprehensive database of resources available  to further the knowledge of our people on climate-related topics.  This provides information on our climate-related capabilities and  commitments, Macquarie’s global partnerships across the private  and public sector, case studies of our expertise in action, and the  latest news and reporting from across Macquarie. For example, the  Climate Intelligence Unit (CIU) provides weekly briefings on climate  matters that are accessible to all of our people.  In addition to information sharing, Macquarie-wide climate risk  awareness training was delivered this year, providing education on  climate change, the energy transition and climate risk at Macquarie.  We continue to assess ongoing training needs. This year Macquarie Asset Management (MAM) released a new  publicly available podcast series, Navigating to Net Zero. The  podcast included stories from leaders at MAM’s infrastructure  portfolio companies and real estate properties who share unique  insights into their business’ decarbonisation challenges and the  practical climate solutions they are implementing. We are proud to work with our people on cultivating a culture  of sustainability and empowering our workforce to recognise  opportunities for improving our management of climate risk. This is  supported by networks such as: the Banking and Financial Services  Sustainability Employee Network Group, the Green Law Community  (a Macquarie-wide group of lawyers who share knowledge and  discuss issues on green law) and Green@Macquarie (an internal  network on sustainability issues with around 2,500 members).  ===== PAGE 42 ===== Image source: Squadron Energy and Sapphire Wind Farm  Appendices Sapphire Wind Farm,   New South Wales, Australia  (1)	 https://www.squadronenergy.com/our-projects/ sapphire-wind-farm Macquarie Capital acted as exclusive  financial adviser to Partners Group on  the sale of CWP Renewables to Squadron  Energy, which operates Sapphire Wind  Farm – currently the largest operational  wind farm in New South Wales.(1)  ===== PAGE 43 ===== 40 Strategy Risk Management  About this Report Governance Metrics & Targets Foreword from   Macquarie’s CEO Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report Appendices Appendices Appendix 1: Methodology for the emissions of Macquarie Group’s own  business operations (2)	 ‘Measurement Determination’, Australian Government, Clean Energy Regulator, 6 September 2023, https://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/ Energy consumption and Scope 1 and Scope 2  emissions for the year ended 31 March 2023 Operational boundary for energy consumption and  Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for  corporate offices and data centres Macquarie’s corporate offices and data centres are  defined as:  •	 Offices leased by Macquarie Group Limited (MGL) and its  subsidiaries, which are also occupied by Macquarie people and  have a Net Usable Area (i.e., the area that can be fitted out by the  tenant) of greater than 100m2.  •	 Data centres around the world where Macquarie has oversight of  electricity usage and pays for this usage. •	 New offices from business acquisitions from the month the  acquisition is completed.  The following exclusions have been applied in determining the  reporting boundary for corporate offices and data centres:  •	 Offices or buildings that are owned or managed by an MGL entity  but are not tenanted by Macquarie people. •	 Serviced offices, data centres and cloud computing services used  by MGL where MGL has no oversight of the energy usage of the  office, data centre and cloud computing services. Energy costs  for serviced offices are typically included as part of a service fee.  •	 Joint venture offices. Joint venture offices are defined as offices  where Macquarie people may be located as part of a joint  venture business activity but where Macquarie has limited  ability to influence the operation of these offices and does  not have oversight of the data required to calculate electricity  consumption and GHG emissions.  •	 Properties associated with businesses acquired by Macquarie  that are operationally segregated subsidiaries (OSSs – refer  to Appendix 5 — Glossary) are excluded until such time as  the associated lease obligations are renewed by Macquarie  post-acquisition. Macquarie’s base buildings are defined as: Offices or buildings where Macquarie owns and occupies the  building. Base building energy refers to the energy required to  operate the mechanical plant, lifts, and lighting in the lobby and  other communal areas.  The following exclusions have been applied in determining the  reporting boundary for base buildings: •	 Energy use in this category excludes tenanted energy use in  Macquarie owned and operated buildings. •	 OSSs. Process for calculating energy consumption and  Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions Scope 1 emissions: Direct emissions associated with  diesel, natural gas and refrigerant usage Scope 1 emissions for the baseline reporting period were estimated  by multiplying energy usage by relevant emission factors from  government or international sources. Usage has been sourced directly from meter data, supplier, or  property owner invoices, where available. Approximately 82 per cent  of Scope 1 emissions data for the reporting period was obtained  directly from actual meter usage data, supplier, or property owner  invoices. Where no tank meter readings were available, diesel usage  was estimated based on engine performance data from diesel  generator data sheets. For natural gas, where no invoiced data  was available, usage was estimated based on usage in comparable  offices. For refrigerant gases, usage was estimated based on  refrigerant charge and leakage rates in accordance with the  National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) (Measurement)  Determination 2008.(2) Emission factors have then been applied to determine the  equivalent direct emissions associated with diesel, natural gas and  refrigerants consumed (Scope 1 emissions). Scope 2 emissions: Indirect emissions associated  with total electricity consumed Approximately 82 per cent of the electricity usage data for the  baseline reporting period was obtained directly from the actual  tenancy or building data, where available, and the remaining  18 per cent of energy consumption was estimated by one of the  following prioritised data methodologies:  1.	 To account for seasonal variances, estimates are derived  as follows: 	– Where a clear seasonal trend exists from previous reporting  periods, the estimate is based on an extrapolation of these  trends and adjusted for any year-on-year overall movements. 	– Where no clear seasonal trend exists from previous reporting  periods, the actual figure for the same period in the prior year  is used as the estimate.  2.	 Where invoiced data exists for part of the reporting period,  the average daily invoiced electricity consumed for that part  of the reporting period is determined and extrapolated out  to the remainder of the reporting period. This method is used  when some of the invoiced data within the reporting period is  unavailable from the energy providers.  3.	 Where no invoiced data is available for a particular office, the  electricity consumed for that office is estimated based on  the Net Lettable Area of the office and the average electricity  consumption per square metre of other offices in the  same region.   ===== PAGE 44 ===== 41 Strategy Risk Management  About this Report Governance Metrics & Targets Foreword from   Macquarie’s CEO Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report Appendices Appendices Continued   Emission factors have then been applied to determine the  equivalent indirect emissions associated with electricity consumed  (Scope 2 emissions). Scope 3 operational emissions Categories 1-6 and  8 for the year ended 31 March 2023 Coverage of Scope 3 GHG emissions of our own  business operations  Category 1: Purchased goods and services (including  capital goods, upstream leased assets, and  upstream transportation and distribution) This category covers emissions arising from the procurement of  goods and services (including capital goods, upstream leased assets  and upstream transportation and distribution) that are paid for via  Macquarie’s procurement system and are categorised according to  Macquarie’s internal taxonomy codes. This excludes transactions  not associated with the purchase of goods and services and capital  goods where identifiable e.g., intra-company and payroll payments,  community/charitable donations, and taxation-related spend. Currently, due to data limitations, this category excludes capital  expenditure on the development of our global headquarters 1  Elizabeth Street, Sydney, due to be completed in 2024. These offices  will be included in Scope 1 and Scope 2 reporting from FY2025. Category 2: Capital goods Given the capital goods spend data has been captured in the  calculation methodology for Category 1, emissions related to  Category 2 are not reported separately. Category 3: Fuel- and energy-related activities This category covers emissions arising from the extraction,  production and transportation of fuels and energy consumed  by Macquarie (being electricity, steam, heating, and cooling),  including transmission and distribution (T&D) losses. Only electricity  is included in the calculation as other fuels and energy are not  material. It includes emissions from Macquarie’s global corporate  offices, data centres and base buildings. Category 4: Upstream transportation and  distribution Given the upstream transportation and distribution spend data  has been captured in the calculation methodology for Category 1,  emissions related to Category 4 are not reported separately. Category 5: Waste generated in operations This category covers emissions arising from the disposal and  treatment of waste generated in operations. Exclusions:  •	 e-waste. •	 Construction waste. •	 Effluents and wastewater. Category 6: Business travel The primary source of business-related travel emissions data  is Macquarie’s exclusive global corporate credit card provider,  American Express, and includes air travel (by cabin flown), hotels,  ground transport (excluding rail) and food and beverage (which  includes meals while travelling and other forms of food and  beverage activity that may not be related to business travel such as  staff or client entertainment). Category 8: Upstream leased assets  Given the upstream leased assets spend data has been captured in  the calculation methodology for Category 1, emissions related to  Category 8 are not reported separately. Process description  Category 1: Purchased goods and services (including  capital goods, upstream leased assets, and  upstream transportation and distribution) The “spend-based” method (as per the GHG Protocol Scope 3  Guidance) was used to calculate these emissions, with  industry-average emission factors applied based on the economic  value of the goods and services and capital goods (upstream leased  assets and upstream transportation and distribution) processed via  Macquarie’s procurement system.  Spend data was extracted from Macquarie’s procurement system,  which was categorised according to Macquarie’s internal taxonomy  codes and uploaded to an emissions calculation platform where  emission factors were applied. This platform applies the United  States Environmentally-Extended Input-Output (USEEIO) dataset  that estimates cradle-to-gate GHG emissions for each given  industry or product category. The corresponding USEEIO emission factors were mapped against  Macquarie’s internal taxonomy and then applied to calculate overall  emissions for this category. A weighted average emission factor was  applied for any uncategorised spend.  The latest USEEIO release provides data through to 2018 with  emission factors denominated in $US. These were translated to the  relevant period (i.e., to Macquarie FY2023) using relative price levels  and then to the relevant currency (i.e., from $US to $A) using the  period average exchange rate.  Emissions Spend by category × = ∑ converted emission factor  (Ef) by category ( ) Category 2: Capital goods  Capital goods are included under Category 1, as described above.  ===== PAGE 45 ===== 42 Strategy Risk Management  About this Report Governance Metrics & Targets Foreword from   Macquarie’s CEO Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report Appendices Appendices Continued Category 3: Fuel- and energy-related activities As discussed above, Category 3 covers emissions arising from the  extraction, production and transportation of fuels and energy  consumed by Macquarie (being electricity, steam, heating, and  cooling), including T&D losses. Usage is based on invoice data from  energy retailers or property owners, where available, or estimated  based on comparable offices. For energy consumed in Australia,  state-level emission factors were used, based on the National  Greenhouse Accounts Factors published by the Department of  Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (2021 & 2022).  For energy consumed outside of Australia, emission factors by  country were used based on the UK Government GHG Conversion  Factors for Company Reporting, Department of Environment, Food  and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) Emission Factors (2021). Category 4: Upstream transportation and  distribution  Upstream transportation and distribution are included under  Category 1, as described above. Category 5: Waste generated in operations  Data for waste generated in operations has been sourced directly  from property owner or cleaning provider reports. Due to limited  data availability, tonnes/FTE was calculated for sites where data  was available (Sydney: 1 Martin Place, 50 Martin Place, 1 Shelley  Street and London: Ropemaker Street), representing approximately  50 per cent of our global people. This was then extrapolated out to  the remaining population of our people to estimate global emissions  for waste generated in operations on a per capita basis. The  headcount number excludes Macquarie people on extended leave,  people at a non-Macquarie office, casual people, and non-executive  directors. Emission factors are based on the UK Government GHG  Conversion Factors for Company Reporting, DEFRA Emission  Factors (2022).  Category 6: Business travel Business travel emissions are calculated by American Express based  on spend on corporate cards. American Express utilises emission  factors for the relevant reporting period, based on government  or international sources, to determine the equivalent indirect  emissions associated with air travel, hotel, ground transport, and  food and beverage spend and associated activity data.  American Express estimates GHG emissions (tonnes CO2e)  as follows:  •	 Air travel: emission calculations are based on distance per flight  segment or leg, with the emission factor determined by class of  ticket and flight haul type, with reference to spend and DEFRA   conversion factors (2022).  •	 Hotel: emission calculations are based on total hotel spend at  a particular hotel and the average daily rate per Business Travel  News’s Corporate Travel Index to estimate room nights based on  location, with reference to Smith Travel Research’s database to  identify the class of service for each hotel. The emission factor  is determined by class of hotel service and property location per  the Cornell Hotel Sustainability Benchmark Index (2021). •	 Ground transport: emission calculations are based on spend  on taxis, car rentals and ride shares, where the average distance  travelled is determined with reference to Numbeo’s report of  Prices by Country of Taxi 1km (Normal Tariff) (Transportation)  (2023). The emission factor is based on car type, as determined  by American Express using internally developed codes and  DEFRA conversion factors (2022). •	 Food and beverage: emission calculations are based on spend  by restaurant category and the United States EPA factors (2023).  Restaurant category is determined by both industry codes and  American Express merchant classifications. Category 8: Upstream leased assets  Upstream leased assets are included under Category 1,   as described above.

Scope Our current product scope, in line with the Net-Zero Banking  Alliance (NZBA) Guidelines, includes on‑balance sheet lending and  equity investments.(3) This means that certain types of investments  are not in scope, e.g., underlying investment vehicles managed by  Macquarie Asset Management. However, we have included other  products where methodology and data are available. For example,  in the motor vehicle sector, we focused on asset finance activity,  which includes lending and novated leases. Our financed emissions  work includes the on‑balance sheet activities of both the banking  and non‑banking businesses of Macquarie. Refer to Appendix 3 for  further details on product scope. In defining organisational boundaries (e.g., entity inclusion),  Macquarie applies an operational control approach, as defined in the  Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol.(4)  Exposure To determine the amount of exposure to a sector and/or client,  we use an Exposure at Default (EAD) measure as at the end of  the financial year. We use EAD because it is a well‑recognised and  understood data point, which we already use in external regulatory  reporting, and is therefore already governed by Macquarie’s data  framework. By using EAD we include both drawn and undrawn components  of our exposure. This ensures a more complete analysis of our  exposure to carbon‑intensive sectors and reduces potential  volatility from any scenarios where clients draw down on the  committed portion of existing loan agreements. Where client reporting periods differ from Macquarie’s reporting  year end, we have taken their latest available data as disclosed on or  prior to our year end. Where client emissions are reported to government entities and a  data lag may exist, the most recent period available for a client has  been used. Metrics When reporting emissions, we report in carbon dioxide equivalents  (CO2e) to account for other GHGs where they are material. Baseline year Prior to assessing net zero pathways and targets, we establish our  financed emissions baseline for each in-scope sector. This is where  several methodological determinations are made. Our financed emissions baseline reporting year for oil/gas,  motor vehicles and coal mining is from 1 April 2019 to 31 March  2020 (Macquarie’s financial year 2020, FY2020) – this takes into  consideration potential distortions caused by the COVID-19  pandemic in FY2021 and to a lesser extent in FY2022. Our financed emissions baseline reporting year for residential  mortgages is from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 (FY2021) – this  closely aligns with the most recent reporting periods of the  government data sources in our proxy analysis. Sector-specific methodology In addition to the sector-level methodology decisions described  in Section 5 — Metrics & Targets, below we provide further  clarification of our methodology for each sector. Oil/gas  In analysing the sector, we considered the upstream, midstream,  and downstream segments. The upstream segment includes  exploration and production activities such as drilling wells and  extracting oil/gas deposits; the midstream segment includes  transporting, including via gas pipelines, and storing oil/gas; and the  downstream segment includes refining crude oil and natural gas into  end-use products such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel that are then  sent to energy providers, gas stations, or other distributors and  retail outlets. In estimating the emissions associated with the oil/gas sector, we  focused our analysis on Scope 1 and 2 of the upstream segment, as  well as Scope 3 combustion by end-users. Our methodology for emissions initially relies on emissions reported  by our clients, sourced either via public databases (e.g., CDP, NGER)  or reported by clients directly to us. Most emissions sourced via this  method were given a Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials  (PCAF) data quality score of 2, as they were not independently  verified. We also performed reasonableness checks on reported  emissions relative to industry benchmarks. Some of our clients did not report their Scope 1 and 2 emissions  (15 per cent by FY2023 sector exposure) and most did not report  their Scope 3 emissions (94 per cent by FY2023 sector exposure).  In those instances, we proxied our clients’ emissions using client  reported production data and weighted emissions intensity factors  estimated using the following publications from the International  Energy Agency (IEA): •	 Methane Tracker 2020.(5) •	 The Energy Security Case for Tackling Gas Flaring and  Methane Leaks.(6) •	 Tracking Clean Energy Progress 2023.(7) •	 World Energy Outlook 2022.(8)  ===== PAGE 47 ===== 44 Strategy Risk Management  About this Report Governance Metrics & Targets Foreword from   Macquarie’s CEO Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report Appendices Appendices Continued In estimating our clients’ emissions for Scope 1 and 2 our  methodology covers both carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane  associated with production of oil/gas products. For Scope 3,  we capture end-use emissions, namely CO2 released into the  atmosphere from combustion.  Emissions estimated using this proxy method were given a data  quality score of 3. Where required, emissions intensities were converted using the BP  Statistical Review of World Energy.(9) For the remaining exposure, where production data of our clients  was not known, emissions were proxied using the average intensity  of our sector exposure for which emissions had been calculated.  This methodology was used for approximately 1 per cent of the  sector by exposure and the resultant emissions were given the  lowest data quality score of 5. We attributed oil/gas clients’ absolute emissions to Macquarie  based on the PCAF Standard and quantified the oil/gas sector  emissions intensity in gCO2e/MJ. Exposure to, and emissions from, upstream pre-production oil/ gas clients were included in overall sector exposure and absolute  emissions calculations, but were excluded from emissions intensity  calculations as those clients have zero production. Motor vehicles  In the motor vehicles sector, we covered our vehicle finance  business in Banking and Financial Services (BFS), namely passenger  cars and light commercial vehicles offered in Australia. Other vehicle  types financed by BFS (such as trucks, buses, motorcycles) make  up a smaller part of the sector and may be considered separately  in future disclosures. In 2021, Macquarie sold its dealer finance  business, therefore it has not been included. Product scope in this sector includes consumer loans, commercial  loans, and novated leases. While novated leasing is not included  in NZBA product scope for financed emissions, we included  this product given its similarity to loans, consistency of the  methodology between the two products, and availability of data.  In line with the PCAF Standard, we include Scope 1 and Scope 2  emissions for vehicles we finance: •	 Scope 1: emissions from fuel combustion for internal  combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and plug‑in hybrid electric  vehicles (PHEVs); and (9)	 ‘Statistical Review of World Energy’, bp, 28 June 2022, https://www.bp.com/ (10)	 ‘Vehicle Standard (Australian Design Rule 81/02 — Fuel Consumption Labelling for Light Vehicles) 2008’, Australian Government, Federal Register of Legislation, 1 October 2011,  https://www.legislation.gov.au/ and ‘Vehicle Standard (Australian Design Rule – Definitions an Vehicle Categories) 2005’, Australian Government, Federal Register of Legislation,  31 May 2012, https://www.legislation.gov.au/ (11)	 ‘Survey of Motor Vehicle Use, Australia’, Australian Bureau of Statistics, accessed September 2023, https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/ (12)	 ‘About us’, Green Vehicle Guide, accessed September 2023, https://www.greenvehicleguide.gov.au/ (13)	 ‘Australian National Greenhouse Accounts Factors Workbook’, Australian Government Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water, accessed September  2023, https://www.dcceew.gov.au/climate-change/publications/national-greenhouse-accounts-factors •	 Scope 2: emissions from electricity used to charge electric  vehicles (EVs) and PHEVs.  The Australian vehicle emissions testing regime is limited to CO2;  however, to capture carbon equivalents, the emissions calculation  has been expanded to also include methane and nitrous oxide from  tailpipe emissions. We used the PCAF methodology to attribute vehicle emissions to  our financing of those vehicles. Vehicle emissions were calculated based on known make and model  vehicle efficiency and fuel type data used as part of the Australian  Government Vehicle Fuel Consumption Labelling Standard(10) and  data obtained from industry sources. Where this was unknown  or emission factors were required to derive CO2e per km, this  information was obtained from government sources including the  Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Motor Vehicle Usage Survey,(11)  Green Vehicle Guide(12) and Australian National Greenhouse  Accounts.(13) The distance travelled data was sourced from the ABS Motor Vehicle  Usage Survey. It is worth noting that the latest survey published in  2020 uses a reference period impacted by restrictions in movement  due to COVID-19. Therefore, we have not used the data directly from  that survey for our FY2020 baseline, and instead derived it using  a growth rate between the data published in the 2016 and 2018  surveys. This data input in our methodology will remain constant  until a new survey is released.  We quantified the motor vehicle sector emissions intensity in  gCO2e/km based on the following formula: Coal mining In the coal mining sector, emissions include our clients’ Scope 1, 2  and 3 emissions (use of sold products, i.e., CO2 from combustion),  based on client-level data, where available. Where client-level data was not available, we estimated emissions by: •	 Scope 1 and 2: multiplying the client reported production data by  the average physical emissions intensity of clients who reported  their Scope 1 and 2 emissions within our sector exposure.

Where required, emissions intensities were converted using the  National Greenhouse Accounts Factors.(15) We attributed our clients’ absolute emissions to Macquarie based on  the PCAF Standard: Power generation In line with industry practice and the NZBA Guidelines, we measure  companies’ direct Scope 1 emissions from power generation, which  allows us to focus our analysis on the segment responsible for most  of the sector’s emissions and consequently where the greatest  amount of strategic focus and investment is required. The Scope 2  and Scope 3 emissions for companies that generate electricity from  fossil fuels are generally comparatively small and/or do not relate  directly to power generation activity. In the initial analysis of the sector we considered the pre-generation,  power generation, distribution and storage, and power supply  segments. The pre-generation segment includes primary energy  acquisition and the development and construction of power  generation assets; the power generation segment includes  generation from fossil fuel sources, renewable sources, waste to  energy sources and multi-utility and gentailers; the distribution and  storage segment includes grid transmission, battery and pumped  hydro energy storage and wholesale electricity trading; the power  supply segment includes retail and industry consumers and EV  charging utilities and infrastructure. We focused our emissions measurement on the power generation  segment and only included clients whose primary activity(16) is  electricity generation and who contribute energy to the grid, as well  as any multi-utility companies and gentailers who have operational  generation assets. We focused on Scope 1 emissions associated  with power generation only, given it relates to combustion of fossil  fuels, the biggest contributor to the sector’s emissions. Our methodology for emissions measurement prioritises data  reported by our clients, sourced either via public databases  (e.g., CDP, NGER, EPA) or reported by clients directly to us. Most  emissions sourced via this method were given a PCAF data quality  score of 2, as they were not independently verified. We also  performed reasonableness checks on reported emissions relative to  industry benchmarks.

(19)	 ‘Electricity and Gas consumption benchmarks for residential customers 2020’, Australian Government, Australian Energy Regulator, 11 June 2020, https://www.aer.gov.au/ For renewable power generation (e.g., solar, wind power), where our  clients do not report their emissions, we have used the National  Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) emission factors.(17) NREL  emission factors do not currently distinguish between Scope 1 and  2. Therefore taking a conservative approach, our calculations of  Scope 1 emissions associated with renewable power generation  assets also include Scope 2 emissions, which are immaterial. For  waste to energy where clients did not report emissions, we used  factors from comparable clients within our Green Investment  Group Financed Emissions Report where Government sources  were not readily available. Emissions estimated using these methods  were given a data quality score of 3. For the remaining exposure, where production data of our clients  was not known, or where the exposure was below a threshold of  $A5 million, emissions were proxied using the average intensity of  our sector exposure for which emissions had been calculated. This  methodology was used for approximately 4 per cent of the sector  by exposure and the resultant emissions were given the lowest data  quality score of 5. We attributed our clients’ absolute emissions to Macquarie based  on the PCAF Standard and quantified the power generation sector  emissions intensity in kgCO2e/MWh using our sector exposure  weighted average physical emissions intensity formula from  page 44 (oil/gas). Residential mortgages Our residential mortgages sector covers Australian loans issued by  BFS secured by residential property,(18) excluding reverse mortgages,  committed exposures where the facility has been approved but  not settled before the reporting period, and non-retail residential  property exposure.  In line with the PCAF Standard, we include Scope 1 and 2 emissions  related to residential mortgages: •	 Scope 1: emissions from on-site fuel combustion (e.g., for  heating and cooking), including natural gas and liquefied  petroleum gas (LPG). •	 Scope 2: emissions from the generation of electricity used on the  property (e.g., for appliances, heating, and cooling).  For Scope 1 and 2, we include CO2 as well as other greenhouse gases  including methane and nitrous oxide.  Our estimates for household energy consumption covering  electricity, gas and LPG are based on two national data sources  given this information is not readily available at a property-level:  •	 The primary source is the Australian Energy Regulator (AER)  Electricity and Gas consumption benchmarks for 2020,(19) which  estimates consumption based on household size, state and  climate zone. We have used the number of bedrooms (sourced  from external data providers) as a proxy for household size due  Financed emissions (Client emissions) × = ∑ Client financing in EAD Client EVIC (or Total debt + Equity, if private company)  ===== PAGE 49 ===== 46 Strategy Risk Management  About this Report Governance Metrics & Targets Foreword from   Macquarie’s CEO Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report Appendices Appendices Continued to data availability issues. Number of bedrooms is multiplied by  the ratio of average number of people per household (2.5) and  average number of bedrooms per dwelling (3.1) sourced from the  ABS 2021 Census data.  •	 Where AER data is unavailable, we use annual data from the  Australian Energy Statistics (AES) published by the Department  of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water.(20) AES  does not have the same level of household data disaggregation  that is available in the AER benchmarks. Household-level  estimates are obtained by dividing State/Territory residential  industry energy consumption by the estimated number of  dwellings within the State or Territory using data from the ABS.  This back-up approach is used for emissions related to LPG,  geographical areas not covered by AER benchmarks (Western  Australia and Northern Territory) and where household size  (proxied using number of bedrooms) is unknown. Once we have estimates for household energy consumption, we  then calculate emissions that occurred to produce that energy  (using emission factors). State grid emission factors are used for  electricity, which are derived from the composition of generation.(21)  Combustion emission factors are used for natural gas and LPG. Finally, we estimate the percentage of each household’s emissions  attributable to Macquarie. We do this by multiplying the estimated  emissions by the loan-to-value ratio, where property value is  estimated as at the latest client-led credit revaluation event.

Later, in  October 2021, we signed up to the Net-Zero Banking Alliance  (NZBA), which enabled us to partner with our peers and the industry  to leverage the NZBA Guidelines in developing our own financed  emissions methodology, in order to deliver on our commitments. Currently, the NZBA Guidelines cover on-balance sheet lending  and equity investments only. As such, the sections of this Report  relating to financed emissions cover our on-balance sheet lending  and equity investments activities excluding on-balance sheet  securities held for client facilitation and market-making purposes  (as opposed to held for investment). Note, for motor vehicles,  we have included novated leases, given availability of both  methodology and data.  Lending refers to loan assets held at amortised cost and excludes  certain items such as leasing, asset finance, trading assets and  short-term financing (e.g., inventory finance). Investments related to  our liquidity portfolio are also excluded. To determine which of Macquarie’s equity investments are in  scope of financed emissions, we are guided by our adoption of an  ‘operational control approach’, as defined by the GHG Protocol,  which helps us define our organisational boundaries. The NZBA Guidelines currently exclude the following activities from  the scope of the commitments:(25)  •	 Cash, cash balances at central banks and other demand deposits.  •	 Financial assets held for trading (trading book).  •	 Derivatives (hedge accounting). •	 Advisory services (including Mergers & Acquisitions). •	 Equity capital markets (structuring or advisory services on equity  instruments). •	 Debt capital markets (structuring or advisory services on debt  securities). •	 Brokerage activities. The NZBA have indicated their intention and plan to expand  the scope to facilitated emissions from banks’ capital markets  (i.e., underwriting) activities. We will consider expanding our  product scope to include facilitated emissions once a practicable  methodology is ready and adopted by the NZBA. The NZBA states that if entities within the group structure carry out  other types of business such as insurance, pension funds, or asset  management, those entities may follow alternative frameworks.  Therefore, activities undertaken by Macquarie Asset Management’s  funds are excluded from the scope of financed emissions.  ===== PAGE 52 ===== 49 Strategy Risk Management  About this Report Governance Metrics & Targets Foreword from   Macquarie’s CEO Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report Appendices Appendices Continued Appendix 4: Independent Limited Assurance Report To the Directors of Macquarie Group Limited Independent Limited Assurance Report on  identified Subject Matter in Macquarie Group  Limited’s 2023 Net Zero and Climate Risk Report  (‘the Report’) The Board of Directors of Macquarie Group Limited (‘Macquarie’  or ‘MGL’) and its subsidiaries (together ‘the Group’ or ‘Macquarie  Group’) engaged us to perform an independent limited assurance  engagement in respect of the identified metrics set out in  Appendix 1 of this independent limited assurance report (the  ‘Subject Matter’). Subject Matter and Criteria The criteria used by Macquarie to prepare the subject matter  information (‘the Criteria’) are established by Macquarie  management (‘Management’). The Criteria are outlined within the  following sections: •	 ‘Financed emissions methodology’ for Macquarie Group as set  out in Appendix 2 of the Report (pages 43 to 47) •	 ‘Financed Emissions - Scope of Activities’ as set out in  Appendix 3 of the Report (page 48) •	 ‘Glossary’ as set out in Appendix 5 of the Report (page 52 to 53) We assessed the Subject Matter against the Criteria. The Subject  Matter needs to be read and understood together with the Criteria.  The Subject Matter are set out in Appendix 1 of our assurance  report. The maintenance and integrity of Macquarie’s website is  the responsibility of Management; the work carried out by us does  not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, we  accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred  to the reported Subject Matter or Criteria when presented on  Macquarie’s website. Our assurance conclusion is with respect to the year ended  31 March 2023 or as at 31 March 2023 as appropriate (or as  specified in Appendix 1 of this independent limited assurance  report) and does not extend to information in respect of earlier  periods, except where otherwise stated, or to any other information  included in, or linked from, the Report including any images, audio  files or videos. Responsibilities of Management Management is responsible for the preparation of the Subject  Matter in accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility includes: •	 determining appropriate reporting topics and selecting or  establishing suitable criteria for measuring, evaluating and  preparing the underlying Subject Matter; •	 preparing the Subject Matter as well as the 2023 Net Zero and  Climate Risk Report in its entirety; •	 the prevention and detection of fraud and error in relation to the  Subject Matter; •	 ensuring that those Criteria are relevant and appropriate to  Macquarie and the intended users; and •	 designing, implementing and maintaining systems, processes  and internal controls over information relevant to the evaluation  or measurement of the Subject Matter, which is free from  material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, against  the Criteria. Our independence and quality control We have complied with the ethical requirements of the Accounting  Professional and Ethical Standard Board’s APES 110 Code of  Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence  Standards) relevant to assurance engagements, which are founded  on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional  competence and due care, confidentiality and professional  behaviour. Our firm applies Australian Standard on Quality Management  ASQM 1, Quality Management for Firms that Perform Audits or  Reviews of Financial Reports and Other Financial Information, or  Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements, which requires  the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality  management including policies or procedures regarding compliance  with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable  legal and regulatory requirements. Our responsibilities Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion  based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we  have obtained. Our engagement has been conducted in accordance with the  Australian Standard on Assurance Engagements (ASAE 3000)  Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical  Financial Information and ASAE 3410 Assurance Engagements on  Greenhouse Gas Statements. Those standards require that we plan  and perform this engagement to obtain limited assurance about  whether anything has come to our attention to indicate that the  Subject Matter has not been prepared, in all material respects, in  accordance with the Criteria, for the year ended 31 March 2023  or as at 31 March 2023 as appropriate (or as specified in Appendix  1 of this independent limited assurance report). The procedures  performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and  timing from, and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance  engagement, and consequently the level of assurance obtained  in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than  the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable  assurance engagement been performed. In carrying out our limited assurance engagement we: •	 enquired of relevant management of the Group regarding the  processes and controls for capturing, collating, calculating and  reporting the Subject Matter; •	 agreed a sample of lending and equity exposures to source  systems and comparing their categorisation by counterparty  to the Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial  Classification codes; •	 enquired with management regarding selected estimates made  in preparing the Subject Matter;  ===== PAGE 53 ===== 50 Strategy Risk Management  About this Report Governance Metrics & Targets Foreword from   Macquarie’s CEO Macquarie Group Net Zero and Climate Risk Report Appendices Appendices Continued •	 reperformed a sample of calculations undertaken in preparing  the Subject Matter and the appropriate application of the  Criteria in those calculations; •	 reviewed the presentation and disclosure of the Subject Matter  and Criteria in the Report; and •	 performed procedures over the compilation of the financed  emissions data. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and  appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion. Inherent limitations Inherent limitations exist in all assurance engagements due to the  selective testing of the information being examined. It is therefore  possible that fraud, error or non-compliance may occur and not  be detected. A limited assurance engagement is not designed to  detect all instances of non-compliance of the Subject Matter with  the Criteria, as it is limited primarily to making enquiries of the  Management and applying analytical procedures. Additionally, non-financial data may be subject to more inherent  limitations than financial data, given both its nature and the  methods used for determining, calculating and estimating such  data. The precision of different measurement techniques may also  vary. The absence of a significant body of established practice on  which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information  allows for different, but acceptable, evaluation and measurement  techniques that can affect comparability between entities and over  time. In addition, Greenhouse Gas (GHG) quantification is subject  to inherent uncertainty because of incomplete scientific knowledge  used to determine emissions factors and the values needed to  combine emissions of different gases. Our scope did not include performing assurance procedures over  the underlying data provided by third parties. In particular, it is acknowledged by stakeholders globally, including  regulators, that there are significant limitations in the availability  and quality of emissions data from third parties, resulting in the  extensive use of proxy data. The Partnership for Carbon Accounting  Financials (“PCAF”) has established a data quality score to assist  in understanding the source of data which is incorporated into  Macquarie’s Criteria. The uncertainties and limitations are laid out in more detail in  the Criteria. The limited assurance conclusion expressed in this report has been  formed on the above basis. Our limited assurance conclusion Based on the procedures we have performed, as described under  ‘Our responsibilities’ and the evidence we have obtained, nothing  has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the  Subject Matter has not been prepared, in all material respects, in  accordance with the Criteria for the year ended 31 March 2023 or  as at 31 March 2023 as appropriate (or as specified in Appendix 1 of  this independent limited assurance report). Use and distribution of our report We were engaged by the board of directors of Macquarie on behalf  of Macquarie to prepare this independent limited assurance report  having regard to the Criteria which is set out within: •	 ‘Financed emissions methodology’ for Macquarie Group as set  out in Appendix 2 of the Report (pages 43 to 47) •	 ‘Financed Emissions - Scope of Activities’ as set out in  Appendix 3 of the Report (page 48) •	 ‘Glossary’ as set out in Appendix 5 of the Report (page 52 to 53). This report was prepared solely for the Directors of Macquarie, to  assist the Directors in obtaining independent assurance over the  Subject Matter for the purposes of reporting as part of the Report.
