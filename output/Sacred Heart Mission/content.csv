Our roots are in St Kilda and we acknowledge and extend our  respects to the Elders and community of the Yalukit Willam  people of the Boonwurrung and we are grateful for their  guidance, wisdom and partnership. Our work is deeply inspired by values that define First Nations  peoples – community, respect and resilience. We are committed  to fostering an inclusive and culturally safe environment,  honouring the cultural significance of the land, waterways and  its people. We extend our respect to all First Nations peoples. Statement of inclusion Sacred Heart Mission celebrates people’s diversity. We offer a  safe and inclusive culture where everyone is welcomed for who  they are. We apply an intersectional lens to all our work. We  recognise there are many dimensions to one’s identity including  gender, age, ethnicity, religion, sexuality and ability.  4 Foreword by Chair and CEO Following the success of our 10-year Strategic Plan (2014-2024), Sacred Heart  Mission has evolved into an innovative and well-respected not-for-profit  organisation focused on addressing the underlying causes of homelessness,  deep disadvantage and social exclusion. We have made outstanding achievements to meeting the needs of the most  vulnerable in the community, enabling hundreds of people to live a fulfilling life. We have overcome great challenges, including keeping our doors open during  the Covid-19 pandemic. Throughout these challenging times, we have proven  that we are adaptable, resilient and courageous and that we have a strong  community of dedicated staff, volunteers and supporters – united in our joint  vision of an inclusive and fair society where people can live a fulfilling life.  As we witness increasing levels of disadvantage and poverty in Victoria  and throughout Australia, we feel a deep responsibility as a Catholic social  service organisation to step up. Over the next six years, we will build on  past achievements and grow our impact to serve more people and more  communities.  We are excited to embark on this new chapter together to ensure more people  will experience better housing, health, social and economic outcomes. Strategy 2030 reflects extensive input from service participants, staff,  volunteers, supporters and service provider partners. Its implementation will be  guided by the voices of people with lived and living experience and bolstered by  strong partnerships.  We thank our wonderful community for their invaluable contributions to this  strategy and for their ongoing efforts, passion and dedication. We look forward  to growing our impact together with you. 10 July 2024 5 Chris Stoltz AM        Chair Hang Vo        Chief Executive Officer  ===== PAGE 4 ===== 6 7 Our journey so far Our welcome continues Sacred Heart Mission is a Victorian not-for-profit  organisation established in 1982 by the local parish to  serve people in the community most in need. Like many initiatives of social justice, Sacred Heart Mission began  modestly, providing daily meals and a place of unconditional  welcome for people experiencing homelessness, deep disadvantage  and social exclusion in St Kilda.  Over the past four decades, we have grown into an innovative and  evidence-based organisation, supporting hundreds of people every  year to live fulfilling lives and achieve their personal goals. Today, our wide-ranging services include housing support, health  and wellbeing, aged care, women’s services and social and economic  inclusion programs. Founded on the principles of Catholic Social Teaching, our purpose  remains unchanged. At the heart of everything we do is a strong  belief in the inherent dignity of every person, human rights and self- determination. We are committed to strengthening communities  through inclusion, empathy and social justice so that everyone is  respected and celebrated for who they are. We see every day that when people have a meaningful say in the  issues that impact them, the outcomes are always better. Our  services are designed and delivered in close partnership with service  participants to provide support that is carefully tailored to their  needs. We know that with the right support and resources, everyone  has the potential to live a fulfilling life. Our organisation today STRUCTURE Sacred Heart Mission Group  includes:  •	 SHM Inc (parent company) •	 Two subsidiaries established to  facilitate scaling of Journey to  Social Inclusion (J2SI) •	 A foundation to grow our corpus FY23 REVENUE $48M  60% government   40% self-generating   (op shops, fundraising,  philanthropic, service fees)  SERVICE PARTICIPANTS 1,745 volunteers   and students   staff WORKFORCE 400+  700+  SERVICE OUTCOMES •	 Housing  •	 Independence  •	 Health and wellbeing  •	 Social participation •	 Economic participation  SERVICE STREAMS  •	 Engagement hubs: meals  program, women’s house and  wellness centre •	 Individualised planned support:  case management and outreach •	 Residential and in-home aged  care support  •	 Specialist accommodation for  people with complex needs:  medium and long term  ===== PAGE 5 ===== 8 Reflecting on  our last 10-year  strategic plan In developing our new strategic  plan, we looked back on our many  achievements over the past 10 years  and reflected on external factors  that required reorientation and  provided opportunities: NEW CAMPUS OF CARE We completed our multi-stage  redevelopment and launched  Sacred Heart Mission’s new  Campus of Care in St Kilda,  transforming our operating  environment into a cohesive and  connected hub of support. To help  fund this ambitious undertaking,  we raised $8 million through our  ‘One Heart, One Home’ capital  campaign and received support  from the Commonwealth and  State governments. PANDEMIC YEARS During the Covid-19 pandemic,  Sacred Heart Mission faced  considerable challenges in providing  our flagship engagement hub  services and responding to the need  in the community. Sacred Heart  Mission’s workforce and volunteers  showed great resilience and were  able to adapt our ways of working to  respond to the new environment. J2SI EVALUATION AND  LEARNING CENTRE  We developed the Journey to  Social Inclusion (J2SI) Evaluation  and Learning Centre and licensing  model to make the J2SI program  available to other organisations  and expand our impact. CONTINUUM OF CARE  SERVICE FRAMEWORK  We launched a flexible service  approach, called ‘Continuum  of Care’, providing people with  the right level of support at the  right time to drive better housing  outcomes. 8 9 LEADERSHIP CHANGE In December 2022, we thanked,  celebrated and farewelled Cathy  Humphrey for her leadership,  dedication and 20-year service  to the organisation, 11 as CEO.  We welcomed Hang Vo as  incoming CEO. JOURNEY TO SOCIAL  INCLUSION (J2SI)  Through Social Impact Investment,  we successfully delivered our  housing-first program J2SI to 180  participants across Melbourne  from 2018 to 2023. 120 participants  were funded by a payment by  results contract with the Victorian  Government – the first of its kind. OP SHOP EXPANSION To help increase alternative and  untied revenue streams, we  opened seven new op shops and  now operate 14 stores across  Melbourne as well as an online  op shop.  ===== PAGE 6 ===== Where we are heading In the 42 years since our foundation, our purpose to serve people  most in need remains unchanged. Then, now and into the future  – we commit to serving people experiencing homelessness, deep  disadvantage and social exclusion. We are ready to extend beyond  our traditional St Kilda footprint and go to where there is need.  Across Victoria and Australia, we are seeing deeper levels of disadvantage: •	 The gap between rich and poor is widening, leaving more people further behind. •	 Homelessness is surging with a national housing crisis. •	 Social exclusion and isolation are widespread and considered a health epidemic. •	 Australia’s population continues to age with increasing complex needs. •	 Population movement and economic pressure are pushing disadvantage  further out of city areas with increased need in middle and outer suburbs   and regional settings. •	 Our service participants, staff, volunteers, partners and supporters expect   us to grow our impact. The evidence is clear, and we must respond. 10 11 We will grow our services to serve more people and more communities. We will do more of what we already do well including housing and  homelessness, health and wellbeing services and aged care.  We will take what we do well and expand into new geographies and  services such as support for women and their children, people living   with disability and other complex needs. We know that delivering services alone will not make lasting change.  We will strengthen our advocacy to influence fairer and more inclusive  communities and service systems.  Our success will be underpinned by strong lived experience voice, deep  partnerships and a resilient organisation. Our vision – the world we aspire An inclusive and fair society where everyone can live a   fulfilling life. Our purpose – why we exist To end homelessness, deep disadvantage and social   exclusion by building people’s capacity and  promoting   fairer and more inclusive communities and service systems.  ===== PAGE 7 ===== Drivers for change  In preparing our strategy, we have reflected on the demand for our  services and future trends to understand how our service participants  and their needs may change over the next six years and beyond. 12 13 Social exclusion  and loneliness are  widespread. •	Social exclusion and loneliness are considered substantial health   and wellbeing issues in Australia and significantly impact on   people’s health, wellbeing and life expectancy.i •	 We see an increased need for services that promote social inclusion   and enable people to experience a sense of belonging. Growing demand for  homelessness and  housing services.  •	Nearly 123,000 people were without a home on Census night 2021.   This equates to a 5.2% increase in homelessness over five years.ii •	There is a growing demand for homelessness and housing services,  with almost 190,000 people in Australia on social housing waiting  listsiii, a national rental vacancy rate of 0.7% and a 0% rental  affordability rate for a single person on JobSeeker.iv Population  movement pushes  disadvantage  further out of metro  areas. •	Service demand increases in middle and outer suburbs and in   regional settings.v •	There is a demand and an opportunity for Sacred Heart Mission to  reach new communities beyond our traditional St Kilda footprint. Increase in ageing  population and  complexity demands  more flexible care. •	Australia is expected to have almost two million people over the   age of 85 by 2050.vi •	Demand for aged care is increasing significantly due to aging  population and growing diversity among older people. •	The number of aged care service users aged over 85 with complex   care needs will increase four-fold by 2027. •	An increased preference for independent living arrangements   will lead to higher demand for in-home care. Macro environment  continues to be  volatile, uncertain,  complex and  ambiguous. •	People across Australia experience higher interest rates and cost   of living pressures.vii •	Disadvantage complexity and intergenerational trauma deepen.viii •	Comorbidity, chronic ill-health and intersectionality impact health  inequality. •	Income, education and health inequality are growing.ix •	Increased service demand and complexity require more trauma- informed service response. •	The need for an integrated services system increases. Lived experience  voice continues to  drive governance,  policy and service  reform.  •	Consistent findings from various royal commissions (disability,  mental health, family violence) recommend uplifting lived  experience voice to ensure better outcomes (from design to  implementation).x •	We see a greater focus on lived experience voice and sharing  decision making across the human services sector.  Climate crisis further  disadvantages people  already marginalised. •	People experiencing poverty and disadvantage are impacted by  climate change first, worse and longest because they have  access to fewer resources to cope, adapt and recover.  •	The climate crisis has severe impacts on health outcomes,  livelihood and housing insecurity.xi •	 People already experiencing deep disadvantage will be further left  behind requiring stepped up response and advocacy.  •	The demand for essential needs will continue to grow. Increased  compliance,  legislative and policy  changes overburden  non-profit resources. •	Changes to employment legislation, ACNC and NDIS, the Aged  Care Act and the Victorian Fair Jobs Code will lead to increased  cost and complexity of compliance.xii Future of work and  digital transformation  continue to disrupt  workplaces.   •	Flexible ways of working (hybrid, remote, casual, gig work,   four day week) are the new standard. •	To compete for talent, workplace culture needs to meet  intergenerational expectations.xiii  •	Ongoing digital transformation and data maturity will become  common practice. Increased  competition and  economic pressure  make sustainability  harder. •	Mixed delivery of private and social housing drives different  ways of partnering and collaborating (Victorian Housing  Statement; Housing Australia Future Fund).xiv •	There is a wide range of funding models, e.g. impact  investment, service participant directed and individualised  funding, outcome payments.xv •	Not for profit organisations are increasingly competing for  donor dollars.xvi •	Sacred Heart Mission needs to drive for innovation and  commercial acumen while staying true to its purpose.  Drivers for change  What it means Drivers for change  What it means  ===== PAGE 8 ===== 15 14  ===== PAGE 9 ===== 16 Expand and   strengthen  housing and  homelessness    services  •	Strengthen Housing First principles across all housing and  homelessness services.  •	Scale Journey to Social Inclusion (J2SI) across Victoria. •	Explore J2SI scale nationally through place-based partnerships. •	Explore expansion of congregate (Common Ground) housing  support models. •	Build the evidence for the Continuum of Care framework and grow  our supportive housing services across Victoria. •	Create employment pathways for people impacted by long term  disadvantage and homelessness. •	Develop health and wellbeing support that builds people’s climate  resilience and adaptive capacity.  •	Facilitate better housing and service access for people exiting prison.
