We pay our  respects to their Elders, past and present. Hallett Wind Farm, SA. Report structure This report is designed to be read in its entirety. The required  elements of the Directors’ Report, including the Operating and  Financial Review (OFR) as required by ASIC Regulatory Guide 247,  are covered on pages 10-113. Pages 61-78 (Climate Related  Disclosures), are excluded from the Directors' Report. Commentary  on AGL’s financial performance specifically is contained on  pages 14-60 and references information reported in the  Financial Report (pages 114-202). The Financial Report includes  AGL Energy Limited (the Company or Parent Entity) and the entities  it controlled at the end of, or during, the year ended 30 June 2024.  Throughout the report, the consolidated entity is referred to as AGL  or the Group. The Directors’ Declaration forms part of the Financial  Report under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (Corporations Act). Voluntary reporting frameworks This report has been prepared with consideration to the  International Integrated Reporting Council’s (IIRC) International  Integrated Reporting Framework. This framework provides a useful  basis for disclosing how sustainable value is created for our  shareholders and other stakeholders over time. We have used  the framework to demonstrate how consideration of risks and  opportunities (both those arising from our business and those that  exist in a broader operational context), our purpose and our values  drive our strategy. We have also considered how the execution of  our strategy creates value, applying a lens that is broader than  financial performance alone. AGL follows the guidance provided by the Financial Stability Board's  Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures voluntary  disclosure framework (TCFD Framework). Our disclosures related  to the TCFD Framework are now included in this report under  Climate Related Disclosures (pages 61-78) rather than in a stand- alone report, as was our previous approach. This change is in  preparation for the introduction of proposed mandatory climate- related disclosures under the Australian Sustainability Reporting  Standards (ASRS). The disclosures in this report and the ESG Data Centre  are made with consideration of the Sustainability Accounting  Standards Board (SASB) standards for ‘Electrical Utilities and Power  Generators’ and ‘Gas Utilities and Distributors’ version 2023-12. Our SASB index is included in the  ESG Data Centre, which identifies the extent to which each  SASB disclosure requirement has been applied. Assurance The Remuneration Report (pages 90-111) and the Financial Report  (pages 114-202) have been independently audited by Deloitte  in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Deloitte was  also engaged to provide limited assurance over selected key  performance indicators included in the Business Value Driver  scorecards (page 26) and AGL's progress against selected  quantified targets from our 2022 Climate Transition Action  Plan (CTAP) and other selected climate-related metrics (page  61-78) in accordance with the Australian Standard on Assurance  Engagements (ASAE) 3000 Assurance Engagements other than Audits  or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and ASAE 3410  Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements. The key  performance indicators are to be read in conjunction with the  definitions in the Glossary (page 206). Full details of the assurance  scope, process and outcomes are included in the assurance  statement on page 200. Forward looking statements This report includes information about AGL's performance for the  period 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024. Any forward-looking statements  are based on AGL's current expectations, best estimates and  assumptions as at the date of preparation, many of which are  beyond AGL’s control. These forward-looking statements are not  guarantees or predictions of future performance, and involve  known and unknown risks, which may cause actual results to  differ materially from those expressed in the report.

FY24 was a year of significant achievements for AGL. We continued  to make strong progress delivering on our strategy - to connect  our customers to a sustainable future and to transition our energy  portfolio - while navigating an increasingly complex and challenging  external environment. Transitioning our energy portfolio The transition of our energy portfolio has been a key focus during  FY24 and we’re pleased to report that our development pipeline –  which includes wind, solar and firming assets such as gas peakers,  batteries and pumped hydro – has almost doubled to 6.2 GW.1 As Australia’s largest corporate emitter of greenhouse gases, we  take our environmental responsibilities seriously and are cognisant  of the material impact AGL’s emissions profile has on Australia’s  decarbonisation journey. We exceeded our target to reduce our  annual operated Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions  target by 17% this year, against a FY19 baseline, achieving a  23.3% reduction. We have an ambition to build and operate  a leading battery portfolio in the National  Energy Market, and we made strong  progress during FY24 with 800 MW of new  grid-scale batteries in operation, in testing  or under construction. The 250 MW Torrens Island Battery  and 50 MW Broken Hill Battery recently  became operational, and construction is  underway for the 500 MW Liddell Battery  at our Hunter Energy Hub in  New South Wales. We also announced a Joint Venture with Someva Renewables to  develop the Pottinger Energy Park in New South Wales – a multi  asset precinct that is expected to consist of a 1.2 GW wind farm,  300 MW solar farm and 500 MW, 4-hour duration grid-scale battery. In April 2024, Gippsland Skies Offshore Wind, a consortium in  which AGL has a 20 percent interest, was awarded a feasibility  licence for a fixed bottom 2.5 GW offshore wind project off the  Gippsland region of Victoria. In New South Wales, we’re developing (together with our JV partner,  Idemitsu) the 400 MW, 8-hour storage, Muswellbrook Pumped  Hydro project, which is planned to provide essential long-duration  storage for the National Electricity Market. In July 2024, the project  received Critical State Significant Infrastructure (CSSI) status by the  NSW Minister for Planning and Public Spaces, qualifying the project  for rapid development assessment. First power generation is  targeted for 2029, subject to advanced development studies being  successful, final investment decision and government approvals. 1. AGL’s development pipeline was disclosed as 3.2 GW in its inaugural Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP), released in September 2022 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 5 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 6 ===== Overview Integral to the delivery of our transition strategy is the  transformation of our existing thermal sites into Integrated Energy  Hubs. This strategy is progressing well, with ten Memoranda of  Understanding signed with various parties across our three major  sites. In particular, during FY24 we signed three Memoranda of  Understanding for the Hunter Energy Hub: the first with Renewable  Metals to develop a pre-feasibility study into establishing a lithium  battery recycling facility; the second with SunDrive to explore the  development of a solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing facility,  and thirdly, with Elecsome to develop a feasibility study for the  establishment of a solar panel recycling plant and solar cable  manufacturing plant. We also continue to invest in the flexibility of our thermal assets  to minimise risk and capture value. We have undertaken significant upgrade works at our Bayswater Power Station in New South Wales  and at Loy Yang A Power Station in Victoria, and these plants  can now be flexed down approximately 60-70 percent of their full  operating capacity. Connecting our customers to a sustainable future We remain acutely aware of the ongoing cost-of-living pressures  affecting our customers and our commitment to easing these  pressures continues through our two-year Customer Support  Package, which we have increased by a further $20 million to  $90 million. To date, we’ve delivered more than $63 million to  assist customers who need it most. Our strategy is to connect our customers  to a sustainable future, which involves  supporting our customers to decarbonise  the way they live, move and work and  advancing their electrification journey. During FY24, we made significant investments to transform our  customer operations to enhance customer and agent experience,  reduce future operating costs and improve speed to market as part  of our Retail Transformation Program. This includes our strategic partnership with Kaluza, including a  proposed 20 percent equity investment. Kaluza is a scalable,  flexible and proven technology platform that digitises and simplifies energy billing, reduces cost-to-serve and enables faster product  innovation to facilitate the energy transition. We will deploy Kaluza  into AGL’s consumer customer base over the next three years,  transferring our 4 million consumer electricity and gas customer  services onto the Kaluza platform. We’re excited about this program for AGL and our customers. The Kaluza platform will allow us to  develop a future suite of simplified  products that will seamlessly integrate  and improve customer experience. This will be complemented by a streamlined operating model to  help us deliver superior speed to market and a reduction in costs. During FY24 we expanded the Electrify Now platform to Australians  across the National Electricity Market. Electrify Now helps  customers to understand their potential energy bill and carbon  savings if their home switched to solar, battery, heat pump hot  water, an electric vehicle (EV) and/or induction cooktop, with users  able to choose which upgrades suit their budget and lifestyle.  We are proud to be the first Australian energy retailer to offer this solution. We continue to grow our customer base,  which increased to 4.5 million customer  services during FY24, while at the same  time driving value and an improved  customer experience. During FY24 we entered into exclusive partnerships with Netflix and Virgin Australia's Velocity Frequent Flyer program to provide  additional benefits for our customers. These new partnerships  complement our existing energy and telecommunications offerings that are already delivering improved customer retention results. Our focus on customer retention, new partnerships, exclusive  products and integrated propositions resulted in strong  growth in overall customer services across both energy and  telecommunications. We’ve also maintained strong customer  advocacy throughout the year with a positive strategic Net  Promoter Score of +4. During FY24, we also partnered with our Commercial and  Industrial Customers on innovative solutions to support their  decarbonisation goals. The completion of a microgrid at the  Cadell Almond Farm in New South Wales, consisting of a solar farm  and battery system, and our partnership with Australian Farming  Services on three bespoke renewable energy projects for their  farming enterprises in New South Wales, are examples of how we’re  working with our large customers. Financial Performance During FY24, AGL delivered strong financial results, in line with our  FY24 earnings guidance: • Statutory Profit after tax was $711 million. This included a pre-tax  negative movement in the fair value of financial instruments of  $(53) million and significant items of $(103) million. • Underlying Net Profit after tax, which excludes the movements in  the fair value of financial instruments and Significant Items, was  $812 million, up 189% from FY23. • Underlying EBITDA was $2,216 million, up 63% on FY23. The Board has declared a final FY24 dividend of 35 cents per share  (unfranked), resulting in a total dividend for FY24 of 61 cents per  share (unfranked). Our results reflect significantly improved fleet availability and  portfolio flexibility, including a solid earnings contribution from the  Torrens Island Battery in its first nine months of operation, as well  as continued strong performance from our retail business. These results, and the core fundamentals of our business, provide  a strong foundation for our ongoing investment in the energy  transition, while maintaining a healthy balance sheet and providing  appropriate shareholder returns. AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 6  ===== PAGE 7 ===== Within our Customer Markets business, our Retail Transformation  Program aims to deliver a reduction in operating costs and capital  expenditure, with net benefits expected to commence in FY28 and  expected pre-cash savings of approximately $70-90 million annually  from FY29. Estimated implementation costs for the residential and  small business customer solution component of the Program will  be approximately $300 million over four financial years, beginning  in FY24. This includes costs associated with program and change  management, customer migration, systems integration and change  within supporting platforms. Safety and People The safety and wellbeing of our people is our utmost priority.  An area of concern for the Board is our Total Injury Frequency  rate, which remains elevated at 3.5 per million hours worked,  up from 2.8 in FY23, and is largely attributable to low-impact  injuries. We continue to undertake measures to improve this metric  and prevent injuries from occurring including increased focus on  health and safety leadership training as well as site specific safety  awareness programs. An engaged workforce is fundamental to the successful delivery of  our strategy, and pleasingly, our employee listening survey results  demonstrate the increased employee confidence in AGL’s strategy,  leadership and our commitment to employee development. This year, our employee engagement  score increased by five percentage-points  to 72%, continuing the positive trend  since FY22. Our inclusion index score also increased to 75%, surpassing the  target we set for FY24 in our Diversity & Inclusion strategy (70%  in 2023). In recognition of our strong workplace culture, we were  acknowledged by the Australian Financial Review (AFR) Boss  Magazine Best Places to Work for 2024, and received Platinum  Employer status at the Australian Workplace Equality Index’s (AWEI)  LGBTQ+ Inclusion Awards. Embracing ESG in everything we do We are focused on embedding ESG considerations into the work  we do and the decisions we make.  During FY24, the Board  approved six focus areas to drive ESG performance, comprising: • decarbonisation and portfolio transition; • affordability; • safety; • gender equality and representation; • community acceptance and social value; and • reconciliation (procurement and recruitment). For further information on our initiatives, see pages 12-13. Our commitment to strong corporate governance was also  recognised by the Australian Shareholders Association this  year, with AGL receiving the 2024 Enhanced Company  Governance Award. Chair succession A message from Chair, Patricia McKenzie ''It has been an honour to lead AGL, as Chair, during the last two  years and to serve on the Board during the last five years.  When I  became Chair, at a challenging period in AGL’s history, my objective  was to stabilise the company and set it on a path to take a  leading role in the transition of the energy industry towards a more  sustainable future. Since this time, a renewed Board and management team was  put in place, including the appointment of Damien Nicks as  Managing Director & CEO in January 2023. Under my leadership,  AGL announced a refreshed strategy and released its inaugural  CTAP with strong support from our shareholders. In line with this  strategy, AGL moved forward the targeted closure date of the Loy  Yang A power station by up to 10 years than previously announced,  the Liddell Power Station closed in April 2023, and we set an  ambition to deliver 12 GW of renewable and firming capacity by  the end of 2035. AGL has made significant progress in delivering  this strategy over the last two years, with the development pipeline  almost doubling to 6.2 GW since the release of the CTAP. AGL  has significantly improved its financial and operational performance  over this period and demonstrated substantial progress towards  the energy transition and AGL’s retail transformation program.  Given this solid foundation, I will retire from the AGL Board  following the release of AGL’s FY25 half-year results in February  2025. Miles George has been appointed Chair-elect and will  succeed me as Chair in February. I remain committed to chairing AGL until February and will  continue to support the management team and ensure an orderly  handover to Miles. I am confident that AGL will continue on this  successful trajectory.'' Looking forward to FY25 Staying ahead of Australia’s changing energy market and  anticipating our customers’ needs is critical to our  continued success. We’ve made significant progress on our strategy over the last  12 months while navigating an increasingly complex regulatory  and policy environment. We have a clear strategy, and the achievement of our goals  and ambition relies on policy certainty and a stable and efficient regulatory environment. We will continue to work with industry and  government to advocate for the coordinated decarbonisation of  Australia’s energy sector in a way that balances energy reliability  and affordability. Following the significant delivery of our strategy in FY24, we are  looking forward to FY25 with excitement about the momentum we  have built and the opportunities ahead. Thank you for your continued support.

AGL recognises that the way in which energy is supplied and used is evolving at pace, with the momentum behind the move to more  sustainable energy sources and the evolution of new customer-centric technology triggering a structural and economic shift in the way that  energy markets operate. Our strong execution of our strategy in FY24 reflects not only our success in responding to these challenges but maximises our opportunities  to create value for our shareholders and other stakeholders, including, critically, our customers. The dual arms of our strategy - connecting  our customers to a sustainable future and transitioning our energy portfolio - recognise that we need to balance energy affordability, reliability  and security for our customers, evolving both the way we supply energy and the way we meet the changing needs of our customers and the  community. Our performance made against our FY27 strategic targets is shown on page 11. We have made significant progress with the delivery of our strategy to transition our energy portfolio. We continue to progress our renewable  and firming development pipeline, which has grown from 3.2 GW to 6.2 GW1 since our Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP) was released  in September 2022, in pursuit of our ambition to deliver 12 GW of new renewable and firming capacity by the end of 2035, with an interim  target of 5 GW by 2030. As we build our pipeline, and deliver against our targets, we continue to review market dynamics, customer demand  and our development pipeline options, and seek to accelerate our decarbonisation pathway where possible . We are also making significant investments in flexibility, including investing in grid-scale batteries, growing distributed energy and orchestration assets, and increasing  thermal unit flexibility. Transforming our existing thermal sites into integrated energy hubs is also an important part of our strategy to support regional  diversification, providing new jobs and skills development opportunities for communities where we operate. It recognises that our move  away from thermal generation needs to be responsibly and respectfully managed to ensure that affected communities are supported and  encouraged to grow through the changes. We are making good progress with transforming our three thermal generation sites into energy  hubs. Refer to the Assets scorecard for details of AGL’s asset transition plans, development pipeline, how we have invested in flexibility, and  our energy hub progress over FY24. This year, we also achieved a significant milestone in our transformation journey to connect our customers to a sustainable future, with our  strategic partnership and equity investment in Kaluza as part of our Retail Transformation program.   The innovative technology and a new  operating model brings opportunities to uplift product innovation and provide effortless digital experiences for our people and customers.  Over FY24, we have seen considerable growth in our core retail business, as well as growth in the delivery of decarbonisation at scale for  our commercial and industrial customers. Refer to the Customer scorecard for details of how over the course of FY24 we have been helping  our customers decarbonise the way they live, move and work, while also actively balancing the need to support our customers facing cost-of-  living pressures. We are also focused on embedding ESG considerations into the work we do and the decisions we make. Over FY24, we have been driving  performance improvements in six key areas, as set out on pages 12-13. The Business Value Driver scorecards on pages 26-39 provide  further detail on how we have been creating sustainable, long-term value for our shareholders and other stakeholders through the lens of  our six business value drivers identified in our ESG framework. This is an important time in both Australia’s and AGL’s transition journeys. The energy transition is opening up new value creation  opportunities, shaped by decarbonisation, decentralisation and digitisation, which AGL is well positioned to capitalise on. Achieving the  necessary rate and scale of transition will need a coordinated approach among federal, state, and local governments, market bodies,  industry, and consumers, as well as a stable investment environment. We are committed to working with stakeholders across the energy  sector and the community to achieve innovative solutions to the challenges that the energy transition brings, in order to create a sustainable  energy future.  2.1 Operating environment Australia's energy and climate policy landscape remains highly dynamic. Over the coming decades, substantial amounts of large-scale  renewables and distributed solar generation are forecast to be added to the system. Ageing thermal generation plant will be replaced  by a range of storage and flexible generation technologies with lower emissions intensities to drive the decarbonisation of Australia's  energy sector. To deliver this transition, a major infrastructure and asset replacement program is needed, requiring substantial investment in new  generation, transmission, distributed energy, and low-emissions appliances. In the last year, state and federal governments have announced a range of additional commitments to accelerate the transition of the energy  sector, most notably the Australian Government’s Capacity Investment Scheme, which seeks to support the renewable energy and emissions  reduction targets set by the federal government and all NEM states. States have also announced new climate and energy policies to support a faster uptake of renewables and transmission infrastructure,  and to support the development of emerging industries such as energy storage, hydrogen, offshore wind, electric vehicles, and consumer  energy resources. At the same time, state governments have entered into agreements with the operators of some thermal assets to provide  certainty around closure dates, and put forward regulatory mechanisms to extend the life of thermal generation assets, if required, to  maintain system reliability and security. 1. As of August 2024. AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 16  ===== PAGE 17 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2024 While growth in uptake of consumer energy resources like rooftop solar and electric vehicles remains strong, increased costs, supply chain  constraints, and planning and connection delays pose challenges to the delivery of generation and transmission projects needed to support  the energy transition. Electrification of other sectors is set to play a critical role in economy-wide decarbonisation, and unlocking barriers to  the energy transition will be critical for enabling this. Despite these challenges, conditions in energy markets have generally improved. This follows a period of significant disruption and  government price intervention in wholesale markets in response to record-high prices for coal and gas in 2022. Wholesale energy prices  have eased from recent highs, and grid reliability targets are being met. However, broader macroeconomic conditions have caused  inflationary pressures and increased input costs, leading to significant household cost-of-living pressures and challenges for businesses  from supply chain disruptions and material increases in energy input costs. Collaborative action, policy reform and a stable investment  environment will be key to delivering new infrastructure in a timely manner and managing higher penetrations of variable renewable energy  in the national electricity grid. Household living and business expenses, including the cost of energy, will therefore remain significant ongoing concerns. As further steps  are taken to accelerate the energy transition and meet government targets, long-term benefits and costs to customers and the broader  economy will remain a critical consideration. 2.2 Capital allocation framework Our capital allocation framework is designed to drive disciplined allocation of capital to transition our customer and generation portfolios, to  deliver on our strategy, while maintaining financial strength and flexibility to maximise future returns for our shareholders. Our principles are: 1. Maintain strong credit profile: Baa2 investment grade credit rating. 2. Ongoing investment: Continue to invest to strengthen and drive value from our core business to realise opportunities through the  energy transition. 3. Sustainable dividends: Dividend payout ratio of 50-75% of Underlying Profit after tax, franked to the extent possible. 4. Capital Management: Consider when appropriate, with all investments tested against additional returns to shareholders. Investment proposition AGL is well-positioned to be a leader in the energy transition and generate strong returns for our shareholders. Our investment proposition  summarises our core strengths as an integrated business and how we intend to leverage these to deliver future value: Strong positive momentum in earnings and cashflow outlook underscored by our low-cost  baseload generation position, flexible portfolio and development pipeline. Leading energy retailer, large quality customer base to underpin investment in transition and  capture new value from electrification. Disciplined capital allocation framework to deliver on the transition while maximising value and  shareholder returns. Opportunity to invest in the Australian energy transition with a clear strategic plan strongly  supported by financial markets. 2.3 Enterprise and strategic risk management AGL faces a wide variety of risks due to the nature of its operations. In order to effectively manage these risks, AGL has an enterprise-wide  risk management framework that is designed to ensure risk management practices are embedded into all business processes, strategy  setting and operational activity, driving consistent, effective and accountable action, decision making and management practices. AGL’s risk  management framework is aligned with the principles and requirements of the International standard for risk management (ISO 31000 –  Risk Management). AGL’s risk management framework is overseen by the Board, supported by the Audit & Risk Management Committee. On an annual basis,  the Board and the Audit & Risk Management Committee review AGL’s Risk Management Framework and its consistent operation across the  organisation. Both the Board and the Audit & Risk Management Committee also regularly review AGL’s strategic risks, and at least annually  review and approve AGL’s Statement of Risk Appetite, which was most recently reviewed in June 2024. Additionally, the Board has adopted an  AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 17 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 18 ===== Directors’ Report Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2024 enterprise-wide Risk Management Policy that sets out AGL's objectives for risk management and clearly articulates the responsibilities of all  AGL’s people in relation to the management of risks. Through this risk management framework, AGL undertakes a comprehensive process throughout the year to identify, monitor, assess and  report on the key risks to achieving our strategic priorities over the medium to long term. We define these as Tier 1 Strategic Risks. Risk  mitigation strategies are in place for each of these risks, which are overseen by AGL’s Audit & Risk Management Committee. Further detail on  AGL’s risk management framework is detailed in our 2024 Corporate Governance Statement. 2.3.1 FY24 Tier 1 Strategic Risks As an owner and operator of critical energy infrastructure, as well as being one of Australia’s largest providers of essential services, AGL  is subject to a broad range of risks. Various aspects of the Australian energy system, and consequently AGL’s business operations, have  material strategic and operational risks, with the energy industry continuing to face significant challenges over the past 12 months. During FY24, key risks to AGL’s operational and financial performance included the pace of the energy transition and the associated  policy environment, as well as ongoing geopolitical risks, inflationary pressures affecting affordability for our customers, and an increasingly  heightened cyber security threat landscape. AGL continues to prioritise the ongoing response to and management of these risks, both to  ensure AGL’s ongoing financial performance and future prospects, and, more broadly, to support the NEM in continuing to provide reliable  and affordable energy during Australia’s energy transition. As a result of the complex environment in which AGL operates, the majority of our  strategic risks remain elevated. AGL’s Tier 1 Strategic Risks for FY24 are summarised below. Tier 1 Strategic Risk Mitigation approach Business  Value  Driver Climate change response: AGL is unable to meet expectations and/or deliver on its strategy and commitments to be a leader in the energy transition to a low carbon future  within targeted timeframes. • AGL supports our majority of  stakeholders' focus on decarbonisation, as  evidenced through our Climate Transition Action  Plan commitments. • However, expectations relating to emissions  reduction continue to accelerate, and factors  including social licence, accessing skills to build  new renewable and firming generation, and  supply chain challenges, are increasing the  complexity of the transition. • AGL’s climate ambitions are reliant on a  stable policy environment and effective project  development and management.  • AGL’s strategy is focused on the accelerated closure of our thermal  plants, and the continuing development of a technologically  and geographically diverse pipeline of investment options for  new renewable and firming generation (as outlined in the  Assets scorecard). • We continue to expand product offerings to help our customers  decarbonise the way they live, move and work (as outlined in the  Customers scorecard). • We proactively engage with stakeholders on key matters related  to the energy transition, including the development of new assets  and integrated energy hubs, and the closure and rehabilitation of  existing thermal assets sites. Wholesale market pricing and earnings volatility: AGL is unable to effectively manage the impact of wholesale electricity price change, and resulting impacts on earnings or cashflow volatility. • AGL’s earnings are materially exposed to  wholesale electricity pricing. The electricity  market is highly volatile, with pricing influenced by factors including local weather, availability  of large, ageing generation assets and related  infrastructure, global commodity pricing and  changes to government policies and regulation. • AGL’s ability to effectively manage price volatility  risk is key to delivering stable earnings and  predicting and managing cashflows required for  operations and financing activities.  • AGL proactively manages earnings volatility, particularly relating  to our wholesale electricity exposure, predominantly through  financial hedging contracts (derivatives) and longer-term offtake arrangements. Our hedging strategy considers our generation  portfolio mix, and factors such as technological and geographic  diversity, plant outages and anticipated market shifts. • AGL has a robust risk management program to manage and  monitor exposures to volatility in wholesale electricity pricing and  commodity markets, and counterparty credit risk. AGL’s Board- approved Trading Risk policy includes financial exposure limits to  manage the financial exposure AGL is prepared to take. • We have a comprehensive market monitoring program, including  stress testing against adverse scenarios, which informs our  portfolio hedging and treasury strategies. • We actively manage our liquidity position through a Treasury  Committee that is governed by a Board-approved Treasury Policy,  including maintaining a minimum liquidity level limit. AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 18  ===== PAGE 19 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2024 Tier 1 Strategic Risk Mitigation approach Business  Value  Driver Unfavourable government intervention: AGL is not able to effectively anticipate, plan or respond to increasing uncertainty regarding government policy. • The energy market has been subject to  significant interventions in recent periods, as  governments seek to address a broad range of  energy-related challenges. • Given the complexity of Australia’s energy  transition and ongoing affordability challenges  for consumers, it is likely that governments will  be required to intervene in energy markets and  related activities into the future. • AGL actively engages with government and regulatory bodies to  advocate for balanced policy outcomes that consider the interests  of our stakeholders, and support AGL and the broader electricity  market to provide reliable and affordable energy during Australia’s  energy transition, as outlined in the Relationship scorecard). • We engage with stakeholders that may be involved in the  development of government policy to understand likely future  policy direction and ensure that AGL is able to respond to  changing policy and regulatory requirements effectively. Regulatory intervention: AGL is not able to effectively anticipate or plan for regulatory intervention, or added restrictions and diversion of resources put wider business  objectives at risk.  • AGL operates in markets that are highly  regulated and subject to significant scrutiny  from regulators. • Challenges, such as accelerating Australia’s  energy transition, reducing emissions, and  customer affordability concerns, are likely to be  addressed by regulators in the future. • We engage with a range of stakeholders that are involved in  the development of legislation and regulation that applies to  our business to understand and inform current and anticipated  regulatory changes, and to ensure that AGL is able to respond to  changing regulatory requirements quickly and effectively. • We actively participate in industry consultations to contribute to  the direction of future regulatory reforms. Cyber security and resilience: AGL’s critical systems, platforms, technology infrastructure and core business and operational processes are compromised or unacceptably  disrupted by a cyber, vendor or internal event. • The cyber security threat landscape remains  heightened, in part due to the acceleration of  generative AI and ongoing geopolitical issues. • A successful cyber-attack or information security  breach (targeting AGL or third-party providers)  has the potential for broad and material  impacts on AGL, including damage to generation  assets, material disruption to business, loss  of customers or significant reputational and  financial loss.  • AGL has an enterprise cyber security strategy in place, which  includes robust processes for monitoring and defence, network  security, identity, and access management, cyber security culture,  training, and engagement. We proactively manage cyber risk  through preparation and rapid response capabilities to limit the  likelihood of inappropriate access to our systems and data, and  the impact of cyber security incidents. • Our IT environments are regularly reviewed and subjected  to a program of testing, business continuity exercises, crisis  management simulations and disaster recovery tests. • AGL also proactively engages with government stakeholders on  cyber security, to effectively identify potential threats. Safety, culture and capability: AGL is unable to foster a health and safety focused, resilient, responsive, future-oriented and purpose-driven organisation that is built on strong  and ethical behaviours, a talented diverse and inclusive workforce, and a customer-centric mindset. • AGL’s people conduct activities that, if not  properly controlled, could result in harm to our  people and contractors, other stakeholders, our  assets or the environment. • Our people are fundamental to the success of  our strategy. Our ability to identify and meet  our capability needs is critical to the effective delivery of our strategy. • The demand for energy-related skills is expected  to remain high over the long term due to the  large scale of the energy transition. • AGL is committed to conducting our business in a way that causes  no harm to our people and contractors. We have a robust Health,  Safety, and Environment (HSE) framework, which includes policies,  procedures and systems to monitor and manage our HSE risks,  that is complemented by regular onsite oversight and monitoring  of controls. • We have frameworks in place to attract, retain and develop  our people, including targeted leadership and skill development  programs and operational workforce transition initiatives.  • Recognising that our strategy will require both new capabilities  and additional resourcing in key areas, we have assessed our  future capability needs, and prioritised the development of the key  capabilities that we will require. AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 19 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 20 ===== Directors’ Report Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2024 Tier 1 Strategic Risk Mitigation approach Business  Value  Driver Resilience of generation and critical infrastructure: AGL is unable to generate and maintain a resilient and flexible energy supply from generation assets and related critical infrastructure. • As our ageing thermal fleet approaches end  of life, unplanned outages are possible. Should  these occur during periods of very high  wholesale electricity pricing; the financial impact  could be material. • AGL is also similarly exposed to the availability  and resilience of related infrastructure, such as  transmission and distribution assets. • AGL continues to invest in and focus on the safety, reliability and  flexibility of our existing power stations, to support plant capability  and efficiency that will allow us to capture value from the changing  energy market. • As part of our strategy, we are continuing to develop a  technologically and geographically diverse pipeline of investment  options for new renewable and firming generation. Investment planning and execution: AGL’s major investments do not deliver on their intended benefits, announced timeframes or outcomes for shareholders, customers and  the community. • AGL’s ambition to add 12 GW of new  renewable generation and firming by the end  of 2035 is reliant on elements including  continued stakeholder support, access to  sufficient capital, a stable government policy  environment and effective project development  and management.  • AGL has in place a disciplined capital management process, as well  as a robust investment governance framework. • Across FY24, AGL materially increased its debt tenor, improved  its liquidity position, and maintained a Baa2 “stable” investment  grade Moody’s rating. As a result, we are well placed as we plan to  deploy $3-4 billion of balance sheet capital by FY30 towards our  generation portfolio's transition, supported by strong operating  cash flow generation and a larger and more diversified pool  of capital. • We engage with key stakeholders, including the community, on  relevant development opportunities to understand expectations  and key risks, and to develop our social licence. Retail market disruption: AGL does not adequately or appropriately identify and respond to changing customer or operating environment needs and expectations; or does  not effectively harness new technologies, products or services that support these changing needs and expectations. • As an essential service provider, AGL plays  an important role in keeping the lights on  for customers. • The Australian retail energy market is highly  competitive for traditional energy customers,  as well as in adjacent markets such as solar,  batteries and electric vehicles. • Failing to respond to this environment could  result in the loss of some customers or  compression of our customer margin. • We continue to support our customers, including through  the delivery of our Customer Support Package (see  Customer scorecard). • AGL actively monitors new technologies, products and business  models with a view to meeting future customer demand and  evolving customer expectations. • In response to a rapidly accelerating pace of technology and digital  disruption, AGL is investing in its Retail Transformation Program,  including our recently announced strategic partnership and equity  investment in Kaluza. Energy sector transition: AGL is unable to deliver on its strategic objectives due to challenges relating to the broader transition of the energy sector. • The energy transition is fast-moving, highly  complex, and facing increased competition  for specialist renewables-related materials  and resourcing. • Within Australia, as thermal assets continue to  age and approach end of life, reliability issues  are expected to increase. • The energy transition also requires a significant build out of transmission to support a  decentralised, decarbonised generation fleet across the NEM, and a higher volume of  renewables projects and related approvals. • In addition to the continued development of our technologically  and geographically diverse pipeline of investment options for new  renewable and firming generation, we continue to make significant investments in our existing assets and infrastructure. • AGL actively engages with government and regulatory bodies  to advocate for balanced policy outcomes within the broader  NEM to provide reliable and affordable energy during Australia’s  energy transition, particularly related to transmission access and  project approvals. AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 20  ===== PAGE 21 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2024 Tier 1 Strategic Risk Mitigation approach Business  Value  Driver Compliance: AGL fails to comply with laws, regulations or other commitments made. • AGL operates in markets that are highly  regulated and subject to significant scrutiny  from regulators. • Failure to comply with regulations can result in  fines, reputation damage or adverse impacts on  our customers and broader stakeholders. • AGL’s Values and Code of Conduct guides the conduct that we  expect from our people, and how we expect decisions to be made. • AGL is committed to complying with all applicable laws and  regulations, and we have in place a robust enterprise-wide  compliance framework, including a Board-approved Compliance  Management Policy. • We have implemented a mandatory annual enterprise-wide  compliance training program, which addresses AGL’s compliance  management processes and systems and key compliance  requirements for all of our people. Access to gas: AGL is unable to source sufficient quantities of gas to meet its future demand. • AGL requires access to sufficient wholesale gas  to meet the needs of our customers, and  supply our gas-fired generation plants, which  are expected to continue to play an important  role in the NEM after coal-fired plants retire. • AEMO forecasts1 a risk that Australia will  experience gas shortfalls on extreme peak  days from 2025, and annual supply gaps  that will require new sources of supply from  2028. In this environment, it may be more  challenging for AGL to secure the competitive  gas supplies required. • AGL proactively contracts competitive gas supplies to firm up our  short, medium and longer term gas position to meet gas supply  demands. AGL has secured most of its gas requirements for its  customer portfolio and gas generation until FY27. Stakeholder trust: AGL is unable to maintain (or build) the trust required from its stakeholders in order to deliver on its strategy.  • AGL plays an important role in keeping the lights  on for households, and supporting Australia’s  energy transition. • We are committed to meeting and exceeding  the  community’s expectations of us. • AGL proactively engages with stakeholder groups, including  customers, shareholders, investors, governments and regulatory  bodies, and the communities in which we operate. We seek  to understand the key social licence risks and opportunities,  and where focus is required to meet and exceed rising  community expectations. • We engage with key stakeholders prior to seeking relevant  approvals for development and operational activities. This  engagement continues through the life of the project and  during operations. 1. Refer to the AEMO 2024 Gas Statement of Opportunities for further details.  Further information in relation to AGL’s climate-related risks is available in the Climate Related Disclosures section of this report, including  transition risks (arising from the changes to systems and business functions which are necessary to address climate change) and  physical risks. AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 21 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 22 ===== Directors’ Report Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2024 Key Operating Metrics and Business Value Drivers 3. The following sections summarise the performance of AGL's business during FY24. Performance is considered through two dimensions: • Key Operating Metrics – These performance measures have a direct influence on AGL's FY24 financial performance. The six key  operating metrics comprise: - Customer numbers and churn; - Customer energy demand; - Wholesale electricity prices; - Generation volumes; - Fuel costs; and  - Operating costs and capital expenditure. • Business Value Drivers – These performance measures are critical to long-term value creation, however may have a less direct  relationship to annual performance, and/or may influence financial performance over the longer term. The performance measures are  divided into scorecards for each of AGL’s identified Business Value Drivers (as shown on page 4). 3.1 Key Operating Metrics performance 3.1.1 Customer numbers and churn Total services to customers increased 4.9% to 4.482 million, from 4.271 million as at 30 June 2023. This increase of 211,000 included the  addition of 94,000 Ovo Energy Australia (OEA) electricity services post 3 April 2024 acquisition of 100% ownership in OEA and introduction  of 44,000 Netflix services. Underlying AGL growth of 73,000 was driven by continued strong telecommunication growth of 52,000 and  underlying AGL energy services growth of 21,000. Consumer Electricity services decreased by 5,000 due to highly competitive market conditions resulting in increased churn with New South  Wales, South Australia and Queensland decreasing by 26,000, partly offset by growth of 21,000 services in Victoria. Consumer Gas services  increased by 27,000, with growth of 19,000 services in Victoria, 8,000 services in Western Australia and 4,000 services in South Australia  whilst New South Wales decreased by 3,000 services and Queensland remained relatively flat. Total Telecommunication services increased 17.8% to 344,000, from 292,000 as at 30 June 2023. The increase of 52,000 was driven by  continued growth in internet and mobile plans.

AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 22  ===== PAGE 23 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2024 Market churn rose sharply in the first quarter due to the impact of price changes and a highly competitive market, before stabilising across  the remainder of the year. AGL churn remains lower than Rest of Market due to a strong focus on customer retention, improved customer  experience and impact of bundled telecommunications offerings. AGL churn was 15.8% (an increase of 1.6 ppts from 14.2% at 30 June 2023),  and Rest of Market churn was 20.9% (an increase of 2.2 ppts from 18.7% at 30 June 2023). The gap between AGL and Rest of Market was  5.1 ppts, an improvement from 4.5 ppts at 30 June 2023. 3.1.2 Customer energy demand Total electricity customer sales volumes were 36,300 GWh, down 1,850 GWh or 4.8%. • Consumer customer electricity sales volumes were 13,838 GWh, down 699 GWh or 4.8%, due to lower average demand as a result of  milder weather and increased rooftop solar generation from customers. • Large Business customer electricity sales volumes were 9,431 GWh, down 875 GWh or 8.5%, primarily driven by competitive market  conditions in New South Wales and Victoria. • Wholesale customer electricity sales volumes were 13,031 GWh, down 276 GWh or 2.1%, driven by lower consumption from AGL’s  wholesale customer base. Customer electricity demand FY24 GWh FY23 GWh Consumer customers electricity sales 13,838 14,537 Large Business customers electricity sales 9,431 10,306 Wholesale customers electricity sales 13,031 13,307 Total customer electricity sales volume 36,300 38,150 Total gas customer sales volumes were 101.8 PJ, down 29.6 PJ or 22.5%. • Consumer customer gas sales volumes were 46.2 PJ, down 8.3 PJ or 15.2%, driven by lower average demand due to milder winter weather  in 2023. • Large Business customer gas sales volumes were 15.0 PJ, down 1.4 PJ or 8.5% primarily driven by competitive market conditions, and  one-off volumes in the prior year relating to the Weston Energy RoLR (Retailer of Last Resort) event. This was partly offset by wholesale  customer growth in Western Australia. • Wholesale customer gas sales and internal gas volumes for power generation were 40.6 PJ, down 19.9 PJ or 32.9%, primarily driven by the  roll-off of wholesale customer volumes and lower internal consumption of gas volumes used for power generation. Customer gas demand FY24 PJ FY23 PJ Consumer customers gas sales 46.2 54.5 Large Business customers gas sales 15.0 16.4 Wholesale customers gas sales and generation 40.6 60.5 Total customer gas sales volume 101.8 131.4 3.1.3 Wholesale electricity prices Wholesale electricity prices were lower across all states compared to the prior year due to the comparative lack of volatility following the  market suspension event resulting in high prices which extended into July 2022, and increased availability of generation units. Wholesale  electricity prices were further influenced by coal and gas cap price schemes introduced in 2022, with pool price declining towards  December 2022. Wholesale electricity prices were impacted from July 2023 to October 2023 due to seasonal mild weather, a lack of volatility, increased asset  availability and increasingly higher solar penetration in the National Electricity Market (NEM). In August 2023, South Australia experienced  volatility due to interconnector issues and low wind generation. December 2023 saw mild spikes in Queensland due to abnormal weather  caused by floods and high temperatures which caused disruption to the energy grid. In January 2024, Queensland experienced a significant uplift in average prices compared to the prior year due to record demand and  weather-related events. In February 2024, New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria experienced an uplift in wholesale electricity prices  compared to the prior year due to periods of extreme volatility, including Victorian transmission lines being damaged by significant storm  activity during the month. In May 2024, New South Wales experienced significant prices volatility due to outages at non AGL operated power  stations. Prices remained high across the NEM in June 2024 due to high demand and a wind drought. Refer to Section 6.2 for details of the Electricity Portfolio Margin, including commentary on customer network and generation running costs.

Time series data for  the Business Value Driver key performance indicators as well as performance data for an extended range of non-financial metrics is available  in the ESG Data Centre. The key performance indicators included in each scorecard should be read in conjunction with the Glossary on  page 206. Key performance indicators that are linked to the FY24 remuneration outcomes for the CEO and key management personnel are also  identified as outlined in the legend below. Key KPI linked to remuneration outcomes for MD and CEO and key management personnel Customers We are committed to partnering with our customers in connecting them to a sustainable future through a range of innovative  initiatives which deliver value and benefits for both our customers and AGL. AGL supports 4.5 million customer services across  energy and telecommunications translating to approximately 25% of households in the National Electricity Market (NEM). As we navigate the multi-decade journey of the energy transition, we are actively balancing the need to support our customers  facing cost-of-living pressures, including rising energy price rises, and the investment required to support our customers to  transition to a net zero future. Solutions to meet customer needs AGL recognises the importance of maintaining strong customer relationships and meeting customer needs, especially with cost- of-living pressures. AGL has maintained a positive Net Promoter Score of +4 for FY24, despite a highly competitive market and  cost-of-living pressures faced by customers. Further, we have maintained strong relationships with our customers, evident in our  energy consumer churn which is 5.1 percentage points lower than the rest of market at 15.8%, driven in part by our multi-service  offerings and partnerships that benefit our customers, as outlined below. (Refer also to Section 3.1.1).    Ombudsman complaint volume increased to 8,111 complaints in FY24, compared to 5,012 in FY23. We received, as anticipated,  higher Ombudsman complaint volumes due in part to higher energy prices and cost-of-living pressures that customers are  experiencing. From March onwards volumes stabilised and have been trending downwards. To make it easier for customers to get  in contact with us, we increased staffing in our contact centres, utilised AI for proactive communications and focused our efforts on  ensuring that customer requests were addressed proactively and positively. The AGL App continues to be the highest rated utility app in Australia. This year, we have added new capabilities to our App,  including usage insights for solar customers, direct debit enhancements and accessibility improvements.  We continued to invest in and optimise our digital channels to create a smoother overall customer experience across both sales  and servicing journeys. We have also introduced partnerships and plans to benefit our customers such as the NBN movers'  journey, Velocity Frequent Flyer offer, Netflix proposition, and EV night saver plan.  We have expanded the capabilities of AGL’s virtual assistant to handle more transactions, enabling customers to view concessions  and update their mailing address. We have also added new digital features to MyAccount, including providing bill breakdowns,  Netflix activation and a new on-boarding experience.    As outlined in the Business Intelligence scorecard, we have announced a significant step in our Retail Transformation Program  through an agreement with Kaluza. The Program will focus on enhancing the customer and agent experience, significantly reducing  operating costs, improving speed to market, and is a key step to accelerating our ambition to connect our customers to a  sustainable future through electrification. Target FY24 FY23 Strategic Net Promoter Score (NPS) FY27: +20 +4 +5 Ombudsman complaints - 8,111 5,012 Energy affordability and support for customers experiencing vulnerability At AGL, we are acutely aware of the ongoing cost-of-living pressures households are experiencing. We are doing our part to  proactively engage with customers experiencing hardship, providing customers with payment support and government grant  assistance, and continuing to deploy free solar for low-income households. We strongly advocated for the continuation of the  Australian Government's National Energy Bill Relief Fund to provide ongoing targeted support for customers feeling cost-of-living  pressures, and the harmonisation of state concession schemes. Through this fund we delivered $466 million in bill relief to eligible  AGL customers across FY24. AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 26  ===== PAGE 27 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2024 AGL continues to ramp up the predictive solutions to support customers, utilising data and AI-driven insights to proactively  outreach when customers are showing warning signs of needing assistance. As part of this work, AGL has proactively engaged with  more than 245,000 customers to offer affordability support. In May 2023, AGL committed to a $70 million Customer Support Package (spread across FY24 and FY25) to assist customers with  cost-of-living pressures. After a successful first year, we have increased the Customer Support Package to $90 million. This year, we  have delivered more than $63 million1 in customer support through: • Payment matching and debt relief, including $20 million proactive bill credits for Centrepay customers and $36 million in debt  relief for customers under our hardship program and those affected by family and domestic violence; • Proactive outreach to deploy solar for low-income households to help reduce their energy consumption, with 100 solar systems  installed as of 30 June 2024; • Specialised empathy training for front-line agents focused on supporting customers experiencing vulnerability; and • Assisted over 9,000 government grant applications for customers. The net number of customers on the Staying Connected program significantly increased by 45% in FY24. While there has been an  increase in customers entering hardship, they are engaging with AGL sooner, providing a greater opportunity for us to support  customers to reduce their costs and provide information on energy literacy.  Throughout FY24, AGL continued to support Staying Connected customers and other customers experiencing vulnerability with  the delivery of $56 million of debt relief. This support allows customers to focus on paying towards their ongoing energy costs  rather than the arrears. Pleasingly, we have supported approximately 17,000 customers to move off Staying Connected during  FY24. The average debt per Staying Connected customer reduced by 21% in FY24 to $2,025 due to direct financial support  provided to Staying Connected customers through debt relief and payment matching. The total average debt across the mass market customer portfolio increased by 7%, with cost-of-living pressures leading to an  increase in the number of customers who are unable to pay their energy bills by the due date. FY24 FY23 Number of customers on Staying Connected 27,471 18,889 Average level of debt of customers on Staying Connected $2,025 $2,578 Total average debt across mass market customer portfolio $414 $386 Decarbonised energy supply AGL is committed to being the partner of choice in helping our customers decarbonise the way they live, move and work. During  FY24, we expanded our capabilities in our home and business electrification and decarbonisation solution portfolios and increased  customer awareness across the electrification value chain. Through these initiatives, AGL continues to prioritise facilitating an  energy transition that is simple, affordable, and beneficial for our customers. • Electrify Now: We expanded Electrify Now to customers across the NEM, helping them embark on their electrification journey  by providing personalised information on potential carbon emissions and bill savings when switching to five home electrification assets (solar, battery, heat pump hot water, EV and/or induction cooktops). Our recommendations are based on advanced  algorithms leveraging smart meter data through the Consumer Data Right (CDR), which is a first for Australian energy retailers.  Further, we have expanded our install capability through offering more products across solar, battery, EV charging and hot  water.  We have had over 25,000 visitors to Electrify Now during FY24. • Electric vehicles: We have made significant progress in the e-mobility space, with our EV plans attracting over 22,000  customers in FY24, and our EV subscriptions enabling businesses to electrify their fleet and offer salary-sacrifice options to  their employees. We have also seen a surge in EV charger sales and installations, which quadrupled between FY23 and FY24. • Flexibility services: AGL is making a significant investment in flexibility, and has been making strong progress against our  grid-scale battery and distributed energy resources (DER) targets as shown on page 11. As outlined in the Assets scorecard,  we have increased thermal unit flexibility to almost 3,000 MW.  Customer load flexibility is a significant opportunity that makes  use of existing assets in homes and businesses. Electric hot water system orchestration (shifting customers’ hot water load to  the middle of the day to coincide with abundant solar generation) represents a significant flexible load throughout the NEM.  We have expanded our reach beyond the PLUS ES South Australia Demand Flexibility Trial through new partnerships with  distribution network service providers in New South Wales and other leading metering providers, representing a growth of 127%  compared to FY23. For business customers, AGL offers demand response products and is helping customers with flexible load  response as part of the ARENA Load Flex trial. • Climate Active certified products: AGL provides 510,074 carbon neutral services across a suite of Climate Active certified products (up from 444,969 in FY23), including more than 165,000 carbon-neutral gas and electricity services.  • Supporting business decarbonisation: Our ambition to be the decarbonisation partner of choice for our commercial and  industrial customers has also seen strong progress in FY24. We have continued efforts to scale our Energy as a Service (EaaS)  proposition, providing integrated offerings across energy solutions, asset management, orchestration and asset financing, and  have launched a Net Zero advisory model with independent environmental and electrification consultants to help customers  1. Includes $57 million in direct financial support (including the delivery of 100 solar systems), $3 million in proactive engagement and $3 million in energy literacy and training. Customer  Support package will be delivered over a 2-year period.

Assets AGL operates the largest electricity generation portfolio within the National Electricity Market (NEM) of any ASX-listed company,  with 7,982 MW operated generation capacity2 as at 30 June 2024. During FY24, our operated assets exported 35 GWh to the grid3,  and accounted for nearly 20% of total generation within the NEM in FY24. Delivering one of Australia’s most significant decarbonisation initiatives means leading a safe and responsible transition for our  employees, customers and the communities in which we operate.  We have brought forward our coal closures by up to ten years  with an ambition to build 12 GW of new renewable and firming capacity by the end of 2035, with an interim target of 5 GW by  2030.  As we build our pipeline, we will periodically review market dynamics, customer demand and development pipeline options  and seek to accelerate options and the decarbonisation pathway where possible. Our first key milestone was achieved in late April 2023 with the safe and respectful closure of Liddell Power Station after more than  50 years of operation. Bayswater Power Station will close between 2030-2033 (no later than 2033), and Loy Yang A Power Station is  targeted to close by the end of FY35. AGL also ceased production at the Camden Gas Project in August 2023. We recognise that the flexibility, availability and reliability of our current generation fleet will be crucial as we look to leverage strong  operating cash flows from our low-cost generation position, to help fund the transition of our business.  Transitioning our energy portfolio As we transition our energy portfolio, we are sourcing the required energy and firming to supply our customer energy  demand through a combination of self-development and external project options via partnerships and third-party offtakes. Our  development pipeline has grown from 5.3 GW at the beginning of FY24 to 6.2 GW at August 2024, and we plan to continue to  build this pipeline to enable options to be exercised as needed depending on the policy environment, economic environment,  and portfolio and customer needs. We will seek to accelerate options and the decarbonisation pathway where possible, and are  advocating for streamlining the approval and connection process for grid-scale assets to accelerate the transition. During FY24 we continued our strong track record of developing renewable generation and energy storage projects: • Projects commencing commercial operations in FY24: AGL’s first owned and fully operational grid-scale battery – the  Torrens Island Battery (250 MW) commenced operations in August 2023. • Projects under commissioning: As of 30 June 2024, the Broken Hill Battery (50 MW) was in the final stages of testing with  AEMO. Commercial operation commenced in August 2024. • Projects under construction: A final investment decision for the 500 MW Liddell Battery was announced in December  2023. Construction work for the battery is expected to begin in Q1 FY25, with the commencement of operations targeted for  mid-2026.  We also continued the Clover Power Station upgrade project to increase the output capacity of the Kiewa Hydro  Scheme by 14 MW. This is expected to be completed in FY26. 1. By market share, SunWiz Executive Insights Report: Jan 2024 - Top 20 Commercial Retailers (15–100kW and 100kW-5MW, 2023) 2. FY24 installed capacity is the AEMO registered capacity, also taking into account the three 25 MW upgrades to Bayswater Power Station Units 4, 2 and 3 in FY20, FY22 and FY23  respectively. Earlier in FY24, AGL and Tilt Renewables agreed to terminate agreements pursuant to which AGL provided asset management and agency and dispatch services in respect  of certain assets owned by Tilt Renewables, namely the Nyngan Solar Plant, Broken Hill Solar Plant, Coopers Gap Wind Farm and Silverton Wind Farm. As a result, from June 2024 (for  Nyngan Solar Plant, Coopers Gap Wind Farm and Silverton Wind Farm) and July 2024 (for Broken Hill Solar Plant), Tilt Renewables is responsible for operations and maintenance for  each facility, while AGL continues to have offtake agreements in respect of these assets. This is to be considered when making prior-year comparisons against AGL’s FY24 performance. 3.

AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 29 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 30 ===== Directors’ Report Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2024 Reliable and efficient plant operations In FY24, AGL’s overall fleet availability or Equivalent Availability Factor (EAF), was 85.8%. This is an improvement on FY23  performance of 79.5% (excluding Liddell), primarily driven by higher than planned performance at both Bayswater and Loy Yang A  power stations, (namely a reduction in unplanned boiler tube leak outages across all eight units, noting no major outage for  Loy Yang A due to a change in major outage cycle). Both Bayswater and Loy Yang A power stations have delivered record  availability performance for the full year in FY24 compared to the previous 5 years.  The performance of AGL’s wind assets also  continues to improve as we transition from an outsourced contracting model to internal delivery. With the changing nature of electricity demand across Australia, there is an increasing need for more flexible generation, as  well as generation from a diverse range of sources and in a range of locations. Firming assets, such as battery storage and  pumped hydro, as well as gas peaking generation, can start at short notice and ramp up and down quickly, making it an excellent  complement to higher levels of variable renewable generation such as wind and solar. While it may only be required for brief  periods, flexible generation will be critical to maintain system reliability and security. As the market operator has noted, renewable  energy connected with transmission and distribution, firmed with storage, and backed up by gas-fired generation is the lowest-cost  way to supply electricity to homes and businesses through Australia’s transition to a net zero economy. Our ability to flex our thermal fleet enables us to manage the impacts of lower customer demand, or negative pool pricing, during  periods of daytime periods of peak solar generation. This year AGL’s flexible operations program has been successful in further  lowering of the minimum generation at both Bayswater and Loy Yang A power stations. Through an extensive testing and analysis  program these assets are now well positioned to provide a greater level of flexibility. Further development and refinement of  additional modes of operation are underway, which are focused on delivering maximum performance and flexibility to adapt to  changing market conditions. The investment in operational flexibility upgrades of Bayswater Power Station over the previous FY23 period enabled the  avoidance of approximately 180,000 tCO2e of greenhouse gas emissions from the power station in FY241, in addition to improved  commercial outcomes. The enhanced flexibility of our thermal assets along with our portfolio of firming assets, gas turbines, engines, hydro and batteries  means we will have a flexible dispatchable capacity of 7.4 GW to better meet our customers' and market needs. Target FY24 FY23 Equivalent Availability Factor (EAF) - all fleet 85.8% 76.8% Equivalent Availability Factor (EAF) - thermal and gas generation fleet FY27: 88% 86.6% 74.6% Repurposed infrastructure (energy hubs) Transforming our existing thermal sites in the Latrobe Valley, Hunter Valley and Torrens Island into integrated energy hubs is  an important part of our strategy to support regional diversification, providing new jobs and skills development opportunities  for communities where we operate. These energy hubs will leverage the unique infrastructure, land, transport access, and grid  connectivity at our sites to integrate renewable energy, grid-scale batteries, and green industrial precincts, and are planned with  circular economy principles at the forefront. We are making significant progress with transforming our three thermal generation sites into integrated energy hubs. Following the  closure of the Liddell Power Station in April 2023, development activities for the Hunter Hub are well underway, including: • Final investment decision reached on a 500 MW grid-scale battery, supported by a $35 million grant awarded by ARENA and a  Long Term Energy Service Agreement (LTESA), arranged by AEMO Services and funded by the New South Wales Government; • Formal applications submitted to New South Wales local and state planning authorities to enable a broader range of permitted  uses on limited areas of the site; • Feasibility assessments are underway with SunDrive, Renewable Metals, NuRock Building Products and Elecsome exploring the  potential development of renewable manufacturing facilities; • Feasibility assessment underway for the 400 MW Muswellbrook Pumped Hydro project, AGL’s joint venture with Idemitsu  Australia, supported by funding from the New South Wales Government. In June 2024, the project was given Critical  State Significant Infrastructure (CSSI) status by the New South Wales Government, in recognition of it being a high priority  infrastructure project that is essential to New South Wales for economic, social or environmental reasons; and • Continued our support and work with the Wonnarua Nation Aboriginal Corporation to establish a Manuka Tree Plantation,  which will produce medicinal Manuka honey. Planting commenced during the year and is due to completed by the end of 2024.  Decommissioning and rehabilitation of the Liddell Power Station is progressing alongside these planning activities. Refer to the  Environment scorecard for further information. The green hydrogen project with Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) has been deprioritised by FFI and feasibility studies will not  progress at this time.  AGL remains committed to exploring options to produce green hydrogen and future fuels at the Hunter site  in the future if economically feasible. 1.

AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 30  ===== PAGE 31 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2024 The transition of our Torrens Island Power Station into the Torrens Island Hub continued in FY24. The 250 MW Torrens Island  Battery was completed in August 2023. Activities in FY24 included: • Progressing pre-feasibility assessments for a renewable hydrogen facility, including a study into opportunities for hydrogen  blending at the Barker Inlet Power Station; • Undertaking development activities for AGL's Barker Inlet Power Station 2 next to the existing Barker Inlet Power Station; and • Initiating a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with global energy technology company SLB to pilot a nickel hydrogen battery  – expected to be the first of its kind in Australia. Given the planned closure of Loy Yang A Power Station by the end of FY35, AGL continues to explore redevelopment activities in  the Latrobe Valley. Activities in FY24 included: • Successfully completing a hydrogen supply chain pilot led by a consortium of Japanese partners, demonstrating the production,  storage and transport of liquid hydrogen to Japan, as well as commencing feasibility and pre-FEED activities for the potential  commercial-scale development; • Initiating a feasibility assessment with Solar Recovery Corporation to develop a solar panel materials recovery facility; and • Exploring recycling waste coal ash into products such as building materials and agricultural inputs, in an industry-research  collaboration. Further, in partnership with RMIT and the Ash Development Association of Australia, AGL is exploring the  development of low carbon concrete, replacing 80% of cement with coal ash.

People The energy transition is an industry-wide transformation that will involve significant changes to the way in which AGL operates,  and labour and skills required to operate our generation assets will change over time. At AGL, we recognise the importance of  attracting, developing and retaining the right people to enable us to deliver value to our customers and stakeholders. We will  seek to achieve this by building a safe, performance-driven and values-led culture that is reflective of the communities in which  we operate. As we progress through the energy transition, our approach is to treat people fairly and with respect, and to work  constructively and openly with our people to keep them informed and engaged. Safe and healthy workforce Underpinned by our value of ‘Be Safe. Be Supportive’, AGL continues to implement and refine our safety strategies to protect our  workforce and maintain high standards of workplace safety. This year, AGL’s approach to health, safety and environmental (HSE)  risk management included health and safety leadership capability education programs, specific operational engineered solutions  and controls for our key operational risks,  and psycho-social safety awareness programs across the enterprise to manage this  emerging risk. Investments in asset integrity, lifting equipment and digital tools have been made to understand and minimise risk,  with ongoing efforts to review and operationalise risk assessments. AGL has embedded assurance processes such as Critical Control Checks, HSE conversations, HSE interactions and hazard  reporting to support our proactive approach to safety. We continue to provide effective HSE systems and support for our people,  developing improved app-based digital systems to put HSE in the hands of all our people when they are out in the field. Risk assessments play a crucial role in our HSE strategy, ensuring that a robust set of controls is available to workers across various  hazard areas. This year, we have continued in the improvement of our Health, Safety, and Environment Management System  (HSEMS) with the development of new elements to formalise the management of psychological risks. There were no health and safety Significant Impact or Fatality (SIF) events recorded in FY24. Our focus on SIF prevention has been  reinforced through the development and release of a comprehensive SIF awareness training program. The SIF prevention program  this year targeted the trending risks associated with falling and dropped objects and contact with electricity. There was an increase in the number of recordable injuries in FY24 and an associated increase in our Total Injury Frequency  Rate (TIFR). These injuries were largely of low to moderate impact, with no significant long-term injuries affecting our employees  or contractors. We are refocusing on safety and hazard awareness across our workforce, highlighted by the Enterprise-wide  ''Stand Together for Safety'' event during SafeWork Month in October 2023. This event emphasised increased health and safety  interactions across all assets, hazard identification and reporting, and the importance of being fit for work. A key focus in FY24 has been on ensuring our contractors are engaged and aligned with AGL’s values, policies, and standards. A  cornerstone of our contractor engagement approach has been promoting safety leadership through dedicated safety forums to  reinforce our expectations and commitment to health safety and the environment. AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 31 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 32 ===== Directors’ Report Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2024 FY24 FY23 TIFR employees 2.7 2.4 TIFR (employees + contractors) 3.5 2.8 Fatalities (employees + contractors) 0 0 Future fit people and culture As reflected in our overarching strategy, our people are the foundation to our success. In FY24 we have sharpened our focus on  building a future-fit workforce and culture. AGL’s employee engagement score improved for the second year running, increasing  by 5 percentage points to 72%. This outcome reflects increased employee confidence in AGL’s strategy, leadership, and our  commitment to employee development. The demand for talent to support the energy transition means that continuous employee development and growth are essential  to our success. Over FY24, several in-depth capability assessments were conducted to understand the skills our people will  need to drive our strategy, and from this we identified key skill areas in need of resourcing. As a result, we established targeted  recruitment, talent movements and development plans. Throughout the year over 800 employees participated in face-to-face  leadership development programs, and talent and succession reviews were conducted for over 200 people and roles. We are investing in the digital engagement platform that will support our focus on skills and capability, and in FY24 we commenced  an innovative program of work to uplift our people processes and systems to ensure that our people are connected with  information and opportunities to navigate their careers, and our leaders have access to insights to enable fast and effective workforce decisions. We know that harnessing a broad talent pool will be key to unlocking future success and therefore accelerating progress on gender  equality, building an inclusive and respectful culture, and playing our role in building an inclusive energy future have been key focus  areas of our diversity and inclusion strategy. Over FY24, female representation increased across AGL’s Senior Leadership Pipeline  and the overall workforce. This increase in representation has contributed to a reduction in the overall median gender pay gap for  total remuneration from 33.2% in March 2023 to 29.3% in March 2024.  We continue to invest in building inclusive practices, including offering employees flexibility to take the January 26 public holiday  on a different day, introducing superannuation payments for people on unpaid parental leave, and strengthening expectations  on people leaders to create positive, consistent, and inclusive leadership practices. During FY24 we maintained our Platinum  Employer status for LGBTQ+ inclusion through the Australian Workplace Equality Index (AWEI), our Family Inclusive Workplace  certification through Family Friendly Workplaces and our Breastfeeding Friendly Workplace accreditation through the Australian  Breastfeeding Association. We were also recognised by Australian Financial Review (AFR) Boss Magazine as one of Australia and  New Zealand’s ‘Best Places to Work’ for 2024, and ranked in the top ten performers in Australia’s Disability Network (ADN) Access  and Inclusion Index Report 2023. As part of our Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) commitments (refer also to the Relationships scorecard), AGL is committed to  increasing First Nations representation in our workforce. During FY24 we worked with our existing First Nations employees to  establish our First Nations Employee Network and to create a dedicated Employee Value Proposition (EVP) to help drive the  recruitment and retention of First Nations people at AGL.  At our operational sites, we supported employment opportunities for  First Nations employees. At AGL Loy Yang, we established a new 2-year traineeship program with two First Nations warehouse  trainees appointed this year, and at Bayswater Power Station, we earmarked one position in the annual intake of Bayswater’s  apprenticeship program for a local First Nations candidate. The number of self-identifying First Nation employees increased from  19 (0.6%) in FY23 to 39 (0.9%) in FY24. The impact of our focus on future-fit people and culture over FY24 is evident in reduced attrition (down from 13% in FY23 to 11%  in FY24), and improved retention of key talent (up from 83% in F23 to 92% in FY24). Targets FY24 FY23 Employee engagement 72% 67% Attrition (total workforce) 11% 13% Key talent retention 92% 83% Gender mix in SLP (% female) FY24: 35% FY25: 40% FY26: ≥40% 36% 33% Material breaches of Code of Conduct 0 0 Workforce transition Our commitment to a respectful and responsible workforce transition is critical to build a secure foundation for the future of  our workforce, and communities impacted by assets in transition and the repurposing of our sites. Respectful and inclusive  engagement with impacted employees and communities is the cornerstone of this commitment. Our approach to workforce transition is informed by comprehensive workforce analysis to identify available career pathways for  our people while ensuring we have the skills and capability to continue to operate our assets safely and reliably.  AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 32  ===== PAGE 33 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2024 Building on the successful closure of Liddell Power Station in 2023, we reviewed and refined our people transition blueprint  with a view to continuing to deliver a respectful and responsible transition throughout future asset closures. This approach  was implemented at our Rosalind Park Gas Plant in Camden, New South Wales, where the 'last gas' production was on  30 August 2023. Our workforce was supported with individual transition plans, mental health support, career outplacement  services, financial counselling, superannuation talks, and information on retirement. We also commenced our transition journey at the Torrens Island Power Station in South Australia, which is scheduled to close in  June 2026. All impacted employees have an individual transition plan outlining the training and support they can access to achieve  their future goals. A ‘Future U Hub’, modelled on the Hub used at Liddell, will open at Torrens Island in 2025 as a dedicated on-site  career transition centre, providing a place for employees to access a range of support services.  We continue to work with leaders across our assets in transition to ensure they are equipped and supported to lead their people  through change. As our assets transition, our workforce is well placed with the necessary skills to ensure they are future-ready. Relationships As a key player in Australia’s interconnected energy industry, it is vital that AGL has open and respectful relationships with our  stakeholders, especially during this period of significant transformation for the industry. A wide variety of people and groups are  interested in, or affected by, the decisions that AGL makes, or have a role in influencing the frameworks through which AGL makes  decisions. These include local communities and Traditional Custodians, governments, regulators, the energy industry and industry  associations, non-government organisations and advocacy groups, suppliers, project partners, and lenders and investors. AGL strives to make a net positive social, economic and environmental contribution to the communities in which we operate. We  proactively engage with our stakeholders on relevant issues in ways that are most appropriate to each group. It is important to  AGL that we build trust in our stakeholders by engaging openly with them, and by having them recognise that we consider their  views in our decision-making. Engaged and supported communities AGL invests in the communities in which we operate through a structured program of community investment. In FY24, total  community contributions increased by over 25%, with increased focus on energy literacy and affordability; and supporting our  partners who provide financial assistance to those in need in communities where we operate. In FY24, we continued consolidating our community investment to support four key areas that contribute to building and  maintaining our social licence: building resilience in communities where we operate, supporting climate action, addressing energy  affordability, and empowering First Nations communities through education and employment opportunities. In FY25, we plan to  further expand the programs within these four focus areas to maximise the social impact of our investment and provide our  community partners funding security over a longer timeframe, to enable them to grow and improve their services. Through AGL's Powering our Community program we provide funding to our community partners to help them to decarbonise.  During FY24 we funded the installation of more than 63 kW solar generation capacity for our community partners OzHarvest,  Hunter Valley Aboriginal Corporation and Aussie Ark. Through our ongoing partnership with Gippsland Climate Change Network  (GCCN), since 2022 we have been supporting the delivery of a network of community-owned EV charging infrastructure and the  provision of community education regarding electrification. At the end of FY24, the installation of four community EV charging units  was completed with another two units nearing completion, which will provide a total of 13 charging points. We have ongoing engagement with the communities where we operate through well-established forums such as Community  Consultative Committees (CCCs) and Community Dialogue Groups (CDGs). For proposed new projects, we develop a tailored  and comprehensive community engagement strategy to deliver meaningful and continual engagement with local community  stakeholders and Traditional Custodians in the proposed project location.  In FY24, we launched our second 'Innovate' Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) and have made strong progress against the targets  and ambitions contained in it. Our first RAP enabled a deeper understanding of the need for tangible action and forged genuine  commitment across all levels of the organisation, creating the momentum to accelerate delivery of our second RAP. Details of  our progress against our First Nations procurement target and workforce representation ambition are outlined on pages 35 and 31, respectively. Cultivating respectful, trusted and meaningful connections with the Traditional Custodian of the lands on which we operate is  critical to our success, and we are focused on improving both the way we work with Traditional Custodians and how we protect  and enhance the cultural heritage values of these lands.  During FY24 we continued implementing AGL’s Cultural Engagement  Guidelines (which were developed in partnership with First Nations advisors at PwC Indigenous Consulting) to create consistency  across the organisation when working with Traditional Custodians in the communities where we are operating and for new  projects. Across our businesses we are working to build cultural safety, including access to formal and informal cultural learning  experiences for all our employees. In FY24 we also continued supporting First Nations education programs including Clontarf  Foundation, Stars Foundation, Waiwa Mudena and the Jungarra Wannik tertiary education scholarships. We conduct periodic community sentiment surveys to understand the perceptions, concerns and needs of the communities  where we have significant operational presence as well as how they view AGL and our engagement with the community.  We also undertake quarterly monitoring of our reputation via RepTrak. AGL's RepTrak score improved by 1.3 points to 66.9.  AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 33 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 34 ===== Directors’ Report Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2024 This improvement coincided with increased activity in market from AGL, including the launch of new value based propositions and  significant efforts to help customers experiencing cost-of-living pressures (as outlined in the Customer scorecard). We are committed to meeting all our tax compliance obligations, and to providing our stakeholders with information about the  taxes we pay. In this regard we have adopted the Board of Taxation’s voluntary Tax Transparency Code. Our effective tax rate on  Underlying Profit for FY24 is broadly in line with the Australian corporate tax rate of 30% before prior year adjustments and the  research and development concession. FY24 FY23 Community contribution $6.0 m $4.8 m RepTrak score 66.9 65.6 Underlying effective tax rate 30.5% 26.7% Collaboration for Australia's energy future Active engagement and collaboration between industry, government and the community is critical for achieving a successful  transition to a lower carbon future.  AGL recognises the importance of positive and transparent relationships with all our  stakeholders, and in creating opportunities to work together to achieve innovative solutions to challenges. As owners of critical infrastructure and providers of essential services, we regularly communicate with government authorities  to ensure that our services are delivered effectively and in accordance with government expectations. We proactively engage  with all levels of government and relevant statutory authorities such as planning and environmental bodies, as it is crucial that  governments and the private sector have a common understanding of how best to achieve governments’ renewable energy and  emissions targets, while also seeking to keep energy prices affordable and energy markets operating effectively over the long  term.  In accordance with AGL’s Political Donations Policy, we have not made any political donations (monetary or in-kind) in FY24. We also engage with energy market bodies to support market reforms that will best meet the needs of the energy system and  our customers, and participate in regulatory consultation processes regarding proposed changes to energy market policies. Our  submissions are available on AGL’s website.  As we progress our energy transition plans, we proactively engage with public interest groups that represent diverse stakeholder  views on important issues including climate and the environment, to ensure there is open communication through which we are  kept aware of key issues for communities, and can share the opportunities and challenges presented by the transition to a lower  carbon future. AGL is acutely aware of the challenges facing energy customers, particularly rising cost-of-living pressures. We have strong  relationships with diverse customer representatives through the AGL Customer Council, which has been operating since 1998.  We also engage regularly with governments and regulators, financial counsellors, customer advocates, and consumer groups, to  provide guidance on how best to implement energy bill relief programs and deliver customer support and assistance. AGL is a member of several industry associations that provide access to industry information and an opportunity to engage on  issues and shared opportunities facing the energy sector. We also participate in several community associations, with a particular  focus on communities we operate in.  In accordance with our Industry Association Membership Policy, we review memberships  annually to ensure that the values and aims of the associations are consistent with those of AGL. A summary of the FY24 review is  included in the ESG Data Centre. Where there is misalignment, we take steps to advocate for changes in policy positioning within  that organisation or consider the merit of ongoing membership with the association where the misalignment is significant and  unable to be resolved. Strong business relationships Our relationships with suppliers, project partners and financial institutions remains foundational to our ability to deliver on  Australia’s energy transition. With over 4,100 suppliers, our Supplier Code of Conduct governs our procurement practices with a key focus on engaging with  suppliers that share similar values and commitments as AGL, while also supporting our suppliers to manage the ESG impact of  the goods and services they supply to us. In FY24 AGL has developed improved processes with regards to our supplier selection  and assessment criteria to ensure we continue to increase our rigour in relation to ESG impacts at all stages of the procurement  process. These improvements have focused on modern slavery, physical and cyber security of our assets and customer data, and  other elements of our procurement procedures and processes. Payment of small business suppliers has continued to be a strong focus in FY24, improving our performance in the Australian  Government’s Small Business Payment Times Reporting Scheme targets by 15%. This has a significant impact in supporting small  businesses with their cashflow. AGL’s commitment to First Nations owned businesses continues to grow, and during FY24 we purchased $5.96 million of goods  and services from First Nations owned businesses1. This represents a significant milestone, which has seen us exceed our two-year  Reconciliation Action Plan target of $5.7 million in our first year, and work with 54 First Nations suppliers. 1. Includes both direct and indirect spend. AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 34  ===== PAGE 35 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2024 AGL’s revised Procurement Policy has an underlying principle of responsible procurement which is aimed at strengthening our  engagement with diverse suppliers including First Nations owned businesses, small and local businesses, and social enterprises  within the communities in which we operate. AGL has entered into partnership with multiple social industry organisations to  further our engagement in these sectors. As outlined in AGL’s Human Rights Policy, AGL is committed to upholding and respecting the human rights of our employees,  customers and the communities in which we operate and that are affected by our operations. As part of delivering on this  commitment, AGL on an annual basis assesses the modern slavery risks across our operations and supply chain to inform the  steps that need to be taken to manage the risk. The steps taken to manage the risk throughout FY24 will be summarised in our  fifth Modern Slavery Statement which will be available on our website in early 2025. Developing and maintaining strong relationships with lending banks and debt capital markets investors is a crucial element of  securing the capital needed to invest in renewable energy projects and execute on AGL's strategy and decarbonisation targets.  AGL has been focused on ensuring that lenders and investors that want to deploy capital to support the energy transition  understand both AGL's strategy and the nuances of the Australian electricity market, particularly given that the carbon intensity of  AGL’s generation portfolio will remain much higher than the industry average while the Loy Yang A Power Station is required for the  stable, efficient, and cost-effective operation of the National Electricity Market. During FY23, AGL established a Green Finance Framework2 which sets out the process by which we have issued debt on an  ongoing basis to fund capital expenditure for new firming capacity and renewable energy assets. In FY24 we continued to use this  framework to support the delivery of AGL’s CTAP, driving more efficient access to capital for ‘green’ projects that meet the eligibility  criteria specified in the Framework, which is guided by best practice principles and guidelines. In FY24, AGL secured $510 million in Asian Term Loan Facilities and issued $468 million in long-term notes in the US private  placement market. Building on the $1.6 billion refinanced in FY23, this highlights AGL’s robust lender and investor support,  reflecting market confidence in its strategic direction and climate transition plan. Environment AGL takes our environmental responsibilities seriously, and recognises the high expectations of our stakeholders in relation to how  we operate our assets as well as the role we play in Australia’s decarbonisation journey. We recognise that our stakeholders expect  AGL to have strong and responsible transition plans that will lead AGL towards a net zero future, accompanied by measurable  targets and transparent reporting. As we contribute to Australia’s decarbonisation through the responsible closure of our coal-fired power stations over time, we face significant rehabilitation obligations, which we undertake through various transition activities  with careful monitoring and transparency. Future low-carbon world As Australia’s largest corporate emitter of greenhouse gases, actions taken by AGL to reduce emissions will have a material impact  on Australia’s emissions profile, and in FY24 our operated Scope 1 and 2 emissions accounted for approximately 8% of Australia’s  total emissions. This year, we exceeded our target of achieving a 17% reduction in operated Scope 1 and 2 emissions against a FY19 baseline,  achieving a 23.3% reduction. In FY24, over 95% of our operated Scope 1 and 2 emissions and approximately 55% of our estimated  total Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions arose from the combustion of black and brown coal in our power stations to generate electricity  both for our customers and other customers in the National Electricity Market. The transition of AGL’s energy portfolio from one dominated by baseload thermal generation to a portfolio of renewable  generation and firming represents a substantial contribution to the decarbonisation of Australia’s economy.  In September 2022, AGL published our inaugural Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP), which documents AGL’s climate  commitments, targets and ambitions, and recognises the need to balance responsible transition and rapid decarbonisation to  keep Australia's electricity supply secure, reliable, and affordable. Our CTAP commitments included accelerated coal closure  timeframes and emissions reduction targets and ambitious renewable and firming portfolio targets. Further information on our  2022 CTAP, including a summary of the progress made against our CTAP commitments, is provided in Section 7.2.1.  The Climate Related Disclosures section also provides further details on how we consider governance, risk management, strategy,  and metrics and targets in relation to climate change. Further information on how we are transitioning our energy portfolio, including our development pipeline of renewable and  firming projects and our integrated energy hubs developments is available in the Assets scorecard, while information about how  we are working with our customers, our people and our communities as we decarbonise is available in our Customer scorecard,  People scorecard and Relationships scorecard respectively. AGL’s operated Scope 1 and 2 emissions decreased in FY24, being AGL's first full reporting year since the closure of the Liddell  Power Station in April 2023. This reduction was partially offset by increased emissions from the Bayswater and Loy Yang A power  stations due to their increased availability. The emissions intensity of operated and contracted generation increased in FY24 due  2. The Framework is consistent with the Green Loan Principles (GLP) as issued by the Asia-Pacific Loan Market Association (APLMA), the Green Bond Principles (GBP) and Climate  Transition Finance Handbook (CTFH) as issued by the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) and the Climate Bonds Standard & Certification Scheme (CBS) where applicable AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 35 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 36 ===== Directors’ Report Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2024 to the larger relative contribution of generation from Loy Yang A Power Station (which has a high emissions intensity) compared  to FY23.

Environmental stewardship AGL has a genuine commitment to operate in a responsible manner and has plans that are designed to reduce our environmental  impact. We are committed to continuously improving our environmental management practices and performance. In FY24 AGL continued to deliver improvement programs to protect and conserve biodiversity, reduce air emissions and improve  cultural heritage practices: • Biodiversity: AGL is committed to the protection and conservation of biodiversity in the areas where we operate. During FY24,  we published a new Biodiversity Policy, which sets out our vision to minimise direct impacts on biodiversity in the areas where  we operate, and to promote sustainable practices that protect and enhance the diversity of plant and animal species, as well as  their habitats. We also established a geographic information system (GIS) database as a central repository for biodiversity values  in proximity to AGL assets, developed a register of land managed by AGL as biodiversity offsets, and introduced a Ground and  Vegetation Disturbance Approval Permit to manage impacts to flora, fauna and ecological communities. • Air emissions: During FY24, AGL continued to implement actions aimed at reducing NOx, SO2 and particulate emissions from  the Bayswater and Loy Yang A power stations, to assist in meeting our obligations and managing our liabilities associated with  air emissions from our coal-fired power stations. Air emissions data is available in the ESG Data Centre. • Cultural heritage: AGL is committed to improving our approach to the management of First Nations cultural heritage at our  sites in conjunction with Traditional Custodians to meet community expectations in addition to legislative requirements. Actions  completed in FY24 included updates to the current GIS database for all recorded cultural heritage locations within 1km of AGL  assets, and introduction of a Ground and Vegetation Disturbance Approval Permit, both of which are used prior to ground  disturbance works commencing to identify and prevent unauthorised impacts to recorded cultural heritage locations. During FY24, there were 17 Environmental Regulatory Reportable (ERR) incidents, four administrative non-compliance events, and  one Environment Serious Impact or Fatality (SIF) Actual1 events as summarised below: • Two ERR events with negligible short-term local environmental impact (inside AGL’s operational area): These events  comprised generation of uncontrolled runoff/sediment or erosion. Actions were taken to reduce the likelihood of this event  occurring again. • Four administrative non-compliance events with negligible short-term local environmental impact (inside AGL’s  operational area): These events resulted from exceeding operating hours, undertaking work without applying the consent  condition, revising estimated rehabilitation costs and late submission of a surrender application for an Environmental Authority. • One ERR event with small scale short-term environmental impact that may extend beyond AGL’s operational area:  This event comprised releases/spills/leaks or loss of containment to ground/soil. Clean up works were undertaken and actions  were implemented to reduce the likelihood of the event occurring again. • Fourteen ERR events with moderate short to medium-term environmental impact that may extend beyond  AGL’s operational area, which is contained and requires short-term clean-up: These events comprised uncontrolled/ unauthorised discharge to surface water (2), loss of containment/impact to air (11), and fire (1). Works have commenced and are  ongoing to reduce the likelihood of these events occurring again. • One Environment SIF Actual event with a significant medium-term impact on important habitat that may extend  beyond AGL’s operational area, which is contained and requires medium-term clean-up: This Environment SIF  Actual event comprised unauthorised clearing of native vegetation outside of the operational area. Remediation works have  commenced and are ongoing. 1. A Serious Impact or Fatality (SIF) Actual (Environment) is defined as an event resulting from a sudden, immediate threat impact to human health or the natural environment, arising from  an unauthorised activity or the release of pollutants into the air, land, or water. AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 36  ===== PAGE 37 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2024 Programs are underway which seek to reduce the number of reportable events across our operational sites.

Responsible rehabilitation The safe and efficient closure of our ageing generation assets is essential in achieving AGL’s decarbonisation commitments. In  addition, the necessary decommissioning, demolition and rehabilitation of these sites creates a pathway to deliver AGL’s integrated  energy hub strategy (refer to the Assets scorecard). We remain committed to providing ongoing, transparent disclosure in relation  to our approach to the closure and rehabilitation of our assets at the end of their operational lives.  Consistent with our previously communicated closure commitments, AGL ceased production at the Camden Gas Project during  FY24. Since reaching ‘last gas’ in August 2023, the Camden Gas Project’s closure activities have included the completion of  decommissioning and demolition of the gas plant and ongoing decommissioning and rehabilitation of the gas wells.  Transition activities undertaken during FY24 focused on: • Delivering positive sustainability outcomes through closure projects, including repurposing or recycling waste materials; • Progressing the Liddell Power Station decommissioning project and completing early scrap removal activities in preparation  for demolition;  • Demolishing the redundant feedwater heating plant (solar array) to prepare for development of the Liddell Battery; • Completing over 120 ha of Stage 1 base layer for Liddell Ash Dam’s post-closure capping project and continuing with proactive  dust and vegetation management strategies;  • Continuing the ‘make safe’ decommissioning works at Torrens A Power Station and mobilising the demolition contractor to  commence the removal of hazardous materials in preparation for demolition; • Completing the sale, preservation and transport of Rosalind Park Gas Plant assets, followed by decommissioning and demolition  of remaining infrastructure; and • Undertaking progressive decommissioning of gas wells at the Camden Gas Project with 14 wells completed in FY24, taking the  total wells rehabilitated to 129 out of 144, with a further five wells in the process of being decommissioned. During FY25, transition activities will focus on: • Maintaining our focus on recycling and recovering materials through our closure projects and demolition contracts. It is  expected that around 90% of the materials in the Liddell Power Station will be recycled during demolition; • Finalising the decommissioning at Liddell and Torrens A power stations; • Commencing early demolition works at Liddell, leading to full scale demolition following receipt of all necessary  regulatory approvals;  • Further progression of the Liddell Ash Dam capping project in line with rehabilitation plans; • Ongoing hazardous material removal activities and associated demolition activities at Torrens A Power Station; • Completing civil works and rehabilitation of the Rosalind Park Gas Plant in preparation for lease hand-back; • Ongoing rehabilitation of remaining gas wells at Camden Gas Project; and • Decommissioning of the 2 MW Cairn Curran Hydro Power Station. AGL also undertakes progressive rehabilitation works at the Loy Yang mine, Silver Springs, and the Ravensworth facility in  compliance with regulatory obligations and approvals. Progressive rehabilitation activities are outlined in the ESG Data Centre. We formally review our approach to rehabilitation, including intended use, no less than every three years.  In 2023 the updated  three-yearly reassessment commenced, overseen by the COO and CFO, which involved a detailed assessment of 29 sites in  conjunction with an external consultant, GHD. Significant change has occurred since the 2020 review, including bringing forward of  thermal site closure dates (as per our CTAP), and commencement of works at Liddell, Torrens A and Camden. The changes from rehabilitation completed in FY24, interest added to the provision, and the three-yearly review have increased  the rehabilitation provision by $163 million, which is reflected in AGL’s financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2024.  The  discount rate used to derive the present value of the estimated cash flows remains unchanged from FY23 at 6.86%.

Business Intelligence Leveraging business intelligence and insights is a critical means for AGL to deliver benefits for our customers. Asset and data  security measures ensure we can safeguard customer information entrusted to us, enabling us to navigate an increasingly  complex digital landscape. AGL’s management of wholesale trading and risk management ensures prudent decision-making and  effective mitigation of potential risks and volatility affecting our customers. Enhancing customer experience We are focused on meeting the changing needs of our customers, and in FY24 invested in technology transformation to enhance  our customers’ experience. We are using call driver analytics to inform how we operate, to improve how customers engage with  and experience our services. From this, we are making it easier for customers to engage with us and understand their energy  choices through digital self-service and supporting through the in-app AGL Messaging function, connecting customers to advice in  real time. This has been reflected in the growth of our ‘digital only’ customers (now 55.8%), and those who are able to fully resolve  their queries and tasks through digital channels. Automated AI transactions were up 105% compared to FY23, to 10.4 million. In FY24, we also increased our investment in transforming our business operations and customer delivery. As part of this  effort, we announced a significant step in our Retail Transformation Program through an agreement with Kaluza. Kaluza's proven  technology platform is scaleable, flexible and digitises and simplifies energy billing, reduces cost to serve and enables faster  product innovation to facilitate the energy transition. Kaluza currently services more than 6 million meters at Ovo Energy in the  UK. This step builds on our existing relationship with Kaluza through our investment in Ovo Energy Australia, in which AGL has  had a 51% investment since 2021, and now fully owns. Kaluza successfully migrated Ovo Energy Australia’s customer base onto  the Kaluza platform in 2023 and now supports 94,000 customer services. Our partnership will enhance the experience for both  customers and our contact centre agents, using fit-for-purpose technology that promotes agility and efficiency. This is expected to  improve our energy billing capabilities, simplify our product offerings, improve speed to market for new products, facilitate easier  resolution of customer issues using AI, and help us to better tailor the customer experience to meet our customers’ needs.  We also continue to invest in further enhancing the digital experience for our business customers and have expanded our  commercial solar monitoring and management platform to support more than 283 MW of our business customers’ solar assets in  FY24, optimising asset performance to ensure customers are benefiting from maximum solar production.  Target FY24 FY23 Digital only customers FY27: 60% 55.8% 52.7% Speed to market FY27: +80%1 +30% Not applicable 1. Improvement compared to May 2023 baseline. Trading, operation, and risk management capabilities AGL’s position as an integrated energy generator and retailer means we can effectively manage price volatility in the energy  markets on behalf of our customers. During FY24, AGL delivered value through both effective risk management of our wholesale  energy portfolio, and the safe and efficient operation of our generation assets. Our risk management framework includes the Trading Risk Policy, which governs our energy hedging and related trading activities.  This policy allows for the commercial optimisation of AGL’s portfolio within an overall risk limit that reflects AGL’s risk appetite. With continued investment in our Trading, Risk and Decentralised Energy management systems, we have been able to improve  the sophistication of our decision-making, such as the algorithmic optimisation and bidding of both our growing large-scale battery  fleet, and our growing Virtual Power Plant (VPP), which incorporates distributed assets like batteries, hot water units and other  customer assets. Critically, investments in these systems have helped ensure our governance processes remain in step with our  commercial decision-making. AGL will continue to contract gas to support the requirements of our customers and our generation fleet, recognising that  customer gas demand is expected to gradually decline with the projected shift to electrification.   AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 38  ===== PAGE 39 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2024 Secure assets and data AGL manages a significant number of assets, including systems, software and networks on which we and others rely, as well  as critical infrastructure assets owned and operated by AGL. We also protect a significant amount of confidential information,  including personal information and data records of our customers. We undertake a comprehensive process to identify, assess and mitigate key cyber security risks, leveraging the Australian Energy  Sector Cyber Security Framework, and in line with regulatory requirements such as the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 and  the Privacy Act 1988. Cyber security and resilience is a Tier 1 Strategic Risk overseen by the Board as part of our enterprise-wide  risk management program (refer to the FY24 Tier 1 Strategic Risks section). Our continual investment in our portfolio of security capabilities, processes and measures enables us to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of assets and data. We proactively manage cyber risk to limit the likelihood of inappropriate access to  systems and data, and to limit the impact of incidents through preparation and rapid response capabilities.  Security vulnerabilities  are managed via a dedicated threat and vulnerability management team and automated scanning platforms, as well as specialist  technical assurance, including penetration testing. The measures we take to protect our assets and data do not eliminate risk. There is always a risk that security breaches,  unauthorised access, malicious software, external attacks or internal breaches could occur that adversely impact our operations  and confidential information. There were 44 major incidents in FY24, compared to 34 incidents in FY23 and 50 in FY22. The overall stability of our technology  environment is attributed to robust change management processes, focus on remediation actions, proactive monitoring and  detection, and continued focus on addressing root cause problems to prevent issues from escalating into major incidents. In FY24, there was one major cyber security incident. A cyber-attack which targeted our business systems related to our  telecommunication services, with the assumed intent of carrying out a ransomware attack, which was ultimately unsuccessful,  with minimal business impact and no disruption to our customers. AGL has implemented additional security controls to mitigate  against similar incidents and further strengthen security.  Across FY24, AGL identified and reported five Notifiable Data Breaches to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner,  compared with three in FY23. The increase in Notifiable Data Breaches reported is partly attributable to the elevated cyber security  threat landscape being observed by AGL and the broader energy sector, but may also be partly attributable to AGL's improving  ability to detect unusual and authorised account activity. AGL is also reliant on key third parties to maintain effective controls  and prevent unauthorised access. AGL continues to invest in tools, controls and management practices designed to reduce the  likelihood of further breaches, and to detect and remediate any breaches that occur in the future.  FY24 FY23 Major IT incidents 44 34 Reportable privacy incidents 5 3 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 39 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 40 ===== Directors’ Report Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2024 Group Financial Performance and Position 4. 4.1 Group results summary Statutory Profit after tax attributable to AGL shareholders was $711 million, an increase of $1,975 million compared to the Statutory Loss of  $(1,264) million in the prior year. The principal drivers of the increase were a lower value of asset impairments taken in FY24 compared to  FY23, lower unfavourable movements in the fair value of financial instruments and a higher Underlying Profit after tax. 4.1.1 Reconciliation of Statutory Profit/(Loss) to Underlying Profit AGL uses Underlying Profit as a key measure of financial performance. Underlying Profit is derived from Statutory Profit, as measured in  accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, and excluding significant items and movements in the fair value of financial instruments.  The use of Underlying Profit enhances comparability of results by excluding non-recurring events and transactions that materially affect the  financial results of AGL for the reporting period. Underlying Profit after tax was $812 million, up 189% from the prior year. A description of the factors driving Underlying Profit is included in  Section 4.1.5.

The increase in the rehabilitation provisions was following external reviews of the rehabilitation  requirements for all operational sites. AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 40  ===== PAGE 41 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2024 • Recognised $2 million ($1 million post-tax) net gain due to the partial surrender of the 664 Collins Street office lease, partly offset by  impairment of corporate office leases. • Recognised a reduction in the onerous contract liability of $1 million ($1 million post-tax) related to various renewable asset power  purchase agreements (PPAs). FY23 During the year AGL: • Recognised impairments of $1,023 million ($716 million post-tax) relating to the carrying value of the AGL Generation Fleet cash-  generating unit, primarily as a result of the decision to bring forward the targeted closure date of Loy Yang A Power Station and additional  Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) costs, and the George Street lease right-of-use assets. This was partly offset by the partial  reversal of the previously recognised impairment of the Moranbah Gas Project of $51 million ($36 million post-tax). • Recognised $30 million ($21 million post-tax) in costs related to redundancy provisions for employees impacted by the planned closure of  the Torrens Island Power Station and Camden operations. • Recognised $14 million ($10 million post-tax) in separation and re-integration costs related to the proposed demerger of AGL. • Recognised $47 million ($33 million post-tax) due to the reduction in rehabilitation provision assets that had previously been impaired. The  reduction in rehabilitation provision was driven by an increase in the discount rate following market changes in base rates. • Recognised $17 million ($15 million post-tax) revenue related to contingent milestones under the FY21 Wellington North Solar Farm sale  being met in the current year. • Recognised $7 million ($7 million post-tax) revenue related to the sale of land as part of a NSW government compulsory acquisition. • Recognised a reduction in the onerous contract liability of $2 million ($1 million post-tax) related to various renewable asset power  purchase agreements (PPAs). 4.1.3 Movement in fair value of financial instruments recognised in Profit or Loss Movement in the fair value of financial instruments recognised in profit or loss (excluded from Underlying Profit) was $(53) million  ($(37) million post-tax), up from $(1,271) million ($(890) million post-tax). The net loss reflected a negative fair value movement in electricity  level 1 and level 2 derivatives due to the positive cash flow trades that had expired during FY24. This was partly offset by a positive fair value  movement in oil and gas derivative contracts as a result of the higher forward oil curve on a net buy position. .

Refer to Section 5 for further analysis on the movement in gross margin for each operating segment and Section 3.1.6 for commentary on  Group operating costs. Depreciation and amortisation of $(747) million was up 2.6%, driven by the completion of the Torrens Island Battery on 30 September  2023, a higher asset base due to increased investment at AGL Loy Yang and Bayswater power stations, and an increase in AGL Loy Yang  environmental rehabilitation assets. This was partly offset by the impairment of Torrens Island Power Station resulting from the accelerated  closure announced in September 2022, and Customer Markets digital assets reaching the end of their depreciable life. Net finance costs were $(312) million, up 20.9% largely driven by higher debt facility interest costs, and higher embeded interest costs  unwinding from the onerous contracts and rehabilitation provisions due to increased reference base rates. Underlying tax expense was $(353) million, primarily reflecting the increase in Underlying Profit before tax. The underlying effective tax rate  was 30.5%, an increase of 3.8 ppts.

Includes deferred revenue recognised for receipt of $381 million government bill relief received in June 2024 to be passed through to customers in FY25. The drivers for higher operating cash flow and cash conversion rates were higher Underlying EBITDA, timing of the bill relief receipt,  and lower working capital requirements compared to the prior year. Total working capital movements were $(140) million, compared to  $(168) million in the prior year. Components of working capital movement were: • Receivables cash flow of $(98) million reflecting price changes driving higher customer consumption revenue, and a payment to the Clean  Energy Regulator (CER) for the under surrender of 2023 Large-scale Generation Certificates (LGCs). This was partly offset by a refund of  fees by the CER following the surrender of 2020 LGCs. • Payables cash flow of $(75) million reflected higher electricity generation at higher pool prices, and AGL Loy Yang mine coal royalty  payments. This was partly offset by higher unbilled network costs resulting from increased rates and higher coal consumption. • Inventory cash flow of $25 million reflected net gas withdrawals from storage to meet demand and support the gas portfolio. • Financial assets/liabilities (margin calls) cash flow of $(38) million reflected higher variation margins within the futures book. • Green assets/liabilities cash flow of $41 million reflected higher Victorian Energy Efficiency Certificate (VEEC) prices for forward purchases  factored into compliance liability in FY24, and inventory optimisation strategy to lower inventory holdings of green certificates. The movement in other assets/liabilities and non-cash items of $435 million included the timing of the bill relief receipt. Payments for rehabilitation of $(82) million included payments for the ongoing decommissioning of the Liddell Power Station and related  infrastructure, and the decommissioning and rehabilitation of gas wells. Cash tax payment of $(4) million reflected the net profit generated in FY24, partly offset by the receipt of the prior year tax refund which  reflected a net tax loss in FY23. Investing cash flows of $(926) million primarily reflected capital expenditure, and Tilt Renewables capital injections. Refer to Section 3.1.6 for  further details on capital expenditure. Financing activities cash flows of $(530) million primarily reflected net borrowing repayments of $(193) million and dividend payments of  $(330) million. AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 43 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 44 ===== Directors’ Report Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2024 4.2.2 Operating Free Cash Flow AGL has adopted operating free cash flow as a key measure of financial performance to ensure the operational core business generates  strong cash flows to support future investment in growth. Operating free cash flow is derived from net cash provided by operating activities  excluding working capital movements for margin calls and cash flow related to significant items and adding sustaining capital expenditure on  an accruals basis. Operating free cash flow was $1,736 million, up $1,232 million from the prior year, primarily driven by the increase in Underlying EBITDA and  the timing of the bill relief receipt. This was partly offset by higher sustaining capital expenditure primarily at AGL's thermal power stations.

Refer to Section 3.1.6 for commentary on sustaining capital expenditure on an accruals basis. 4.3 Financial position Summary Statement of Financial Position At 30 June 2024 AGL’s total assets were $15,661 million, an increase from $15,238 million at 30 June 2023, primarily due to an increase in  cash reflective of the increase in Underlying EBITDA, the timing of the bill relief receipt, and a $364 million increase in current trade and other  receivables reflecting energy price increases affecting the closing balances. The increase in property, plant and equipment was reflective of the increase in capital expenditure during the year (refer to Section 3.1.6). This was partly offset by a $745 million decrease in energy  derivatives. Other current assets included $83 million of assets classified as held for sale, a decrease of $102 million due to the divestment of  the Moranbah Gas Project and an impairment loss recognised on the Surat Gas Project in the current period (refer to Section 4.1.2). Total liabilities at 30 June 2024 were $10,230 million, an increase from $10,119 million at 30 June 2023, primarily due to receipt of  $381 million government bill relief to be passed through to customers, a $274 million increase in trade and other payables reflecting an  increase in AEMO related trade payables, and an increase in environmental rehabilitation provisions. This was partly offset by a $687 million  movement in energy derivatives, a decrease in borrowings, and a decrease in liabilities held for sale due to the divestment of the Moranbah  Gas Project. Total equity at 30 June 2024 was $5,431 million, up from $5,119 million, primarily reflecting the Statutory Profit for the period, partly offset by  dividends paid. AGL’s return on equity, calculated on a rolling 12-month basis was 14.9%, up 10.0 ppts from 30 June 2023.

AGL's gearing (measured as the ratio of net debt to net debt plus adjusted equity) at 30 June 2024 was 24.7% compared with 34.9% at  30 June 2023. AGL maintained its credit rating of Baa2 throughout the period as provided by Moody’s Investors Service.

AGL  generates electricity or has contracted gas supply in excess of its customers’ demand in some states. In other states, AGL has sources of  supply less than its customers’ demand. AGL uses certain financial instruments (derivatives) to manage these energy price risks and to manage its exposure to interest and foreign  exchange rates arising in the normal course of business, provided the overall AGL risk appetite is not exceeded. The majority of these  financial instruments exchange a fixed price for a floating market-based price of a given commodity, interest rate, currency or a quoted asset,  with the net differential being settled with the counterparty. AGL is exposed to price volatility on the sale and purchase of energy-related  commodities in the normal course of business, and therefore enters into contracts that minimise the price risk to AGL on both sold and  purchased forecast exposures. AGL has in place a governance framework that establishes the policy guidelines under which energy hedging activities are conducted. Key  components of that policy include segregation of duties, independent risk oversight, earnings-at-risk limits, compliance management and  regular reporting to the Board. The risk policy represents the Board and Senior Management's commitment to an effective risk management  function to ensure appropriate management and oversight of AGL’s risks related to wholesale markets energy risk. The policy allows for  commercial optimisation of the portfolio provided that AGL adheres to overall earnings-at-risk limits that reflect its risk appetite. Energy price risk AGL’s energy-related derivatives recognised in profit or loss include sell and buy positions, where AGL receives or pays a fixed price from or to  a counterparty in exchange for a floating price paid or received. AGL is required to make margin payments in respect of futures contracts traded through the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Initial  margin call payments are made at the time contracts are entered in order to manage intra-day credit exposure. The quantum of initial  margin depends on the volume traded, the expected market volatility as well as forward electricity prices at the time. The initial margin call  can move subsequently as forward prices move. AGL also receives or makes payments known as variation margin calls, which cover mark to  market movements of AGL’s open futures position. These typically reverse through future earnings as contract positions roll off. Treasury related risk AGL’s treasury related risk primarily relates to interest and foreign currency rate fluctuations. Contracts to minimise the exposure to  market-based fluctuations are executed pursuant to AGL’s treasury risk management policy. These contracts primarily result in fixed interest  rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts are designated in hedge relationships when they can be matched to forecast  transactions with sufficient probability of the forecast transaction occurring. In addition to the above, AGL is counterparty to cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements to convert its fixed interest rate US dollar  private placement borrowing instruments to floating interest rate Australian dollar equivalent borrowing instruments. The cross-currency  interest rate swap arrangements are designated as fair value and cash flow hedge relationships.

Fair value movements in any given period are  a function of changes to underlying indices, market prices or currencies and the roll-off of realised contractual volumes or amounts. A  reconciliation of the movements in financial instruments carried at fair value for FY24 is presented in the following table.

The net loss reflected a negative fair value movement in level 1 and 2 electricity derivatives primarily due to the positive cash flows trades expired during FY24. This decrease was partly offset by positive fair value movements in level 3 valuations due to the negative cash  flows expiring in periods up to June 2024 and a positive fair value movement in the oil position as a result of higher forward prices on a  net-buy position. • A decrease in fair value of $36 million of treasury derivative contracts was recognised due to the maturity of $8 million interest rate swaps,  and a $28 million fair value reduction mainly driven by the decrease in forward interest rate curves.

They also control the dispatch of  AGL’s owned and contracted generation assets, which includes grid-scale batteries, and associated portfolio of energy hedging products. • Trading and Origination - Electricity reflects the trading of key fuel inputs and hedging of AGL's wholesale electricity requirements, and  also includes Eco Markets, which reflects the management of AGL's liabilities relating to both voluntary and mandatory renewable and  energy efficiency. • Trading and Origination - Gas reflects the sourcing and management of AGL's gas supply, storage and transportation portfolio. Trading and  Origination - Gas is also responsible for the management of the price exposures related to AGL's oil-linked wholesale gas contracts. • Trading and Origination – Other reflects the Trading and Origination resourcing and support, in addition the Decentralised Energy  Resources business is responsible for the management of other growth initiatives in AGL’s orchestration pathway alongside  Customer Markets. The Operations and Other components of Integrated Energy comprises AGL’s power generation portfolio and other key sites and operating  facilities across the Coal, Gas Generation, Renewables and Storage, Natural Gas, and Other business units. • Coal primarily comprises AGL Macquarie (Bayswater and Liddell power stations) and AGL Loy Yang. Liddell Power Station ceased  generation on 28 April 2023 and the site is being rehabilitated and transitioned to an integrated energy hub. • Gas Generation primarily comprises Torrens Island Power Station, Barker Inlet Power Station, Kwinana Swift Power Station and  Somerton Power Station. As announced in November 2022, Torrens Island Power Station will close its three remaining units in operation  on 30 June 2026 and will be rehabilitated and transitioned into an integrated energy hub. • Renewables and Storage primarily comprises hydroelectric power stations, the operation of solar power as well as wind power generation,  and the Torrens Island Battery since it reached practical completion on 30 September 2023. Operational costs to maintain the wind farms  are reported within Trading and Origination – Electricity to align with the gross margin of the related power purchase agreements. • Natural Gas includes the Surat Gas Project which is held for sale, the Newcastle Gas Storage Facility, the Camden Gas Project which ceased  production in August 2023, and the Moranbah Gas Project until it was divested in August 2023. • Other primarily consists of the Energy Hubs business focused on the development and construction of greenfield growth opportunities  related to renewable and firming capacity as well as the development of the Integrated Energy Hubs at Torrens Island, Latrobe Valley and  the Hunter, and technical and business support functions. 5.2.1 Underlying EBIT Integrated Energy Underlying EBIT was $1,618 million, up $865 million or 114.9%, largely due to higher gross margin from Trading  and Origination – Electricity partly offset by an increase in Coal and Natural Gas operating costs, and an increase in depreciation and  amortisation. Trading and Origination – Gas margin was broadly in line with the prior year. FY24 $m FY23 $m Gross margin 2,967 2,046 Operating costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation) (790) (762) Underlying EBITDA 2,177 1,284 Depreciation and amortisation (559) (531) Underlying EBIT 1,618 753 Gross margin was $2,967 million, up $921 million due to higher margin in the Electricity portfolio, reflecting the recovery of higher market  costs through consumer prices, lower NEM volatility compared to the prior year, particularly July 2022 which had high pool prices on short  electricity positions, increased asset availability, including a full year of operation of Unit 2 at AGL Loy Yang, and realised benefits of portfolio  flexibility with the commencement of the Torrens Island Battery operations. This was partly offset by the loss of generation volumes due to  the closure of Liddell Power Station in April 2023, the impact of lower wholesale electricity prices on long positions mainly in Queensland,  and lower consumer demand volumes compared to the prior year. Operating costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation) were $(790) million, an increase of $28 million compared with the prior year due  to higher labour costs driven by Enterprise Agreement wage escalations, a one-off adjustment to increase the materials and spare part  inventory obsolescence provisions at AGL Loy Yang and Bayswater power stations, increased costs to maintain plant availability across the  thermal fleet, and expenditure at Surat Gas Project that would have otherwise been treated as capital following the asset being classified as held for sale. This was partly offset by the closures of Liddell Power Station and the Camden Gas Project, and the divestment of the  Moranbah Gas Project. For further details see Section 5.2.2.

The portfolio review for the Electricity (Section 6.2) and Gas (Section 6.3) businesses outlines the margin achieved for each of AGL’s portfolios  across operating segments, and demonstrates how value is generated within each business. The portfolio reviews in Section 6.2 and 6.3  start with volume information before summarising external customer revenue, customer network and other costs, fuel and gas costs net of  hedging, and costs of managing and maintaining owned and contracted generation assets, to arrive at a portfolio’s margin. A per unit rate  ($/MWh for electricity and $/GJ for gas) is derived from each category of revenue and cost using the relevant associated volumes. The tables in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 should be read in conjunction with Section 6.4 to reconcile the segmental revenue and costs allocated to  each portfolio with Group Underlying EBIT. 6.1 Portfolio Review Summary to Underlying Profit after Tax FY24 $m FY23 $m Electricity Portfolio Total revenue 8,282 7,119 Customer network, green compliance, and other cost of sales (3,649) (3,634) Fuel costs (726) (861) Generation running costs (754) (804) Depreciation and amortisation (526) (491) Net portfolio management (646) (372) Electricity Portfolio Margin (a) 1,981 957 Gas Portfolio Total revenue 2,506 2,737 Customer network and other cost of sales (635) (587) Gas purchases (762) (1,051) Haulage, storage and other (344) (326) Gas Portfolio Margin 765 773 Natural Gas (14) 3 Gas Portfolio Margin (including Natural Gas) (b) 751 776 Other AGL Other margin1 59 62 Customer Markets operating costs (651) (536) Integrated Energy other operating costs (107) (89) Centrally Managed Expenses operating costs (320) (286) Investments operating costs (26) (20) Other depreciation and amortisation (218) (231) Net finance costs (312) (258) Income tax expense (353) (100) Total Other AGL (c) (1,928) (1,458) Underlying Profit after Tax (a + b + c) 804 275 Non-controlling interests2 8 6 Underlying Profit after tax attributable to AGL shareholders 812 281 1.

AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 54  ===== PAGE 55 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2024 6.2 Electricity portfolio The Electricity portfolio review combines Integrated Energy’s Trading and Origination (Electricity), Operations (Coal, Gas Generation and  Renewables and Storage), with Customer Markets (Consumer and Large Business) businesses to outline the portfolio’s performance across  operating segments. All electricity volumes generated by AGL is sold into either the National Electricity Market (NEM) or Western Australian Wholesale Electricity  Market (collectively “the pool”) for which AGL receives pool generation revenue. Pool generation revenue is a function of volume and pool  prices, which are set by the real-time market in each state. In the NEM, the total volume demanded by AGL customers is then purchased  from the pool according to the geographical profile of customer demand and is reported as pool purchase volumes and costs. Where AGL’s  customer demand volumes exceed pool generation volumes, the generation volume deficit needs to be purchased from the pool by AGL.

In the statutory accounts the  amounts associated with these contracts are recognised within cost of sales. Total revenue was $8,282 million, up 16.3%. • Revenue from Consumer customers was $5,218 million, up 22.8% driven by higher revenue rates due to an increase in wholesale energy  prices and focused customer value management. • Large Business customer revenue was $1,729 million, up 2.4%, primarily due to an increase in wholesale electricity prices driving higher  revenue rates, partly offset by lower volumes. • Wholesale customer revenue was $1,217 million, up 12.9%, largely driven by higher revenue rates to wholesale customers and an increase  in green certificates sold compared to the prior year at similar prices. • Operations revenue was $118 million, up 12.4% primarily driven by higher external revenue from the sale of coal from AGL’s mine at  AGL Loy Yang to the Loy Yang B Power Station.

Renewables and Storage includes Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) costs. Total generation running costs were $(754) million, down 6.2%. • Coal operating costs were $(387) million, up 2.7%, driven by higher costs to maintain and improve plant availability, a one-off adjustment  to increase the materials and spare part inventory obsolescence provisions at AGL Loy Yang and Bayswater power stations, and increased  labour costs due to Enterprise Agreement wage escalations. This was partly offset by the reduction in costs following the closure of  Liddell Power Station in April 2023. • Gas operating costs were $(48) million, flat with the prior year. • Renewables and Storage costs were $(254) million, up 15.5%, driven by higher generation costs due to a decrease in onerous contract  releases compared to the prior year. These releases were lower due to higher assumed price outcomes that were fixed within the current  year. Operating costs also increased due to the Torrens Island Battery that commenced operations on 30 September 2023. • Other costs were $(65) million, down 59.1%, primarily driven by a reduction in market fees.

Net pool generation revenue and pool purchase costs were $(589) million, down $24 million, reflecting lower pool prices and lower  generation volumes following the closure of Liddell Power Station. This was largely offset by higher asset availability at AGL Loy Yang and  Bayswater generation units, in addition to lower customer demand.

AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 60  ===== PAGE 61 ===== Climate Related Disclosures For the year ended 30 June 2024 Climate Related Disclosures 7. AGL recognises that the impacts of, and the responses to, climate change at global, national, and state levels have significant implications for  our business. This presents both material risks and opportunities that can shape AGL's financial position, performance, and prospects. As an early adopter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework in Australia, AGL has made a commitment  to disclose climate-related information considering this framework, which is currently voluntary in Australia. We have incorporated climate- related risk and strategy disclosures in our annual corporate disclosures since 2016, and since 2018, these disclosures have been aligned  with the TCFD framework. As noted on page 2, our disclosures related to the TCFD framework are now included in this report rather than in a  stand-alone publication. We are closely monitoring evolving regulatory obligations and investor expectations regarding climate-related reporting and have considered  the evolving draft Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards (ASRS) to inform and enhance our disclosure practices this year. 7.1 Governance The AGL Board of Directors plays a pivotal role in overseeing climate-related matters. It actively considers climate-related risks and  opportunities when reviewing and setting the company's strategy and making investment decisions. In September 2022, the Board approved  AGL's Climate Transition Action Plan (refer to Section 7.2.1), which was subsequently endorsed by shareholders at the 2022 Annual General  Meeting, underscoring our commitment to addressing climate change and transitioning to a more sustainable future.  Two Board-level committees also provide oversight of particular aspects of climate-related risks and opportunities: the Audit & Risk  Management Committee (ARMC) and the Safety & Sustainability Committee (SSC).  The ARMC oversees the development of AGL's annual reporting aligned with the TCFD recommendations. Climate change response is a  Tier 1Strategic Risk (refer to Section 2.3). The SSC considers climate-related issues from a sustainability perspective, including considerations  for AGL stakeholders. More information about the role of the Board and its committees can be found on the AGL website, in the Governance  Summary in this report, and in the 2024 Corporate Governance Statement. AGL's CEO & Managing Director is responsible for implementing AGL's overall strategy, which includes our response to climate-related issues  through our dual focus on connecting our customers to a sustainable future and transitioning our energy portfolio. This involves translating  the strategic vision and goals into actionable plans and initiatives that effectively address the challenges and opportunities posed by  climate change. The CEO & Managing Director works closely with the Board to monitor the changing landscape of climate-related policies,  regulations, and market dynamics. This role is critical in ensuring that climate-related issues are integrated into the core business strategy, to  enable AGL to adapt and thrive in the rapidly changing energy sector. AGL recognises the importance of our Board having the climate-specific knowledge, skills, experience and background to effectively make  decisions relating to climate-related threats and opportunities. As an integrated energy generator and retailer, climate is inextricably linked to  the nature of our business, and the competencies required likewise intersect. AGL's commitment to robust governance practices related to  climate change is reflected in our governance framework.  AGL uses a skills matrix to identify the key skills and experience the AGL Board is seeking to achieve in its membership, which includes ‘ESG  and Climate Change risks and opportunities’. Director skills and experience are assessed on a regular basis. The competency of the Directors  with respect to these key skills and experience is outlined in the Governance Summary and in the 2024 Corporate Governance Statement. The Board is comprised of a number of Directors with specific energy and climate change experience. Directors undertake a program of  ongoing Director education to ensure that they are kept up to date on the risks and opportunities facing AGL’s business. During FY24,  Director education included a session on Climate Transition Action Plans. For further information, see our 2024 Corporate Governance Statement. 7.2 Strategy As outlined on page 10, AGL has two primary strategic objectives – connecting our customers to a sustainable future and transitioning our  energy portfolio. Released in September 2022, AGL’s Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP) outlines our commitments to work towards these  objectives. The following sections outline AGL’s CTAP commitments, progress made against these commitments, a summary of the scenario  analysis used to inform the development of our 2022 CTAP; scenario analysis undertaken during FY24 to improve our understanding of  physical risk, and how AGL aims to evolve our capital allocation over time to transition our portfolio to deliver on our strategy. As discussed in Section 2.1, Australia's energy sector is undergoing a period of significant change, as ageing thermal generation plant are  replaced by a range of renewable generation, energy storage and flexible generation technologies with lower emissions intensities to drive  the decarbonisation of Australia's energy sector. AGL strongly supports Australia’s commitment to the Paris Agreement to ensure the increase in global average temperature is held to well  below 2 degrees Celsius and importantly to pursue all efforts to limit temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Consistent with this, AGL  continues to support Australia setting ambitious economy wide emissions reduction targets consistent with delivering Australia’s share of  national contributions to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or as close as can be practically and economically delivered. Achieving emissions reductions consistent with a global 1.5 degrees Celsius ambition will require significant emissions reductions across all  sectors of the economy. To deliver this transition, a major market-wide infrastructure and asset replacement program is needed, requiring  substantial investment in grid-scale generation and storage, transmission, distributed energy, electrification and fuel switching. AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 61 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 62 ===== Climate Related Disclosures For the year ended 30 June 2024 Decarbonising the electricity system and energy sector will be central to decarbonising Australia’s economy and meeting government targets.  This will require rapidly increasing the share of renewable energy sources, and the uptake of electrification and consumer energy resources  to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. The energy transformation will need to be supported by significant investments in grid infrastructure,  renewable and firming technologies, and supportive policy and market settings to ensure reliability and security of supply. Most importantly,  achieving the necessary rate and scale of transition will need a coordinated approach among federal, state, and local governments, market  bodies, industry, and consumers.  7.2.1 AGL's Climate Transition Action Plan In September 2022, AGL released our inaugural Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP). AGL's CTAP included a commitment to bring forward  our exit from coal, targeting the closure of Loy Yang A Power Station by the end of FY35. AGL will be net zero for operated Scope 1 and 2  emissions following the closure of our coal-fired power stations. We are seeking to supply our customer demand with 12 GW of additional  renewable and firming capacity by the end of 2035 (with an interim target of 5 GW by 2030), and since the release of our CTAP, we have  committed to seeking options to accelerate where possible. Our CTAP recognises the importance of striking a balance between responsible transition and rapid decarbonisation to ensure the  security, reliability, and affordability of Australia's electricity supply. We are committed to working collaboratively with our stakeholders,  including government bodies, employees, and the communities where we operate to lead a responsible and orderly transition. We received  shareholder support for our CTAP through the ‘Say on Climate’ vote at our 2022 Annual General Meeting. As outlined in our CTAP, and in line  with emerging best practice, we propose to put our decarbonisation plans to shareholder vote every three years. We anticipate that we will  build on the ambitions of our 2022 CTAP in our next CTAP, scheduled for release with our FY25 results. A summary of the commitments made by AGL in our CTAP, and the progress achieved against those commitments to date, is outlined below.  We engaged Deloitte to undertake limited assurance of selected quantified targets in accordance with the Australian Standard on Assurance  Engagements ASAE 3000 Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and ASAE 3410 Assurance  Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements issued by the Australian Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. Full details of the assurance  scope, process and outcome are included in the assurance statement on page 200. Key Complete In Progress Ongoing - met in FY23 Commitment Progress as at 30 June 2024 Assurance Scope 1 and 2 emissions Liddell Power Station will be closed by April 2023.

Yes1 Achieve a reduction of at least 17% in annual2 Scope 1 and  2 emissions against a FY19 baseline3 by FY244 following the  closure of the Liddell Power Station. AGL's operational Scope 1 and 2 emissions  reduced by 23.3% in FY24 compared to a FY19  baseline, primarily driven by the closure of Liddell  in FY23. AGL's flexible operations program is  also enabling emissions reductions. Refer to the  Environment scorecard and Assets scorecard for  more information. Yes Bayswater Power Station will be closed between 2030-2033 -  no later than 2033 (FY34). Achieve a reduction of at least 52% in annual Scope 1 and  2 emissions against a FY19 baseline3 by FY354 following the  closure of the Bayswater Power Station. Loy Yang A Power Station is targeted to close by the end  of FY35. Achieve net zero emissions following the closure of AGL's  coal-fired power stations (Liddell, Bayswater, and Loy Yang A  power stations). AGL's asset management plans have been  structured to support availability and reliability until  the planned closure of the Bayswater and Loy Yang  A power stations, in the timeframes targeted in  the CTAP. AGL has informed AEMO of our updated closure  dates as per the requirements of NER 2.2.1(e)(2A). N/A AGL will develop appropriate strategies for the use  and/or origination of high-quality offsets, guided by the  development of carbon markets over the coming years. AGL has developed a company-wide Carbon Offsets Offsets Policy. N/A AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 62  ===== PAGE 63 ===== Climate Related Disclosures For the year ended 30 June 2024 Commitment Progress as at 30 June 2024 Assurance Scope 3 emissions AGL has the ambition of being net zero for Scope  3 emissions by 2050 and is currently working on a  decarbonisation pathway for these emissions. AGL is developing a decarbonisation pathway to  meet our ambition of net zero Scope 3 emissions  by 2050. Further details will be published in the  2025 CTAP which will be published with AGL's  FY25 results. N/A Responsible and orderly transition Our Sites: AGL is committed to re-purposing its large  thermal generation sites into low-carbon energy hubs. Our  industrial energy hubs at Loy Yang, Torrens Island and in the  Hunter will bring together renewable energy production and  storage with energy-intensive industries, centred around a  shared infrastructure backbone. Progress made to develop our integrated energy  hubs is outlined in the Assets scorecard. N/A Our Communities: We recognise our responsibility reaches  beyond the safe operation of our assets and supply  of energy, and includes supporting the communities in  which we operate before assets close, and managing the  responsible best practice rehabilitation of our sites. AGL's engagements with local communities, local  businesses and government, and connections  with Traditional Owners, are outlined in the  Relationships scorecard. N/A Our People: The energy transition is an industry-wide  transformation that will involve significant changes to the  way AGL operates. As we manage this transition, the labour  and skills required to operate our generation assets will  change over time. Our future workforce is likely to be  smaller; employees will be located across a distributed  network of sites, operating a diverse portfolio of energy and  related assets and technology. Actions undertaken in FY24 in relation to supporting  the transition of our workforce are outlined in the  People scorecard. N/A Portfolio reshape and capital allocation alignment AGL intends to transition our portfolio to support a lower  carbon world and will seek to supply our customers' energy  demand by building and accessing 12 GW of new renewable  generation and firming capacity before 2036, with an interim  target of 5 GW by 2030. AGL has 978 MW of new renewable and firming capacity contracted or in delivery from FY23, as  discussed in the Assets scorecard. Yes AGL has a development pipeline of 6.2 GW5 of  renewable and firming assets, as discussed in the  Assets scorecard. Capital allocation is discussed in  Section 7.2.3. N/A Green revenue In accordance with our FY23 long-term incentive (LTI)  plan, we aim to increase the percentage of total revenue  derived from green energy and carbon neutral products and  services in FY266 to at least 22.2%, with a stretch goal of  achieving 27.0%. The percentage of AGL's total revenue derived  from green energy and carbon neutral products  and services in FY24 was 19.3%. Refer to the  Remuneration Report for further details.

AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 64  ===== PAGE 65 ===== Climate Related Disclosures For the year ended 30 June 2024 7.2.2 Scenario analysis AGL undertakes climate-related scenario analysis on a periodic basis to inform decisions regarding our operations, investments and strategic  direction. Climate scenario modelling helps AGL assess the resilience of our strategy and operations across a range of potential future  pathways, anticipate risks and opportunities, and align our actions with the evolving energy landscape. AGL undertook climate scenario  modelling of transitional climate-related effects on the National Electricity Market (NEM) in 2022 to inform the development of the CTAP, and  more recently undertook modelling of hazards arising under different climate-related scenarios to increase our understanding of the physical  risks to our operational portfolio. Scenario analysis of climate-related transitional effects on the electricity market In 2022 we used climate-related scenario analysis of the electricity market to inform the development of our CTAP. The scenarios modelled  a broad range of outcomes in terms of climate and energy transition pathways. The targeted closure dates for AGL’s thermal coal assets  outlined in our CTAP were consistent with a modelled decarbonisation scenario where the NEM achieved a well below two degrees outcome,  and with the climate ambition of the 'Step Change' scenario within AEMO's 2022 Integrated System Plan1. Our CTAP recognises that to  achieve a net zero energy system in an orderly and efficient way, individual generators and asset owners will decarbonise at different rates  as the NEM efficiently decarbonises as a whole. Dynamic market settings in the NEM may result in less reliable and higher-cost assets exiting  the market first, while more reliable, lower-emissions, and lower-cost assets will remain in the system to support reliability and affordability objectives as the system rapidly decarbonises in the most efficient way. Since the 2022 scenario modelling was undertaken, there have been several key developments affecting the outlook for Australia’s energy  market and economy. Notably, as discussed in Section 2.1, the Australian Government has introduced the Capacity Investment Scheme  which seeks to support state commitments and achieve the government’s targets of 82% renewables by 2030 and economy-wide emissions  reduction of 43% on 2005 levels by 2030. The federal and state governments have also announced new climate and energy policies to  support a faster uptake of renewables and transmission infrastructure, and to support the development of emerging technologies such  as energy storage, hydrogen, offshore wind, electric vehicles, and consumer energy resources. At the same time, state governments have  entered into agreements with the operators of some thermal assets to provide certainty around closure dates, and have put forward  regulatory mechanisms to extend the life of thermal generation assets, if required, to maintain system reliability and security. As the market continues to evolve, we  plan to publish updated climate-related energy market scenario analysis within our next CTAP,  scheduled for release with our FY25 Results. The scenarios modelled in 2022 and the key outcomes of each are summarised below.2 Modelled scenario (2022) Scenario outcomes Scenario I Challenging economic environment, lack  of coordinated decarbonisation policy and  slow renewables infrastructure build-out  slows the decarbonisation of the NEM.  Emissions reduction and energy policies are  not delivered due to, for example, energy  affordability concerns, lags in renewable  project development and connection delays. Limited growth in system demand results in relatively stable annual generation levels  and generation capacity in the NEM to 2050. Coal-fired generators run at relatively low  load factors as a result of low system demand. Annual emissions and emissions intensity  of NEM generation decline over time as coal-fired generation exits the system, and is  replaced by renewable generation technology, driven by economics. The scenario shows  approximately 70 GW of renewable and storage capacity added to the grid between FY24  and FY50. Scenario II Emissions reduction goals are progressively  ratcheted up over time in pursuit of an  economy wide 26-28% emissions reduction  target by 2030 (against 2005 levels) and  economy-wide net zero emissions by 2050. Significant growth in system demand owing to strong electrification drives increasing  generation levels and significant growth in installed capacity in the NEM. The scenario  shows approximately 225 GW of renewable and storage capacity added to the grid  between FY24 and FY50, while economics drives the progressive exit of ageing coal-fired generation capacity. Annual emissions and emissions intensity of NEM generation decline  over time as renewable generation grows and coal-fired generation exits the system. 1. Based on scenario modelling of the NEM undertaken by ACIL Allen utilising a carbon budget for the NEM which is consistent with limiting global temperature increases to well below  two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. 2. The full details of AGL's methodology, assumptions and limitations of the scenarios are available in our 2022 CTAP. AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 65 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 66 ===== Climate Related Disclosures For the year ended 30 June 2024 Modelled scenario (2022) Scenario outcomes Scenario III (Well below 2 degrees) Rapid consumer-led transformation of  the energy sector and coordinated  economy-wide action, fuelled by a step  change in policy commitments and  deployment and coordination of enabling  technologies, delivering a Paris-aligned  decarbonisation pathway Meeting a Paris well below 2°C aligned carbon constraint results in coal-fired generation  exiting the system in advance of economic closure dates and operating at relatively lower  load profiles compared to Scenario II, while the increasing electrification macro trend  drives increasing system demand. This results in approximately 250 GW of renewable and  storage capacity being added to the grid over the FY24-FY50 period. Annual emissions  levels and emissions intensity of NEM generation declines more rapidly than under  Scenarios I and II, owing to earlier coal exits and strong growth in renewable generation,  and the NEM reaches net zero emissions in the early 2040s. Scenario IV (1.5 degree goal) Accelerated policy action and significant technological breakthroughs driving a rapid  transformation of the economy, delivering a  1.5°C-aligned pathway. Meeting a Paris-1.5°C aligned carbon constraint results in an accelerated exit of coal-fired generation from the system, with all coal closed by the early 2030s, while the increasing  electrification macro trend and longer-term shift to hydrogen generation technology drives  a strongly increased long-term system demand outlook. This results in approximately  295 GW of additional renewable and storage capacity being required by the grid over  the FY24-FY50 period. Annual emissions levels and emissions intensity of NEM generation  decline more rapidly than under Scenarios I - III, owing to accelerated coal exits and strong  growth in renewable generation, with the NEM reaching net zero emissions by 2040. Scenario analysis of climate-related physical risk on AGL's portfolio AGL has also undertaken climate-related physical risk analysis to assess potential risks facing our assets under different warming scenarios.  The modelling was conducted across each of our operational sites, our integrated energy hubs, assets with which we have Power Purchasing  Agreements and for selected future assets within our development pipeline. Our disclosures in this document do not cover all future assets  or assets AGL is seeking to close or divest in the short-term. Refer to Section 7.3.2 for details of the outcomes of this analysis. AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 66  ===== PAGE 67 ===== Climate Related Disclosures For the year ended 30 June 2024 7.2.3 Capital allocation to support the energy transition As part of our current and long term strategy, AGL has the aspiration to significantly grow our pipeline of climate solutions.1 In FY24, AGL’s  allocation of capital toward climate solutions included $274 million of capital expenditure on a mixture of grid-scale batteries, investment in  hydro assets and Energy as a Service projects, equivalent to approximately 32% of total capital expenditure for FY24. We recognise that our commitment to decarbonising our portfolio will require a significant capital investment across both firming and  renewable2 technologies throughout the next decade. Further, we acknowledge that ongoing uncertainty of the future state of the Australian  energy market will require AGL to refine how we allocate capital3 year-on-year. The chart4 below shows the anticipated evolution of AGL's capital allocation3 towards meeting our plans to add 12 GW of renewable  generation and firming capacity before the end of 2035. This reflects the total required investment to be funded through a combination of  balance sheet, offtakes and partnerships.5 6The FY25-28 period reflects AGL’s estimated spend across the next 4-year period and the current  pipeline of identified growth opportunities that AGL is actively pursuing. AGL's capital allocation to thermal7 assets is focused on ensuring the  ongoing safe and efficient operations of Loy Yang A and Bayswater power stations until closure, and is indicative of the role that thermal  generation is expected to play in providing reliable and affordable electricity to support the energy transition.     Our disciplined capital allocation decisions reflect AGL's commitment to transition our portfolio responsibly and effectively to renewable and  firming capacity, in line with our capital allocation framework. Thermal Firming Renewables Retail FY25-36 aspirational FY25-28 plan + identified opportunities FY25-28 plan Capital allocation evolution The table below outlines the anticipated evolution of AGL's capital allocation in the short, medium and longer term in terms of the proportion  of capital expected to be allocated to climate solutions.

AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 67 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 68 ===== Climate Related Disclosures For the year ended 30 June 2024 7.3 Climate-related risks and opportunities AGL manages climate-related risks in line with our enterprise-wide risk management framework. Through this framework, AGL identifies key  risks that could impact the achievement of our strategic priorities (Tier 1 Strategic Risks). As shown in Section 2.3.1, ‘climate change response’  was identified as a Tier 1 Strategic Risk. Climate-related impacts are also associated with many of our other Tier 1 Strategic Risks, due to the  interconnected nature of climate change with the energy sector. At a more granular level, AGL’s climate-related risks can be categorised into two main areas: transition risks and physical risks. As shown  below, the TCFD framework breaks transition risk into four subcategories and physical risk into two subcategories. Transition Risks Physical Risks Policy and Legal Technology Market Reputation Acute Chronic Risks arising  from policy or  legal interventions  that attempt to  constrain actions that  contribute to the  adverse effects of  climate change or  actions that seek to  promote adaptation  to climate change. Risks arising from  the technological  changes which are  occurring to support  the transition to  a low carbon  economy and the  disruption they can  cause to markets  and businesses Risks associated  with changing  supply and  demand for  commodities and  other products  and services. Risks arising from  changing customer  and community  perceptions of  organisations due  to their action on  climate change, with  impacts to reputation  leading to reduced  customer trust and  participation with  a business. These risks  refer to those  that are event- driven, including  increased severity  of extreme  weather events,  such as cyclones,  hurricanes,  droughts  or floods. These risks refer  to longer-term shifts  in climate patterns  (e.g., sustained  higher temperatures)  that may cause sea  level rise or chronic  heat waves. AGL uses our enterprise-level strategic planning processes to identify, assess and manage climate-related opportunities on an iterative basis.  Through this process we identified climate-related opportunity areas, which include resource efficiency, low emission alternative energy  sources, product and service innovation, new markets and asset types, and building climate resilience capacity. The following sections include a summary of the climate-related physical and transition risks that AGL considers could reasonably affect our  business' prospects, and the time horizons in which these risks could be expected to materialise, as well as an outline of key climate-related  opportunities for AGL. 7.3.1 Transition risks The potential challenges and uncertainties that arise from the shift towards a low-carbon economy and the transition away from carbon- intensive industries and practices are known as climate-related transition risks. These risks emerge as a result of various factors, including  policy changes, technological advancements, market dynamics, and evolving societal expectations. Key climate-related transition risks for AGL  are summarised below: Key Short term (1-4 years) Medium term (5-10 years) Long term (10+ years) Climate-related risk causes Mitigation approach Policy or regulatory intervention AGL is impacted by policy and/or regulatory intervention or other restrictions that seek to address greenhouse gas emissions or climate  change adaptation. • Government policies and/or other interventions  designed to limit the impacts of climate change  or manage the impacts of Australia's transitioning  energy system may have a material impact on  AGL’s operations or strategy, or be implemented  in a disorderly or unplanned manner which may  increase uncertainty for AGL’s strategic direction  and in the allocation of resources. • Increased resourcing may be required to  anticipate, understand and comply with new  regulatory requirements. Any new regulations  that place further restrictions or limitations on  greenhouse gas emissions are likely to increase the  cost of operating thermal plants. • AGL has committed to a portfolio transformation including 12 GW  of new renewable and firming capacity by the end of 2035 (and  seek options to accelerate where possible) and the closure of our  coal-fired power stations. • AGL actively engages with government and regulatory bodies to  advocate for balanced policy outcomes that consider the interests of  our stakeholders, and support AGL and the broader NEM to provide  reliable and affordable energy during Australia’s energy transition. • AGL contributes to the ongoing development of relevant government  policy, including through participation in public forums and the  submission of formal responses to government policy consultation.  Through this process, AGL seeks to understand and inform current  and anticipated regulatory changes, to ensure that AGL is able to  respond to changing regulatory requirements quickly and effectively. AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 68  ===== PAGE 69 ===== Climate Related Disclosures For the year ended 30 June 2024 Climate-related risk causes Mitigation approach Access to capital AGL's access to capital markets, including debt, equity investors and insurance, may become further constrained where our energy transition timing  does not meet the expectations of these markets. • ESG challenges and capital market perception  of carbon risk will remain an ongoing challenge  for AGL, as debt and equity markets continue  to increase their focus on climate impacts,  particularly limiting lending and investing in fossil  fuel companies. • AGL has committed to a portfolio transformation including 12 GW  of new renewable and firming capacity by the end of 2035 (and  seek options to accelerate where possible) and the closure of our  coal-fired power stations. • AGL has in place a Green Finance Framework, which sets out the  process by which AGL intends to issue and manage Green Debt  on an ongoing basis to fund expenditure on firming capacity and  renewable energy. • AGL engages with capital market stakeholders regarding our strategic  direction and to understand their expectations. • AGL engages with other key stakeholders, including the community,  on relevant development opportunities to understand expectations  and key risks, and to develop our social license to deliver on  these projects. • Across FY24, AGL materially increased its debt tenor, improved its  liquidity position and maintained a Baa2 “stable” investment grade  Moody’s rating. Changing customer needs and expectations AGL may not effectively harness new technologies, products or services that support changing customer decarbonisation and electrification needs  and expectations. Additionally, the increasing uptake of rooftop solar and electrification of vehicles and other services is resulting in changing  demand and load profiles across the Australian electricity market. • As low-carbon, renewable, electrification and  behind-the-meter technologies alter electricity  supply to the NEM and change the profile of  Australia’s electricity supply, some energy assets  and investments may no longer provide a viable  economic return and could therefore see their  economic life curtailed. • AGL may fail to identify and/or appropriately invest  in new technologies that support the transition and  are aligned to its business objectives, impacting on  financial performance. • As we seek to help our customers decarbonise the way they  live, move and work. AGL is actively monitoring new technologies,  new products and business models with a view to meeting future  customer demand and evolving customer expectations. These  include opportunities in electrification services such as electric  vehicles and charging, hot water, heating and cooling, Distributed  Energy Resources (DER) like rooftop solar and residential battery  storage systems, and asset monitoring and management. • AGL has also entered into an agreement with Kaluza to transform  our customer operations in order to support our customers' needs  including supporting how they decarbonise and electrify. • In FY24 AGL launched its Electrify Now platform across the National  Electricity Market, helping households to understand the potential  benefits of electrifying their homes by providing personalised  information for the most impactful upgrades. • AGL continues to invest in and focus on the safety, reliability and  flexibility of our existing power stations, to support plant capability  and efficiency that will allow us to capture value from the changing  energy market. Stakeholder perception Stakeholder trust in AGL is negatively impacted by changing community perceptions and expectations of our contribution to the energy transition. • AGL's success is dependent on the ongoing  support of our key stakeholders, including  our people, customers, shareholders and the  communities where we operate. Where AGL is  unable to meet current expectations or anticipate  and/or respond to changing expectations, our  ability to achieve our objectives could be  significantly challenged. • AGL is committed to engaging with stakeholders in a transparent  manner regarding climate change. Our CTAP aims to find a balance  between meeting Australia's current and future energy requirements  while responsibly reducing carbon emissions. The plan includes  specific targets towards achieving net zero emissions, facilitating  a responsible transition for Australia's energy market. AGL has  committed to putting our CTAP to a non-binding shareholder vote  every three years. AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 69 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 70 ===== Climate Related Disclosures For the year ended 30 June 2024 7.3.2 Physical risks Physical risks associated with climate change have the potential to significantly impact AGL’s business. These risks can be categorised into  two main types of hazard: acute and chronic. Both acute and chronic physical hazards pose significant risks to businesses, communities, and the overall economy. They can result in direct  damages, operational disruptions, increased costs for repair and maintenance, decreased productivity, and loss of assets and infrastructure.  Additionally, these hazards can have cascading effects, impacting supply chains, insurance costs, investor confidence, and the overall stability  of financial markets. Physical climate hazards can additionally have both primary and secondary effects. The primary effects are the direct impacts on assets such  as power stations, critical infrastructure, and corporate facilities. The secondary effects are impacts on supply chains, distribution networks,  customers, and markets. Key climate-related physical risks for AGL are summarised below: Key Short term (1-4 years) Medium term (5-10 years) Long term (10+ years) Climate-related Risk Cause Mitigation Approach Acute hazards Acute, event-driven hazards resulting primarily from the increasing severity of extreme weather events. • Increasing frequency and severity of extreme heat,  fire, and storm events impacting the operation of  AGL's thermal coal fleet. • Extreme heat, fire and wind events impacting the  operation of AGL’s wind and solar assets. • Extreme heat leading to spikes in demand for  electricity and potential electricity shortfalls. • Major flooding events causing disruption to AGL  generation capabilities. • To mitigate the impacts of acute weather and natural hazards risks,  AGL has Emergency Management and Response Plans in place  across our portfolio. These include bushfire management plans, and  procedures for extreme weather and flood management. • The flexibility of AGL’s generation fleet allows us to efficiently respond  to changing generation and load profiles when acute hazards impact  generation assets across the NEM.  • As acute natural hazards are usually localised to a specific region, the  geographic diversity of AGL’s generation portfolio helps to minimise the  risk of major impacts across the fleet. Chronic shift in climate patterns Chronic, long-term shifts in climate patterns leading to ongoing changes to environmental hazards. • Extended drought periods compromising water  security at thermal and hydro assets, impacting  asset availability. • Ongoing increases in average temperatures leading  to higher energy demand from customers. • AGL actively monitors access to water and water availability for our  assets to mitigate drought risks and ensure availability of our assets. In  addition, AGL maintains water licences or entitlements for each asset.  • AGL continues to invest in critical spares and equipment to support  the ongoing reliability of our generation assets.  Secondary effects of hazards Chronic and acute physical hazards that impact AGL due to their secondary effects. • Extreme weather and fire events affecting the  vulnerability of transmission and distribution  networks, limiting AGL's ability to supply and source  electricity from the market. • As these secondary effects are inherently risks on assets that are  outside of AGL’s control, our ability to directly mitigate them is limited.  • However, AGL actively engages with government and regulatory bodies  to advocate for balanced policy outcomes within the NEM to provide  reliable and affordable energy during Australia’s energy transition,  particularly related to transmission access and project approvals.  Another mitigation strategy that applies across all risks set out above is the implementation of the commitments made in our CTAP. This will  limit greenhouse gas emissions while diversifying AGL's portfolio of assets and allow us to continue to meet the needs of our customers. AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 70  ===== PAGE 71 ===== Climate Related Disclosures For the year ended 30 June 2024 AGL's scenario analysis of climate-related physical hazards In FY24, AGL engaged Aon, an external risk specialist, to undertake climate-related physical hazard modelling to assess potential hazards  facing our assets under different warming scenarios. The modelling was conducted across each of our operational sites, our integrated  energy hubs, assets with which we have Power Purchasing Agreements and for selected future assets within our development pipeline. AGL  has limited the disclosure of the analysis as set out below to our operational electricity generation assets and integrated energy hubs as it  best represents our material assets and potential material risks. Three scenarios aligned to three different temperature outcomes1 were modelled, with each scenario considering both acute and chronic  hazards, as summarised below. Physical risk type Hazard type Modelling approach Scenarios modelled for  each hazard1,2 Acute hazards Bushfire Flood  Cyclone  Hail  Storm The current exposure to acute hazards was analysed  using a proprietary model, containing seven billion data  cells and over 200 risk variables. For assessing future exposure to acute hazards, the  model was extended by integrating climate science from  the CSIRO, Bureau of Meteorology, and the Climate  Measurement Standards Initiative. This model forecasts  changes in hazard exposure at an asset level for various  emissions pathways over intervals to 2090. Scenario A - The expected  change in climate under a  ~1.8-degree scenario aligned  with RCP2.6 / SSP1-2.6. Scenario B - The expected  change in climate under a  ~2.7-degree scenario aligned  with RCP4.5 / SSP2-4.5. Scenario C - The expected  change in climate under a  ~4.4-degree scenario aligned  with RCP8.5 / SSP5-8.5. Chronic hazards Drought  Extreme heat  Extreme rainfall The analysis of current and future exposure  to chronic physical hazards utilised a proprietary  model incorporating data from the Coupled Model  Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), which informed  the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report. This model provides  climate projections at 10-year intervals relative to the  historical baseline period (1995-2014) extending to 2100. 1. Relative Concentration Pathways (RCP), are concentration pathways for greenhouse gases and aerosols, demonstrating possible future emissions and radiative forces (i.e. Temperature  intensity) scenarios for the world until 2100, as defined by the IPCC). 2. Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP), describe how socioeconomic trends around the world may evolve over time, as defined by the IPCC (2017). For modelling acute hazards, the analysis considered the declared value of each AGL asset to estimate the Average Annual Loss (AAL)  loading for each hazard. When assessing future acute hazards, the model estimated the proportion of the declared value at risk over various  scenarios, evaluating these risks at intervals up to the year 2090. This financial assessment focused on the direct effects of potential climate hazards on each asset, without considering impacts to the income  generated by the asset or the broader impacts of the hazard on supporting infrastructure and markets. For chronic hazards, the model employs a percentile-based scoring system that ranges from 1 to 100. This scoring indicates the relative  hazard level of each asset's location compared to global locations. For instance, a score of 70 signifies that the hazard level for that specific location is higher than 70% of all locations worldwide. This analysis has enabled AGL to more accurately assess current physical hazards facing our assets and anticipate areas where exposure to  hazards may increase under different climate scenarios in the future. It is important to note that this analysis is centred on changes in exposure to physical hazards based on the asset's location. It does not  consider the type of asset, its vulnerability to the hazards, or any mitigation actions that might be implemented. As such, the impact of the  hazard has not been assessed. Additionally, the scenarios modelled are not predictions or forecasts but indicators of potential outcomes. The primary finding from this analysis is an expected correlation between rising temperatures over time and increasing exposure of our  assets to physical hazards. 1. Temperature outcomes are as outlined in the most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): Assessment Report 6 (AR6) AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 71 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 72 ===== Climate Related Disclosures For the year ended 30 June 2024 Acute physical hazards The modelling assessed the exposure of AGL’s assets to current acute physical hazards expressed as an AAL loading. Further, the modelling  of exposure to future acute physical hazards considers the value at risk of each asset for each hazard under each scenario. The change in value at risk has been mapped in the table below by asset type. However, as the asset type groupings include geographically  dispersed assets, the changes shown are indicative only and represent the totality of change for each group. Increasing exposure as shown  in the table indicates a higher likelihood of an asset or asset group being affected by a hazard but may not lead to a higher risk. Key1 Large increase  in exposure Moderate increase  in exposure Stable or small  increase in exposure N/A Negligible or no exposure  to this hazard type 1. For the purposes of representing AGL's acute physical hazard exposure under the modelled scenarios, the following boundaries have been applied: Stable or small increase in exposure  is indicative of a 0-4% upwards change in exposure; moderate increase in exposure is indicative of a 5-9% upward change in exposure; and large increase in exposure is indicative of a  >=10% upwards change in exposure.

This assessment underlines that AGL's current risk from acute physical hazards is limited and manageable. Under the future acute scenarios, the largest increase in value at risk across all hazards is projected for floods, with a 23% increase in  exposure by 2090 under Scenario C. Hydro generation assets are most exposed to this hazard. However, this increased exposure does not  necessarily correlate with a higher level of risk for these assets. The analysis also shows that under Scenario C, exposure to bushfire hazards is expected to increase by a similar margin of 22.8% by 2090.  Storm exposure across the portfolio under Scenario C has a lower increase, and is primarily concentrated in a single location. These specific increases represent significant projections for the end of the century, by which time it is anticipated that several of AGL’s  assets will be retired. AGL continues to monitor proposed locations for new assets to minimise exposure and risk in this context. Further,  maintaining a geographically diverse fleet helps mitigate the likelihood of acute physical hazards affecting multiple assets simultaneously,  thus reducing overall business risk. 1. The percentage of asset exposure is calculated based on the percentage of the total declared value of the assets identified as being exposed. AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 73 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 74 ===== Climate Related Disclosures For the year ended 30 June 2024 Chronic physical hazards To assess AGL’s exposure to chronic physical hazards, each asset was evaluated based on historical data. From this, a baseline exposure  scenario for each hazard was determined, and this exposure was evaluated as the relative hazard level. This relative hazard level has also  been calculated under each future scenario, and the change in this level is mapped in the table below. As the asset groupings in the table include geographically dispersed assets, the changes mapped are to be read as indicative only and  represent the totality of change for each group. Increasing exposure in the table indicates a higher likelihood of an asset or asset group being  affected by a hazard, but may not lead to a higher risk. Key1 Large increase  in exposure Moderate increase  in exposure Stable or small  increase in exposure N/A Negligible or no exposure  to this hazard type 1. For the purposes of representing AGL's chronic physical hazard exposure under the modelled scenarios, the following boundaries have been applied: Stable or small increase in  exposure is indicative of a 0-9% upwards change in exposure; moderate increase in exposure is indicative of a 10-29% upward change in exposure; and large increase in exposure is  indicative of a >=30% upwards change in exposure.

The potential hazard of freeze was also assessed, and it was found that AGL’s assets have no exposure to this hazard. AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 74  ===== PAGE 75 ===== Climate Related Disclosures For the year ended 30 June 2024 Based on the modelled outputs of AGL’s chronic hazard exposure, AGL is most exposed to projected changes in extreme heat and drought  under all three scenarios. Notably, AGL’s current exposure to extreme heat1 is already elevated. This is known to de-rate and impact  performance of most generation technologies. The analysis suggests that under Scenario C, AGL’s portfolio could experience an increase in  the annual average number of days with extreme heat from 10 to 50 by the end of the century. Drought exposure is based on consecutive months for which the mean precipitation is below the historical 15th percentile for the location  modelled.2 The modelling indicates that under Scenario A, AGL's exposure peaks around 2045 at approximately 1.9 consecutive months  of drought (up from 1.5 months), then decreases slightly towards the end of the century. In contrast, under Scenario C, exposure steadily  increases to approximately 2.6 months. Exposure to extreme rainfall across AGL’s portfolio shows only a low to moderate increase through the end of the century. Further controls and mitigation AGL’s management of climate-related physical risks is grounded in our commitment to being net zero for operated Scope 1 and 2 emissions  following the closure of our coal-fired power stations. This commitment along with others outlined in our 2022 CTAP and subsequent  disclosures, are intended to progress and support action on climate change to limit warming outcomes. Through these measures AGL aims to contribute to the mitigation of climate-related physical hazards and the avoidance of a high-warming  outcome as modelled in Scenario C. More specifically, AGL’s physical hazards are controlled and managed through AGL’s risk management  process as outlined in Section 2.3. AGL’s asset portfolio is resilient to direct physical risks in part through its geographic distribution, which acts to dilute the impact of location- specific acute impacts. The generation fleet is also technologically diverse, which provides increased resilience to the impact of temperature  increases on generation efficiency. In addition, water rights and supply security allow for certainty even in extensive drought conditions. As outlined, the key direct risks faced by AGL's fleet are consistent across most assets and locations and include increasing frequency of  extreme heat and fire events, as well as water security. AGL currently has comprehensive mitigation strategies in place in relation to bushfires and water security, as detailed in our FY23 TCFD Report which is available on our website. 7.3.3 Opportunities Climate-related opportunities may arise from addressing climate challenges, adopting new business models, developing new products and  services, and capitalising on new or emerging technology, as well as through leadership, differentiation and reputation enhancements which  may drive customer growth and employee attraction and retention. AGL's strategy recognises the significant opportunities arising from the decarbonisation of Australia's energy sector, and as set out on page  11, we have set ambitious targets to add new renewable and firming capacity to our energy portfolio, grow behind the meter customer  assets and expand our portfolio of decentralised assets under orchestration, and drive growth in green revenue. We are also advancing  our plans to repurpose our thermal generation sites into integrated energy hubs, connecting industrial partners into a circular economy at  the sites. Key climate-related opportunities for AGL are summarised below: Climate-related opportunity Strategy to realise opportunity Helping our customers decarbonise Customer demand for renewable and clean energy is  driving a transition towards a more decentralised energy  system and electrified economy. This shift presents  opportunities for companies like AGL to expand into new  and expanding markets. AGL also sees opportunities to utilise decentralised  orchestration to help alleviate peak demand events and  capture new and growing value pools particularly. The  increasing demand for these products and services  presents a significant opportunity for AGL to continue to  grow our customer offerings. We are committed to helping our customers to electrify and decarbonise. We have set a strategic target of having 1.6 GW of decentralised assets  under orchestration by FY27. Progress against this target is outlined in our  Strategy scorecard on page 11.  We offer customer load flexibility services and are expanding our home  electrification and decarbonisation solution portfolios. We also offer a  suite of certified carbon neutral products. For our commercial and  industrial (C&I) customers, we are progressing on scaling our Energy as  a Service solutions; we continue to be the largest solar provider in the  country; we are increasing our contracted C&I PPAs as well as commercial  assets under monitoring and management. For further details see the  Customer scorecard. 1. Extreme heat is defined as the daily maximum temperature exceeding 35 degrees Celsius under Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), which was used to inform  the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report. 2.

AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 75 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 76 ===== Climate Related Disclosures For the year ended 30 June 2024 Climate-related opportunity Strategy to realise opportunity Grid-scale renewable energy The transition away from high-emissions thermal power  generation presents opportunities for investment and  development of renewable energy projects. This includes  solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and other forms of clean  energy generation. AGL has an ambition to add 12 GW of new renewable and firming capacity  by the end of 2035 with an interim target of 5 GW by 2030, and we will  seek options to accelerate where possible. AGL has the ambition to add  approximately 3.1 GW of renewable capacity by 2030. AGL expects the  majority of renewable capacity to be accessed via PPAs. We have set a  strategic target of having 2.1 GW of new renewable and firming capacity  development contracted or in delivery from FY24 by FY27. Progress against this target is outlined in the Strategy scorecard on page  11 . Grid-scale energy storage and long-duration firming With the integration of intermittent renewable energy  sources into the electricity grid alongside the retirements  on thermal baseload power, there is a growing need for  effective energy storage solutions. Energy storage technologies, such as batteries, pumped  hydro, and thermal storage, play a crucial role in grid  stability and system strength as well as storing excess  energy during periods of high generation and releasing it  when demand is high, or generation is low. Gas peaking  generation also has a role to play in supporting system  reliability through the transition. AGL has an ambition to add 12 GW of new renewable and firming capacity  by the end of 2035 with an interim target of 5 GW by 2030, and we will  seek options to accelerate where possible. AGL has the ambition to add  approximately 2.3 GW of firming capacity by 2030. AGL expects the majority  of firming capacity to be funded on balance sheet. We have set a strategic target of 1.5 GW grid-scale batteries operated,  contracted or in delivery by end of FY27. Progress against this target is  outlined in the Strategy scorecard on page 11 , and in the Assets scorecard. Repurposed infrastructure AGL is committed to transitioning our baseload thermal  generation sites into integrated energy hubs. The transition of our thermal generation sites will support  the economic diversification of these regions, providing  new jobs and skills development opportunities for the  communities where we operate. The Hunter Valley, Torrens Island and Latrobe Valley hubs will bring  together energy production and energy-intensive industries around a  shared infrastructure backbone, with a focus on circular economy principles,  including innovative re-use of valuable infrastructure, recycling and co- location of complementary industries.

AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 78  ===== PAGE 79 ===== Governance Summary For the year ended 30 June 2024 Governance Summary 8. AGL is committed to ensuring that its corporate governance  framework, policies and practices are of a high standard. Delivering  on this commitment requires AGL to have a sound understanding  of current governance requirements and practices, as well as being  attuned to emerging governance trends and shifting stakeholder  expectations. Set out below is a summary of selected aspects  of AGL’s corporate governance framework and a summary of key  governance focus areas during FY24. Throughout FY24, AGL’s corporate governance arrangements  were consistent with the Corporate Governance Principles and  Recommendations (4th edition) published by the ASX Corporate  Governance Council. AGL’s 2024 Corporate Governance Statement  is available at agl.com.au/CorporateGovernance. AGL’s 2024 Corporate Governance Statement outlines AGL’s  arrangements in relation to its Board, Board Committees, Executive  Team, risk management framework and financial reporting,  diversity and inclusion, key corporate governance policies and  stakeholder engagement. 8.1 Board skills AGL seeks to maintain a Board of Directors with a broad range  of skills, knowledge and experience necessary to provide effective oversight over management and guide the strategic direction of  AGL. The Board uses a skills matrix to identify the key skills and  experience the Board is seeking to achieve in its membership. The  skills matrix is updated regularly by each Director rating their skills,  expertise and experience from 1 to 3 for each identified skill. The  self-assessment ratings are subsequently considered and approved  by the Board. The skills matrix as at 14 August 2024 is set out in  Table 8.2.2. In conducting the assessment, Directors were assessed using the  following skills rating levels: Significant Experience – regarded to have expert or highly  qualified proficiency, knowledge and experience in the subject  matter or domain and has been seen to contribute these skills in  Board and Committee conversations and critical thinking. Developed Understanding – developed a sound working  knowledge and understanding of the subject matter through  either past executive or management roles, extensive on-the-job  application of skills in Board and Committee activities and/or  through training and professional development activities. General Familiarity – possesses an awareness and base literacy  around the subject/topic and its relevance to the organisation and  the Board. Individual Director assessments were aggregated to inform an  assessment of the overall level of capability represented across the  Board in each of the identified priority areas.

Message from the Chair of the People &  Performance Committee Dear Shareholders, On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Remuneration  Report for AGL Energy Limited (AGL) and its consolidated entities  for the year ended 30 June 2024 (FY24). A year of strong operational and financial performance,  and delivery of our strategy In FY24, we focused on delivering our strategy of connecting our  customers to a sustainable future and transitioning our energy  portfolio. Our progress towards our FY27 targets is set out on  page 11 of the Annual Report. Our operational and financial performance across the year was strong, and we continue to  expand our development pipeline, which has grown from 3.2 GW  to 6.2 GW, since our Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP) was  released in September 2022. Our progress towards our FY27 targets is  set out on page 11 of the Annual Report. AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 90  ===== PAGE 91 ===== Remuneration Report For the year ended 30 June 2024 Linking FY24 remuneration outcomes to performance When determining overall FY24 remuneration outcomes, Directors  were cognisant to ensure they were reflective of and aligned to  shareholder experience. Furthermore, when setting FY24 targets  and the remuneration framework for executives, our key focus  was to measure and reward outperformance against delivery of  AGL’s strategy, including the targets set out in AGL’s CTAP and  AGL’s broader electrification and decarbonisation strategy. The  FY24 remuneration outcomes are reflective of this delivery. Fixed remuneration The fixed remuneration of both the Managing Director & CEO (MD  & CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) remained unchanged  since their respective appointments in January 2023. Following  a thorough remuneration benchmarking process, increases were  provided during the financial year to the Chief Operating Officer (COO) and Chief Customer Officer (CCO) in line with market  benchmarks, and reflecting their experience in role. Short-term incentives (STI) The performance outcomes in the STI scorecard for the year are  as follows: • Underlying Net Profit after tax of $812 million. The outcome  reflects significantly improved plant availability and portfolio  flexibility, higher wholesale electricity pricing from prior periods  reflected in overall pricing outcomes and continued discipline in  margin management. • Operating free cash flow of $1,355 million, (after adjusting for  Government bill relief payments received), up from $504 million  in FY23, reflecting strong cash flows in the existing business  which are being applied to dividends and to grow the  future business. • A Total Injury Frequency Rate (TIFR) which was below target and  of concern to the Board. Further initiatives are being undertaken  to prevent injuries across the organisation. • Strategic Net Promoter Score (NPS) of +4 was achieved, and  digital only customers increased to 55.8%. These results were  achieved despite challenging market conditions and cost of  living pressures. • Our employee engagement score increased by 5 percentage  points from 67% in 2023 to 72%, reflecting management's focus  and an improved employee value proposition, including positive  sentiment on AGL's future direction. This resulted in STI outcomes of 83.8% of maximum for the  MD & CEO and between 83.8% and 86.3% of maximum for  other executives. Long-term incentives (LTI) The FY21 LTI grant, the first to include a portion related to carbon  transition metrics, was tested at the end of FY24. The relative  total shareholder return (TSR) hurdle was not met, return on  equity (ROE) was achieved above target, and the carbon transition  hurdles were mostly met, resulting in 53.2% vesting. This is the  first LTI vesting in four years, and reflects the execution of strategic  objectives and our progress on transition plan objectives. Other remuneration arrangements Non-Executive Director fees remained unchanged in FY24. The last  fee change was in January 2020. The year ahead During FY24, the Board continued to review and monitor  remuneration structures and performance metrics to ensure  alignment with AGL's strategic objectives. The FY24 STI framework  will be broadly maintained for FY25, however, refinements to  the STI measures will be made by adding an inclusion index  measure in the people scorecard, which is a key measure to  drive focus on our Diversity & Inclusion Strategy. We will also  revise the customer metric from NPS to a customer satisfaction  metric to ensure we continue to maintain high customer service  during AGL’s retail transformation program. The FY25 LTI terms  will remain the same as FY24, with targets for the plan outlined  in section 9.2.4. The Board determined that the MD & CEO's  fixed remuneration will increase from 1 September 2024 to  $1,500,000 and the fixed remuneration for other executives will  also increase in line with market benchmarks. The MD & CEO's  variable opportunity at maximum will be increased to 125% of fixed remuneration (from 120%) for STI and 130% of fixed remuneration  (from 120%) for LTI, to align with market benchmarks and provide  for a greater portion of remuneration 'at-risk' and dependent on  performance outcomes. During FY25, AGL will develop its 2025 CTAP, which is scheduled  to be released in August 2025. The Board will continue to  consider opportunities to align future remuneration frameworks  with delivery of AGL’s strategy as it evolves over time. We welcome your feedback on the remuneration practices and  disclosures for AGL and look forward to your support at our  2024 AGM.

This may or may not result in an  increase for executives. • AGL is committed to gender pay equity across employees, including executives. There are no gender pay  gaps in fixed remuneration for current executives in roles of equivalent size, based on relative experience. AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 94  ===== PAGE 95 ===== Remuneration Report For the year ended 30 June 2024 9.2.2 Short-term incentive Features Approach Purpose • Reward executives for delivering financial returns and progressing AGL’s strategy and purpose Opportunity • MD & CEO: target of 100% of fixed remuneration (maximum of 120% of fixed remuneration) • Other executives: target of 70% of fixed remuneration (maximum of 84% of fixed remuneration) • Maximum is set at 120% of target Performance measures  and weightings • STI scorecards consist of group operational metrics aligned to the AGL Business Value Drivers and strategic  objectives which drive towards long-term value creation for shareholders: Measure Weighting Business Value Driver Financial 55% Safety 10% Customer 7.5% People 7.5% Individual strategic objectives 20% All Performance  assessment • In assessing outcomes under the STI, the Board assesses the quality of the results and the manner in  which they were achieved as well as ensuring that those outcomes are aligned with the experience of  AGL’s shareholders. • The starting point for considering STI outcomes is Statutory Profit. The Board may adjust Statutory Profit in  consideration of any non-cash fair value movements in financial instruments and non-recurring significant items that materially affect AGL’s financial results to derive Underlying Profit after tax. This is to ensure that  management are not unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged by items outside their control. • The Board expects an executive delivering against all performance objectives to achieve STI outcomes at  their target levels given that performance targets are set at ''stretch'' levels. • The Board applies discretion in the treatment of any significant items and their impact on outcomes  against performance targets and subsequent STI awards. Discretion guidelines are in place to formalise this  approach. Discretion may be applied within each of the measures, moving outcomes within the range and  if required, upwards or downwards between each assessment level. No Board discretion was applied in  assessing FY24 STI outcomes. Deferral and payment • 50% of the STI outcome is deferred and delivered in Restricted Shares for the MD & CEO, and 25% is  deferred for other executives. • Restricted Shares vest after two years subject to continuous service, and carry voting rights and  entitlements to dividends. • The number of Restricted Shares allocated is based on the average price paid per share for the purchase of  all Restricted Shares acquired at the time of offer. Cessation  of employment • When an executive leaves the organisation prior to the STI payment date by way of resignation or dismissal  for cause, the executive would not be eligible to receive any STI award for the relevant year. • Where the Board determines that an executive is a ''good leaver'' they may be entitled to a pro-rated award  for the year. The grant and treatment of Restricted Shares is subject to Board discretion. • Generally, Restricted Shares will be subject to forfeiture if an executive resigns prior to the restrictions lifting.

Therefore,  there was no change to fixed remuneration for Mr Nicks or Mr Brown during FY24. • Mr Brokhof's fixed remuneration increased by 5.0% to align with market benchmarks in peer companies, and reflect his experience,  performance and criticality in delivering strategic objectives. This is the first increase since appointment into the role in 2020. • Ms Egan's fixed remuneration increased by 12.9% to reflect her experience and performance in role, within market benchmarks. 9.3.2 FY24 STI outcomes The group STI scorecard outcomes are detailed below, and the individual strategic objective outcomes are shown in the subsequent tables. Group performance objectives and FY24 outcomes There is a strong link between executive remuneration outcomes and business performance. The FY24 STI scorecard results in STI outcomes  of between 83.8% and 86.3% of maximum for executives. As outlined in section 9.2.2, when considering the STI outcomes for executives, the  Board takes into account the scorecard results, how those outcomes were achieved, and the experience of shareholders over the period.  After detailed consideration, the Board determined that the outcomes appropriately reflect the company's performance and executives'  contributions against the scorecard for the year and has elected not to exercise discretion to adjust the outcomes.

People & Performance Committee (the Committee) What is the purpose of the Committee? • The purpose of the Committee is  to support the Board in fulfilling its  responsibilities through the recruitment,  retention and remuneration of  executives with the capabilities and skills  necessary to execute AGL’s strategy. How does the Committee support  the Board? • The Committee reviews and makes  recommendations to the Board on the  remuneration arrangements for KMP. • The Committee provides support to  the Board in relation to matters  such as governing remuneration  and employment policies, practices  and programs. • The Committee oversees the preparation  of AGL's Remuneration Report which is  subsequently reviewed by the Board as  part of the Annual Report. Who sits on the Committee? • The Committee includes independent  Non-Executive Directors of the Board,  including members of the Audit & Risk  Management Committee. Management External consultants The Committee has access to management to seek advice on  various remuneration-related matters, as required. The Committee has access to external consultants to seek  advice on various remuneration-related matters, as required.  Any recommendations made by consultants in relation to  remuneration arrangements of KMP are made directly to the  Board without any influence from management. Arrangements  are in place to ensure any advice is independent of management. During FY24, the Committee engaged EY to act as independent  remuneration advisers. EY did not provide any remuneration  recommendations as defined in the Corporations Act 2001 to the  Committee during FY24. Further details • The complete Committee Charter is reviewed at least every two years and is available on AGL’s website:  agl.com.au/BoardAndCommitteeCharters. 9.4.2 Management of risk and remuneration The AGL remuneration framework is designed to ensure that executives focus on delivering against the strategic objectives, ensuring that  company and shareholder outcomes are primary considerations in decision-making processes. The framework is structured to mitigate  against any excessive risk-taking or short-term decisions by executives through the establishment of scorecard metrics that align with  strategic objectives. The use of deferred equity in both the short and long-term incentive plans, and the clawback provisions within those  equity plans also assists the company in managing risk. AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 104  ===== PAGE 105 ===== Remuneration Report For the year ended 30 June 2024 9.4.3 Incentive plan governance AGL has the following governance framework in place for its incentive plans: Clawback • The Board has discretion to prescribe clawback events for any unvested equity awards which may be clawed  back from executives. Change of control • The Board will determine at the time a change of control event occurs how to treat unvested equity in  accordance with the plan rules, and ultimately has absolute discretion in determining this treatment, taking  into consideration market practice. Hedging Policy • AGL has a policy in place that prevents executives from entering into any derivative or other financial product  in relation to their equity plan(s) participation. Discretion • The Board, in conjunction with the People & Performance Committee, exercises discretion to ensure the  quantum of executive remuneration is appropriate considering individual and company performance, for  example by adjusting STI and LTI vesting outcomes. This discretion ensures that the quantum of executive  remuneration is appropriate. • Discretion guidelines provide a framework to assist the Board with identifying one-off/extraordinary circumstances (e.g. impairments) and whether those circumstances require an adjustment to incentive  outcomes. The guidelines support consistency in application over time and does not limit the Board's  overarching discretion under AGL's incentive plans. 9.4.4 KMP share ownership To provide for shareholder alignment, AGL operates a Minimum Shareholding Policy, subject to compliance with AGL’s Securities Dealing  Policy. Shareholdings are reported in Table 9.6.2.1 for executives and Table 9.7.4.1 for Non-Executive Directors. The Minimum Shareholding Policy stipulates the following requirements: Shareholding requirement Period to satisfy requirement Non-Executive Directors 100% of Board member  base fee Four years; 50% within two years of appointment; encouraged to hold 10%  by the end of the financial year of appointment.

AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 109 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 110 ===== Directors’ Report Remuneration Report For the year ended 30 June 2024 9.7 Non-Executive Director remuneration disclosure 9.7.1 Fee pool The maximum aggregate fee pool for Non-Executive Directors is $2.75 million per annum. The fee pool is regularly reviewed by the  Board and, if appropriate, adjusted (subject to shareholder approval), having regard to the anticipated time commitment, workload and  responsibilities attached and the fees paid by comparable organisations. The current fee pool was approved by shareholders at the  2016 AGM. 9.7.2 Fee policy Non-Executive Directors receive a base fee. Members of a Committee receive a Committee fee to recognise the associated higher workload  and extra responsibilities, and chairing a Committee attracts a higher fee. The Chair of the Board receives a higher base fee in recognition of  the added responsibility and time commitment; but does not receive any extra fees for participating in or chairing any Committees. Fees are  inclusive of superannuation. There are no additional fees in relation to the Nominations Committee. In setting Non-Executive Directors’ fees, the Board considers the following: • time commitment • workload • risk and responsibility • market benchmark data, sourced from companies with market capitalisation of 50-200% of AGL's To ensure independence, Non-Executive Directors do not receive performance-related remuneration. This allows the Board to focus on  governance and both short and long-term strategy. 9.7.3 FY24 fees Fees for Non-Executive Directors remained unchanged during the financial year.

Other Required Disclosures 10. 10.1 Changes in state of affairs In the opinion of the Directors there were no significant changes in  the state of affairs of the AGL consolidated entity that occurred  during the financial year other than those included in this  Directors’ Report. 10.2 Proceedings on behalf of the company No person has applied under Section 237 of the Corporations  Act for leave of the Court to bring proceedings on behalf of AGL  or intervene in any proceedings to which AGL is a party for the  purpose of taking responsibility on behalf of AGL for all or any part  of those proceedings. AGL was not a party to any such proceedings  during the year. 10.3 Commercial in confidence information Further information about likely developments in the operations of  AGL and its consolidated entity and the expected results of those  operations in the future has been included in this Directors’ Report  except to the extent disclosure of the information would be likely to  result in unreasonable prejudice to the consolidated entity. The type of information not disclosed includes commercial  in confidence information such as detailed operational plans  and strategies that would provide third parties with a  commercial advantage. 10.4 Auditor and non-audit services Non-audit services have been provided during the year by the  external auditor, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Australia (Deloitte).  Disclosure of the details of these services can be found in Note  26 of the Financial Report 2024. The Board has a formal policy on the provision of auditing and  related services. Specifically, the external auditor is precluded  from providing any services that might threaten its independence  or conflict with its assurance and compliance role. Semi-annual  reports on the provision of auditing and related services are  provided to the Board through the Audit & Risk Management  Committee. The Directors are satisfied that the provision of  other accounting advice and services by the external auditor  is compatible with the general standard of independence  for auditors. The policy and procedures in place, and the review by the Audit  & Risk Management Committee, enable the Directors to conclude  that non-audit services provided did not compromise the external  auditor’s independence requirements of the Corporations Act. The external auditor annually provides a letter to the Company  Secretary on its independence within the meaning of relevant  legislation and professional standards. No officers of AGL were  partners or directors of Deloitte during this or prior periods. 10.5 Rounding AGL is an entity to which ASIC Corporations Instrument 2016/191  applies and, in accordance with that Instrument, amounts in the  Financial Report and this Directors’ Report have been rounded to  the nearest million dollars, unless otherwise stated. 10.6 Auditor’s Independence Declaration A copy of the external auditor’s declaration under Section 307C of  the Corporations Act in relation to the audit for the financial year is  attached to the AGL Financial Report 2024. 10.7 Indemnification and insurance of officers AGL's constitution indemnifies, to the extent permitted by law,  officers of the consolidated entity when acting in their capacity in  respect of: • liability to third parties (other than related entities) when acting in  good faith; and • costs and expenses of successfully defending legal proceedings  and ancillary matters. The Directors named earlier in this Report and the Company  Secretary have the benefit of the indemnity, together with any other  person concerned in, or who takes part in, the management of the  consolidated entity. During the year, AGL paid premiums in respect of contracts  insuring all Directors of AGL as listed earlier, all Directors of related  bodies corporate of AGL, secretaries and other Officers of the  consolidated entity against liabilities incurred in their capacity as  Director or Officer, as the case may be, of the consolidated entity. The contract prohibits disclosure of the nature of the liabilities  covered and the amount of premium. 10.8 Subsequent events On 14 August 2024, AGL announced it has entered into a  binding agreement for the acquisition of 100% of the shares and  units in Firm Power and Terrain Solar for a total consideration  of approximately $250 million. Firm Power is a Battery Energy  Storage System (BESS) developer with 21 projects in development,  and Terrain Solar is a solar project developer with 6 projects  in development.  Completion of the acquisition is anticipated  in calendar year 2024 subject to fulfillment of conditions. Apart from the matters identified above and in the financial statements or notes thereto, there has not been any other matter  or circumstance that has arisen since the end of the financial year, that has significantly affected or may significantly affect the  operations of AGL, the results of those operations, or the state of  affairs of AGL in future financial periods. 10.9 Non-IFRS Financial Information The Operating & Financial Review attached to and forming part  of this Directors’ Report includes a number of non-International  Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) financial measures. AGL  management uses these non-IFRS financial measures to assess the  performance of the business and make decisions on the allocation  of resources. AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 112  ===== PAGE 113 ===== Other Required Disclosures For the year ended 30 June 2024 Principal among these non-IFRS financial measures is Underlying  Profit. This measure is Statutory Profit/(Loss) adjusted for: • significant items (which are material items of revenue or expense  that are unrelated to the underlying performance of the  business); and • changes in the fair value of financial instruments recognised in  the statement of profit or loss (to remove the volatility caused by  mismatches in valuing financial instruments and the underlying  asset differently). AGL believes that Underlying Profit provides a better understanding  of its financial performance than Statutory Profit/(Loss) and allows  for a more relevant comparison of financial performance between  financial periods. Underlying Profit is presented with reference to ASIC Regulatory  Guide 230 “Disclosing non-IFRS financial information”, issued in  December 2011. AGL’s policy for reporting Underlying Profit is consistent with this guidance. The Directors have had the  consistency of the application of the policy reviewed by the external  auditor of AGL. 10.10 Corporate governance A copy of AGL's Corporate Governance Statement can be found on  the AGL website at agl.com.au/CorporateGovernance. 10.11 Environmental regulation AGL's businesses are subject to a range of environmental laws  and regulations as well as project and site-specific environmental  permits and approvals issued at both the federal and state  government levels. On 26 September 2023, the EPA Victoria issued AGL Loy Yang  Pty Ltd with an Improvement Notice, following an event on  11 August 2023when a fire service water pipeline leak below the  Raw Coal Bunker resulted in water flowing into the Sheepwash  Creek catchment area and discharging beyond the premises  boundary. The Improvement Notice was revoked by the EPA on  20 December 2023 as compliance had been achieved. On 16 May 2024, the Qld Department of Environment and Science  (DES) issued AGL Gas Storage Pty Ltd with an Environment  Protection Order (EPO) in relation to the relinquishment of the  Environmental Authority (EA) EPSX02393214. AGL allegedly failed  to surrender an EA for two previously relinquished leases (ATP471  & 709) despite continued and sustained efforts by AGL and DES  to arrive at a successful resolution. DES has advised that there is  no mechanism under the Environmental Protection Act (1994) to  formally extend the surrender timeframe and therefore an EPO was  deemed necessary. Approval of Directors’ Report This Directors’ Report is made in accordance with a resolution of  the Board of Directors and is signed for and on behalf of the Board  this 14th day of August 2024.

AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 119 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 120 ===== Financial Report Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2024 Segment information 1. Operating Segments AGL manages its business in three key operating segments: Segments • Customer Markets comprises the Consumer and Business customer portfolios responsible for the retailing of electricity, gas,  broadband/mobile/voice, solar and energy efficiency products and services to residential, small and large business customers. Customer  Markets sources its energy from Integrated Energy at transfer prices that reflect wholesale energy costs in each state, along with other  energy costs such as those arising from environmental schemes. Customer Markets also includes sales, marketing, brand, and AGL's  customer contact and call centre operations. • Integrated Energy operates AGL’s power generation portfolio and other key assets, including coal, gas and renewable generation  facilities, natural gas storage and production facilities, and development projects. Integrated Energy runs a large trading operation to  manage price risk associated with procuring electricity and gas for AGL's customers, manages AGL's obligations in relation to renewable  energy schemes, and controls the dispatch of AGL's owned and contracted generation assets, gas offtake agreements and associated  portfolio of energy hedging products. • Investments comprises AGL’s interests in the ActewAGL Retail Partnership, Tilt Renewables, Energy Impact Partners Europe, Ovo Energy  Australia Pty Ltd and other investments. In the segment financial results, the ‘Other’ category consists of various Corporate activities. These are not considered to be  reportable segments. Segment financial results The measurement of segment results is in line with the basis of information presented to the Board of Directors for internal management  reporting purposes. The performance of each segment is measured based on their Underlying earnings before interest and tax (Underlying  EBIT) contribution to AGL. Certain items of income and expense are excluded from the segment results to show a measure of underlying  performance. These items include changes in fair value of financial instruments and significant items. AASB 8 Operating Segments requires AGL to report segment information on the same basis as the internal management structure. As a  result, the Customer Markets segment reports the revenue and margin associated with satisfying the gas, electricity and telecommunication  requirements of AGL consumer and business customer portfolio and Integrated Energy reports the revenue, expenses and margin related to  AGL's operating sites and AGL's wholesale energy portfolio.

AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 124  ===== PAGE 125 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2024 Revenue (Continued) 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY Revenue from contracts with customers AGL's primary revenue streams relate to the retail sale of  electricity and gas to residential (consumer) and business  customers in Australia, the sale of electricity and gas  to wholesale customers in Australia and the sale of  generated electricity to the National Electricity Market  (NEM) in Australia. Revenue from contracts with customers  is recognised when control of the goods or services is  transferred to a customer at an amount that reflects the  consideration to which AGL expects to be entitled to receive  in exchange for those goods or services. The majority of contractual energy supply arrangements  with customers have no fixed duration, generally require  no minimum consumption by the customer and are able to  be terminated by either party at any time without incurring  significant penalty. Given this, the enforceable contracts are  considered short term (less than 12 months) in nature.  There are some longer term contracts particularly those with  business and wholesale customers. AGL has generally concluded that it is the principal in its  revenue arrangements because it controls the goods or  services before transferring them to the customer. AGL’s primary performance obligations are the supply  of energy (electricity or gas) over the contractual term.  There are either individual contracts representing separate  purchasing decisions of customers, or the units of supply  of energy represent a series of distinct goods that are  substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer  to the customer and hence is considered one performance  obligation satisfied over time. For the shorter term contracts,  the performance obligations are considered to be satisfied, and revenue is recognised, as and when the units of  energy are delivered. Additionally, in relation to AGL’s longer  term contracts, AGL determines that the right-to-invoice  approach to measure the progress towards completion  of the performance obligation is most appropriate as it  represents AGL’s performance. AGL uses the units of energy  delivered to the customer as estimated as part of the  unbilled process (and later verified by meter readings) or as  indicated by the customer’s energy meter (where these are  known more frequently). In most instances, the transaction price is determined by  the relevant customer pricing plan. For some wholesale  contracts, AGL also considers the effects of variable  consideration and for some business sales, there is non-cash  consideration and consideration payable to the customer  relating to renewable energy certificates (RECs). Electricity and Gas revenue Consumer electricity and gas sales Consumer energy sales relate to the sale of energy  (electricity and gas) to retail customers. Consumer sales  are classified as individual, short term, day-by-day contracts  and are recognised as revenue on a day-by-day basis upon  delivery of energy to customers. Where the customers are eligible to receive additional  discounts (e.g. pay on time discounts to encourage timely  payment of energy invoices), AGL considers this to be  variable consideration, which is estimated as part of the  unbilled process. Portfolio approach for consumer electricity and  gas sales AGL recognises revenue from contracts with its consumers  at the electricity and gas portfolio levels. Furthermore, AGL  has elected to apply the portfolio approach in accounting  for the fair valuing of RECs, accounting for connection fees  and sales commissions. Recognition at the portfolio level  does not differ materially from applying the standard on a  contract-by-contract basis. Business electricity and gas sales Business sales represent the sale of energy to business  customers. Revenue recognition is largely consistent with  consumer sales. These contracts are longer term in nature  and represent a series of distinct goods that are substantially  the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the  customer and are treated as one performance obligation  satisfied over time based on the output delivered to the  customer. For a large majority of business sales customers,  revenue is recognised when AGL has the ‘right to invoice’  the customer for consideration that has been determined  to correspond directly with the value of units of energy  delivered to that customer. Some business sales arrangements also include the transfer  of RECs to the customer, which can, in some instances,  represent a separate performance obligation. Material right applicable to residential and  business sales Where a fixed fee (e.g. connection fee, distribution fee,  capacity reservation charge, etc.) received from a customer  does not represent a transfer of a good or service to a  customer, but the customer is charged an upfront amount,  the customer contract contains a material right in that the  customer is effectively able to buy additional units of energy  at a lower cost per unit. The material right is valued based on its relative  standalone selling price. If standalone selling prices are not  directly observable, the price is estimated by taking into  consideration the discount the customer would receive in a  standalone transaction and the likelihood that the customer  would exercise the option. Revenue from a material right is recognised as and when  the right is exercised by the customer or the right expires,  whichever is earlier.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY Wholesale energy sales Wholesale energy sales represent the sale of electricity  and gas to wholesale customers. These involve a high  volume of energy usually over an extended period of time.  Supply of energy represents a series of distinct goods that  are substantially the same and have the same pattern of  transfer to the customer and is the major performance  obligation. It is treated as one performance obligation  which is satisfied over time. In some instances, there is an  additional performance obligation in these contracts by way  of a material right. Revenue is recognised for these arrangements when AGL  has the ‘right to invoice’ the customer for consideration that  has been determined to correspond directly with the value  of units of energy delivered to that customer. Some wholesale electricity arrangements may involve the  transfer of RECs to the customer, which may represent a  separate performance obligation. Renewable energy certificates (RECs) applicable to  business and wholesale sales There are two main instances where RECs pass between AGL  and its customers. These include those transferred under a  self-surrender arrangement as part of the consideration for  energy and those that are sold to customers. Received from customer (self-surrender) As a retailer, AGL incurs costs in relation to its renewable  energy obligations for which RECs must be surrendered to  the government. For most customers, the costs associated  with meeting these renewable energy obligations is factored  into the cost of energy (i.e. there is a REC cost component  built into the price paid). For some customers, instead of  paying for the cost of the energy in cash, they have the  option to elect to pay for their energy usage in the form of  cash and by self-surrendering RECs. The obligation to remit RECs to the regulator remains with  AGL, but the customer is choosing to meet part of its  payment by way of surrendering its own RECs rather than  paying for the cost of the RECs as part of the overall cost of  the energy. The transfer of RECs as consideration in exchange for energy  is a form of non-cash consideration. AGL measures non-cash  consideration at its fair value at the date of surrender (i.e. the  date of transfer by the customer). Transferred to the customer For some customer contracts, AGL sells both energy and  RECs to the customer. A customer may purchase RECs to  meet its own REC obligations and/or where it wants actual  title to the RECs. The RECs sold to a customer represent a separate  performance obligation, i.e. a good, as the customer can  benefit from the RECs on their own and the promise to  transfer RECs to the customer is separately identifiable from the other promises in the contract (e.g. promise to  deliver energy). AGL determines the portion of the transaction price that it  allocates to the RECs using the relative standalone selling  price method. The transaction price is allocated to each performance  obligation based on the proportion of the stand-alone  selling price of each performance obligation to the sum  of the stand-alone selling prices of all of the performance  obligations in the contract. Revenue is recognised as and when the control of the RECs  are transferred to the customer, which occurs at a point  in time. Where the customer is entitled to all the RECs  generated at a specified power plant (e.g. in cases where  power plants are located at the customer’s site), transfer of  control to the customer occurs as and when the RECs are  generated. In other cases where the RECs are transferred to  the customer from inventory, control of the RECs transfers  upon receipt by the customer. Pool revenue Generation Sales to Pool Pool generation sales and pool purchase costs relate to  sales by AGL’s generation assets to the NEM and purchases  of energy on behalf of AGL's retail business. AGL has  assessed it is acting as the principal in relation to such  sales and purchases of energy to the pool and therefore the  transactions are recognised on a ‘gross’ basis. Revenue from  these arrangements is recognised at the spot price achieved  when control of the energy passes to the NEM. Variable consideration If the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount,  AGL estimates the amount of consideration to which it  will be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods  to the customer. The variable consideration is estimated  at contract inception and constrained until it is highly  probable that a significant revenue reversal in the amount  of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the  associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is  subsequently resolved. Significant financing component AGL applies the practical expedient in that it does not adjust  the promised amount of consideration for the effects of  a significant financing component if it expects, at contract  inception, that the period between the transfer of the  promised good or service to the customer and when the  customer pays for that good or service will be one year  or less. AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 126  ===== PAGE 127 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2024 Revenue (Continued) 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY Costs to obtain a contract Costs that are incurred regardless of whether a contract is  obtained are expensed as incurred, unless those costs are  explicitly chargeable to the customer. Discretionary bonuses  paid to sales staff based on meeting annual sales targets,  overall profitability and individual performance evaluations  are expensed as incurred as they are not directly attributable  to identifiable contracts and do not meet the criteria  for capitalisation. Costs to fulfil The costs incurred by AGL to fulfil a contract with a customer,  which may qualify for capitalisation include connection  fees paid/incurred by AGL (including those charged by  distribution businesses to provide such network services, or  those incurred directly by AGL in connecting a customer).  These costs do not fall within the scope of any other  standard (i.e. the cost is not part of inventory, an intangible  asset or property, plant and equipment). Therefore, these  costs are capitalised as a contract cost (cost to fulfil) asset  and amortised over the life of the customer contract or  customer relationship, where material. Cost sharing arrangements AGL enters into cost sharing arrangements whereby the  costs to operate and maintain assets that are shared with  parties outside the AGL Group are recharged to the parties  in accordance with their beneficial interest. These recharged  amounts are recognised as revenue when the associated  costs to which they relate impact the statement of profit or  loss. Revenue is measured with reference to the fair value of  the consideration received. Government grants Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable  assurance that AGL will comply with the conditions of the  grant and the grant will be received. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Variable consideration and constraints AGL includes variable consideration in the transaction price  as estimated at the inception of a contract. However, if it  is considered ‘highly probable’ that a significant reversal of  revenue recognised will occur in the future, the variable  consideration is constrained and not included in the  transaction price. AGL’s contractual arrangements contain a number of variable  pricing elements including pay-on-time discounts, payment  plans, and escalations. Some of these variable elements  are resolved during the reporting period. Where they are  not, management estimates the likelihood of the variable  pricing element eventuating and recognises the variable  pricing element to the extent it is not highly probable that  it will reverse. Revenue recognition AGL recognises revenue from gas and electricity services  once the gas and/or electricity has been consumed by the  customer. Management estimates customer consumption  between the last invoice date and the end of the reporting  period when determining gas and electricity revenue for the  financial period. Various assumptions and financial models  are used to determine the estimated unbilled consumption.  Refer to Note 9 for the key assumptions used in determining  the estimated unbilled consumption.

AGL has adopted the voluntary Tax Transparency Code as endorsed by the Board of Taxation and the Australian Taxation Office. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY Income tax Tax consolidation AGL Energy Limited (the Parent Entity) and its wholly-owned  Australian resident subsidiaries formed a tax-consolidated  group pursuant to Australian taxation law with effect from  25 October 2006 and are therefore taxed as a single entity  from that date. AGL Energy Limited is the head entity in the  tax-consolidated group. On 23 July 2012, AGL Generation Holdco Pty Ltd, a subsidiary  99.99% owned by AGL Energy Limited, and AGL Generation  Pty Ltd elected to form a tax-consolidated group with Loy  Yang Marketing Holdings Pty Limited and its wholly-owned  subsidiary, in addition to the existing group. On 27 July 2012,  Great Energy Alliance Corporation Pty Limited (GEAC) and its  wholly-owned subsidiaries joined the new tax-consolidated  group. AGL Generation Holdco Pty Ltd is the head entity in  the new tax-consolidated group. Tax expense/income, deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax  assets arising from temporary differences of the members of  the tax consolidated group are recognised in the separate  financial statements of the members of the tax-consolidated  group using the ‘standalone taxpayer’ approach by reference  to the carrying amounts in the separate financial statements  of each entity and the tax values applying under tax  consolidation. Current tax liabilities and assets and deferred  tax assets arising from unused tax losses and tax credits of  the tax-consolidated group are recognised by the head entity  in each tax consolidated group. The members of each of the tax-consolidated group have  entered into a tax sharing and tax funding agreement. The  tax funding agreement requires payments to/from the head  entity equal to the current tax liability/asset assumed by the  head entity and any tax loss deferred tax asset assumed by  the head entity. The payments are recorded as intercompany  receivables/payables. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Deferred tax assets relating to tax losses AGL recognises a deferred tax asset relating to tax losses. The recoverability of this deferred tax asset is dependent on the  generation of sufficient taxable income, to utilise those tax losses. Management judgements and estimates are required in the  assessment of this recoverability, including forecasting sufficient future taxable income.

Trade and other receivables  are recognised at amortised cost, less an allowance for  expected credit loss. AGL's policy requires customers to pay  in accordance with agreed payment terms. Depending on  the customer segment, trade receivables are generally due  for settlement within 30 days. AGL assesses on a forward looking basis the expected  credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at  amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive  income (FVOCI). The impairment methodology applied  depends on whether there has been a significant increase  in credit risk. For trade receivables, unbilled revenue, and other  receivables, AGL applies the simplified approach, which  requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from  initial recognition of the receivables. Unbilled revenue Unbilled revenue represents estimated gas and electricity  services supplied to customers but unbilled at the end of the  reporting period. Unbilled gas and electricity revenue is not  collectible until such time as customers’ meters are read and  bills rendered.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Expected credit loss on trade receivables and  unbilled revenue AGL uses an allowance matrix to measure expected credit  losses of trade receivables and unbilled revenue from its  customers. Trade receivable amounts are disaggregated into  customer segments. Loss rates are estimated in each age category and are  based on the probability of a receivable progressing through  to write-off. Factors to estimate the loss rate are based  on risk assessment performed for each customer segment  and economic factors such as wholesale electricity forward  curves, commodity fuel forward curves and prevailing macro- economic information. Unbilled revenue AGL recognises revenue from gas and electricity sales  once the gas and/or electricity has been consumed by the  customer. Management estimates customer consumption  between the last invoice date and the end of the reporting  period when determining gas and electricity revenue for the  financial period. Various assumptions and financial models  are used to determine the estimated unbilled consumption. Key accounting assumptions and estimates include: • Volume and timing of energy consumed by the customers • Various pricing plans prevalent and allocation of the  estimated volume to such pricing plans • Loss factors • Behavioural discounts.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is measured at  cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated  impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to  the acquisition or construction of the asset. Finance costs  related to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets  are capitalised. Cost may also include transfers from other  comprehensive income of any gain or loss on qualifying cash  flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property, plant  and equipment. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis so as to  write off the cost of each asset over its expected useful life  to its estimated residual value. Leasehold improvements are  amortised over the period of the relevant lease or estimated  useful life, whichever is the shorter. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation  method are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate at the end  of each annual reporting period. The following estimated useful lives are used in the  calculation of depreciation: • Leasehold improvements − lesser of lease period or up to  50 years • Plant and equipment − Up to 50 years AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 139 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 140 ===== Financial Report Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2024 Property, plant and equipment (Continued) 15. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY Right-of-use assets (ROU assets) A ROU asset is subsequently measured using the cost model  less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated  impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of  the lease liability. AGL does not apply the revaluation model  but instead carries all ROU assets at cost. The ROU asset is  depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset  and the lease term. Where the ROU asset is adjusted due to  changes in the lease liability, the depreciation for the ROU  asset is adjusted on a prospective basis. The following estimated useful lives are used in the  calculation of depreciation on ROU assets: • Plant and equipment – ROU assets: lesser of lease period  or up to 15 years • Other – ROU assets: lesser of lease period or up to  50 years Short-term and low value leases as lessee AGL has elected to apply the practical expedients available  for short-term leases (i.e. where the lease period is 12  months or less) and low-value asset leases. As a result of  application of these practical expedients, the measurement  requirements of accounting standards do not apply and  the expense for these leases is recognised on a straight- line basis. Impairment of non-financial assets  excluding goodwill Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs  of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the  estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present  value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects current  market assessments of the time value of money and the risks  specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash  flows have not been adjusted. Refer to Note 16 for further details on the impairment  assessment during the period.

Impairment testing for goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives Goodwill, that is significant in comparison to AGL's total carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite lives, has been allocated to  cash-generating units (CGUs) for the purpose of impairment testing as follows: 2024 $m 2023 $m Customer Markets 1,093 1,093 Wholesale Gas 1,353 1,353 Generation Fleet - - Flexible Generation - - Total goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives 2,446 2,446 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY Intangible assets Except for goodwill, intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation  is recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the period during which economic benefits are expected to  be received. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting period. The following estimated useful lives are used in the calculation of amortisation for intangible assets with finite lives: • Customer relationships and contracts − 3 to 20 years • Software − 3 to 7 years • Licences – 3 to 35 years Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Impairment assessment for the year ended  30 June 2024 AGL regularly reviews the carrying values of its assets to  test for any impairment. An assessment of indications of  impairment for each cash generating unit (CGU) is performed  at each reporting period end, and if indications exist, a  subsequent recoverable value assessment is performed.  Notwithstanding the above, the recoverable value of a CGU  containing goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful  lives or intangible assets in development is determined at  least annually. These annual assessments are performed in  December each year. AGL’s main CGUs are: • Generation Fleet • Customer Markets • Wholesale Gas • Flexible Generation Impairment testing methodology AGL is subject to a number of external factors that impact  the performance of its CGUs. This includes, but is not limited  to, market prices, external regulatory and social factors that  may impact the life of assets, competitor behaviour and new  entrants and technological change. To respond to the range  of potential outcomes that can result from these factors,  AGL applies a scenario analysis approach when determining  the recoverable value of assets. Each of the scenarios are  assigned a probability weighting to estimate the recoverable  value of the CGU overall. The scenarios modelled represent  a range of outcomes including differing wholesale market  prices, expected generation volume, station closure dates,  asset lives, and operating costs.  Estimates and assumptions underlying impairment testing  are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are consistent  with AGL’s climate-related commitments, including AGL’s  announced closure dates for its thermal assets. If the recoverable amount of a CGU is estimated to be less  than the carrying amount, the carrying amount of the CGU  is reduced to its recoverable amount with any impairment  recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss. Generation Fleet CGU For AGL’s fleet of finite life generation assets, cash flow forecasts are based on discrete and long-term cash flow forecasts that reflect the life of the assets.  The long-term  modelling reflects AGL’s view of the cash flows anticipated  from operations, factoring in both known events such  as planned outages and expectations, and allows for  quantification of sensitivities and scenarios. The key assumptions applied in the determination of  the recoverable amount of the Generation Fleet CGU at  31 December 2023 include: • Three scenarios of forecast electricity pool prices over  the life of the relevant station based on short term  market forecasts for electricity pricing and longer term  external and internal modelled pricing outlook, including  the scenario where there is a decrease in the long-term  electricity pool price as a result of the Capacity Investment  Scheme (CIS); • Three station closure date scenarios; one consistent with  those announced in the Climate Transition Action Plan,  and two other scenarios whereby Bayswater and Loy  Yang A close earlier than announced as a result of an  oversupply of new generation; • A post-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)  discount rate of 9.5% (FY23: 8.5%); • Generation volumes for each relevant station based on  historical and forecast generation and availability including  planned outages; and • Assumptions associated with regulatory outcomes  impacting upon operations. The derived recoverable amount resulted in no impairment  charge to the carrying value of the CGU nor a  requirement to reverse previously recognised impairment at  31 December 2023. Sensitivity analysis In the prior year impairment assessment at 31 December  2022, AGL reduced the carrying amount of the Generation  Fleet CGU to its recoverable amount resulting in a pre-tax  impairment loss of $1,008 million. Accordingly, any further  reduction in the recoverable amount driven by a small  change in assumptions could result in further impairment.  When considering variables in isolation, AGL's Generation  Fleet  CGU recoverable amount estimate is most sensitive  to changes in electricity pool price. There is a high degree  of uncertainty when forecasting pool price over long-term  periods where long-run secular changes can impact supply.  Based on historical pool prices, a reasonably possible  change of $10 per MWh has been observed. In the annual  impairment assessment performed at 31 December 2023,  a sustained decrease of $10 per MWh in the pool price,  whilst holding all other assumptions constant, could result  in further impairment of the Generation Fleet CGU. Equally,  a sustained increase of $10 per MWh would result in the  partial reversal of any previously recognised impairment  losses, up to the depreciated carrying amount. The recoverable amount estimate is also sensitive to  changes in expected generation volumes. The relationship  between generation volume and the flow on impact on  the recoverable amount is complex and interdependent,  particularly as Australia transitions away from coal-fired baseload to intermittent renewable power generation.  During periods of excess generation, pool prices are often  negative, and in such instances AGL may limit or curtail  the generation volume to reduce exposure to negative  AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 142  ===== PAGE 143 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2024 Intangible assets (Continued) 16. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS pricing. It is possible that limiting and curtailing generation  volume in this instance can have a counterintuitive impact of  increasing the recoverable amount. However, based on the  assumptions utilised in the annual impairment assessment  at 31 December 2023, a sustained decrease of 2% in  generation volume whilst holding all other assumptions  constant could result in further impairment.  The analysis above is to some extent limited by the fact  that changes in variables are rarely mutually exclusive and  the relationships and interactions between those changes  are highly complex. Alterations in the external operational  landscape, such as closure of major electricity consumers,  substantial additions to generation capacity, postponements  in the closure of power stations not owned by AGL, or  modifications to government policies, have the potential to  bring about fluctuations in pool prices. Additionally, these  changes may decrease the operational lifespan of AGL's  assets, possibly leading to additional impairments. At 30 June 2024, an impairment indicators assessment  was performed for the Generation Fleet CGU to determine  if there were any indicators of impairment since the  assessment performed at 31 December 2023. The  assessment has not identified any internal or external  indicators that the asset within this CGU is further impaired  or the previous impairment expense recognised should  be reversed. Accordingly, no further recoverable value  assessment was required. Customer Markets CGU The following key assumptions were applied to determine  the recoverable amount of the Customer Markets CGU at  31 December 2023: • Gross margin outcomes based on actual regulatory  decisions for the current reporting period, which are  publicly available, together with AGL’s expectations of  regulated network prices and regulated pricing (Victorian  Default Market Offer/Default Market Offer) beyond the  current reset period; • Future gross margin in unregulated markets is determined  with reference to historically achieved revenue rates,  AGL’s expectations of future price changes and impact of  expected customer discounts; • Customer numbers and consumption volumes are  estimated based on historical experience, marketing  strategies for the retention and winning of customers and  the expected competition from new entrants; • A post-tax WACC discount rate of 8.25% (FY23: 7.5%); and • Terminal growth rate of 2.75% (FY23: 2.5%). The recoverable amount of the Customer Markets CGU  exceeded the carrying value at 31 December 2023. There  were no reasonable possible changes in assumptions that  would result in an impairment. At 30 June 2024, an impairment indicators assessment was  performed for the Customer Markets CGU. The assessment  has not identified any internal or external indicator that the  assets within this CGU are impaired and accordingly, no  further recoverable value assessment was required. Wholesale Gas CGU The following key assumptions were applied to determine  the recoverable amount of the Wholesale Gas CGU at  31 December 2023: • Gas sales volumes, pricing and procurement costs are  estimated based on the actual contract portfolio, together  with an estimate of future market margins and volumes  beyond the period of the actual contracted portfolio; • A post-tax WACC discount rate of 8.25% (FY23: 7.5%); • Terminal growth rate range between 0% to 1.5% (FY23:  2.5%); and • Various scenarios with different assumptions regarding  the operational life of the CGU were evaluated. The recoverable amount of the Wholesale Gas CGU  exceeded the carrying value at 31 December 2023 and  consequently no impairment loss was recognised in relation  to this CGU. At 30 June 2024, an impairment indicators assessment was  performed for the Wholesale Gas CGU. The assessment has  not identified any internal or external indicator that the  assets within this CGU are impaired and accordingly, no  further recoverable value assessment was required. Sensitivity analysis The recoverable amount is sensitive to reasonably possible  changes in the forecast gas margin assumption. At  31 December 2023, the recoverable amount of the CGU  would equal its carrying amount if the long-term gas margin  forecast was reduced by $0.5/GJ in isolation for each of the  forecast periods. The Wholesale Gas CGU benefits from favourable supply  costs associated with existing contractual arrangements.  The recoverable amount assessment of the Wholesale  Gas CGU is calculated on a probability-based approach  across various scenarios, including scenarios where these  favourable supply contracts lapse, and costs reset to terms  more consistent with current market conditions. As these  contracts lapse and costs reset to terms more consistent  with current market conditions, the recoverable amount  of the Wholesale Gas CGU could potentially decrease. A  decrease in the recoverable amount could potentially give  rise to an impairment loss in future periods to the extent it is  lower than the carrying amount.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Flexible Generation CGU The following key assumptions were applied to determine  the recoverable amount of the Flexible Generation CGU at  31 December 2023: • Assumed cap prices derived from internal and external  market modelling to reflect the ability to capture prices  during high demand events; • Useful life of the generation assets, which includes  gas peaker stations and renewable generation and  storage assets; • A post-tax WACC discount rate of 8.25% (FY23: 7.5%); • Generation volumes for each relevant asset based on  historical and forecast generation and availability including  planned maintenance; and • Terminal growth rate of 2.75% (FY23: 2.5%). The recoverable amount exceeded the carrying value of  the CGU at 31 December 2023. There were no reasonable  possible changes in assumptions that would result in  an impairment. At 30 June 2024, an impairment indicators assessment was  performed for the Flexible Generation CGU to determine if  there were any indicators of impairment since December  2023. The assessment has not identified any internal or  external indicator that the assets within this CGU are  impaired and accordingly, no further recoverable value  assessment was required.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY Borrowings Interest bearing liabilities All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, being the amount received less attributable transaction costs. After  initial recognition, interest bearing liabilities are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value  being recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis. Lease liabilities In contracts where AGL is a lessee, AGL recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the commencement date of the  lease for all leases other than short-term or low-value asset leases. AGL has elected to apply the practical expedients available for short-term leases (i.e. where the lease term is less than 12  months) and low-value asset leases. As a result of application of these practical expedients, the measurement requirements of  accounting standards do not apply and the expense for these leases is recognised on a straight-line basis. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Leases Lease term Where lease arrangements contain options to extend the term or terminate the contract, AGL assesses whether it is ‘reasonably  certain’ that the option to extend or terminate the contract will be made. Consideration is given to the prevalence of other  contractual arrangements and/or the economic circumstances relevant to the lease contract, that may indicate the likelihood of  the option being exercised. Lease liabilities and ROU assets are measured using the reasonably certain contract term.

Movement in onerous contract provision in Note 4 consist of both the change in estimated provision and additional provisions recognised during the period. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY Provisions Employee benefits A liability is recognised for benefits accruing to employees  in respect of wages and salaries, annual leave, long service  leave and sick leave when it is probable that settlement will  be required and they are capable of being measured reliably. Liabilities recognised in respect of short-term employee  benefits are measured at their nominal values using  the remuneration rate expected to apply at the time  of settlement. Liabilities recognised in respect of long-term employee  benefits are measured as the present value of the estimated  future cash outflows to be made by AGL in respect of  services provided by employees up to the end of the  reporting period. Environmental rehabilitation The provision for future rehabilitation costs is the best  estimate of the present value of the expenditure required  to settle the rehabilitation obligation at the end of the  reporting period, based on current legal requirements and  current technology. Future rehabilitation costs are reviewed  periodically and any changes are reflected in the provision at  the end of each reporting period. The initial estimate of the environmental rehabilitation  provision is capitalised into the cost of the related asset  and depreciated/ amortised on the same basis as the  related asset. Changes in the estimate of the provision for  environmental rehabilitation are treated in the same manner,  except that the unwinding of the effect of discounting on the  provision is recognised as a finance cost rather than being  capitalised into the cost of the related asset. Restructuring A restructuring provision is recognised when AGL has  developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and  has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will  carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the  plan or announcing its main features to those affected by  it. Future operating losses are not provided for. Onerous contracts A provision for onerous contracts is measured at the present  value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating  the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with  the contract. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Provision for environmental rehabilitation AGL estimates the future removal and rehabilitation costs of  electricity generation assets, oil and gas production facilities,  wells, pipelines, mine and related assets at the time of  installation of the assets. In most instances, removal of assets will occur many years  into the future. The requirement for rehabilitation is also  subject to community and regulatory expectations which  may evolve over time and in practice, negotiation is required  to arrive at a practical rehabilitation strategy. The calculation  of this provision requires management to make assumptions  regarding the removal date, application of environmental  legislation, the extent of rehabilitation activities required,  and available technologies. The assumptions are highly  judgemental and represents management’s best estimate of  the present value of the expenditure required to settle the  obligation, given known facts and circumstances at a point  in time. For the period ended 30 June 2024, a comprehensive  assessment of the environmental rehabilitation provision  was performed across AGL’s assets. The assessment  performed include determining the nature and timing of  AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 147 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 148 ===== Financial Report Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2024 Provisions (Continued) 19. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS rehabilitation activities to be undertaken for each site  including technical aspects for demolition, remediation and  rehabilitation as well as determining closure tasks and  associated periods, quantities and rates to prepare the  cash flow model, and then discounting the cashflows back  to net present value at 30 June 2024. The assessment  was completed with inputs from third-party subject matter  experts and further externally peer reviewed. At 30 June 2024, the critical judgements and assumptions  included in the estimation of the environmental  rehabilitation provision consist of the following: • Commencement date of rehabilitation activities is  consistent with the announced closure dates of AGL’s  thermal generation assets; • The operating life of wind generation assets is extended by  10 years based on available technical feasibility performed  for similar assets and as a result, the associated  rehabilitation activities are deferred by 10 years until the  end of the extended operating life; • Where AGL intends on repurposing thermal generation  sites as “Energy Hubs”, rehabilitation activities may be  deferred where there is no associated regulatory or legal  requirement to immediately remediate; • During the operating phase of generation assets, costs  that are mandatory for the operation of the assets  are classified as operational costs. Post closure and  where appropriate, these costs are only classified as  rehabilitation costs to the extent that they are unavoidable  during the period where rehabilitation activities are  undertaken and subsequent to completion of remediation  activities, where AGL retains ownership or lease of the  associated site; and • A pre-tax discount rate of 6.86% (FY23: 6.86%). In line with AGL’s accounting policy, the provisions for  environmental rehabilitation are reviewed regularly.  Provision for onerous contracts AGL recognises a number of legacy power purchase  agreements as onerous. Under these legacy power purchase  agreements, AGL makes periodic payments for the electricity  and green certificates generated by these assets. The  agreements were primarily entered between 2006 and 2012  to support the development of the renewables sector at  that time. These offtake agreements were entered at prices  significantly higher than current and forecast prices for  electricity and renewable energy certificates today. Provision for onerous contracts includes the following  key assumptions; • Long-term electricity and renewable energy  certificate prices; • Generation volume; and • A discount rate of 7.7% (FY23: 7.5%). In line with AGL’s accounting policy, the onerous contract  provisions are reviewed on a regular basis.

AGL contributes to superannuation plans that provide defined benefit members a lump sum on retirement, death, disablement and  withdrawal. Some defined benefit members are eligible for pension benefits in some cases. Lump sum benefits are calculated based on  years of service and final average salary. The defined benefit plans are closed to new members. The plans are the Equipsuper Fund (EF), Electricity Industry Superannuation Scheme (EISS), State Superannuation Scheme (SSS), State  Authorities Superannuation Scheme (SASS) and the State Authorities Non-contributory Superannuation Scheme (SANCS). The Superannuation Industry Supervision (SIS) legislation governs the superannuation industry and provides the framework within which  superannuation plans operate. The SIS regulations require an actuarial valuation to be performed for each defined benefit plan every three  years, or every year if the plan pays defined benefit pensions. The plans’ trustees are responsible for the governance of the plans. The trustees have a legal obligation to act solely in the best interests  of plan beneficiaries. The trustees have the following roles: administration of the plans and payment to the beneficiaries from plan  assets when required in accordance with the plan rules; management and investment of the plan assets; and compliance with other  applicable regulations. There are a number of risks to which the plans expose AGL. The most significant risks are investment risk, salary growth risk, inflation risk,  interest rate risk, legislative risk and changes in the life expectancy for members. AGL also contributes to defined contribution superannuation plans for employees, which are also provided by these plans.

Categories of plan assets The major categories of plan assets as a percentage of the fair value of total plan assets at the end of the reporting period are as follows: 2024 EF % EISS % SSS, SASS, and SANCS % Australian equities 16 24 16 International equities 21 28 40 Fixed interest securities 16 16 3 Property 6 9 6 Cash 10 7 7 Alternatives/other 31 16 28 2023 Australian equities 16 24 26 International equities 22 23 38 Fixed interest securities 16 13 4 Property 6 11 2 Cash 7 6 14 Alternatives/other 33 23 16 All plan assets are held within investment funds which do not have a quoted market price in an active market. The fair value of plan assets include no amounts relating to any of AGL’s own financial instruments, or any property occupied by, or other  assets used by AGL. Principal actuarial assumptions The principal actuarial assumptions at the end of the reporting period (expressed as weighted averages) were as follows: 2024 EF % EISS % SSS, SASS, & SANCS % Discount rate active members 5.5 5.6 5.6 Discount rate pensioners 5.5 5.6 - Expected salary increase rate 3.5 3.0 3.8 Expected pension increase rate 2.6 2.7 - 2023 Discount rate active members 5.6 5.6 5.7 Discount rate pensioners 5.6 5.6 - Expected salary increase rate 3.0 3.8 3.2 Expected pension increase rate 2.8 2.9 - AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 161 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 162 ===== Financial Report Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2024 Defined benefit superannuation plans (Continued) 31. Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the  end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant. Defined benefit obligation Increase 2024 $m Decrease 2024 $m Increase 2023 $m Decrease 2023 $m Discount rate (0.5 percentage point movement) (28) 30 (27) 29 Expected salary increase rate (0.5 percentage point movement) 10 (9) 10 (9) Expected pension increase rate (0.5 percentage point movement) 9 (8) 9 (9) The sensitivity analyses presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that  the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated. There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses from prior years. Funding arrangements and employer contributions Employer contributions are determined based on actuarial advice and are set to target the assets of the plans exceeding the total of  members’ vested benefits. Funding levels are reviewed regularly. Where assets are less than vested benefits, a management plan must be  established to restore the coverage to at least 100%. AGL expects to contribute $15 million to the defined benefit plans during the year ending 30 June 2025. The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation as at 30 June 2024 was EF 9 years; EISS 10 years; and SSS, SASS and SANCS  12 years. Defined contribution superannuation plans AGL makes contributions to a number of defined contribution superannuation plans. The amount recognised as an expense for the year  ended 30 June 2024 was $54 million (2023: $46 million). CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Defined benefit superannuation plans Various actuarial assumptions are utilised in the determination of AGL’s defined benefit obligations. AGL uses external actuarial  experts to determine these assumptions. Key accounting assumptions include the discount rate, salary increase rate and  pension increase rate. AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 162  ===== PAGE 163 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2024 Share-based payment plans 32. AGL operates the following share-based payment plans: • The Share Reward Plan; and • The Long-Term Incentive plan. AGL has the following other equity arrangements: • The Share Purchase Plan; and • The Restricted Equity Plan. Share Reward Plan (SRP) The SRP is AGL’s complying broad-based employee share plan that enables eligible employees to be granted up to $1,000 of ordinary shares  in AGL for no consideration each financial year. The SRP is governed by the AGL General Employee Share Plan Rules. The grant of shares  is subject to the achievement of performance metrics and can therefore be scaled down in years where all objectives are not met. Shares  granted pursuant to the SRP are subject to a trading restriction of the earlier of three years or the participant’s cessation of employment. Eligible participants include all AGL employees with at least 12 months service at the eligibility date (generally 1 September following the  financial year end). Participants in the long-term incentive plan are excluded from any SRP grant. Details of share movements in the SRP during the year are set out below: Grant date Balance at 1 July Number Granted during the year Number Fair Value per share $ Released during the year Number Balance at 30 June Number 2024 30 September 2023 - 233,100 10.71 (13,690) 219,410 30 September 2022 298,200 - - (23,940) 274,260 28 September 2021 207,583 - - (14,774) 192,809 28 September 2020 149,385 - - (149,385) - Total Share Reward Plan shares 655,168 233,100 (201,789) 686,479 2023 30 September 2022 - 329,700 $6.58 (31,500) 298,200 30 September 2021 234,973 - - (27,390) 207,583 28 September 2020 167,532 - - (18,147) 149,385 28 September 2019 100,251 - - (100,251) - Total Share Reward Plan shares 502,756 329,700 (177,288) 655,168 The expense recognised in profit or loss, as part of employee benefits expense during the year in relation to the SRP, was $2 million  (2023: $2 million). Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Plan The LTI plan provides for a grant of performance rights to eligible participants subject to AGL’s performance against pre-determined metrics  over a four-year performance period (prior to FY20, a three-year performance period applied). The LTI is governed by the AGL Energy Limited  Share Plan Rules. Participation is determined annually at the discretion of the Board. Generally, performance rights are forfeited on cessation of employment. The Board has discretion with reference to the relevant facts and  circumstances of the cessation to vest all or part of the balance, or to authorise a portion of the award to be retained and assessed post- employment.

Current LTI Plans For the FY24 plan, the performance rights are subject to two performance hurdles, based on: • Relative Total Shareholder Return (Relative TSR) - 70% weighted; and • Carbon Transition metrics - 30% weighted For the FY23 and FY22 plan, the performance rights are subject to two performance hurdles, based on: • Relative TSR- 75% weighted; and • Carbon Transition metrics - 25% weighted For the FY21 plan, the performance rights are subject to three performance hurdles, based on: • Relative TSR - 33.4% weighted; • Return on Equity (ROE) - 33.3% weighted; and • Carbon Transition metrics - 33.3% weighted Relative TSR is calculated by ranking AGL’s TSR on a relative basis against the peer group, being S&P/ASX100 companies. ROE measures the amount of Underlying Profit returned as a percentage of average monthly shareholders' equity. Carbon Transition is calculated through three transition metrics. These metrics are based off emissions intensity, renewable capacity and  green energy and carbon neutral revenue. The performance period for the outstanding LTI plans as at 30 June 2024 are as follows: • FY24: Four years from 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2027 • FY23: Four years from 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2026 • FY22: Four years from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2025 • FY21: Four years from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2024 The number of shares vested are determined by the vesting schedules detailed in the tables below.

Other equity arrangements Share Purchase Plan (SPP) The SPP is AGL’s salary sacrifice plan that enables eligible employees to contribute up to $5,000 per financial year from their ongoing fixed remuneration and/or short-term incentive (STI) award into acquiring ordinary shares in AGL. The SPP is governed under the AGL General  Employee Share Plan Rules. Shares granted pursuant to the SPP are subject to a trading restriction of the earlier of four years (from the start  of the financial year in which they are acquired) or the participant’s cessation of employment. The holding lock is in place to provide for a  deferral of income tax for participants. Eligible participants include all permanent AGL employees. Non-Executive Directors, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, and  members of the executive team are excluded from SPP participation.

There were no material transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year. 2024 Carrying  Amount $m Level 1 $m Level 2 $m Level 3 $m Total $m Financial assets Equity instruments at FVOCI Unlisted equity securities 15 - - 15 15 Unlisted investment funds 11 - - 11 11 Other 3 - - 3 3 Derivative financial instruments Cross currency swap contracts - cash flow and fair value hedges 59 - 59 - 59 Interest rate swap contracts - cash  flow hedges 89 - 89 - 89 Energy derivatives - economic hedges 1,425 383 291 751 1,425 Total financial assets 1,602 383 439 780 1,602 Financial liabilities Derivative financial instruments Cross currency swap contracts - cash flow and fair value hedges (40) - (40) - (40) Interest rate swap contracts - cash  flow hedges (1) - (1) - (1) Forward foreign exchange contracts - cash  flow hedges (2) - (2) - (2) Energy derivatives - economic hedges (1,672) (351) (374) (947) (1,672) Total financial liabilities (1,715) (351) (417) (947) (1,715) AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 172  ===== PAGE 173 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2024 Financial instruments (Continued) 35. 2023 Carrying  Amount $m Level 1 $m Level 2 $m Level 3 $m Total $m Financial assets Equity instruments at FVOCI Unlisted equity securities 8 - - 8 8 Unlisted investment funds 7 - - 7 7 Derivative financial instruments Cross currency swap contracts - cash flow and fair value hedges 55 - 55 - 55 Interest rate swap contracts - cash  flow hedges 114 - 114 - 114 Forward foreign exchange contracts - cash  flow hedges 2 - 2 - 2 Energy derivatives - economic hedges 2,170 1,022 433 715 2,170 Other 5 - - 5 5 Total financial assets 2,361 1,022 604 735 2,361 Financial liabilities Derivative financial instruments Cross currency swap contracts - cash flow and fair value hedges (29) - (29) - (29) Energy derivatives - economic hedges (2,359) (747) (553) (1,059) (2,359) Total financial liabilities (2,388) (747) (582) (1,059) (2,388) Management has assessed that the carrying value of financial assets and financial liabilities to be comparable to fair value. Estimation of fair values The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments: • Receivables/payables with a remaining life of less than six months, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value. All other  receivables/payables are discounted to determine the fair value if the effect of discounting is material. • The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate and cross currency swaps is calculated as the present value of expected  future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates that reflect the credit  risk of various counterparties. • The fair value of borrowings, energy derivatives and deferred consideration is determined as the present value of future contracted cash  flows and credit adjustments. Cash flows are discounted using standard valuation techniques at applicable market yield having regard to  timing of cash flows. • The fair value of lease liabilities is estimated as the present value of future cash flows discounted where the effect of discounting  is material. The following table provides a reconciliation of fair value movements in Level 3 financial instruments. 2024 $m 2023 $m Opening balance (324) (801) Total gains or losses recognised in profit or loss Settlements during the year (194) (579) Changes in fair value 373 842 Transfer from Level 3 to Level 21 - 253 Premiums (23) (40) Purchases 1 1 Closing balance (167) (324) 1.

The total gains or losses for the year included a gain of $373 million relating to energy derivative Level 3 contracts held at the end of the  reporting period (2023: a gain of $842 million). Fair value gains or losses on energy derivatives are included in other expenses in the line item  ‘Gain on fair value of financial instruments’ in Note 4. The sensitivity of Level 3 contracts with significant unobservable inputs, where the inputs are higher by 10 percent is $(191) million and lower  by 10 percent is $191 million (profit after tax (decrease)/increase)). Input changes were applied to forward prices with references to electricity  market and emissions schemes, cost-based indexes, contract volumes and management's assumptions on long-term commodity curves. 35.c Capital risk management AGL’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns  for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an appropriate capital structure of debt and equity. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, AGL may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to  shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. AGL’s overall capital management strategy remains unchanged from 2022. The capital structure of AGL consists of net debt (borrowings offset by cash and cash equivalents) and total equity (comprising issued capital,  reserves and retained earnings). AGL monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio and funds from operations (FFO) to interest expense cover. The gearing ratio is calculated as net debt divided by adjusted total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings, adjusted for cross  currency swap hedges and deferred borrowing costs, less cash and cash equivalents. Adjusted total capital is calculated as total equity less  the hedge reserve plus net debt. The gearing ratio at the end of the reporting period was as follows: 2024 $m 2023 $m Current borrowings 35 47 Non-current borrowings 2,693 2,836 Total borrowings 2,728 2,883 Adjustment for cross currency swap hedges (27) (24) Adjusted total borrowings 2,701 2,859 Cash and cash equivalents (932) (148) Net debt 1,769 2,711 Total equity 5,431 5,119 Hedge reserve (39) (62) Adjusted equity 5,392 5,057 Net debt 1,769 2,711 Adjusted total capital 7,161 7,768 Gearing ratio 24.7% 34.9% 35.d Financial risk management AGL’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk (interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and energy price risk),  credit risk and liquidity risk. AGL’s overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of markets and seeks to manage the  impact of these risks on its financial performance. AGL uses a range of derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the risk management policy and framework. The  Board has established the Audit & Risk Management Committee (the Committee), which is responsible for approving AGL’s risk management  policy and framework for identifying, assessing and managing risk. The Committee is also responsible for reviewing and updating the risk  profile, monitoring the effectiveness of the risk management framework and reviewing at least annually the implementation of the risk  management policy and framework. The Committee reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities. AGL has written policies covering specific areas, such as interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, energy price risk, credit risk, liquidity  risk, and the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments. Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed on a  continuous basis. AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 174  ===== PAGE 175 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2024 Financial instruments (Continued) 35. 35.e Interest rate risk management AGL is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. The risk is managed by maintaining an  appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, and by the use of interest rate swap contracts or other hedging instruments. AGL regularly analyses its interest rate exposure, by taking into consideration forecast debt positions, refinancing, renewals of existing  positions, alternative financing, hedging positions and the mix of fixed and floating interest rates. At the end of the reporting period, AGL had the following financial assets and liabilities exposed to floating interest rate risk: Floating rate instruments 2024 $m 2023 $m Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 932 148 Total financial assets 932 148 Financial liabilities USD senior notes (after effect of cross currency swaps) 1,027 872 Bank loans 853 1,483 Interest rate swap contracts (1,250) (1,450) Total financial liabilities 630 905 Interest rate swap contracts - cash flow hedges The following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding at the end of the  reporting period: Outstanding hedging  instruments cash flow hedge  - receive floating, pay  fixed contracts Average contracted fixed interest rate Notional principal amount Carrying value of outstanding  hedging instruments 2024 % 2023 % 2024 $m 2023 $m 2024 $m 2023 $m Less than 1 year 0.94 1.63 150 400 2 8 1 to 2 years 1.24 0.94 50 150 2 8 2 to 3 years 1.50 1.24 500 50 30 3 3 to 4 years 1.26 1.50 175 500 17 39 4 to 5 years 3.74 1.26 125 175 3 21 5 years or more 2.72 2.74 405 425 30 35 Total 1,405 1,700 84 114 Financial year 2024 $m 2023 $m Aggregate notional amount of variable rate borrowings 1,405 1,700 Aggregate notional principal of the outstanding interest rate swaps 1,405 1,700 Included in this amount: Forward interest rate swap contracts 155 250 Of which: Commences in 2024 - 200 Commences in 2025 50 50 Commences in 2026 - - Commences in 2027 105 - The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly basis. The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is the Australian Bank Bill Swap (BBSW)  reference rate. AGL will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis. During the year, no hedges were  de-designated. All underlying forecast transactions remain highly probable.

Interest rate sensitivity The following sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative  instruments at the end of the reporting period and the stipulated change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held  constant throughout the reporting period. At the end of the reporting period, if interest rates had been 50 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, AGL’s  profit after tax and other comprehensive income would have been affected as follows: Profit/(loss) after tax  increase/(decrease) Other comprehensive income  increase/(decrease) 2024 $m 2023 $m 2024 $m 2023 $m Interest rates +0.5% (50 basis points) 1 (3) 6 3 Interest rates -0.5% (50 basis points) (1) 3 (6) (3) 35.f Foreign currency risk management AGL undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. Foreign  currency risk arises primarily from overseas term borrowings and firm commitments for the purchase of plant and equipment which are  denominated in foreign currencies. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign  exchange contracts and cross currency swap contracts. Forward foreign exchange contracts - cash flow hedges AGL’s Corporate Treasury policy requires the hedging of foreign currency risk using forward foreign exchange contracts. The Corporate  Treasury’s policy is to hedge currency exposures of anticipated cash flows in excess of $3 million and to not enter into forward foreign  exchange contracts until a firm commitment is in place. The forward foreign exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges.  During  the year, no hedges were de-designated and all underlying forecast transactions remain highly probable as per original forecast. There were $167 million of forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of the reporting period (2023: $26 million). The fair  value of those contracts was $2 million liability (2023: $1 million asset). The following tables detail the Forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of the reporting period, as well as information  regarding their related hedged items. Forward foreign exchange contracts assets and liabilities are presented in the line ‘Derivative financial instruments’ (either as assets or as liabilities) within the statement of financial position: Average exchange rate Contract value  (foreign currency) Contract value  (local currency) Carrying value  of outstanding  hedging instruments Cash Flow Hedge -  Outstanding contracts 2024 2023 2024 $m 2023 $m 2024 $m 2023 $m 2024 $m 2023 $m Buy GBP 6 to 12 months 0.52 - 79 - 151 - (2) - Buy Euro 0 to 6 months 0.64 0.64 5 5 8 7 - - 6 to 12 months 0.64 0.66 2 1 3 2 - - 1 to 5 years 0.63 0.64 3 11 5 17 - 1 Cross currency swap contracts Under cross currency swap contracts, AGL has agreed to exchange specified foreign currency loan principal and interest amounts at agreed  future dates at fixed exchange rates. Such contracts enable AGL to eliminate the risk of movements in foreign exchange rates related to  foreign currency denominated borrowings. The fair value of cross currency swaps at 30 June 2024 was an asset of $19 million (2023: asset of $26 million), of which $115 million  (2023: $117 million) is in a cash flow hedge relationship, $(96) million (2023: $(94) million) is in a fair value hedge relationship and $0.3 million  (2023: $3 million) relates to the currency basis of the cross currency swaps. AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 176  ===== PAGE 177 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2024 Financial instruments (Continued) 35.

At the end of the reporting period, if the Australian dollar had weakened or strengthened by 10% against the respective foreign currencies  where all other variables remain constant, AGL’s profit after tax and other comprehensive income would have been affected as follows: Profit/(loss) after tax  increase/(decrease) Other comprehensive income  increase/(decrease) 2024 $m 2023 $m 2024 $m 2023 $m AUD exchange rates +10.0% - - 3 1 AUD exchange rates -10.0% - - (4) (1) 35.g Energy price risk management AGL is exposed to energy price risk associated with the purchase and/or sale of electricity, gas, oil and environmental products. AGL manages  energy risk through an established risk management framework consisting of policies to place appropriate risk limits on overall energy  market exposures and transaction limits for approved energy commodities, requirements for delegations of authority on trading, regular  reporting of exposures and segregation of duties. It is AGL’s policy to actively manage the energy price exposure arising from both forecast energy supply and customer energy load. AGL’s risk  management policy for energy price risk is to hedge forecast future positions for up to five years into the future. Exposures to fluctuations in the wholesale market energy prices are managed through the use of various types of hedge contracts including  derivative financial instruments. Energy derivatives – economic hedges AGL has entered into certain derivative instruments for economic hedging purposes under the Board-approved risk management policies,  which do not satisfy the requirements for hedge accounting under AASB 9 Financial Instruments. These derivatives are therefore required to  be categorised as held for trading and are classified in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as economic hedges. Changes in the  fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in profit or loss as part of (loss)/gain  on fair value of financial instruments. Energy price sensitivity The following table details the sensitivity to a 10 percent increase or decrease in the energy contract market forward prices. A sensitivity of  10 percent has been used as this is considered reasonably possible, based on historical data relating to the level of volatility in market prices. At the end of the reporting period, if the forward prices had been 10 percent higher or lower and all other variables were held constant,  AGL’s profit after tax and other comprehensive income would have been affected as follows: Profit/(loss) after tax  increase/(decrease) Other comprehensive income  increase/(decrease) 2024 $m 2023 $m 2024 $m 2023 $m Energy forward price +10% (204) (115) - - Energy forward price -10% 204 113 - - The movement in profit after tax is mainly attributable to an increase/decrease in the fair value of certain energy derivative instruments  which are not hedge accounted by AGL. The movement in other comprehensive income is due to the reclassification and/or amortisation of  historical hedge accounted derivatives.

AGL’s exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously  monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread among approved counterparties. Trade and other receivables consist of approximately 3.95 million residential, small business and large commercial and industrial services to  customers, in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia. Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the  AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 178  ===== PAGE 179 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2024 Financial instruments (Continued) 35. financial condition of customers and, where appropriate, an allowance for expected credit loss is raised. AGL does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single customer or any group of customers. AGL limits its exposure to credit risk by investing surplus funds and entering into derivative financial instruments only with approved financial institutions that have a credit rating of at least A from Standard & Poor’s and within credit limits assigned to each financial institution.  Derivative counterparties are limited to high creditworthy financial institutions and other organisations in the energy industry. AGL also  utilises International Swaps and Derivative Association (ISDA) agreements with derivative counterparties in order to limit exposure to credit  risk through the netting of amounts receivable from and amounts payable to individual counterparties. At the end of the reporting period, there was a significant concentration of credit risk with certain counterparties in relation to energy  derivatives undertaken in accordance with the AGL’s hedging and risk management activities. The carrying amount of the financial assets  recognised in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the maximum exposure to credit risk. AGL does not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements to cover this credit risk. 35.j Liquidity risk management Liquidity risk is the risk that AGL will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Ultimate responsibility for liquidity  risk management rests with the Board of Directors, who have established an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the  management of AGL’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. AGL manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously  monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. The following table details AGL’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities with agreed repayment periods. The  amounts are based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities on the earliest date on which AGL can be required to pay. The table  includes both interest and principal cash flows.

The classification depends on AGL’s business model for  managing financial assets and the contractual terms of the  cash flows. Equity instruments All of AGL's equity financial instruments are classified as  FVOCI. Dividends from such investments continue to be  recognised in profit or loss as other income when AGL’s  right to receive payments is established. Impairment losses  (and reversal of impairment losses) on equity investments  measured at FVOCI are not reported separately from other  changes in fair value. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Fair value of financial instruments Management uses their judgement in selecting an appropriate valuation technique for financial instruments not quoted in an  active market. For derivative financial instruments, assumptions are made based on quoted market rates adjusted for specific features of the instrument. Other financial instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow analysis based on assumptions  supported, where possible, by observable market prices and rates.

Member of Deloitte Asia Pacific Limited and the Deloitte organisation.                Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of AGL Energy Limited    A    Report on the Audit of the Financial Report    Opinion     We have audited the financial report of AGL Energy Limited (“AGL” or the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”),  which comprises the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2024, the consolidated statement of profit or  loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of  cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information  and other explanatory information, the directors’ declaration and the Consolidated Entity Disclosure Statement.  In our opinion, the accompanying financial report of the Group is in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including:   •  Giving a true and fair view of the Group’s consolidated financial position as at 30 June 2024 and of its financial  performance for the year then ended; and   •  Complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001.    Basis for Opinion    We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are  further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report section of our report. We are  independent of the Group in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and the  ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional & Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional  Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the “Code”) that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia.  We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.   We confirm that the independence declaration required by the Corporations Act 2001, which has been given to the directors  of the Company, would be in the same terms if given to the directors as at the time of this auditor’s report.  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.    Summary of our audit approach    Key Audit Matters  The key audit matters that we have identified in the current year were:  •  Potential financial reporting impacts of climate change related risk;  •  Provision for environmental rehabilitation;  •  Carrying value of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets;  •  Unbilled revenue and accrued distribution costs; and  •  Derivative financial instruments.  Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu  ABN 74 490 121 060  Quay Quarter Tower  50 Bridge Street  Sydney  NSW  2000  Phone: +61 2 9322 7000  www.deloitte.com.au  Independent Auditor’s Report of the Financial Report AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 189 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 190 =====       All key audit matters are consistent with those we identified in the prior year and the developments in  fact patterns of these previously identified key audit matters are explained in the respective sections  below.  Materiality      The materiality that we used for the audit of the Group financial report was $55 million which was  determined based on 4.8% of underlying profit before tax.     Key Audit Matters       Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial  report for the current year and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to  fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the  allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the audit engagement team.   Throughout the course of our audit, we identify risks of material misstatement (“risks”). We consider both the likelihood of a  risk and the potential magnitude of a misstatement in making the assessment. Certain risks are classified as ‘significant’ or  ‘higher’ depending on their severity. The category of the risk determines the level of evidence we seek in providing assurance  that the associated financial statement item is not materially misstated.   The matters described below were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our  opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.     Potential financial reporting impacts of climate change related risk (impacting property, plant and equipment, intangible  assets and provisions) – Note 15, 16 and 19  Key audit matter  description  Climate change related risk is pervasive to AGL’s overall financial position and performance given the  industry in which AGL operates. It represents a strategic challenge and a key focus of management and  the Board of Directors. The related risks that we have assessed for our audit are as follows:  •  Forecast assumptions used in assessing whether the recoverable amounts of property, plant and  equipment and intangible assets exceed the carrying values within AGL’s consolidated statement  of financial position. In particular, that forecast price and volume assumptions and their  interrelationship with forecast emissions costs and energy procurement costs, may not  appropriately reflect actual changes in supply and demand due to the impact of climate change.  The estimation of future energy prices is subject to increased uncertainty given climate change, the  global energy transition, macroeconomic factors and disruption in global supply due to ongoing  geo-political conflicts. There is a risk that management do not forecast reasonable ‘best estimate’  price forecasts or scenarios when assessing cash generating units (“CGUs”) for impairment expense  and/or impairment reversal, leading to material misstatements. These price assumptions are highly  judgmental and are pervasive inputs to AGL’s CGU valuation models, as well as being consistently  applied elsewhere in the financial report to determine the carrying values of onerous contract  provisions and financial instruments (see ‘Derivative financial instruments’ below), where  applicable.   •  AGL announced the revised planned closure dates for Loy Yang Power Station, Bayswater Power  Station and Torrens Island A Station as part of the release of its ‘Climate Transition Action Plan’ and  outlined its intention to develop a decarbonisation pathway to achieve its ambition of being ‘net  zero’ for Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions following the closure of all of AGL’s coal fired  power stations, and for Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.  The useful economic lives of  AGL’s generation assets for the purpose of calculating depreciation expense, preparing discounted  cash flow value in use models and timing of environmental rehabilitation cash flows are consistent  with the announced planned closure dates. The targeted useful lives of electricity generation assets,  oil and gas production facilities, wells, pipelines, mine and related assets may be further shortened  as Australian federal and state governments and society moves towards ‘net zero’ emissions  targets. As a consequence in future periods, the depreciation expense associated with these assets  may be materially increased, a material impairment of property, plant and equipment may be  required and the present value of the provision for environmental rehabilitation may need to be  materially increased due to the potential acceleration of timing of cash outflows relating to site  environmental rehabilitation activities.   Financial Report Independent Auditor’s Report of the Financial Report AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 190  ===== PAGE 191 =====       •  AGL reviews current and future water impacts, risks, and opportunities. These reviews consider the  quantity of water required, any regulatory requirements and the potential for water scarcity due to  climate change. Thermal coal assets use considerable quantities of water and as the likelihood of  droughts increase with rising temperatures, water availability and security become increasing risks.  AGL holds water rights that reduce the impact of these events. In the event that water rights or  supply security changes, a material impairment of property, plant and equipment may be required  and the present value of the provision for environmental rehabilitation may need to be materially  increased if water scarcity were to impact targeted useful lives of electricity generation assets  and/or environmental rehabilitation activities required for those assets.   The above considerations were a significant focus of management during the year which led to this  being a matter that we communicated to the Audit and Risk Management Committee, and which had a  significant effect on the overall audit strategy. We therefore identified this as a key audit matter.  How the scope of  our audit  responded to the  key audit matter      We have considered the areas of AGL’s financial report whereby climate change related risk could have  a financial reporting impact and determined audit procedures to specifically respond to this.  Our  procedures included, amongst others, the following:   In respect of forecast assumptions used by management in assessing the recoverable amount of  property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, in conjunction with our valuation specialists, our  procedures included, but were not limited to:   •  assessing and challenging the key assumptions for forecast price and volume inputs used in the CGU  valuation models, including obtaining an understanding of the process flows and key controls  associated with the valuation models used to estimate the recoverable amount of each CGU and  impairment expense, where applicable;  •  challenging management’s scenario analysis and probability weighting of those scenarios, including  further sensitivity analyses in terms of future energy prices. We compared these assumptions to  historical results and third party economic data and industry forecasts, considering the impact of  climate change related risk, where applicable. In doing this, we obtained third party outlook reports  and information assessing the National Electricity Market and gas market outlook, which included  information related to energy pricing, emissions costs, procurement costs, supply, demand,  government policy and targeted thermal coal power station closure dates. This included the  Australian Energy Market Operator’s 2024 Integrated System Plan and other third party National  Electricity Market outlook reports as well as the ACCC Gas inquiry June 2024 interim report; and  •  assessing management’s historical forecasting accuracy through retrospective analysis by  comparing to actual results and whether the estimates had been determined and applied on a  consistent basis.  In respect of the targeted useful lives adopted by management, our procedures included, but were not  limited to:  •  assessing and determining whether the planned closure dates of AGL’s thermal coal power stations  has been appropriately reflected in the value in use discounted cash flow modelling, as well as the  calculation of depreciation expense; and  •  assessing and challenging management’s assertion at 30 June 2024 that no further changes were  required to useful lives of thermal coal power stations as a consequence of the potential impact of  climate change related risk. We compared the assertions to third party outlook reports and  information evaluating the National Electricity Market which included expected thermal coal power  station closure dates.   In respect of assumptions of water availability and cost adopted by management, our procedures  included, but were not limited to:  •  assessing and challenging water rights and security of supply where changes would impact the  recoverability of thermal coal generation assets and associated provision for environmental  rehabilitation by comparing to regulatory requirements and third party agreements.   We read the other information included in the Annual Report and considered (a) whether there was  any material inconsistency between the other information and the financial statements; or (b) whether  Independent Auditor’s Report of the Financial Report AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 191 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 192 =====       there was any material inconsistency between the other information and our understanding of the  business based on audit evidence obtained and conclusions reached in the audit.  Provision for environmental rehabilitation – Note 19  Key audit matter  description  As disclosed in Note 19, AGL has recognised a provision for environmental rehabilitation of $1,565  million (FY23: $1,402 million) in respect of the future removal and rehabilitation costs of electricity  generation assets (including the coal mine associated with Loy Yang Power Station), oil and gas  production facilities, wells, pipelines and related assets. In most instances, removal of these assets and  remediation of the associated sites will occur many years into the future.   The estimation of provision for environmental rehabilitation is a highly judgemental area as it involves  several key estimates including:  •  Forecasting future costs which are impacted by:  o  the extent of environmental rehabilitation activities required;  o  available technologies;  o  application of environmental legislation and ongoing communication with regulatory bodies;   o  mining licenses and ownership agreements; and  o  quantity and rate estimation for environmental rehabilitation activities, including the  assessment of applicable contingencies.   •  Assumptions in relation to classifying costs as operational rather than progressive environmental  rehabilitation;  •  Timing of future cash outflows which is impacted by the targeted useful lives of the existing assets,  renewable asset re-energisation assumptions and closure dates as announced to the market; and  •  Inflation and discount rate assumptions.  AGL has set out its plans to convert existing coal fired power generation sites into low carbon industrial  ‘Energy Hubs’, to bring together renewable energy production and storage with energy-intensive  industries. To the extent that this results in environmental rehabilitation activities being deferred  (where, for example, there is no regulatory requirement to immediately remediate the site post closure  of the thermal coal generation), this assumed deferral can have a material impact on the net present  value of the environmental rehabilitation provision.  Significant judgement is also required in estimating the quantum of ongoing costs associated with sites  once remediation activities have been completed, for items such as site security and monitoring whilst  this responsibility remains with AGL as the land owner or lessee. In most cases these costs will be  incurred several decades into the future which increases the level of judgement associated with  estimating the liability.  In the current year, AGL has engaged third party experts to assist with assessing the environmental  rehabilitation requirements and expected quantum and timing of costs in respect of remediation across  each of AGL’s generation sites. These estimates have been used as the basis by management to  determine the environmental rehabilitation provision at 30 June 2024, and the key assumptions  associated with the determination of the provision have been disclosed in Note 19.  AGL used a discount rate of 6.86% in calculating the provision for environmental rehabilitation as at 30  June 2024.  How the scope of  our audit  responded to the  key audit matter      Our procedures included, but were not limited to:  •  obtaining an understanding of the process flows and key controls management has in place to  determine the estimate of the provision for environmental rehabilitation;  •  assessing the competence, capability and objectivity of management’s third party expert;  •  in conjunction with our internal rehabilitation specialists:  o  evaluating AGL’s closure and rehabilitation plans with regard to applicable regulatory and  legislative requirements;  Financial Report Independent Auditor’s Report of the Financial Report AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 192  ===== PAGE 193 =====       o  understanding and evaluating the methodology used by the third party expert against industry  practice;   o  assessing the reasonableness of the assumptions and technical solutions used to inform the  cash flow estimates against industry practice;   o  understanding the relevant data sources of the forecast cash flows including use of estimates  from third party experts, by:  ▪  assessing and challenging quantity and rate estimation in respect of environmental  rehabilitation activities, including applicable contingencies, for evidence of supporting  and/or contradictory evidence, with reference to internal AGL and appropriate third party  data;  ▪  where relevant, agreeing cash flow estimates to contractual arrangements for  environmental rehabilitation activities; and  o  assessing the completeness of environmental rehabilitation activities required based on the  rehabilitation plan and relevant legislation, including ensuring all electricity generation assets,  oil and gas production facilities, wells, pipelines, mine and related assets were considered in  the estimation of the provision for environmental rehabilitation.   •  evaluating AGL’s assessment of significant changes in future cost estimates from the prior year,  with a focus on the impact of the timing and quantum of expenditure required;    •  assessing and challenging the classification of costs as operational rather than progressive  rehabilitation considering operational plans and through inquiry of operational personnel and  management’s third party experts;  •  assessing and challenging renewable asset re-energisation and other cost deferral assumptions in  comparison to operational plans and global market practice;  •  comparing forecast timing of environmental rehabilitation cash flows to targeted closure dates of  relevant assets as announced to the market and industry practice and cross checking alignment  with targeted closure dates in other areas, including testing property, plant and equipment and  intangible assets for impairment;   •  understanding and challenging discount rates and inflation rates applied to the forecast cash flows  against relevant market data; and  •  verifying the accuracy of the calculation of the rehabilitation provision.  We have also assessed the appropriateness of the disclosure included in Note 19.  Carrying value of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets – Note 15 and 16  Key audit matter  description  As disclosed in Note 15 and 16, property, plant and equipment totaling $5,717 million and intangible  assets totaling $3,100 million, including goodwill of $2,446 million, are included in the consolidated  statement of financial position at 30 June 2024.  Where a CGU contains goodwill, management conducts annual impairment tests (or more frequently if  impairment indicators exist) to assess the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and  intangible assets. This assessment is performed through the preparation of discounted cash flow value- in-use models.  The annual impairment assessment for the year ended 30 June 2024 was carried out at  31 December 2023 which resulted in no impairment expense being recognised, and management has  considered whether indicators of impairment are present at 30 June 2024 and concluded that there are  none. The evaluation of the recoverable amount requires significant judgement by management in  determining the key assumptions supporting the forecast cash flows of each CGU.   Given the long timeframes involved, certain CGU impairment assessments are sensitive to the discount  rates applied to the forecast cash flows. Discount rates should reflect the return required by the market  and the risks inherent in the cash flows being discounted. There is a risk that management does not  assume reasonable discount rates, adjusted as applicable to the asset specific risks inherent in each  CGU, leading to material misstatements. Determining a reasonable discount rate is highly judgmental,  and is a pervasive input across AGL’s CGU recoverable amount assessments. Management has revised  AGL’s discount rate assumptions for value-in-use impairment tests in the current year to reflect current  macro-economic and market conditions and as disclosed in Note 15 and 16 to the financial statements  a discount rate of 9.5% has been applied to the Generation Fleet CGU (which predominantly includes  Independent Auditor’s Report of the Financial Report AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 193 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 194 =====       ageing thermal coal electricity generation assets) and a discount rate of 8.25% has been applied to all  other CGUs.  AGL’s electricity and gas pricing assumptions have a significant impact on all of the CGU impairment  assessments, and are inherently uncertain given the volatility in energy markets and impact of the  energy transition on supply and demand.  There is a risk that management do not forecast reasonable  ‘best estimate’ price forecasts or scenarios when assessing CGUs for impairment expense and/or  impairment reversal, leading to material misstatements (see ‘Potential financial reporting impacts of  climate change related risk’ above).  Management has used a finite life discounted cash flow value in use model for the Generation Fleet  CGU as the related electricity generation assets have finite lives and targeted closure dates. There is a  risk that the targeted closure dates in the finite life models are not appropriate (see ‘Potential financial  reporting impacts of climate change related risks’ above). For the Wholesale Gas CGU management has  used a combination of finite life and terminal value probability weighted scenarios to reflect the ongoing  uncertainty over the future of gas markets in Australia, and for the Flexible Generation and Customer  Markets CGUs, terminal value discounted cash flow models have been used to determine the  recoverable amounts of the individual CGUs. Terminal value models assume a level of business  continuity of operations and there is a risk that future changes in the entity’s operation or strategy in  response to society or macroeconomic factors results in terminal value models no longer being  appropriate.  As disclosed in Note 15 and Note 16 to the financial statements, based on the impairment assessment  carried out at 31 December 2023, management has determined the following reasonably possible  changes of assumptions that could lead to further impairment or reversal of impairment of CGUs:  •  Generation Fleet CGU – electricity pool price and generation volumes  •  Wholesale Gas CGU – forecast gas margin  •  Customer Markets CGU – no reasonably possible changes  •  Flexible Generation Fleet CGU – no reasonably possible changes  There is a risk that not all reasonably possible changes in assumptions for impairment expense and/or  impairment reversal are disclosed.  Assessments of the carrying values of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets remain a key  audit matter because recoverable amounts and determination of impairment expense and/or  impairment reversal are reliant on forecasts that are inherently judgmental and complex for  management to estimate, and the magnitude of the potential misstatement risk is material to AGL.  How the scope of  our audit  responded to the  key audit matter      Our procedures included, but were not limited to:  •  obtaining an understanding of the process flows and key controls associated with the valuation  models, prepared by management and approved by the AGL Board, used to estimate the  recoverable amount of each CGU and impairment expense or impairment reversal, where  applicable;  •  evaluating management’s methodologies and their documented basis for key assumptions utilised  in the discounted cash flow valuation models, which are disclosed in Note 16 to the financial  statements;  •  in conjunction with our valuation specialists, assessing and challenging:  o  the identification of each CGU;  o  the use of finite life or terminal value, value in use models for each CGU;  o  the identification and allocation of cash flows for the purposes of assessing the recoverable  amount of each CGU;  o  the key assumptions for forecasting energy prices and demand used in the forecast cash flows  (see ‘Potential financial reporting impact of climate change related risk’ above); and   Financial Report Independent Auditor’s Report of the Financial Report AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 194  ===== PAGE 195 =====       o  the discount rate applied by comparing to our independent estimate, third party evidence and  broker consensus data taking into account whether asset specific risks of each CGU were  reasonably reflected by management.  •  comparing the term of forecast cash flows included in the valuation models to the targeted closure  dates of thermal coal power stations as announced to the market;  •  checking the mechanics and mathematical accuracy of the cash flow models;  •  agreeing forecast cash flows including capital expenditure to the latest forecasts approved by the  AGL Board;  •  assessing management’s historical forecasting accuracy through retrospective analysis by  comparing to actual results and whether the estimates had been determined and applied on a  consistent basis;  •  challenging the scenarios and probability weighting of those scenarios, including further sensitivity  analyses in terms of future energy prices and the discount rate applied; and   •  assessing and challenging the consideration by management of reasonably possible changes in key  assumptions that would be required for each CGU to be impaired and/or impairment reversal and  considering the likelihood of such movement in those key assumptions arising.   We have also assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures included in Note 15 and Note 16 to the  financial statements.  Unbilled revenue and accrued distribution costs – Note 2, 9 and 17  Key audit matter  description  Unbilled revenue of $869 million, as disclosed in Note 9 to the financial statements, represents the  estimated value of electricity and gas supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading  and 30 June 2024 where no invoice has been issued to the customer at the end of the reporting period.   Accrued distribution costs of $473 million, as disclosed in Note 17 to the financial statements,  represents the estimated distribution costs related to energy consumption between the date of the last  invoice from the distributor and 30 June 2024.  Significant management judgment is required in the calculation of unbilled revenue and accrued  distribution costs, including estimation of allowance for expected credit losses. Management exercise  this judgement in the calculation of:   •  consumption profile for electricity and gas retail portfolios;  •  pricing applicable to customers between the last invoice date and the end of the reporting period;  and  •  application of consumption profiles of portfolios against relevant published distribution tariff rates.  There is a risk that any of the above assumptions individually or in combination are not appropriate,  leading to material misstatements.  How the scope of  our audit  responded to the  key audit matter      Our procedures included, but were not limited to:  •  obtaining an understanding of the process flows and key controls management has in place to  determine the estimate of unbilled revenue, related allowance for expected credit losses and  accrued distribution costs;   •  understanding and challenging management’s assumptions relating to volume, customer pricing  and distribution tariff rates used in determining unbilled revenue and accrued distribution costs by:  o  on a sample basis, agreeing data underlying the calculation of the estimated volume to  supporting systems, having performed testing of the key controls in those systems;  o  comparing the prices applied to customer consumption with historical and current data; and  o  comparing the distribution tariff rates applied to relevant published distribution tariff rates.  •  assessing and challenging the allowance for expected credit loss estimates applied to unbilled  revenue by:  Independent Auditor’s Report of the Financial Report AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 195 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 196 =====       o  evaluating management’s forward-looking macroeconomic assumptions and scenario  weightings;  o  testing the completeness and accuracy of critical data elements used in the expected credit  loss models; and  o  testing the recoverability of debtors through subsequent cash collection analysis.  •  in conjunction with our data analytics specialists:  o  calculating an independent estimate of the expected unbilled revenue at 30 June 2024 using  historical customer consumption, purchase volumes and pricing data, and comparing this to  the reported unbilled revenue; and  o  calculating an independent estimate of the expected accrued distribution costs at 30 June 2024  utilising information supplied by distributors and tariff data and comparing this to the reported  accrued distribution costs.  We have also assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in Note 2, Note 9 and Note 17 to the  financial statements.  Derivative financial instruments – Note 11, 20 and 35  Key audit matter  description  AGL enters into various financial instruments including derivative financial instruments, which are  recorded at fair value, to economically hedge the Group’s exposure to variability in interest rates,  foreign exchange movements and energy prices. These derivative financial instruments include long  term energy purchase and supply contracts which in some cases have significant contractual volumes  and/or pricing linked to commodity prices.  Where these contracts are economic hedges, such as in the case of power purchase and power sale  agreements, hedge accounting is not applied and therefore can result in significant unrealised gains and  losses arising in the consolidated statement of profit or loss on account of the fair value movements in  the associated derivative assets and liabilities.  At 30 June 2024, derivative financial assets totaled $1,573 million (current assets of $949 million and  non-current assets of $624 million), as disclosed in Note 11 to the financial statements, and derivative  financial liabilities totaled $1,715 million (current liabilities of $1,228 million and non-current liabilities  of $487 million), as disclosed in Note 20 to the financial statements.  For level 1 derivatives AGL has adopted a ‘market approach’ and a ‘discounted cash flow’ approach for  level 2 and treasury derivatives, applying observable market inputs in the valuations. For level 3 energy  derivative valuations, AGL has adopted a ‘discounted cash flow’ approach, applying inputs, assumptions  and considerations which a market participant would consider when pricing similar contracts under  current market conditions.   Significant judgement is required by management in the valuation of and accounting for these derivative  financial instruments including:  •  understanding and applying contract terms;   •  forecasting of energy prices in the short and long term;   •  forecasting of emissions trading outcomes and prices; and   •  applying appropriate discount rates.   Determining the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities can be complex and subjective, particularly  where the valuation is dependent on significant inputs which are not observable and are classified as  level 3 in the fair value hierarchy set out in AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement (“AASB 13”). This degree  of subjectivity also makes such fair value estimates liable to potential fraud by management  incorporating bias in the inputs used in determining fair values. Given the significant judgements,  sensitivity to management assumptions, and the absolute value associated with these positions, we  have identified a significant risk in respect of certain financial instruments where the valuation is  dependent on significant unobservable inputs.  Financial Report Independent Auditor’s Report of the Financial Report AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 196  ===== PAGE 197 =====       How the scope of  our audit  responded to the  key audit mater      Our procedures included, but were not limited to:   •  obtaining an understanding of the internal risk management process and the systems and key  controls associated with the origination and maintenance of complete and accurate information  relating to contracts containing derivative financial instruments, and the valuation of derivative  financial instruments;   •  obtaining an understanding of the relevant contract terms in derivative financial instruments to  assess the appropriateness of the relevant accounting applied; and  •  in conjunction with our treasury and capital markets specialists, testing on a sample basis the  valuation of derivative financial instruments including:  o  assessing hedge documentation and effectiveness where appropriate;  o  evaluating the integrity of the valuation models; and   o  assessing the incorporation of the contract terms and the key assumptions into the valuation  models, including emissions trading outcomes, future energy prices (see ‘Potential financial  reporting impact of climate change related risk’ above), future energy demand used in the  forecast cash flows, and discount rates by comparing to market data.  We have also assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures included in Note 11, Note 20 and Note 35  to the financial statements.    Materiality    We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic  decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be change or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope  of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our audit work.  Based on our professional judgment, we determined materiality, performance materiality and the error reporting threshold  for the financial statements as a whole as follows:    Materiality  The materiality that we used for the FY24 group financial statements was $55 million.  Basis for  determining  materiality      Consistent with the prior year we concluded that it is appropriate to use underlying profit before tax as  a materiality benchmark.  FY24 materiality was determined to be $55 million, which is 5.5% of statutory profit before tax and 4.8%  of underlying profit before tax.  Rationale for the  benchmark  applied  We conducted an assessment of which line items are the most important to investors and analysts by  reading analyst reports and AGL's communications to shareholders and lenders, as well as the  communications of peer companies.  Profit before tax is the benchmark ordinarily considered by us when auditing listed entities. It provides  comparability against companies across all sectors but has limitations when auditing companies whose  earnings are strongly correlated to energy prices, which can be volatile from one year to the next, and  therefore may not be representative of the volume of transactions and the overall size of the business  in the year.  This resulted in us selecting underlying profit before tax as the most appropriate benchmark for our  audit of AGL. We further note that the non-IFRS measure underlying profit before tax is one of the key  metrics communicated by management in AGL's results announcements and therefore is considered to  be an appropriate benchmark.  Performance  materiality  We set performance materiality at a level lower than materiality to reduce the probability that, in  aggregate, uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceed the materiality for the financial  statements as a whole.  Independent Auditor’s Report of the Financial Report AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 197 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 198 =====       Performance materiality was set at $44 million which is 80% of materiality for the FY24 audit.  Basis and rationale  for determining  performance  materiality  Consistent with the prior year, performance materiality of 80% reflects the overall quality of the  control environment, the magnitude of misstatements identified in the current and prior years, as well  as the fact that management is generally willing to correct any such misstatements.  Error reporting  threshold  We agreed with the Audit & Risk Management Committee that we would report all differences to the  Audit & Risk Management Committee in excess of $2.75 million, as well as differences below that  threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit &  Risk Management Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall  presentation of the financial statements.    Other Information     The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the  Group’s annual report for the year ended 30 June 2024 but does not include the financial report and our auditor’s report  thereon.   Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance  conclusion thereon.   In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider  whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or  otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material  misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.    Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Report    The directors of the Company are responsible:  • For the preparation of the financial report in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including giving a true and fair  view of the financial position and performance of the Group in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards; and   • For such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report in  accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including giving a true and fair view of the financial position and performance  of the Group, and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.   In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group to continue as a going  concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the  directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.     Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report     Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance  is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards  will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered  material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users  taken on the basis of this financial report.  As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and maintain  professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:    • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and  perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide  a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one  resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of  internal control.   Financial Report Independent Auditor’s Report of the Financial Report AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 198  ===== PAGE 199 =====       • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate  in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.   • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related  disclosures made by the directors.   • Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit  evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on  the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to  draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate,  to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.   • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and whether the  financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.   • Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within  the Group to express an opinion on the financial report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance  of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.  We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant  audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.   We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding  independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on  our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.   From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit  of the financial report of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s  report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we  determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would  reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.    Report on the Remuneration Report    Opinion on the Remuneration Report     We have audited the Remuneration Report included in pages 90 to 111 of the Directors’ Report for the year ended 30 June  2024.  In our opinion, the Remuneration Report of AGL Energy Limited, for the year ended 30 June 2024 complies with section 300A  of the Corporations Act 2001.

Reporting Criteria    AGL’s definitions and approaches as described in the “Glossary for the Business Value Drivers and Climate  Related Disclosures'' section of 2024 Annual Report on pages 206-210 respectively.    Basis for Conclusion  We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with Australian Standards on Assurance Engagements ASAE 3000  Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (‘ASAE 3000’) and ASAE 3410 Assurance  Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements (“ASAE 3410”), issued by the Australian Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.   We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.  Responsibilities of management of AGL  The Management of AGL are responsible for:   •  Selecting and applying appropriate reporting criteria;  •  Ensuring that the Subject Matter Information is properly prepared in accordance with the Reporting Criteria;   •  Confirming the measurement or evaluation of the underlying Subject Matter Information against the applicable criteria,  including that all relevant matters are reflected in the Subject Matter Information;  •  Designing, establishing and maintaining internal controls to ensure that the Subject Matter Information is properly  prepared in accordance with the Reporting Criteria; and  •  Maintaining adequate records and making estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.    Our Independence and Quality Control  We have complied with the independence and relevant ethical requirements which are founded on fundamental principles of  integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour, including those contained  in APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards).  Our firm applies Australian Auditing Standard ASQM 1 Quality Management for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial  Reports and Other Financial Information, or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements, which requires the firm to design,  implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical  requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.   Assurance Practitioner’s responsibilities   Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the AGL’s Subject Matter Information as evaluated against the  Reporting Criteria based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained. ASAE 3000 and ASAE 3410  requires that we plan and perform our procedures to obtain limited assurance about whether anything has come to our attention  that causes us to believe that the Subject Matter Information is not properly prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with  the Reporting Criteria.   A limited assurance engagement in accordance with ASAE 3000 and ASAE 3410 involves identifying areas where a material  misstatement of the Subject Matter Information is likely to arise, addressing the areas identified and considering the process used  to prepare the Subject Matter Information.  A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable  assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the  procedures performed in response to the assessed risks.  The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a  reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is  substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.   Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the Subject Matter Information has been properly  prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.   Based on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that  the Subject Matter Information is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria for the year  ended 30 June 2024.  Independent Auditor’s Report on Business Value Drivers AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 201 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 202 =====       Our procedures included:  •  Interviews with a selection of AGL executives and senior management, including AGL’s sustainability management team,  concerning the overall governance structure, corporate sustainability strategy and policies used for managing and reporting  sustainability performance across the business; and  •  In respect of the FY24 selected Annual KPI scorecard disclosures and selected Climate Transition Action Plan (“CTAP”) and  Metrics disclosures:   o  interviews with a selection of AGL management responsible for selected FY24 Annual KPI scorecard disclosures and  selected CTAP and Metrics disclosures to understand the compilation and review processes;  o  applying analytical and other review procedures including assessing relationships between the reported information and  other financial and non-financial data;  o  examination of evidence for a small number of transactions or events;  o  analysing and inspecting on a sample basis, the key systems, processes and procedures and controls relating to the  collation, validation, presentation and approval process of the information included in the 2024 Annual Report;  o  reviewing underlying evidence on a sample basis to corroborate that the information is prepared and reported in line with  the relevant reporting criteria; and  o  reviewing disclosures provided in AGL’s annual report to test that the information disclosed is consistent with the  supporting evidence.  Inherent limitations  Because of the inherent limitations of an assurance engagement, together with the inherent limitations of any system of internal  control there is an unavoidable risk that it is possible that fraud, error, or non-compliance with laws and regulations, where there  has been concealment through collusion, forgery and other illegal acts may occur and not be detected, even though the  engagement is properly planned and performed in accordance with Standards on Assurance Engagements.   Emissions quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because incomplete scientific knowledge has been used to determine  emissions factors and the values needed to combine emissions due to different gases.  Additionally, non-financial data may be subject to more inherent limitations than financial data, given both its nature and the  methods used for determining, calculating, and sampling or estimating such data.  Restricted Use  The Reporting Criteria used for this engagement was designed for the specific purpose of assisting management in their reporting  of the Subject Matter Information in the 2024 Annual Report, as a result the Subject Matter Information may not be suitable for  another purpose.  This report has been prepared for use by the management of AGL Energy Limited for the purpose of reporting the Subject Matter  Information in the 2024 Annual Report. We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this report to any person  other than the management of AGL Energy Limited or for any purpose other than that for which it was prepared.   Matters relating to electronic presentation of information   It is our understanding that AGL may publish a copy of our report on their website. We do not accept responsibility for the electronic  presentation of our report on the AGL website. The security and controls over information on the web site is not evaluated or  addressed by the independent auditor. The examination of the controls over the electronic presentation of this Report on the AGL  website is beyond the scope of this engagement.

AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 208  ===== PAGE 209 ===== Glossary for the Business Value Drivers and Climate Related Disclosures Term Explanation Pool generation volume Pool generation volume refers to electricity that AGL generates that is sold into the National Electricity Market  and the Western Australian Wholesale Energy Market (together termed “the pool”) and considers marginal loss  factors, non-scheduled generation and auxiliary usage. Reduction in operated  Scope 1 & 2 emissions  compared to FY19  baseline (%) AGL's FY19 Scope 1 and 2 emissions baseline is 43.2 MtCO2 and comprises Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas  emissions for all facilities operated1 by AGL, as reported under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting  Act 2007. FY19 was selected as the baseline year as it provides a better reflection of representative historical  output from thermal assets compared to FY20-FY22. Reportable  privacy incidents Data comprises ‘eligible data breaches’ as defined in the Privacy Act 1988. An eligible data breach arises  when there is unauthorised access, disclosure, or loss of personal information and AGL has not been able to  prevent the likely risk of serious harm with remedial action. RepTrak score The RepTrak score reflects the most recent score reported to AGL by RepTrak at the time of publication of the  Annual Report. FY20 to FY24 scores reflect the score for the June quarter. Scope 1  emissions (MtCO2e) Scope 1 emissions are the direct release of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions into the atmosphere as the  result of AGL's direct operations. Estimates are prepared in accordance with the National Greenhouse and  Energy Reporting Act 2007, using emissions factors from the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting  (Measurement) Determination 2008 (NGER MD). Scope 2  emissions (MtCO2e) Scope 2 emissions are indirect greenhouse gas emissions arising from AGL's consumption of purchased  electricity, heat or steam.  • Location-based: Calculated and defined as per sections 7.2 and 7.3 of the NGER MD.  • Market-based: Calculated and defined as per section 7.4 of the NGER MD. Unless otherwise stated, all references to Scope 2 emissions have been calculated using the location-based  methodology, as defined above. Scope 3  emissions (MtCO2e) Scope 3 emissions are other indirect greenhouse gas emissions, emitted as a consequence of AGL's  operations, by where the sources are owned, controlled or contracted by another organisation. This includes  but is not limited to the extraction and production of purchased materials and fuels, transport-related  activities in vehicles not owned or controlled by AGL, electricity-related activities (including transportation and  distribution losses) not covered in Scope 2, outsourced activities and waste disposal. Annual Scope 3 emissions are estimated, and the calculation methods continue to evolve each year to  improve accuracy. Calculation method changes have not been retrospectively applied.  SIF  Actual (Environment) A Serious Impact or Fatality (SIF) Actual (Environment) event results from a sudden, immediate threat impact  to human health or the natural environment, arising from an unauthorised activity or the release of pollutants  into the air, land, or water. A SIF Actual (Environment) event generally has an actual consequence that  corresponds to the prescribed definitions of FIRM Consequence level 4 or higher (this is likely to be driven by  the Environment consequence ranking). Strategic Net Promoter  Score (NPS) NPS is a measure of overall brand performance and is based on how likely a customer would be  to  recommend AGL as an energy provider. AGL’s NPS is measured quarterly via an external survey that  asks customers across all energy retailers “On a scale of 0-10, how likely is it that you would recommend  Retailer X to a friend or colleague?” The NPS is calculated by subtracting the proportion of responses of zeros  to sixes from the proportion of responses of nines and tens. The performance measure relates to the NPS  measured  in Q4 of the reporting year. Total average debt  across mass market  customer portfolio The average energy debt represents the outstanding debt at the customer (rather than account) level as  of 30 June in the relevant reporting year. Debt levels include GST. Data excludes ‘unknown customers’ and  commercial and industrial customers. From FY23 onwards this does not include clearing restricted debt  (where bill has been issued but invoice has not been presented to customers). Total grid-scale  batteries operated,  contracted or  in delivery This represents the capacity of batteries within AGL's operated and contracted boundary as at 30 June in the  reporting year.2 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2024 209 Overview Directors’ Report Financial Report Other Information  ===== PAGE 210 ===== Other Information Glossary for the Business Value Drivers and Climate Related Disclosures Term Explanation Total Injury Frequency  Rate (TIFR) (employees) The rate is calculated as number of lost time and medical treatment injuries classified as TIFR related in a  12-month rolling period, per million hours worked by employees in that 12-month period.

Patricia McKenzie Chair Damien Nicks Managing Director & CEO Dear Shareholders, We're pleased to provide you with AGL’s Annual Report for FY23. It’s been a year of significant transformation in which we reset market and stakeholder confidence and progressed our strategy to connect our customers to a sustainable future and transition our energy portfolio. Despite challenging market conditions and heightened volatility, our improved FY23 results reflect the strength of the underlying business: our low-cost generation portfolio, large and loyal customer base and effective risk management processes. We’re acutely aware of the broad cost of living pressures affecting our customers, including higher energy prices. In June, AGL committed to increasing customer support funding to at least $70 million over the next two years to support our customers to manage cost of living pressures. This year we’ve made good progress with delivering on our strategy and Climate Transition Action Plan, which was endorsed by shareholders at our Annual General Meeting in November 2022. Our strategy includes transitioning our energy portfolio by exiting coal up to 10 years earlier than previously planned and an ambition to add ~12 GW of new renewable generation and firming capacity by the end of 2035.  Following the closure of our coal-fired generation assets, AGL will be net zero for operated Scope 1 and 2 emissions with an ambition to be net zero for all emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) by 2050. This plan represents a major step forward in Australia’s decarbonisation journey and supports the transition to a lower carbon world aligned with the Paris Agreement goals. AGL’s strategy is backed by our refreshed purpose, “Powering Australian Life”, and three new values: Bring on tomorrow; Can do. Will do; and Be Safe. Be Supportive. Our purpose reflects the critical role we play in enabling the everyday lives of our customers and millions of Australians. Our values, which our people helped create, will guide the decisions we need to make as we transition our business to a lower carbon future. We've achieved several important milestones this year, most significantly the safe and respectful closure of the Liddell Power Station after almost 52 years of operation. This is expected to result in a reduction of eight million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions annually from FY24, compared to when the power station was operating. Importantly, we maintained our commitment to no forced redundancies and transferred around one hundred Liddell employees to our Bayswater Power Station. We’re focused on achieving our near term ~5 GW target of new renewables and firming capacity by 2030 and we’ve increased our pipeline by 60 percent from 3.2 GW to 5.3 GW. Our pipeline includes renewables such as solar and wind, as well as firming assets including batteries and pumped hydro.  Commissioning has commenced on the 250 MW Torrens Island Battery and later this year, the 50 MW Broken Hill Battery is also expected to start operating. We’ve also signed a 15-year agreement with Tilt Renewables for the offtake of 45 percent of the energy from the Rye Park Wind Farm in New South Wales, the equivalent of 178 MW.    ===== PAGE 5 ===== Letter from the Chair and MD & CEO AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 3 Central to the delivery of our strategy is connecting our customers to a sustainable future through products and services that make it easy for them to decarbonise the way they live, move and work. Our new partnership with bp pulse will let customers charge their electric vehicle at an affordable rate when they are at home or on the road. We’ve also launched a new pilot program, Electrify Now, where customers can access the information and tools they need to make informed decisions about electrifying their homes. In the Commercial and Industrial space, we’re a leader in helping our customers achieve their sustainability goals and lower their energy costs through innovative solutions, such as solar systems, batteries and microgrids. Business performance After a challenging first half due to a combination of volatile energy market conditions and outages, including the prolonged outage of Loy Yang Unit 2, we saw a strong improvement in the availability of our generation assets in the second half which lifted overall performance and earnings. The investment to improve flexibility at Bayswater Power Station and AGL Loy Yang has also led to improvements in the efficiency of the operation of these assets. On the customer side, we’ve seen continued organic growth in customer services across both energy and telecommunications during a period of heightened market competition. We finished the year with an increase of 56,000 customer services from FY22, with a total of 4.3 million customer services. We’ve also maintained strong customer advocacy throughout the year with a positive strategic Net Promoter Score of +5. The significant improvement in the performance of our generation assets in the second half, combined with the strong performance of our gas portfolio and customer business, has contributed to an increase in earnings compared with FY22.  This is reflected in our improved FY23 result with Underlying EBITDA of $1,361 million, up on FY22 by 12% and an Underlying Profit after tax of $281 million, up on FY22 by 25%. This result was in accordance with our FY23 earnings guidance, which was updated in June 2023. The final FY23 dividend is 23 cents per share (unfranked) and the total dividend for FY23 is 31 cents per share (unfranked). We’ve updated our dividend policy, which will target a payout ratio of 50 to 75 percent of Underlying Profit after tax (previous ratio was 75 percent of Underlying Profit after tax). This will be effective from the FY24 interim dividend. Our revised dividend policy enables us to strengthen the core business and execute our strategy, while providing strong returns to shareholders. In June, we announced an expected positive financial outlook for the year ahead with an increase in FY24 earnings guidance reflecting sustained periods of higher wholesale electricity pricing and improved performance of the generation portfolio. Importantly, this strong business performance will support us to invest in the transformation of our generation portfolio. Safety and People As always, the safety of our people and the safe and reliable operation of our assets is our number one priority. This year, there were no serious injuries to employees or contractors, however our Total Injury Frequency Rate (TIFR) increased to 2.8 per million hours worked for employees and contractors, up 0.7 from 2.1 in FY22. This was driven by an increase in low-impact injuries. In response, we’re increasing the focus on preventing common injuries before they occur and continuing to encourage employees and contractors to report all events that have the potential to cause an injury or fatality. An engaged workforce with high levels of employee satisfaction and a strong sense of belonging is critical to the company’s overall success and delivery of our strategy. Pleasingly, after a period of uncertainty, we had a 10-percentage point improvement in our employee engagement score from 57% in FY22 to 67% in FY23. There is still more work to be done but the momentum is positive. Board and Management renewal The significant renewal of the Board and Management team in FY23 has brought a diverse range of skills and experience to the business.  In September 2022, we welcomed Miles George as a Non-Executive Director. Following the AGM in November 2022, we also welcomed Christine Holman, John Pollaers, Dr Kerry Schott and Mark Twidell as Non-Executive Directors. It was an enormous honour and privilege for us to be appointed into our respective roles as Chair and Managing Director & CEO, and to have the opportunity to lead AGL at this pivotal time, supported by an expanded Board and renewed Management team. Together, AGL’s Board and Management team have navigated volatile and challenging energy market conditions as well as a complex energy transition to set AGL’s future direction, which is aimed at enhancing long-term shareholder value while meeting community expectations. Looking ahead AGL will be a very different company over the next decade and will continue to transform as it has always done during its 185-year history. With our strategy, purpose, values and highly experienced Board and Management teams in place, we’re well positioned to play a leading role in Australia’s energy transition. The challenge is significant, but the opportunities are enormous, and the positive momentum we have now means that it’s an exciting time for the Board, the leadership, and our people.  Thank you for your continued support.     ===== PAGE 6 ===== Five Year Summary 4 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 Key financial metrics FY23 FY22 FY21 FY20 FY19 Income Revenue $m 14,157 13,221 10,942 12,160 13,246 Underlying EBITDA $m 1,361 1,218 1,666 2,026 2,285 Underlying EBIT $m 633 501 959 1,306 1,660 Statutory Profit/(Loss) after tax $m (1,264) 860 (2,058) 1,007 905 Underlying Profit after tax $m 281 225 537 808 1,040 Financial position Total assets $m 15,238 19,270 15,450 14,607 14,821 Net debt $m 2,711 2,662 2,997 2,723 2,600 Gearing (net debt/net debt + equity) % 34.9 29.2 35.1 25.3 23.5 Cash flow Sustaining capital expenditure $m 508 460 534 507 551 Growth and transformation capital expenditure $m 121 186 173 178 388 Operating cash flow before significant items, interest and tax $m 1,013 1,498 1,606 2,476 2,013 Cash conversion % 74 123 96 122 88 Cash conversion excluding margin calls and rehabilitation % 86 112 100 100 97 Shareholder value Statutory earnings per share cents (187.9) 131.6 (330.3) 157.2 138.0 Underlying earnings per share cents 41.8 34.4 86.2 126.1 158.6 Dividends declared cents 31.0 26.0 75.0 98.0 119.0 Payout ratio % 75.0 75.0 87.0 75.0 75.0 Return on capital invested % 5.7 4.8 7.6 8.6 10.7 Return on equity % 4.9 3.7 8.1 10.0 12.5 Key operating metrics FY23 FY22 FY21 FY20 FY19 Total services to customers million 4.271 4.215 4.208 3.954 3.708 Customer churn % 14.2 15.6 14.3 14.3 17.6 Pool generation volume TWh 36.9 40.8 41.1 43.8 43.7 Customer demand: Electricity TWh 38.2 39.0 40.6 40.3 39.2 Customer demand: Gas PJ 131.4 153.1 158.4 155.5 167.1 Wholesale electricity prices (realised spot generation) $/MWh 134.01 115.0 58.0 75.2 103.1 Fuel costs $/MWh (23.3) (20.2)2 (20.8) (23.1) (24.3) Operating costs and capital expenditure $m (2,233) (2,142) (2,326) (2,336) (2,487) 1.

AGL will play our role in Australia’s decarbonisation journey by connecting our customers to a sustainable future and transitioning our energy portfolio.     AGL is taking action to accelerate Australia’s transition to a lower carbon future. We are targeting an exit from coal-fired generation by the end of FY35, and have an ambition to supply ~12 GW of new renewable and firming capacity before 2036, with an interim target of ~5 GW by 2030. Our commitment to responsibly reshape our future energy portfolio represents one of the most significant decarbonisation initiatives in Australia. We are progressing our plans to curate a demand-driven generation and firming portfolio to meet projected growth in electricity demand in the most cost effective and low risk manner. We also have an unwavering focus on continuing to ensure the availability, reliability and flexibility of our thermal asset fleet for the remainder of their operational lives. We are advancing our plans to repurpose our thermal generation sites into low-carbon energy hubs in the Hunter, Latrobe Valley and Torrens Island, connecting industrial partners into a circular economy at the sites.   Further information on our asset transition plans, development pipeline, and energy hub progress, is available in the Assets scorecard. We are also committed to helping our customers decarbonise the way they live, move and work. Our Customer Markets strategy focuses on three areas: strengthening our core business while supporting our customers; capturing growth in new value pools particularly those arising from decarbonisation and electrification; and leveraging technology and digital to unlock efficiency and growth through retail transformation. Through execution of this strategy we intend to be well positioned to capture the projected increase in electricity demand through electrification, as well as future population growth in major capital cities as we shift the focus of our business model from being a commodity supplier to scaling “Energy as a Service,” which includes asset orchestration, hardware provision, e-mobility solutions such as leasing and charging, decentralised energy, and asset monitoring and management. Further information is available in the Customer scorecard. Our people are critical to our success, and we are committed to building the capabilities and culture required to deliver our strategy. We also recognise the important role of technology in unlocking growth, enhancing customer experience and strengthening our trading operations and risk management capabilities. We are also focused on ensuring that ESG considerations are part of our decision making. During FY23, AGL’s climate strategy was released through our inaugural Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP). As well as key decarbonisation targets across a 12-year roadmap, the CTAP includes our commitment to continue to advocate for a responsible transition that balances energy reliability and affordability with the need to decarbonise, and our commitment to work with and support our people and communities through a responsible and orderly transition. The CTAP was endorsed by shareholders at the 2022 Annual General Meeting.  A summary of the progress made against our CTAP commitments over FY23 is set out in our FY23 TCFD Report, available on our website.  We are also committed to embracing other aspects of AGL's ESG framework, and our ESG performance over FY23 is available in our Business Value Driver scorecards from page 19 and in our ESG Data Centre.  ===== PAGE 11 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 9 Capital allocation framework Our refreshed capital allocation framework has been developed to drive disciplined allocation of capital to transition our customer and generation portfolios, while maintaining financial strength and flexibility to maximise future returns for our shareholders.

Includes smelters. 2.2 Management of strategic risks AGL is committed to ensuring that risk management practices are embedded into all business processes and operations in order to drive consistent, effective and accountable action, decision-making and management practices. The Board has adopted a Risk Management Policy that sets out AGL's objectives for risk management and clearly articulates the responsibilities of all AGL’s people in relation to the management of risks. AGL’s enterprise-wide risk management program, which is aligned with the principles and requirements of the international standard for risk management (ISO 31000), is detailed in our 2023 Corporate Governance Statement at agl.com.au/corporategovernance. Through this program, we identify factors that are critical to the successful delivery of our strategy and our ability to continue creating value into the future. AGL’s Statement of Risk Appetite, which was last approved by the Board in June 2023, supports our commitment to optimising risk management practices in pursuit of AGL's strategic priorities.  AGL undertakes a comprehensive process throughout the year to identify, monitor, assess and report on the key risks to achieving our strategic priorities over the medium term to long term. We define these as Tier 1 Strategic Risks. Risk mitigation strategies are in place for each of these risks, and the risks have been overseen throughout FY23 by AGL’s Audit & Risk Management Committee. 2.2.1 FY23 Tier 1 Strategic Risks AGL is subject to a broad range of risks reflecting our ownership and operation of critical infrastructure, as well as being one of Australia’s largest providers of essential services. Various aspects of the Australian energy system, and subsequently of AGL’s business operations, have material strategic and operational risks, with the energy industry continuing to face significant challenges on numerous fronts over the past 12 months. Delivery of our accelerated decarbonisation and transition strategy (as outlined above) creates new risks for AGL, and for AGL to be successful, will require new capabilities, access to sufficient capital, strong social licence, and support from various stakeholders. AGL’s ability to achieve our strategic objectives may also be affected by factors outside of our direct control, including timely access to required licences, permits, and transmission network connections, constraints on key capabilities across the labour market and market demand for limited global skillsets, as well as supply chain constraints associated with required equipment and materials. While progressing our strategy, we continue to operate within a complex operating environment. The global and Australian economies continue to be impacted by inflationary pressures which are increasing the costs of doing business and creating affordability challenges for our customers. While wholesale energy prices have moderated from the very high prices experienced in late 2022, they remain higher than historical averages, and across FY23 have been highly volatile. Our ability to effectively manage changing and volatile energy pricing is key to delivering on our strategic objectives and earnings outlook.  ===== PAGE 13 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 11 In addition to contributing to the current inflationary outlook, geopolitical events are also exacerbating an already heightened threat landscape relating to cyber security. While AGL has systems in place to protect, detect, contain and respond to cyber-attacks and information security threats, the nature and sophistication of cyber threats continue to evolve. Technology is also evolving at a rapid rate, creating both opportunities and threats for AGL. To deliver on our strategy to lead the energy transition, we need to continue to invest in enhancing and protecting our core business, while harnessing new and emerging generation technologies and electrification-related value pools. As a key contributor to AGL’s earnings, the safe and reliable operation of our key generation plants will continue to be critical, both for AGL’s ongoing financial performance and to fund our decarbonisation strategy; and for the NEM more broadly in supporting reliable and affordable energy during Australia’s energy transition. AGL continues to focus on thermal asset safety, reliability and flexibility. As a result of the complex environment AGL is currently operating within, the majority of AGL’s strategic risks remain elevated. The key changes identified in AGL’s strategic risk profile over FY23 are as follows: • The Organisational Culture and Capability risk has reduced, reflecting the increased clarity of AGL’s strategic direction, new purpose and values, and finalisation of key Board and management appointments. • The Investment Planning and Execution risk has increased recognising that delivering on our strategy to be a leader in the energy transition and execute our decarbonisation pathway is a significant and complex task. The Tier 1 Strategic Risks for FY23 are summarised in the following table.  ===== PAGE 14 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 12 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 Tier 1 Strategic Risk Mitigation approach Relevant Business Value Driver Climate change response: AGL is unable to meet expectations and/or deliver on its strategy and commitments to be a leader in the energy transition to a low carbon future within targeted timeframes. • Through our strategy, AGL is focused on the accelerated closure of our coal plants and the development of a significant investment pipeline of options for new renewable and firming generation. Mid-term targets for this new renewable and firming generation have been announced, and detailed plans to meet these targets have been developed. • AGL proactively engages with government, communities, employees and our broader stakeholder groups on matters relevant to this portfolio transition, including in relation to asset closures, rehabilitation and our proposed energy hubs which will help to create the energy industry of the future.  • AGL is also committed to helping our customers to connect with a sustainable future through the provision of a wide range of decarbonisation and electrification products and services. • AGL has published a Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP), which includes further information on our approach to decarbonisation. The CTAP was supported by shareholders at the 2022 Annual General Meeting. We report annually on our progress against the commitments included in the CTAP (refer to our FY23 TCFD Report). Unfavourable government intervention: AGL is not able to effectively anticipate, plan or respond to changing government policy. • AGL actively contributes to the ongoing development of government policy in areas relevant to our business, including through participation in public forums and the submission of formal responses to government policy enquiries. Through this involvement, AGL seeks to influence policy change to deliver balanced outcomes that consider the interests of all of AGL’s stakeholders (including our customers and shareholders), guided by our Values and Purpose. • AGL also directly engages with a range of stakeholders that may be involved in the development of government policy to understand and provide input into likely future government policy direction. Wholesale market pricing and earnings volatility AGL is unable to effectively manage the impact of wholesale electricity price change and earnings or cashflow volatility. • AGL has in place rigorous governance processes to manage financial risk exposures within the limits set by the Board, and in accordance with a Trading Risk policy that is approved by the Board. • AGL proactively manages earnings volatility through our hedge position, which takes into account our current and future generation portfolio mix, as well as other factors such as plant outages and anticipated market shifts. • AGL has a robust program of market monitoring and analysis, including stress testing against adverse scenarios. Regulatory intervention: AGL is not able to effectively anticipate or plan for regulatory intervention, or added restrictions and diversion of resources put wider business objectives at risk. • AGL actively contributes to regulatory discussions and developments by regularly engaging with regulators, jurisdictional and governmental bodies. AGL seeks to influence regulatory change to deliver balanced outcomes that consider the interests of all of AGL’s stakeholders (including our customers and shareholders), guided by our Values and Purpose. • AGL participates in industry consultations to contribute to the direction of future regulatory reforms.  ===== PAGE 15 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 13 Tier 1 Strategic Risk Mitigation approach Relevant Business Value Driver Stakeholder trust: AGL’s strategy to deliver on its social licence to all stakeholders is unclear, inconsistent, and/or poorly executed. • AGL proactively engages with various stakeholder groups, including customers, shareholders, investors, governments and regulatory bodies, and communities in which we operate to understand the key social licence risks and opportunities, and also where focus is required to meet and exceed rising community expectations. • A dedicated Board Committee oversees safety and sustainability. The Committee receives regular reporting on issues impacting AGL's social licence. • AGL engages with key stakeholders prior to seeking relevant approvals for our development and operational activities, and this engagement continues through the life of the project and during operations. Cyber Security and Resilience: AGL’s critical systems, platforms, technology infrastructure and core business and operational processes are compromised or unacceptably disrupted by a cyber, vendor or internal event. • AGL manages our information and technology assets and systems in alignment with the Australian Energy Sector Cyber Security Framework, along with other relevant international frameworks. • AGL operates key cyber security capabilities including monitoring and defence, network security, identity and access management. AGL people are regularly trained on relevant cyber risks. • AGL continues to invest in security capabilities, processes and measures to protect critical infrastructure, assets and data. AGL proactively manages cyber risk to limit the likelihood of inappropriate access to systems and data, and to limit the impact of cyber security incidents through preparation and rapid response capabilities. • AGL’s information and technology environments are regularly reviewed and subjected to a program of testing, business continuity exercises, crisis management simulations and disaster recovery tests, which are supported by external experts. • AGL’s Audit & Risk Management Committee receives regular updates on cyber risk management and business resilience. Organisational Culture and Capability: AGL is unable to foster a resilient, responsive, future-focused and purpose- driven organisation that is built on strong and ethical behaviours, talented people, a focus on health and safety, and a customer-centric mindset. • During FY23, AGL announced the appointment of a permanent CEO and CFO, AGL’s new strategy and a refreshed purpose and values, which have provided greater clarity of direction for AGL. • AGL has frameworks in place to attract, retain and develop our people to support our strategy. For example, targeted leadership development programs and operational workforce transition initiatives are in place.  • AGL continues to prioritise the safety of our people, with ongoing focus on our Serious Injury and Fatality (SIF) prevention program, critical control verification and psychological safety risk assessment and management. • Recognising that AGL’s new strategy will require both new capabilities and additional resourcing in key areas, AGL has proactively assessed our future capability needs and has identified and prioritised capabilities required in the short, medium and longer term to deliver on our strategy.  ===== PAGE 16 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 14 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 Tier 1 Strategic Risk Mitigation approach Relevant Business Value Driver Resilience of Generation and Critical Infrastructure: AGL is unable to generate and maintain a resilient and flexible energy supply from generation assets and related critical infrastructure. • Throughout AGL’s transition of our generation fleet from thermal assets to renewable and firming assets, the reliability and flexibility of our coal plants will remain a significant focus. AGL continues to invest in the ongoing reliability and flexibility of our coal assets, including operating the Loy Yang A and Bayswater power stations with reliable and flexible loads, investing capital appropriately to meet asset objectives through to end of life, and supporting plant capability and efficiency. • As part of AGL’s portfolio rebuild, we are pursuing a detailed pipeline of firming and renewables development options, and we continue to seek contracting, partnership and acquisition opportunities. Investment Planning and Execution: AGL’s major investments do not deliver on their intended benefits, announced timeframes or outcomes for shareholders, customers and the community. • AGL has in place a disciplined capital management process including a recently updated dividend policy, and a robust investment governance framework for capital allocation and investments, with expected returns to shareholders considered for all potential investments assessed. • AGL engages with the community and other key stakeholders on relevant development opportunities to understand expectations and the key risks and opportunities involved with those opportunities. Retail Market Disruption: AGL does not adequately or appropriately identify and respond to changing customer or operating environment needs and expectations; or does not effectively harness new technologies, products or services that support these changing needs and expectations. • AGL actively monitors new and emerging technologies, products and business models with a view to meeting future customer demand and increasing customer expectations. For example, AGL is pursuing opportunities in electrification services including EVs and EV charging, hot water, heating and cooling, distributed energy resources (DER), asset monitoring and management. • AGL continues to support our customers, particularly in the current affordability and cost of living environment, and has recently committed to a minimum of $70 million towards national customer support programs over the next two years. Compliance and Privacy: AGL fails to comply with laws, regulations or other commitments made, including its privacy and environmental obligations. • AGL is committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations, and has in place a robust enterprise-wide compliance framework to manage our compliance requirements, including those related to privacy. Access to Gas: AGL is unable to source sufficient quantities of gas to meet its future demand. • AGL proactively contracts competitive gas supplies to firm up our short, medium and longer term gas position to meet gas supply demands. Further information in relation to AGL’s climate-related risks is available in our FY23 TCFD Report, including transition risks (arising from the changes to systems and business functions which are necessary to address climate change) and physical risk.  ===== PAGE 17 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 15 3. Key Operating Metrics and Business Value Drivers The following sections summarise the performance of AGL's business during FY23. Performance is considered through two dimensions: • Key Operating Metrics – These performance measures have a direct influence on AGL's FY23 financial performance. The six key operating metrics comprise: - Customer numbers and churn; - Customer energy demand; - Wholesale electricity prices; - Generation volumes; - Fuel costs; and  - Operating costs and capital expenditure. • Business Value Drivers – These performance measures are critical to long-term value creation, however may have a less direct relationship to annual performance, and/or may influence financial performance over the longer term. The performance measures are divided into scorecards for each of AGL’s identified Business Value Drivers. 3.1 Key Operating Metrics performance 3.1.1 Customer numbers and churn Total services to customers increased 1.3% to 4.271 million, from 4.215 million as at 30 June 2022. This increase of 56,000 was driven by strong growth in telecommunication and gas services, with a slight decrease in electricity services due to increased competition and churn in the second half of the year. Consumer Electricity services decreased by 4,000 in a challenging market with New South Wales, South Australia and Queensland decreasing by 25,000, partly offset by growth of 21,000 services in Victoria. Consumer Gas services increased by 14,000 services, with growth of 10,000 services in Victoria and 13,000 services in Western Australia, whilst New South Wales decreased by 12,000 services and the remaining states were relatively flat to FY22. Total Telecommunication services increased 18.7% to 292,000 due to continued growth in mobile and internet plans.

Excluding approximately 310,000 services to ActewAGL customers. Market churn rose sharply in the first quarter due to the impact of higher wholesale prices, price changes and Retailer of Last Resort (RoLR) events with churn stabilising across the remainder of the year. AGL churn remains lower than Rest of Market due to strong customer retention in the second half of the year and improved customer experience. AGL churn was 14.2% (an improvement of 1.4 ppts from 15.6% at 30 June 2022), and Rest of Market churn was 18.7% (an improvement of 0.9 ppts from 19.6% at 30 June 2022). The gap between AGL and Rest of Market was 4.5 ppts, an improvement from 4.0 ppts at 30 June 2022.  ===== PAGE 18 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 16 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 3.1.2 Customer energy demand Total electricity customer sales volumes were 38,150 GWh, down 806 GWh or 2.1%. • Consumer customer electricity sales volumes were 14,537 GWh, up 166 GWh or 1.2%, due to increased average demand as a result of favourable change in customer mix. • Large Business customer electricity sales volumes were 10,306 GWh, down 237 GWh or 2.2%, primarily driven by market competition in South Australia. • Wholesale customer electricity sales volumes were 13,307 GWh, down 735 GWh or 5.2%, driven by lower consumption from AGL’s existing customer base in Victoria as well as the re-contracting of Alcoa at lower volumes. Customer energy demand FY23 GWh FY22 GWh Consumer customers electricity sales 14,537 14,371 Large Business customers electricity sales 10,306 10,543 Wholesale customers electricity sales 13,307 14,042 Total customer electricity sales volume 38,150 38,956 Total gas customer sales volumes were 131.4 PJ, down 21.7 PJ or 14.2%. • Consumer customer gas sales volumes were 54.5 PJ, up 0.4 PJ or 0.7%, with an increase in average customer base compared to prior year, in addition to higher average demand due to colder weather. • Large Business customer gas sales volumes were 16.4 PJ, down 1.5 PJ or 8.4%, primarily in Victoria and Queensland as a result of limited supply of gas, partly offset by growth in Western Australia. • Wholesale customer gas sales and internal gas volumes for power generation were 60.5 PJ, down 20.6 PJ or 25.4%, primarily driven by the roll-off of wholesale customer volumes from AGL’s existing customer base and lower internal consumption of gas volumes used for power generation in South Australia. FY23 PJ FY22 PJ Consumer customers gas sales 54.5 54.1 Large Business customers gas sales 16.4 17.9 Wholesale customers gas sales and generation 60.5 81.1 Total customer gas sales volume 131.4 153.1 3.1.3 Wholesale electricity prices Wholesale electricity spot prices were higher in New South Wales and Victoria across the current year compared with the previous year whilst Queensland and South Australia electricity spot prices were higher in the first half of the year and lower in the second half of the year. The increase was more pronounced towards the beginning of FY23, particularly in July 2022, due to various factors including the impact of higher international coal and gas prices, overall supply chain delays due to ongoing COVID-19 impacts and flooding affecting coal supply in the Hunter Valley. Wholesale electricity prices were also impacted by the market suspension declared in June 2022, when AEMO intervened in the NEM spot market in response to sustained high prices, initially triggering administered pricing followed by market suspension in response to challenges in market operation. Towards the end of calendar year 2022 spot prices decreased driven by increased renewable generation, with rooftop and commercial solar increasing generation capacity, as well as the Federal Government price cap intervention in domestic coal and gas markets, setting a price of $12/GJ on gas and $125/tonne on coal announced in December 2022. Electricity forward curves have reduced since the introduction of these caps, especially in New South Wales and Queensland. AGL's generation assets are exposed to the changes in electricity spot prices. This exposure is hedged with customer load and financial derivatives. Customer contracted prices in FY23 were higher than FY22 in all states except Victoria. AGL's practice of resetting prices to consumer customers annually on a rolling forward curve and re-contracting Large Business customer contracts and derivatives on a two to three year forward time frame, means the current higher prices will translate into higher contracted prices in the future.  ===== PAGE 19 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 17 Wholesale electricity prices (AEMO spot prices) $/MWh NSW QLD SA VIC Jul-21 Aug-21 Sep-21 Oct-21 Nov-21 Dec-21 Jan-22 Feb-22 Mar-22 Apr-22 May-22 Jun-22 Jul-22 Aug-22 Sep-22 Oct-22 Nov-22 Dec-22 Jan-23 Feb-23 Mar-23 Apr-23 May-23 Jun-23 0 100 200 300 400 500 3.1.4 Generation volumes Generation sold to the pool decreased by 9.4%, driven by the staggered closure of the Liddell Power Station with the first generating unit closing in April 2022 and the remaining three units in April 2023. The reduction in generation was also impacted by the Unit 2 and other outages at AGL Loy Yang. Bayswater Power Station was operated more flexibly during periods of lower demand and to support more stable Liddell Power Station running as the units approached closure. Lower Gas generation was mainly due to market conditions in South Australia whilst higher Renewable generation at the Victorian hydroelectric power stations was driven by significant rainfall in the region, partly offset by lower wind generation due to outages at Macarthur Wind Farm located in Victoria.

On a per MWh basis, costs increased by $4.0 per MWh or 21.3%, due to increased purchase of coal at higher spot market prices, and contracted supplier and Enterprise Agreement wage escalation at the Loy Yang Mine. This was partly offset by higher coal volumes procured from lower cost legacy supply contracts compared to the prior year. • Gas fuel costs were $(168) million, down 4.5%. On a per MWh basis, costs increased by $17.2 per MWh or 14.2%, due to higher gas costs particularly in Victoria, as gas generation increased in response to higher pool prices in the first quarter of the year and managing AGL’s position as part of the major outage of Unit 2 at AGL Loy Yang resulting in higher market prices.  ===== PAGE 20 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 18 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 Generation fuel costs FY23 $m Restated FY22 $m FY23 $/MWh Restated FY22 $/MWh Coal (693) (647) (22.8) (18.8) Gas1 (168) (176) (138.0) (120.8) Total generation fuel costs (861) (823) (23.3) (20.2) 1.

Time series data for the Business Value Driver key performance indicators as well as performance data for an extended range of non-financial metrics is available in the ESG Data Centre. The key performance indicators included in each scorecard should be read in conjunction with the Glossary to the Business Value Drivers on page 186. Key performance indicators that are linked to the FY23 remuneration outcomes for the CEO and key management personnel are also identified as outlined in the legend below. Legend KPI linked to FY23 remuneration outcomes for CEO and key management personnel We are focused on strengthening our customer relationships through a range of innovative initiatives which deliver value for our business and improvements for our customers. AGL supports around 4.3 million customer services across energy and telecommunications translating to approximately 30% of households in the national electricity market. The fundamental strengths of our business continue to be our large quality customer base, leading brand, strong operating discipline and deep energy expertise. As we navigate the multi-decade journey of the energy transition, we are actively balancing the need to support our customers facing cost of living pressures, including rising energy price rises, and the investment required to support our customers to transition to a net zero future.  Solutions to meet customer needs A critical way to enhance our relationship with our customers and grow trust is through the development of products and services that meet and respond to their changing needs. AGL has maintained a positive level of customer advocacy for the fifth consecutive year, with our Net Promoter Score at +5 for FY23, despite rising energy prices and a highly competitive market. Our strong and loyal customer relationships are further demonstrated by our energy consumer churn which is 4.5 percentage points lower than the rest of market. In FY23 we increased our investment in retail transformation to simplify and streamline our business processes and the way we engage with our customers. AGL has the highest rated mobile application among our peers in Australia on the App store and this year added self service capabilities, including digital disconnection and direct debit, to simplify service access and improve the time taken to resolve customer queries.  We also offer a wide range of products and solutions to help customers lower costs and decarbonise their lifestyle, as set out in the following section. We have placed a strong emphasis on ensuring that customer issues are addressed promptly and effectively. AGL has the least consumer electricity customer complaints of any Tier 1 retailer1. In FY23, Ombudsman complaints increased by 3% against FY22, which is the first time we have seen an annual increase since FY15. However, AGL continues to have lower overall Ombudsman complaints compared to our Tier 1 peers. The volume of Ombudsman complaints remained flat throughout the majority of the year, supported by continued focus on overall service improvement. We have begun to see the impacts of cost of living pressures through increased Ombudsman volume which we expect to continue into FY24. Target FY23 FY22 Strategic Net Promoter Score (NPS) FY27: +20 +5 +6 Ombudsman complaints - 5,012 4,873 Energy affordability and support for customers experiencing vulnerability Energy affordability continues to be a major concern for Australians, particularly in the context of broader cost of living pressures. Increases in wholesale prices have been driven by major global energy challenges, including significant market volatility, increases in global fuel prices, geopolitical factors and supply disruptions. In response to this, AGL, along with other energy retailers, increased prices for customers on standing offers and variable market offers.  We are acutely aware that these price increases are challenging for many customers. Our decision to increase prices for our market contract customers is based on a detailed consideration of a range of factors including wholesale prices, network charges, retail operating costs, customer affordability and the value we offer to our customers. 1. Per FY23 Q3 reporting cycle (AER and ESC).  ===== PAGE 22 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 20 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 To mitigate the impact of energy prices and to support customers experiencing vulnerability, AGL increased customer support funding over the next two years to at least $70 million. This will form part of a package of measures providing direct and indirect support to assist customers. The funding includes the provision of direct financial support to our Staying Connected customers through debt relief and bill credits of up to $400. Additionally, this funding will also help AGL improve energy literacy and accessibility, using advanced analytics to proactively identify and contact customers showing early signs of hardship, and building situational awareness for AGL’s front line staff. More broadly, AGL continues to provide a wide range of mechanisms to support customers who may be experiencing financial hardship or other vulnerability. These programs include: • Payment support options such as payment plans, payment deferrals, monthly billing, and bill smoothing arrangements; • Access to AGL’s dedicated hardship programs which offer tailored assistance to customers experiencing financial distress and vulnerable circumstances, including protection from disconnection for non-payment; • Dedicated family and domestic violence support to provide safe access to energy; • Facilitating access to government support such as state energy concessions schemes, utility grants and rebate information; • Energy efficiency advice and tools including AGL’s Energy Coach, which provides helpful advice on reducing energy consumption to lower energy bills; and • Additional protections for customers registered as requiring life support equipment at their premises. The number of customers on the Staying Connected program increased by 18% in FY23. Customers are entering the hardship program earlier when compared to previous years. In FY23, AGL has continued to support Staying Connected customers with the delivery of $18 million of debt relief for customers participating in the program. This support allows customers to focus on paying towards their ongoing energy costs rather than the arrears, which has resulted in the average debt per Staying Connected customer reducing by 13% in FY23 to $2,578. The increase in total average debt across the mass market customer portfolio can be attributed to energy price increases and broader cost of living expenses. FY23 FY22 Number of customers on Staying Connected 18,889 15,964 Average level of debt of customers on Staying Connected $2,578 $2,973 Total average debt across mass market customer portfolio $386 $241 Decarbonised energy supply We are committed to helping our customers decarbonise the way they live, move and work. During FY23, we have established and are scaling a range of initiatives to extend decarbonisation efforts for our residential customers: • Electrify Now: During FY23 we launched Electrify Now, a first of its kind pilot for Australian energy retailers that provides personalised recommendations for customers on ways to electrify their home and meet their decarbonisation goals. Electrify Now is underpinned by advanced analytics utilising customers’ own smart meter data to tailor recommendations based on their individual household energy needs and usage patterns. Since the pilot was launched in March 2023, we have presented over 6,500 customers with tailored decarbonisation recommendations for their homes. • Electric vehicles:  AGL’s electric vehicle subscription program is now the largest of its kind in the country, growing in revenue by 38% since FY22. During FY23 we completed an ARENA-funded smart charging trial to test customer engagement, orchestration of residential electric vehicle charging and the impact on the grid.  In June 2023 we also announced a new eMobility partnership with bp pulse. This partnership will launch in New South Wales where customers on AGL’s EV home energy plan will be able to access a discounted rate for charging at bp pulse’s public charging sites. Further propositions are planned to be rolled out across the future period. • Carbon Neutral: AGL now provides 444,969 carbon neutral services across a suite of certified Climate Active products (up from 391,558 in FY22), including more than 150,000 carbon neutral gas and electricity services. • Demand response and orchestration: We are currently operating 316 MW of Decentralised Assets Under Orchestration, excluding smelters, and 1,139 MW including smelters. This includes our Peak Energy Rewards program, which is one of the largest flexible demand response programs in the country and has been expanded to over 120,000 customers. During FY23 we also commenced hot water orchestration trials that are generating interest from our customers and have the potential to provide significant flexible capacity. AGL continues to be an industry leader in relation to providing products and services to our commercial and industrial customers and are progressing on scaling our Energy as a Service (EaaS) solutions, providing integrated offerings across energy solutions, asset management, orchestration and asset financing. We continue to be the largest solar provider in the country, delivering three times more commercial solar capacity than the nearest competitor over FY23.  ===== PAGE 23 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 21 Target FY23 FY22 Green revenue as a % of total revenue1 17.5% 15.3% Increase in green revenue from FY192 FY27: +85% 73% 41% Decentralised assets under orchestration (including smelters) FY27: 1.6 GW 1,139 MW 1,038 MW Cumulative customer assets installed (behind the meter) FY27: 300 MW3 Not applicable Not applicable 1.

AGL operates the largest electricity generation portfolio within the National Electricity Market of any ASX-listed company, with 8,735 MW installed generation capacity1 as at 30 June 2023. Our operated assets exported 38.2 GWh to the grid2, equivalent to around 20% of electricity generated in the NEM. We have a defined strategy which aims to deliver a responsible and accelerated exit from coal-fired generation and transition to a lower carbon future. Our first key milestone was achieved in late April 2023 with the safe and respectful closure of Liddell Power Station after more than 50 years of operation. Bayswater Power Station will close between 2030-2033 (no later than 2033), and Loy Yang A Power Station is targeted to close by the end of FY35. We are committed to transitioning our portfolio to support a lower carbon world, and will seek to supply our customers' energy demand by building and accessing ~12 GWof new renewable generation and firming capacity before 2036, with an interim target to have ~5 GW in place by 2030.  We also recognise that the flexibility, availability and reliability of our current generation fleet will be crucial as we look to leverage strong operating cash flows from our low-cost generation position, to help fund the transition of our business. Transitioning our energy portfolio As we transition our energy portfolio, AGL plans to seek the most efficient way of sourcing the required energy and firming to supply our customer energy demand. As outlined to the market in June 2023, we will aim to meet this through a combination of self-development and external project options via partnerships and third-party offtakes. During FY23 we continued our strong track record of developing renewable generation and energy storage projects: • Projects under construction: The Torrens Island Battery (250 MW) and the Broken Hill Battery (50 MW) are in the final stages of construction and commissioning, with both projects expected to be complete in H1FY24. In July 2022, we commenced a $40 million investment in modernising and upgrading the Clover hydro power station to increase the output capacity of the Kiewa Hydro Scheme by 14 MW. This is expected to be completed in FY26. • Onshore development pipeline: We have advanced our onshore development pipeline to 5.3 GW. Since February 2023 we have added 500 MW of wind, 100 MW of solar and 400 MW of battery storage in New South Wales, as well as 500 MW of battery storage in Queensland to our development pipeline, complementing existing development projects including the Liddell and Loy Yang batteries. We plan to continue to build up this development pipeline to enable options to be exercised as needed depending on the policy environment, economic environment, and portfolio and customer needs. • Offshore wind: In May 2023, AGL announced that a consortium of Australian and global companies (comprising Mainstream Renewable Power, Reventus Power, AGL and DIRECT Infrastructure) had submitted a feasibility licence application for a 2.5 GW offshore wind development in Bass Strait, off the coast of Gippsland, Victoria.  The following map summarises our development pipeline, including both fully owned and joint venture projects. 1.

AGL is also focused on procuring renewable energy for our customers via third-party offtakes. In June 2023 AGL entered into a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Tilt Renewables (in which AGL has 20% ownership) to offtake 45% of the output from the Rye Park Wind Farm in New South Wales (with that share equivalent to 513 GWh per annum derived from 178 MW). We continue to progress initiatives to rationalise our upstream gas portfolio, with divestment processes underway for the Surat and Moranbah gas projects in Queensland.  Sale agreements for both projects are expected to be entered prior to the end of calendar year 2023.

Comprises 130 MW of operational batteries as well as Torrens Island Battery (250 MW) and Broken Hill Battery (50 MW), both under construction during the period. Reliable and efficient plant operations In FY23, AGL’s overall fleet availability or Equivalent Availability Factor (EAF), was 76.8%. This is an improvement on FY22’s performance of 74.5%, but lower than planned, primarily driven by lower performance in the first quarter of FY23 resulting from the continuation of the Loy Yang A Unit 2 generator failure (which began in the last quarter of FY22). Despite the Unit 2 outage, the other Loy Yang A units achieved above planned performance with very strong performance in the first quarter of FY23. Bayswater Power Station’s FY23 performance was an improvement on FY22 performance due to fewer plant forced outages than occurred in FY22. Until its retirement in April 2023, the Liddell Power Station achieved an availability performance that was higher than in FY22.  ===== PAGE 25 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 23 The future ready program has been developed and plans are now in place for Bayswater and Loy Yang A power stations to ensure that these assets are optimally positioned for anticipated changes to their market roles, with flexibility upgrades allowing these assets to operate at up to 70% and 45% below nameplate capacity, respectively. Thermal digital twins are being integrated with the energy efficiency plans for these sites to support further carbon intensity reduction objectives. These plans seek to address, among other goals, optimum performance of these plants when operating at lower loads due to fluctuating market conditions and optimisation of fuel consumption. Target FY23 FY22 Equivalent Availability Factor (EAF) - all fleet 76.8% 74.5% Equivalent Availability Factor (EAF) - thermal and gas generation fleet FY27: 88% 74.6% Not reported Repurposed infrastructure (energy hubs) AGL is committed to repurposing its thermal generation sites into energy hubs. The Hunter Valley, Torrens Island and Latrobe Valley hubs seek to bring together energy production and energy-intensive industries around a shared infrastructure backbone, with a focus on circular economy principles, including innovative re-use of valuable infrastructure, recycling and co-location of complementary industries. The transition of these generation sites is underway through which we aim to support the economic diversification of these regions, providing new job and skills development opportunities for the communities where we operate. In April 2023, the final operating unit of the Liddell Power Station was safely shut down and the neighbouring Bayswater Power Station is targeted to be closed by 2033. Development activities are underway across the Hunter Hub, and include the following: • Planning approval for a 500 MW battery and ARENA funding secured (final investment decision expected to be made in FY24); • Feasibility assessment with Fortescue Future Industries for a large scale renewable hydrogen facility; • Pre-feasibility assessments for solar thermal energy and emerging battery technologies; • Pre-feasibility assessment with NuRock Building Products for a building products manufacturing facility utilising recycled waste ash; • Feasibility assessment with joint venture partner Idemitsu for a 250-400 MW pumped hydro project, supported by funding from the New South Wales Government; and • Approval of a First Nations agriculture project for the development of a Manuka Tree Plantation, which will provide the opportunity for medicinal Manuka honey production. AGL is working closely with the First Nations group to support engineering and construction activities, with seedlings expected to be planted in FY24. Decommissioning and rehabilitation activities following the closure of the Liddell Power Station are progressing alongside our Hub planning activities (refer to the Environment scorecard for further information). As announced in November 2022, the final operating unit of Torrens Island Power Station is planned to close on 30 June 2026. Transition of the Torrens Island Hub is well progressed, with construction and commissioning of the 250 MW Torrens Island Battery underway during FY23 which is expected to be completed in August 2023. Pre-feasibility assessments for a renewable hydrogen facility and a range of other energy projects are underway, including: • A study into opportunities for hydrogen blending at the Barker Inlet Power Station, where AGL also has planning approval for a new 210 MW gas peaking plant; and • A thermal energy storage project, supported by ARENA, involving the assessment of technologies which aim to capture and convert excess low-cost energy to heat for steam generation, with the potential to provide co-firming or replacement of gas fuel usage at the Torrens Island B Power Station. With Loy Yang A Power Station’s targeted closure by the end of FY35, redevelopment activities for the Latrobe Valley Hub are ramping up. In addition to progressing plans for a 200 MW battery, a hydrogen supply chain project led by a consortium of Japanese partners has progressed to a second stage. In June 2023, AGL announced a Memorandum of Understanding with Solar Recovery Corporation to investigate the feasibility of a solar panel materials recovery facility that could support a re-manufacturing supply chain. AGL is working with Federal and State governments to support the redevelopment of these sites . Further information in relation to workforce transition is available in the People scorecard.

From FY23.  ===== PAGE 26 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 24 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 The energy transition is an industry-wide transformation that will involve significant changes to the way in which AGL operates, and labour and skills required to operate our generation assets will change over time. At AGL, we recognise the importance of attracting, developing and retaining the right people to enable us to deliver value to our customers and stakeholders. We will seek to achieve this by building a safe, performance driven and values led culture that is reflective of the communities in which we operate. As we progress through the energy transition, our approach is to treat people fairly and with respect, and to work constructively and openly with our people to keep them informed and engaged. Safe and healthy workforce Consistent with the value of Be Safe. Be Supportive, AGL aims to identify and control risks in the workplace so our employees and contractors go home unharmed, both physically and mentally. The energy transition is raising many new safety challenges, including working with ageing plants, undertaking major demolition and rehabilitation projects, and incorporating new types of assets and operations into our portfolio. AGL has a comprehensive HSE Management System. The health and safety management systems used within the Customer Markets business successfully retained accreditation to ISO 45001 (2018), demonstrating the thoroughness of these systems. AGL invests significantly in understanding and minimising risk. In FY23, a periodic program of updating risk-assessments at all sites commenced. Additionally, a project to review and update all regulatory compliance requirements is underway. We continue to prioritise the protection of our people’s mental health. Awareness and training programs to employees were held during FY23, and additional specific reporting and measurement of mental health incidents was put in place to drive learning and improvement. Work-group risk-assessments on psycho-social hazards and controls commenced in March 2023, consistent with guidelines from Worksafe NSW. AGL seeks to engage, share and learn from other stakeholders in the sectors where we operate. Targeted health and safety forums with our major contractors have been strengthened. A major initiative in which AGL collaborated with our peers resulted in SafeWork Australia commencing the development of a national guide for safer solar installations. No health and safety Significant Incident and Fatality (SIF) events occurred in FY23; the last Significant Incident event occurred in December 2020. During FY23 the SIF prevention program concentrated on working at heights, falling and dropped objects, and contact with electricity. Total Injury Frequency Rate performance (TIFR) continued the long-term improvement trend in the first eight months. However, the last quarter of the year saw an increase in low-impact injuries. There was no discernible consistent cause for this, and a broad program and communication to maintain risk-awareness in all activities has been made.  FY23 FY22 TIFR employees 2.4 1.5 TIFR (employees + contractors) 2.8 2.1 Fatalities (employees + contractors) 0 0 Performance culture Building a performance culture where AGL’s employees are empowered as the driving force of a future-focused and purpose driven business is a critical enabler of AGL’s strategy.  Our focus includes improving employee engagement, building a gender-balanced and diverse workforce and ensuring employees feel connected to AGL’s purpose and values and enabled to deliver their role in the strategy. The FY23 employee engagement score increased 10 percentage points from FY22 to 67%. The increase in engagement is reflective of the Board and management renewal, AGL’s future-focused strategy, and the coordinated actions put in place in FY23 to improve communication and increase investment in employee growth and development. During FY23 over 300 employees participated in formal face-to-face leadership development programs which focused on building the future-ready skills and mindsets that are required to lead through the energy transition. We continue to strengthen our focus on diversity and inclusion, and are committed to ensuring that our workforce represents the communities in which we operate. In FY23 we were recognised as one of Australia’s top 10 companies in the Australian Network on Disabilities Access and Inclusion Index, awarded Family Inclusive Workplace status for the third consecutive year, and achieved Platinum status from Pride in Diversity, the highest obtainable recognition within the Australian Workplace Equality Index. Since we launched our inaugural Reconciliation Action Plan in FY21 we have also been focused on building our cultural competency to ensure that our workplace is culturally safe for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees. We are also striving to lift our current representation from 1.3%1 to 3%, reflecting the same proportion of Aboriginal 1. 1.3% of participants in AGL’s March 2022 Flexibility, Diversity and Inclusion survey identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander.  ===== PAGE 27 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 25 and Torres Strait Island peoples in Australia’s population. During FY23 we introduced ‘Sorry Business Leave’ for our employees who identify as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander peoples to participate in cultural practices, and delivered additional cultural learning opportunities for all employees. Traction on gender equality has not met AGL’s expectations and the proportion of females in the senior leadership pipeline declined from 35% to 33%. Improving gender diversity in the senior leadership pipeline is a priority in FY24 to ensure the decline is not further exacerbated from current levels. In FY23 AGL joined the Champions of Change Coalition as a founding member of a newly established Energy Group to support stronger action on gender equality. AGL continues to review gender pay equity twice-yearly and maintains a 0% gender pay gap in like-for-like roles. The roll out of ‘Respect@AGL’ training across the workforce remains a focus to provide employees with the skills and knowledge to build an inclusive and respectful culture. The design and launch of new values in FY23 (refer to the About AGL section) has created alignment and focus internally on behaviours and actions that will determine AGL’s success and are reinforced through recruitment, performance, reward, and recognition frameworks. The results of AGL’s focus on a performance culture are evident in reduced attrition (down from 22% in FY22 to 13% in FY23) and improved retention of key talent (up from 76% in F22 to 83% in FY23). Targets FY23 FY22 Employee engagement 67% 57% Attrition (total workforce)1 13% 20% Key talent retention 83% 76% Gender mix in SLP (% female) FY24: 35% FY25: 40% FY26: ≥40% 33% 35% Material breaches of Code of Conduct 0 0 1. Historical data has been restated to reflect a change in methodology for calculating attrition based on headcount rather than FTE. Workforce transition The energy transition will significantly change AGL’s workforce over the coming decade, and we have made a commitment to a respectful and responsible workforce transition. In FY23 a comprehensive capability program commenced, and a roadmap is in place to build capabilities required to deliver AGL’s assets development pipeline and low-carbon energy hubs (refer to the Assets scorecard). The capability program will continue in FY24 to ensure AGL is positioned to build, attract, and retain critical capability, as well as to identify opportunities to upskill and reskill employees to develop capabilities required for new and existing energy industries. In April 2023, we closed the last three units of the Liddell Power Station after nearly 52 years of operation. Supporting our Liddell workforce and the local community was a central part of our closure plans, and we delivered on our commitment to have no forced redundancies. Around 100 people (comprising over half of our Liddell employees) transferred to AGL’s Bayswater Power Station in continued employment, and all other employees were supported with individual transition plans, as they elected to retire or seek other opportunities. Also key to our closure strategy was the establishment of the Future U Hub in FY21, an on-site centre dedicated to supporting our people at Liddell to plan for their futures. This prioritised mental health support, with a focus on training that gave our people skills and tools to help manage their wellbeing and mental health during the closure process. Financial counselling, superannuation talks and information on retirement support was also provided, and as Liddell people transferred to Bayswater, leaders undertook training on how to successfully form new teams and integrate the two workforces. AGL was acknowledged by community and government stakeholders for the careful and respectful management of the closure and the expertise AGL gained has created a platform on which to build for future coal-fired generation asset closures.  ===== PAGE 28 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 26 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 As a key player in Australia’s interconnected energy industry, especially as the industry goes through the current period of significant transformation, it is vital that AGL fosters and perpetuates open and respectful relationships with our stakeholders. A wide variety of people and groups are interested in, or affected by, the decisions that AGL makes, or have a role in influencing the frameworks through which AGL makes decisions, including local communities and Traditional Owners, government, regulators, the energy industry and industry associations, non-government organisations and advocacy groups, suppliers, project partners, and lenders and investors. AGL strives to make a net positive social, economic and environmental contribution to the communities in which we operate. We proactively engage with our stakeholders on relevant issues in ways that are most appropriate to each group, prioritising the establishment of positive, respectful and transparent relationships. It is important to AGL that we build trust in our stakeholders by engaging openly with them, and by having them recognise that we consider their views in our decision-making. Engaged and supported communities We invest in the communities in which we operate through a structured program of community investment. In FY23, we invested approximately $4.8 million. There was a 26% increase in the overall amount of our investment compared to the previous financial year which was the result of growing our existing corporate community partnerships and establishing new community partnerships at our energy hubs to support AGL's energy transition. In FY23, we reviewed our community investment programs and partnerships to better align with our refreshed strategy, purpose and values and input from our stakeholders. Our community investment will focus on supporting programs and partnerships that contribute to building resilience in communities where we operate, support climate action and address energy affordability. We have consolidated some of our smaller contributions into more significant long-term partnerships to improve the impact of our investment and provide our community partners funding security over a longer timeframe rather than one-off donations. We will continue to review our community investment to ensure alignment with our strategic objectives. We continue to engage proactively with the communities where we currently operate through well-established Community Consultative Committees and Community Dialogue Groups. As we embark on new projects to deliver the commitments of our Climate Transition Action Plan, we will develop comprehensive community engagement strategies for each project to meaningfully engage and consult with key stakeholders, local communities and Traditional Owners in the proposed project locations. FY23 saw the conclusion of AGL’s inaugural Innovate Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP). During FY22 and FY23 we implemented several foundational priorities including building cultural competency, enhancing our workplace cultural safety, developing our First Nations Procurement Strategy, strengthening our long-standing relationships with Traditional Owners, and building new partnerships with Clontarf Foundation, Stars Foundations and Redfern Youth Connect. We also lent our support to the constitutional recognition of First Nations people by signing the Uluru Statement from the Heart. We believe establishing a First Nations Voice to Parliament is an important step in Australia’s reconciliation journey enabling First Nations people to have a say on policies that impact their lives and communities. While we have made progress through our inaugural RAP, we acknowledge the need for continued efforts to ensure better outcomes for Indigenous Australians. We received endorsement from Reconciliation Australia for our second Innovate RAP in June 2023, which will be implemented over FY24 and FY25. The commitments in our new RAP focus on creating pathways to sustainable futures for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples by supporting direct and indirect employment and through our investment in AGL’s energy transition. AGL conducts periodic community sentiment surveys to understand how the community and other stakeholders view AGL. We also undertake quarterly monitoring of our reputation via RepTrak. In FY23, AGL's RepTrak score was 65.6, remaining consistent with earlier performance, the slight decrease reflecting broader trends in the energy sector. We are committed to meeting all our tax compliance obligations, and to providing our stakeholders with information about the taxes we pay. In this regard we have adopted the Board of Taxation’s voluntary Tax Transparency Code. Our effective tax rate on Underlying Profit is broadly in line with the Australian corporate tax rate of 30% before prior year adjustments and the research and development concessions. FY23 FY22 Community contribution $4.8 m $3.8 m RepTrak score 65.6 65.8 Underlying effective tax rate 26.7% 23.2%  ===== PAGE 29 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 27 Collaboration for Australia's energy future As we navigate the decades-long energy transition in Australia, we recognise the value of positive and transparent relationships with governments, productive consultation with regulators, and respectful, collaborative relationships with industry and advocacy groups. AGL proactively engages with governments on a regular basis, providing policy and technical input for government regulatory settings and pathways to net zero.  Ensuring trusted relations with governments and the public service is an important form of risk mitigation and provides a two-way flow of information relating to policy settings.  In line with our long-standing Political Donations Policy, we have not made any political donations (monetary or in-kind) over FY23. During FY23, AGL invested significant time consulting with governments and a wide range of stakeholders following the release of our Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP) and our plans to accelerate our exit from coal-fired generation.  It is important for governments and AGL to have a common understanding of how our commitments impact governments’ renewable energy and net-zero goals, and the implications of policy settings on the energy transition. We also held briefing sessions for civil society stakeholders including Greenpeace Australia Pacific, Beyond Zero Emission, Gippsland Climate Change Network, The Sunrise Project, Healthy Futures, Environment Victoria among several others to seek feedback following the release of our CTAP and better understand their views as we embark on the implementation of our CTAP. We will continue to proactively engage with key civil society stakeholders as we progress our energy transition plans. We are also partnering with governments and industry as we transition our thermal generation sites to industrial energy hubs, recognising that collaboration is critical for their successful delivery. Further information is available in the Assets scorecard. As the Australian economy faces rising cost of living challenges, AGL is acutely aware of how these challenges, together with the rising cost of energy, impact our customers. During FY23 we have engaged with governments to provide advice on how best to implement energy bill relief programs, as well as in relation to the customer support and advice programs that AGL has in place for customers. AGL has further developed the range of support programs to provide complementary assistance to vulnerable customers to minimise the impact of current cost of living pressures. AGL also engages on a regular basis with customer representatives through the AGL Customer Council, which has been operating since 1998. The Council meets on a quarterly basis to discuss a wide range of matters that affect our customers and the communities in which we operate. The continuing aim of the Council is to enable two-way communication between AGL and representatives of our residential and business customers, including older Australians and people from culturally and linguistically diverse communities. AGL regularly engages with state and federal energy regulators, the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) in order to advocate for market designs that we believe best meet the needs of the power system and our customers, as well as meet the National Energy Objectives . We actively participate in consultation processes regarding proposed changes to energy market policies and procedures, providing data, analysis and technical industry expertise. Our submissions to these processes are publicly available on AGL’s website. AGL is a member of several industry associations which provide a range of benefits including access to industry information and analysis, relationship building, and an additional avenue to prosecute unified industry views on energy, climate change and related policies. We contribute to the development of policy advocacy strategies for many of these organisations through participation in a number of industry working groups. Other associations, particularly those associated with AGL’s generation facilities, provide a valuable link to local communities and a forum within which to work together with key stakeholders. We are also a member of several associations which focus on a specific technical area not specific to the energy sector, such as tax, health and safety, and diversity and inclusion. In accordance with our Industry Association Membership Policy, we review memberships annually to ensure that the values and policy positions of these organisations are closely aligned with those of AGL. Where there is any misalignment, we actively take steps to address any disagreements or consider the merits of ongoing membership with the association where the misalignment is significant and unable to be resolved. Strong business relationships A variety of other stakeholders can have significant influence on Australia’s energy transition. AGL recognises the importance of building strong relationships with these stakeholders, including our suppliers, project partners, and providers of financial capital. With over 4500 suppliers, our Supplier Code of Conduct governs our procurement practices with a key focus on engaging with suppliers that share similar values and commitments as AGL, while also supporting our suppliers to manage the ESG impact of the goods and services they supply to us. Throughout FY23 AGL has been developing improved processes with regards to our supplier selection and assessment criteria to ensure we continue to increase our rigour in relation to ESG impacts. These process improvements have focused on Modern Slavery, Cyber Security, Security of Critical Infrastructure reforms and other elements of our procurement procedures and processes. Payment of small suppliers has continued to be a strong focus in FY23. AGL has improved our performance in meeting the Australian Government’s Small Business Payment Times Reporting Scheme targets. During FY23, we reduced the time taken to pay small business invoices by approximately 4.5%, helping to support small businesses manage their cash flow.  ===== PAGE 30 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 28 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 AGL exceeded our target to increase our procurement spend with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander suppliers to $3 million by FY23, procuring $3.9 million of goods and services and forming many strong relationships with First Nations owned businesses. Numerous suppliers to AGL have also engaged First Nations suppliers to further improve our impact in this area. Our Reconciliation Action Plan commitments for FY24/FY25 include actions to drive further improvement, and we have increased our target by 90% to $5.7 million by FY25. As noted within AGL’s Human Rights Policy, AGL believes protecting and upholding human rights within our operations and supply chains is vital to realising human rights for our people, the people we work with, our customers and the communities in which we operate. To deliver on this belief, AGL used risk indicators to identify and validate our modern slavery risk exposure in key areas of our operations and supply chains. AGL has identified key risk areas for modern slavery to be in offshore labour, the solar supply chain, and the sourcing of batteries and solar-related products. Throughout FY23 AGL has continued to take proactive steps to manage its modern slavery risk exposure, all of which have been aligned to our Risk Management Policy and standard risk management practices. These steps will be summarised in our fourth Modern Slavery Statement for the FY23 reporting period which will be available on our website in early 2024. Developing and maintaining strong relationships with lending banks and debt capital markets investors is a crucial element of securing the capital needed to invest in renewable energy projects and execute on AGL's strategy and decarbonisation targets. AGL has been focused on ensuring that lenders and investors that want to deploy capital to support the energy transition understand both AGL's strategy and the nuances of the Australian electricity market, particularly given that the carbon intensity of AGL’s generation portfolio will remain much higher than the industry average while the Loy Yang A Power Station is required for the stable, efficient and cost effective operation of the NEM. During FY23, AGL established a Green Finance Framework which sets out the process by which we have issued debt on an ongoing basis to fund capital expenditure for new firming capacity and renewable energy assets. This will support the delivery of AGL’s CTAP, driving more efficient access to capital for ‘green’ projects that meet the eligibility criteria specified in the Framework, which is guided by best practice principles and guidelines 1. In FY23 AGL undertook a successful $1.6 billion partial refinancing of the company which included the issuance of long-term debt in the US private placement market, along with the first time creation of a $500 million green capex loan issued under the Green Finance Framework. The strong lender and investor support for AGL reflects the market's high level of confidence in and support for AGL's strategy and decarbonisation plans. During FY23 AGL also refreshed our capital allocation framework, including our dividend policy (refer to Section 2) in order to both maximise future returns for our shareholders while enabling the transitioning of AGL's energy portfolio. 1. The Framework is consistent with the Green Loan Principles (GLP) as issued by the Asia-Pacific Loan Market Association (APLMA), the Green Bond Principles (GBP) and Climate Transition Finance Handbook (CTFH) as issued by the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) and the Climate Bonds Standard & Certification Scheme (CBS) where applicable.  ===== PAGE 31 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 29 AGL takes our environmental responsibilities very seriously, and recognises the high expectations of our stakeholders, both as we operate our power generation facilities and as we play our part in Australia’s decarbonisation journey.  We recognise that our stakeholders expect AGL to have strong and responsible transition plans that will lead AGL towards a net zero future, accompanied by measurable targets and transparent reporting. As we contribute to Australia’s decarbonisation through the responsible closure of our coal-fired power stations over time, we face significant rehabilitation obligations, which we undertake through various transition activities with careful monitoring and transparency. Future low-carbon world As Australia’s largest corporate emitter of greenhouse gases, actions taken by AGL to reduce emissions will have a material impact on Australia’s emission profile. Until the closure of the Liddell Power Station in April 2023, our operated Scope 1 and 2 emissions accounted for approximately 8% of Australia’s total emissions. In FY23, over 95% of our operated Scope 1 and 2 emissions and an estimated 57% of our total Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions arose from the combustion of black and brown coal in our power stations to generate electricity both for our customers and other customers in the NEM. The transition of AGL’s energy portfolio from one dominated by base-load generation to a portfolio of renewable and firming generation comprises one of the largest contributions to the decarbonisation of the Australian economy.  In September 2022, AGL published our inaugural Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP), furthering our track record of market-leading climate disclosures and our commitment to communicating transparently with our stakeholders. The CTAP documents AGL’s climate commitments, targets and ambitions, and recognises the need to balance responsible transition and rapid decarbonisation to keep Australia's electricity supply secure, reliable, and affordable. AGL has set the following emission reduction targets through the CTAP for its operated Scope 1 and 2 emissions: • Achieve a reduction of at least 17% in annual Scope 1 and 2 emissions against a FY19 baseline1 by FY242, following the closure of the Liddell Power Station. • Achieve a reduction of at least 52% in annual Scope 1 and 2 emissions against a FY19 baseline1 by FY353, following the closure of the Bayswater Power Station. • Achieve net zero emissions following the closure of AGL's coal-fired power stations (Liddell, Bayswater and Loy Yang A power stations4). The targeted closure dates for AGL’s thermal coal assets outlined in AGL’s CTAP are consistent with a decarbonisation scenario where the NEM achieves a well below two degrees outcome, and with the climate ambition of the 'Step Change' scenario within AEMO's 2022 Integrated System Plan. Our plan recognises that to achieve a net zero energy system in an orderly and efficient way, individual generators and asset owners will decarbonise at different rates as the NEM efficiently decarbonises as a whole. Market settings in the NEM will result in less reliable and higher-cost assets exiting the market first, while more reliable, lower-emissions, and lower-cost assets will remain in the system to support reliability and affordability objectives as the system rapidly decarbonises in the most efficient way. We received shareholder support for the CTAP through the ‘Say on Climate’ vote at our 2022 Annual General Meeting. As outlined in our CTAP, and in line with emerging best practice, we propose to put our decarbonisation plans to shareholder vote every three years. A summary of the progress made against our CTAP commitments over FY23 is available within our FY23 TCFD Report, available on our website. Our FY23 TCFD Report also provides further details on how we consider governance, risk management, strategy, and metrics and targets in relation to climate change. Further information on how we are transitioning our energy portfolio, including our development pipeline of renewable and firming projects and our energy hubs developments is available in the Assets scorecard, while information about how we are working with our customers, our people and our communities as we decarbonise is available in our Customer scorecard, People scorecard and Relationships scorecard respectively. Our total operated Scope 1 and 2 emissions in FY23 were 35.2 MtCO2e, down 12% compared to FY22, and down 18.5% against an FY19 baseline. The reduction in emissions is due to the extended Loy Yang A Unit 2 outage (which commenced in Q4 FY22), and the retirement of the Liddell Power Station at the end of April 2023. 1. Emissions comprise Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions for all facilities operated by AGL, as reported under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007. FY19 was selected as the baseline year as it provides a better reflection of representative historical output from thermal assets compared to FY20-FY22. 2. FY24 represents the first full financial year where no emissions from the Liddell Power Station occur following its closure in April 2023 (FY23). 3. FY35 represents the first full financial year where no emissions from the Bayswater Power Station occur following its closure by CY33 (FY34). 4. Loy Yang A Power Station is targeted to close by the end of FY35.  ===== PAGE 32 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 30 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 Target FY23 FY22 Operated Scope 1 & 2 emissions (MtCO2e) 35.21 40.1 Reduction in operated Scope 1 & 2 emissions compared to FY19 baseline FY24: 17% FY35: 52% 18.5%1 NR Controlled generation intensity (tCO2e/MWh) FY24: 0.845 0.9171 0.938 Emissions intensity of total revenue (ktCO2e/$m) 2.491 3.0 1.

Green revenue and portfolio transition targets and performance are included in the Customer scorecard and Assets scorecard respectively. Environmental stewardship AGL has a genuine commitment to operate in a responsible manner and a desire to reduce our environmental impact. We are committed to continuously improving our environmental management practices and performance. In FY23 AGL demonstrated our commitment to the natural environment through improvement programs to reduce air emissions and cultural heritage practices: • Air emissions: Australian coal-fired power station operators are under increasing scrutiny from regulators, environmental groups and the community in relation to air pollution. During FY23, AGL continued to implement actions to reduce NOx, SO2 and particulate emissions from the Liddell, Bayswater and Loy Yang A power stations, to assist AGL in meeting its obligations and managing its liabilities associated with air emissions from its coal-fired power stations. Programs undertaken to improve the flexibility of our thermal assets (refer to the Assets scorecard) also help the plants optimise fuel consumption (and lower air emissions) when operating at lower loads. • Cultural heritage: AGL is committed to improving our approach to the management of indigenous cultural heritage at our sites in conjunction with Traditional Owner groups to meet community expectations in addition to legislative requirements. Actions completed in FY23 included: the establishment of a Geographical Information Systems (GIS) database as a central repository of all recorded cultural heritage locations in proximity to AGL assets; updating AGL’s Cultural Heritage Standard, Cultural Heritage Standard Methodology, cultural heritage risk profile and, site-based Cultural Heritage management plans; improving site inductions to include details of cultural heritage sites and mitigation practices; and implementing training programs for employees to better understand legal requirements and AGL’s expectations in relation to managing cultural heritage and engaging with Traditional Owner groups.  During FY23, there were 30 Environmental Regulatory Reportable (ERR) incidents and four administrative non-compliance events as summarised below: • Nine events with negligible short-term local environmental impact: These events comprised administration non compliances (4), inability to complete monitoring due to equipment availability (1), and negligible risk unauthorised discharges to air/land/water (4). • 15 events with small scale short-term local impact (inside AGL’s operational area): These events comprised inability to complete monitoring due to equipment availability (1) and unauthorised discharges to air/land/water (14). • Eight events with moderate short- to medium-term impacts to environment (short-term clean-up required): All eight of these events were unauthorised discharges to air/land/water. More information on these events is included in the ESG Data Centre. • Two events with medium-term impacts to environment that may extend beyond AGL’s operational area: Both these events comprised unauthorised clearing of native vegetation outside of the operational area at Broken Hill. More information on these events is included in the ESG Data Centre. Programs are underway which seek to reduce the number of reportable events across our operational sites. For information on official cautions and Penalty Infringement Notices received during FY23 refer to the Environmental regulation section. FY23 FY22 Environmental Regulatory Reportable incidents1 30 13 1. In FY23 there was a change to the Environmental Regulatory Reportable (ERR) incidents definition. From FY23, an ERR incident is any Event that meets the notification criteria of a Regulatory Authority and may include: an Event that caused actual or potential material or serious environmental harm; a breach of an environmental licence condition that is not an administrative non-compliance; and monitoring unable to be completed due to availability of plant or specialist. An ERR incident may include events that have occurred on AGL managed site by an independent party. This definition change has resulted in an increase in ERR events reported as it comprises previous ERR and Voluntarily Regulatory Reportable (VRR) events into one figure.  ===== PAGE 33 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 31 Responsible rehabilitation AGL is committed to providing ongoing, transparent disclosure in relation to our approach to the progressive and final rehabilitation of assets at the end of their operational lives. The efficient closure of our ageing generation assets and the subsequent decommissioning, demolition and rehabilitation of these sites is a critical part of AGL’s plans deliver its energy hubs (refer to the Assets scorecard). During FY23, AGL ceased operations at two of its oldest power stations: Torrens A Power Station in September 2022, and Liddell Power Station in April 2023. This was a significant milestone in AGL’s transition journey for these sites, as we move from closure planning to delivery of decommissioning and demolition works. Decommissioning work at both Torrens A and Liddell has immediately commenced, to prepare the assets for demolition. FY23 transition activities focused on: • developing a ‘Transition Centre of Excellence’ to leverage capability and expertise of site closure and transition within AGL; • execution of the demolition and ash dam rehabilitation contract for Liddell Power Station; • conducting environmental, biodiversity and dam safety studies and progressing regulatory approvals to support closure projects; • significantly progressing the decommissioning and demolition planning for Torrens A Power Station; • rehabilitating 35.6 hectares of land at AGL Macquarie, including 23.5 hectares of the Liddell Ash Dam and 12.1 hectares of the Ravensworth Voids; • expediting dust mitigation activities for the Liddell Ash Dam, including the application of dust suppressants and commencement of the first stage of post-closure capping and rehabilitation which will cover 140 hectares over two years; • decommissioning and demolition planning for the Rosalind Park Gas Processing Facility; and • progressive ‘plug and abandon’ of gas wells at the Camden Gas Project with 17 wells completed in FY23 and a total of 112 wells rehabilitated of a total of 144 wells. During FY24, transition activities will focus on: • completion of decommissioning and commencement of demolition works at Liddell and Torrens A power stations; • progression of the Liddell Ash Dam capping and rehabilitation; • closure of the Camden Gas Project, and decommissioning and demolition of the Rosalind Park Gas Processing Facility; • ongoing ‘plug and abandon’ of gas wells at Camden Gas Project; and • decommissioning of the 2 MW Cairn Curran Hydro Power Station. AGL also undertakes progressive rehabilitation works at Loy Yang Mine, Silver Springs, Moranbah and Ravensworth facility in line with regulatory obligations and approvals. Progressive rehabilitation of ash dams and mines associated with AGL’s coal generation assets, as well as decommissioning and rehabilitation of gas production wells undertaken in FY23, is outlined in the ESG Data Centre. A summary of the updated provisions for environmental rehabilitation as at 30 June 2023 is provided below. The discount rate used to derive the present value of the estimated cash flows was revised to reflect current interest rates and increased from 5.14% to 6.86%, consistent with standard accounting practice. The cash flow changes offset by the increased discount rate have resulted in an increase in the provision for environmental restoration of $246 million, which is reflected in AGL’s financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2023. The increase in rehabilitation costs at AGL Loy Yang FY23 also reflect the accelerated closure timetables for this asset as communicated to the market in September 2022.

Asset and data security measures ensure we can safeguard customer information entrusted to us, enabling us to navigate an increasingly complex digital landscape. AGL’s management of wholesale trading and risk management ensures prudent decision-making and effective mitigation of potential risks and volatility affecting our customers. Enhancing customer experience AGL’s continued focus on technology transformation over FY23 supports our overarching objective to deliver contemporary and resilient technology platforms and services that enable our business to meet the changing needs of our customers, to effectively compete in the market, and to grow and innovate. We understand that as technology advances, customers are no longer just comparing AGL to other energy retailers; they expect seamless digital experiences and instant access to personalised information. We are seeing momentum building through our customers increasingly embracing digital interactions, and we have achieved improvements in our continual drive to be 'Digital First', with the proportion of our customers who have accessed AGL's digital channels materially increasing. During FY23 we have simplified our product portfolio by 52% against an FY20 baseline, and are continuing to leverage AI with over five million transactions now managed through this technology. Technology changes form a critical part of AGL’s ‘Retail Next’ technology transformation program to dramatically simplify its technology architecture and deliver significant capability uplift. We also continue to invest in further enhancing the digital experience for our business customers. We have expanded our commercial solar monitoring and management platform to support more than 210 MW of our business customers’ solar assets, optimising asset performance to ensure customers are benefiting from maximum solar production, lowering costs and improving asset returns.

Improvement compared to May 2023 baseline. Trading, operation, and risk management capabilities During FY23, AGL continued to focus on delivering greater value through improved risk insights and enhanced market and portfolio analysis. AGL’s position as an integrated energy generator and retailer means we can effectively manage price volatility in the energy markets for our customers. We do this by implementing considered energy trading and hedging strategies, and through the safe and efficient operation of our generation assets. AGL’s risk management framework includes the Trading Risk Policy, which governs our energy hedging and related activities. The policy allows for the commercial optimisation of AGL’s portfolio provided that all activities adhere to an overall risk limit that reflects AGL’s risk appetite. As a responsible market participant, we take our compliance, risk and regulatory obligations seriously. Our policies and procedures are updated periodically to reflect our obligations under market rules and relevant laws, and compliance obligation registers are maintained to ensure these obligations are owned and managed by the appropriate business units. Relevant staff are required to perform periodic online and face-to-face training and are encouraged to maintain professional accreditation. With the investment of our Energy Trading & Risk Management (ETRM) Uplift in FY22, we have been able to improve our governance processes as well as the quality of our decision-making. The ETRM Uplift replaced AGL’s ageing energy trading systems, automated manual processes, and strengthened internal controls, as well as addressing market changes such as 5-minute settlements. It also provided a foundation to support business growth via the introduction of an integrated data platform which has enhanced data governance and data quality. Our technology investment has also improved the sophistication of our decision-making, such as the algorithmic optimisation and automated bidding of our growing large-scale battery fleet and our Virtual Power Plant (VPP), which incorporates distributed assets like batteries and hot water units in our customers’ homes. With the projected shift to electrification expected to result in gradual decline of customer gas demand, AGL will continue to contract gas to support AGL and customer requirements. During FY23, AGL contracted 161 PJ of gas supplies for future periods to replace contracts that are expiring over time, including new supply agreements with Cooper Energy, Senex, Exxon and others.  ===== PAGE 35 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 33 By investing in our generating assets, our technology and our people, AGL is well-placed to deliver on managing energy price risks for our customers. Secure assets and data AGL manages a significant number of assets, including systems, software and networks on which we and others rely, as well as critical infrastructure assets owned and operated by AGL. We also protect a significant amount of confidential information, including personal information and data records of our customers. AGL undertakes a comprehensive process to identify, assess and mitigate key cybersecurity risks, which leverages the Australian Energy Sector Cyber Security Framework as well as international cybersecurity frameworks, and is in line with regulatory requirements such as the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 and the Privacy Act 1988.  Cybersecurity and resilience is a Tier 1 Strategic Risk overseen by the board as part of our enterprise-wide risk management program (refer to the FY23 Tier 1 Strategic Risks section).  The measures we take to protect our assets and data do not eliminate risk. There is always a risk that security breaches, unauthorised access, malicious software, external attacks or internal breaches could occur that adversely impact our operations and confidential information. Continual investment and uplift in a significant portfolio of security capabilities, processes and measures to manage the ever-changing cyber environment are in place to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of assets and data. We proactively manage cyber risk to limit the likelihood of inappropriate access to our systems and data, and to limit the impact of cyber security incidents through preparation and rapid response capabilities.  Security vulnerabilities are managed via a dedicated threat and vulnerability management team and automated scanning platforms, as well as specialist technical assurance, including penetration testing. We have achieved a high level of stability throughout the year with a significant reduction of major incidents from 50 incidents in FY22 to 34 incidents in FY23, continuing the downward trend from prior years.  This trend is attributed to robust change management processes, heightened focus on remediation actions, improved proactive monitoring and detection, and a dedicated focus on handling lower priority incident management to prevent issues from escalating into major incidents. In FY23 only one major IT incident was attributed to cyber security.  In this incident attackers tried to test and validate credentials they had gained from other known external breaches or via the Dark Web to see if they worked in the AGL MyAccount portal.  AGL implemented additional security controls to mitigate against similar incidents and further strengthen security over customer accounts. Across FY23, AGL identified and reported three separate Notifiable Data Breaches to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. All three cases involved an external threat actor attempting to gain access to customer personal information through obtaining access to the customer's account details with AGL. In each case, AGL has conducted a detailed analysis of the root cause of the incident, and implemented additional targeted controls or strategies to reduce the likelihood of an incident occurring with the same or a similar attack pattern.

The principal drivers of the decrease were a negative movement in the fair value of financial instruments, a higher value of asset impairments taken in FY23 compared to prior year predominantly due to the earlier targeted closure of Loy Yang A Power Station, and reduction in favourable onerous contract movements. 4.1.1 Reconciliation of Statutory (Loss)/Profit to Underlying Profit AGL uses Underlying Profit as a key measure of financial performance. Underlying Profit is derived from Statutory Profit, as measured in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, and excluding significant items and movements in the fair value of financial instruments. The use of Underlying Profit enhances comparability of results by excluding non-recurring events and transactions that materially affect the financial results of AGL for the reporting period. Underlying Profit after tax was $281 million, up 24.9% from the prior year. A description of the factors driving Underlying Profit is included in Section 4.1.5.

This was partly offset by the partial reversal of the previously recognised impairment of the Moranbah Gas Project of $51 million ($36 million post-tax). • Recognised $30 million ($21 million post-tax) in costs related to redundancy provisions for employees impacted by the planned closure of the Torrens Island Power Station and Camden operations.  ===== PAGE 37 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 35 • Recognised $14 million ($10 million post-tax) in separation and re-integration costs related to the proposed demerger of AGL. • Recognised $47 million ($33 million post-tax) due to the reduction in rehabilitation provision assets that had previously been impaired. The reduction in rehabilitation provision was driven by an increase in the discount rate following market changes in base rates. • Recognised $17 million ($15 million post-tax) revenue related to contingent milestones under the FY21 Wellington North Solar Farm sale being met in the current year. • Recognised $7 million ($7 million post-tax) revenue related to the sale of land as part of a NSW government compulsory acquisition. • Recognised a reduction in the onerous contract liability of $2 million ($1 million post-tax) related to various renewable asset power purchase agreements (PPAs). FY22 During the prior year AGL: • Recognised a pre-tax impairment of $246 million ($172 million post-tax) relating to Newcastle Gas Storage Facility, Newcastle Gas Peaker development rights and Collins Street lease right-of-use assets. This was partly offset by the reversal of a previously recognised impairment of AGL's investment in Tilt Renewables of $14 million ($10 million post tax). • Recognised $61 million pre-tax ($42 million post-tax) in costs related to redundancies and restructuring to deliver future cost reductions, and the integration of acquired businesses including completion of the SEGH Pty Limited and Epho Holdings Pty Limited integrations and Phase 2 of the integration of Southern Phone Company. • Recognised $125 million pre-tax ($89 million post-tax) in separation costs related to the proposed demerger of AGL. • Recognised $65 million pre-tax ($46 million post-tax) due to the reduction in the rehabilitation provision for certain assets that had previously been impaired. The reduction in rehabilitation provision was driven by an increase in the discount rate following market changes in base rates. In addition to this the estimated closure date of Camden was revised impacting the timing of cash flows. • Recorded a reduction in the valuation of onerous contracts of $1,019 million ($713 million post-tax) as a result of higher electricity and large-scale generation certificate forward prices along with higher discount rates. • Recognised $20 million in other revenue related to AGL's sale of the purchase option to re-power 50% of the Macarthur Wind Farm following the completion of the existing lease in 2038. 4.1.3 Movement in fair value of financial instruments recognised in Profit or Loss Movement in the fair value of financial instruments recognised in profit or loss (excluded from Underlying Profit) was $(1,271) million ($(890) million post-tax), down from $212 million ($149 million post-tax). The net loss reflected a negative fair value movement in net buy electricity level 1 and level 2 derivatives mainly due to significant downward movements in short to medium term forward curves across FY23 and a negative fair value movement in oil and gas derivative contracts as a result of higher forward prices. The fair value loss on treasury derivatives of $(3) million recognised in profit or loss reflected hedge ineffectiveness.

The principal drivers of the increase were higher Trading and Origination Gas gross margin driven by higher oil prices on a net long position and haulage optimisation, and higher Consumer Gas and Electricity gross margin due to higher revenue rates and higher demand. This was partly offset by increased operating costs and lower Trading and Origination Electricity gross margin due to a reduction in generation volumes at Bayswater, Liddell and AGL Loy Yang power stations in addition to the impact of short positions exposed to high pool prices during the month of July 2022.

Refer to Section 5 for further analysis on the movement in gross margin for each operating segment and Section 3.1.6 for commentary on Group operating costs. Depreciation and amortisation of $(728) million was up 1.5%, driven by the impact of the targeted earlier closure dates of AGL Loy Yang and Bayswater Power Station, and a higher asset base due to an increase in environmental rehabilitation assets at AGL Loy Yang and increased investment at Bayswater Power Station. Net finance costs were $(258) million, up 18.9% largely driven by rehabilitation provision interest costs and debt facility interest costs. Underlying tax expense was $(100) million, primarily reflecting the increase in Underlying Profit before tax.

Total working capital movements were $(168) million, compared with $404 million in the prior year. Components of working capital movement were: • Receivables cash flow of $147 million reflected the reversal of an AEMO deposit which was a security requirement driven by the market volatility in June 2022 and roll-off of wholesale gas customers.  This was partly offset by higher consumer revenue compared with the prior year. • Payables cash flow of $(206) million reflected the payments made for energy as a result of AGL being a net purchaser of electricity during the unprecedented market intervention in June 2022, lower pool purchases, lower realised derivative positions, and lower generation volume at an overall lower electricity spot price.  This was partly offset by higher unbilled network costs resulting from higher customer consumption compared with prior year. • Inventory cash flow of $(8) million reflected higher gas storage volumes due to lower net gas withdrawals and increase in spot purchases of coal at higher prices. This was partly offset by lower coal volume purchases and a reduction in Sustainable Business Energy Solutions (SBES) solar inventory.  • Net derivative premiums paid of $(20) million reflected the timing differences of derivative premiums amortised and derivative premiums paid. • Financial assets/liabilities (margin calls) cash flow of $(103) million reflected lower electricity market prices on a buy position, partly offset by a bank guarantee replacement for initial margin and changes in margin requirements. The prior year cash flow of $180 million reflected a reduction in variation margin with a favourable buy position at a lower strike price against a lifting market price between June 2021 to June 2022, partly offset by an increase in initial margin due to an increase in net volume traded. • Green assets/liabilities cash flow of $43 million reflected higher Large-Scale Renewable Energy Certificate (LREC) prices for forward purchases factored into compliance liability in FY23, partly offset by a short term cash flow management strategy to lower inventory holdings of green certificates.  ===== PAGE 40 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 38 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 The onerous contracts cash flow of $(120) million reflected the onerous portion of payments made to suppliers under legacy wind farm off take agreements and Yabulu PPA and Gas Transport Agreements (GTAs) previously recognised as onerous. The movement in other assets/liabilities of $(9) million included the reversal of restructure related payables, employee provisions, and the amortisation of unearned revenue. Payments for rehabilitation of $(55) million includes payments for the ongoing decommissioning of the Liddell Power Station and related infrastructure, and the decommissioning and rehabilitation of gas wells. Cash tax refund of $1 million related to the receipt of tax instalments previously paid. Investing cash flows of $(729) million primarily reflected capital expenditure, the majority being sustaining expenditure and capital injections to Tilt Renewables. The prior year included capital expenditure, the acquisition of Tilt Renewables, and the sale of investments in Energy Impact Partners' Fund, Activate Capital Partners, and Ecobee Inc.  For further details on capital expenditure, see Section 3.1.6. Financing activities cash flows of $(159) million primarily reflected $(121) million dividend payments and $(39) million net repayment of borrowings.  The prior year included $(302) million net repayment of borrowings. 4.3 Financial position Summary Statement of Financial Position At 30 June 2023 AGL’s total assets were $15,238 million, a decrease from $19,270 million at 30 June 2022, primarily due to a $1,290 million decrease in current trade receivables reflecting significant energy price decreases reducing the value of closing balances, a $2,605 million decrease in energy derivatives and a $595 million decrease in property, plant and equipment primarily due to an impairment loss recognised in the current year, partly offset by an increase in rehabilitation assets reflecting the increases in estimated environmental rehabilitation costs. Other current assets includes $185 million of upstream gas assets classified as held for sale related to the Moranbah and North Queensland Energy joint operations (Moranbah Gas Project) and Surat Gas Project. Total liabilities at 30 June 2023 were $10,119 million, a decrease from $12,753 million at 30 June 2022, primarily reflecting a $1,480 million movement in energy derivatives, $1,337 million decrease in trade and other payables reflecting significant energy price decreases reducing the value of closing balances and a decrease in onerous contracts provisions. This was partly offset by an increase in environmental rehabilitation provisions driven by the earlier targeted closure date of AGL thermal generation assets, additional ESG costs, and borrowings. Other liabilities includes $220 million of upstream gas liabilities classified as held for sale related to Moranbah Gas Project and Surat Gas Project. Total equity at 30 June 2023 was $5,119 million, down from $6,517 million, reflecting the Statutory Loss for the year and dividends paid. AGL’s return on equity of 4.9%, calculated on a rolling 12-month basis was 1.2pp up from 30 June 2022.

AGL generates electricity or has contracted gas supply in excess of its customers’ demand in some states. In other states, AGL has sources of supply less than its customers’ demand. AGL uses certain financial instruments (derivatives) to manage these energy price risks and to manage its exposure to interest and foreign exchange rates arising in the normal course of business, provided the overall AGL risk appetite is not exceeded. The majority of these financial instruments exchange a fixed price for a floating market-based price of a given commodity, interest rate, currency or a quoted asset, with the net differential being settled with the counterparty. AGL is exposed to price volatility on the sale and purchase of energy-related commodities in the normal course of business, and therefore enters into contracts that minimise the price risk to AGL on both sold and purchased forecast exposures. AGL has in place a governance framework that establishes the policy guidelines under which energy hedging activities are conducted. Key components of that policy include segregation of duties, independent risk oversight, earnings-at-risk limits, compliance management and regular reporting to the Board. The risk policy represents the Board and Senior Management's commitment to an effective risk management function to ensure appropriate management and oversight of AGL’s risks related to wholesale markets energy risk. The policy allows for commercial optimisation of the portfolio provided that AGL adheres to overall earnings-at-risk limits that reflect its risk appetite. Energy price risk AGL’s energy-related derivatives recognised in profit or loss include sell and buy positions, where AGL receives or pays a fixed price from or to a counterparty in exchange for a floating price paid or received. AGL is required to make margin payments in respect of futures contracts traded through the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Initial margin call payments are made at the time contracts are entered in order to manage intra-day credit exposure. The quantum of initial margin depends on the volume traded, the expected market volatility as well as forward electricity prices at the time. The initial margin call can move subsequently as forward prices move. AGL also receives or makes payments known as variation margin calls, which cover mark to market movements of AGL’s open futures position. These typically reverse through future earnings as contract positions roll off. Treasury related risk AGL’s treasury related risk primarily relates to interest and foreign currency rate fluctuations. Contracts to minimise the exposure to market-based fluctuations are executed pursuant to AGL’s treasury risk management policy. These contracts primarily result in fixed interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts are designated in hedge relationships when they can be matched to forecast transactions with sufficient probability of the forecast transaction occurring. In addition to the above, AGL is counterparty to cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements to convert its fixed interest rate US dollar private placement borrowing instruments to floating interest rate Australian dollar equivalent borrowing instruments. The cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements are designated as fair value and cash flow hedge relationships. Movement in fair value The initial fair value of a derivative is the consideration paid or received (the premium). Fair value movements in any given period are a function of changes to underlying indices, market prices or currencies and the roll-off of realised contractual volumes or amounts. A reconciliation of the movements in financial instruments carried at fair value for FY23 is presented in the following table.  ===== PAGE 42 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 40 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 Net assets/(liabilities) FY23 $m FY22 $m Change $m Energy derivative contracts (189) 937 (1,126) Cross currency and interest rate swap derivative contracts 141 219 (78) Total net assets/(liabilities) for financial instruments (48) 1,156 (1,204) Change in net assets/liabilities (1,204) Premiums paid (107) Premium roll off 90 Equity accounted fair value (92) Total change in fair value (1,313) Recognised in equity hedge and other reserve (26) Recognised in borrowings (71) Recognised in profit or loss – pre-tax (1,216) Total change in fair value (1,313) The movement in net derivative assets/(liabilities) in the period of $(1,204) million is expanded on in the table below.

The net loss reflected a negative fair value movement in net buy electricity level 1 and level 2 derivatives mainly due to the significant short to medium term forward curve drop in June 2023 and a negative fair value movement in oil and gas derivative contracts as a result of higher forward prices. • A decrease in fair value of $78 million of cross currency and interest rate swaps was recognised due to the maturity of $54 million cross currency swaps with the repayment of USD senior notes, and a $24 million fair value reduction mainly driven by the decrease in interest rate curves.  ===== PAGE 43 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 41 5. Segmental Analysis AGL manages its business in three key operating segments: Customer Markets, Integrated Energy and Investments. Further detail on the activities of each operating segment is provided below. AGL manages and reports a number of expense items including Technology within Centrally Managed Expenses. These costs are not reallocated to AGL’s operating segments because their management is the responsibility of various corporate functions. A reconciliation of segment results and Underlying Profit after tax is provided in the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 Segment information. 5.1 Customer Markets Customer Markets comprises the Consumer and Large Business customer portfolios responsible for the retailing of electricity, gas, broadband/ mobile/voice, solar and energy efficiency products and services to residential, small and large business customers. Customer Markets sources its energy from Integrated Energy at transfer prices that reflect wholesale energy costs in each state, along with other energy costs such as those arising from environmental schemes. Customer Markets also includes sales, marketing, brand, and AGL's customer contact and call centre operations. Following the integration of Telecommunications, certain costs associated with Telecommunications Technology and Corporate functions were transferred from Customer Markets to Centrally Managed Expenses. 5.1.1 Underlying EBIT Customer Markets Underlying EBIT was $248 million, up 37.0% due to higher margin across Consumer, Telecommunications, Perth Energy and Sustainable Business Energy Solutions (SBES) portfolios, partly offset by higher operating costs due to an increase in net bad debt expense.

Includes fees, charges, and recoveries. Excludes depreciation and amortisation, and the impact of digital uplift expenses (Software as a Service). Average consumer services increased compared with the prior year largely due to growth in Telecommunications services and growth in gas services, largely within Victoria and Western Australia, partly offset by a small decline in electricity services, particularly in New South Wales. Gross Margin per consumer service increased compared to the prior year due to higher revenue as a result of focused value management, higher usage driven by increased solar volumes and gas customer services growth, and increased margins in Telecommunications as a result of growth in Telecommunications services. 5.2 Integrated Energy The Trading and Origination components of Integrated Energy are responsible for managing the price risk associated with trading electricity and gas for AGL’s customers and for managing AGL’s obligations in relation to renewable energy schemes. They also control the dispatch of AGL’s owned and contracted generation assets and associated portfolio of energy hedging products. • Trading and Origination - Electricity reflects the trading of key fuel inputs and hedging of AGL's wholesale electricity requirements, and also includes Eco Markets, which reflects the management of AGL's liabilities relating to both voluntary and mandatory renewable and energy efficiency. • Trading and Origination - Gas reflects the sourcing and management of AGL's gas supply and transportation portfolio. Trading and Origination - Gas is also responsible for the management of the price exposures related to AGL's oil-linked wholesale gas contracts. • Trading and Origination – Other reflects the Trading and Origination resourcing and support, in addition the Decentralised Energy Resources business is responsible for the management of other growth initiatives in AGL’s orchestration pathway alongside Customer Markets.  ===== PAGE 45 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 43 The Operations and Other components of Integrated Energy comprises AGL’s power generation portfolio and other key sites and operating facilities across the Coal, Gas Generation, Renewables, Natural Gas, and Other business units. • Coal primarily comprises AGL Macquarie (Bayswater and Liddell power stations) and AGL Loy Yang. Liddell Power Station ceased generation on 28 April 2023 and the site will be rehabilitated and transitioned to an industrial renewable energy hub. • Gas Generation primarily comprises AGL Torrens, Barker Inlet Power Station, Kwinana Swift Power Station and Somerton Power Station. As announced in November 2022, AGL Torrens will close its three remaining units in operation on 30 June 2026 and will be transitioned into an industrial renewable energy hub. • Renewables primarily comprises hydroelectric power stations, the operation of solar power as well as wind power generation. Operational costs to maintain the wind farms are reported within Trading and Origination – Electricity to align with the gross margin of the related power purchase agreements. • Natural Gas includes the Surat Gas Project, the natural gas production assets at Camden in New South Wales, the Newcastle Gas Storage Facility and the Moranbah Gas Project. As of 30 June 2023, the Moranbah Gas Project and Surat Gas Project are held for sale. The Moranbah Gas Project divestment is expected to be completed by early 2024. • Other primarily consists of the Energy Hubs business focused on the development and construction of greenfield growth opportunities related to renewable and firming capacity, and technical and business support functions. 5.2.1 Underlying EBIT Integrated Energy Underlying EBIT was $753 million, up $110 million or 17.1%, largely due to higher gross margin from Trading and Origination – Gas. This was partly offset by lower gross margin from Trading and Origination – Electricity, an increase in Coal operating costs and an increase in depreciation and amortisation. FY23 $m FY22 $m Gross margin 2,046 1,871 Operating costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation) (762) (725) Underlying EBITDA 1,284 1,146 Depreciation and amortisation (531) (503) Underlying EBIT 753 643 Gross margin was $2,046 million, up $175 million due to higher margin in the gas portfolio, as a result of high oil prices on a net long position, haulage optimisation, and the recovery of wholesale and consumer customer margin reflecting rising gas costs in recent years that were previously absorbed by AGL. In addition, the electricity portfolio benefited from higher contracted prices outside of Victoria, higher hydroelectric generation revenue, and lower volatility in May and June 2023. This was partly offset by exposure to high pool prices, mainly during the month of July 2022 when AGL was short electricity in the market, the major outage of Unit 2 at AGL Loy Yang and the retirement of three Units at Liddell Power Station in April 2023 resulting in lower generation, and higher coal generation costs. Operating costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation) were $(762) million, an increase of $37 million compared with the prior year due to higher labour costs driven by Enterprise Agreement wage escalations and increased costs to maintain plant availability across the thermal fleet. This was partly offset by labour efficiencies and the closure of Liddell Power Station in April 2023. For further details see Section 5.2.2.  ===== PAGE 46 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 44 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 The following table provides a breakdown of the contributors to Underlying EBITDA and Underlying EBIT: FY23 $m FY22 $m Trading and Origination - Electricity 1,429 1,455 Trading and Origination - Gas 437 239 Trading and Origination - Other (31) (40) Coal (440) (406) Gas Generation (38) (43) Renewables (26) (18) Natural Gas 9 - Other (56) (41) Underlying EBITDA 1,284 1,146 Depreciation and amortisation (531) (503) Underlying EBIT 753 643 • Trading and Origination – Electricity gross margin was $1,429 million, down 1.8%, largely due to a reduction in generation volumes at Bayswater, Liddell and Loy Yang A power stations and exposure to high pool prices during July 2022 when AGL was short electricity in the market. In addition, in Eco Markets there was an increase in costs due to a lagged recovery of increasing LREC prices coupled with the timing of SREC compliance cost recovery from customers. Gross margin was also down due to higher input costs, primarily coal, gas and diesel costs as a result of recent international market events. This was partly offset by an increase in consumer and business customers contracted pricing, lower exposure to high pool prices during May and June 2023 compared to market events in 2022, and higher hydroelectric generation. • Trading and Origination – Gas gross margin was $437 million, up 82.8%, driven by high oil prices on a net long position and haulage optimisation, the recovery of wholesale and consumer customer margin reflecting rising gas costs in recent years that were previously absorbed by AGL, and higher internal generation rates. This was partly offset by higher gas costs due to higher spot market purchases as a result of ROLR events in the first quarter of the year and higher oil-linked contract prices. • Trading and Origination – Other Underlying EBITDA was $(31) million, up 22.5% mainly due to the realignment of the Decentralised Energy Resources business, higher orchestration revenue and labour efficiencies. • Coal Underlying EBITDA was $(440) million, down 8.4%, driven by higher costs to maintain plant availability, and increased labour costs due to Enterprise Agreement wage escalations. This was partly offset by the reduction in costs from the closure of Liddell Power Station, and labour efficiencies. • Gas Generation Underlying EBITDA was $(38) million, up 11.6%, predominantly driven by labour efficiencies. • Renewables Underlying EBITDA was $(26) million, down 44.4%, predominantly driven by increased labour costs due to Enterprise Agreement wage escalations, and higher maintenance costs, including an unplanned maintenance event at Clover Power Station. • Natural Gas Underlying EBITDA was $9 million, up $9 million, driven by higher gas sales at Camden and the Moranbah Gas Project, and lower field development costs for the Moranbah Gas Project. This was partly offset by increased costs of well workover activities in the Surat Basin. • Other Underlying EBITDA was $(56) million, down 36.6%, driven by the transfer of Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) function costs from Centrally Managed Expenses to Integrated Energy, and increased feasibility studies for the energy hub sites. This was partly offset by lower insurance premiums.  ===== PAGE 47 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 45 5.2.2 Operating costs Integrated Energy operating costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation) of $(762) million increased by 5.1% compared with the prior year.

This was partly offset by the impact of the impairments resulting from AGL’s Review of Strategic Direction (RoSD) outcomes announced in September 2022. • Gas Generation depreciation and amortisation was $(35) million, down 20.5% driven by the impact of the impairment of AGL Torrens resulting from AGL’s RoSD outcomes announced in September 2022. • Renewables depreciation and amortisation was $(35) million, flat with the prior year. • Natural Gas depreciation and amortisation was $(6) million, broadly flat with the prior year. • Other Integrated Energy depreciation and amortisation was $(34) million, up 36.0%, driven by a higher asset base due to the completion of the leased Wandoan battery in June 2022.  ===== PAGE 48 ===== Operating & Financial Review For the year ended 30 June 2023 46 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 5.3 Centrally Managed Expenses AGL manages and reports certain expense items including technology costs within Centrally Managed Expenses. These costs are not reallocated to AGL’s operating segments because their management is the responsibility of various corporate functions. Following a structural review, certain costs associated with Telecommunications Technology and Corporate functions were transferred from Customer Markets to Centrally Managed Expenses, and the tranfer of the HSE function to Integrated Energy in the year. Centralised Managed Expenses Underlying EBIT was $(360) million, down 7.8%. This included the transfer of $(9) million of costs associated with the Telecommunication functions and $10 million of costs associated with the HSE function. Excluding the impact of transferred functions Underlying EBIT was down 8.0%, primarily due to the non-recurrence of benefits in the prior year, which included the movement in employee short term incentive provisions. Additionally, there was an uplift in cyber security spend to further enhance the protection of AGL’s operations and customers, increased travel and consultancy activities post COVID-19 and higher Board of Directors’ fees due to an increase in the number of AGL Board members.

The portfolio reviews in Section 6.2 and 6.3 start with volume information before summarising external customer revenue, customer network and other costs, fuel and gas costs net of hedging, and costs of managing and maintaining owned and contracted generation assets, to arrive at a portfolio’s margin. A per unit rate ($/MWh for electricity and $/GJ for gas) is derived from each category of revenue and cost using the relevant associated volumes. The tables in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 should be read in conjunction with Section 6.4 to reconcile the segmental revenue and costs allocated to each portfolio with Group Underlying EBIT. 6.1 Portfolio Review Summary to Underlying Profit after Tax FY23 $m Restated FY22 $m Electricity Portfolio Total revenue 7,119 6,614 Customer network, green compliance, and other cost of sales (3,634) (3,447) Fuel costs1 (861) (823) Generation running costs1 (804) (707) Depreciation and amortisation (491) (471) Net portfolio management (372) (146) Electricity Portfolio Margin (a) 957 1,020 Gas Portfolio Total revenue 2,737 2,511 Customer network and other cost of sales (587) (556) Gas purchases (1,051) (1,104) Haulage, storage and other (326) (342) Gas Portfolio Margin 773 509 Natural Gas 3 (7) Gas Portfolio Margin (including Natural Gas) (b) 776 502 Other AGL Other margin2 62 64 Customer Markets operating costs (536) (491) Integrated Energy other operating costs (89) (76) Investments operating costs (20) (21) Centrally Managed Expenses operating costs (286) (259) Other depreciation and amortisation (231) (238) Net finance costs (258) (217) Income tax expense (100) (66) Total Other AGL (c) (1,458) (1,304) Underlying Profit after Tax (a + b + c) 275 218 Non-controlling interests3 6 7 Underlying Profit after tax attributable to AGL shareholders 281 225 1.

All electricity volumes generated by AGL are sold into either the National Electricity Market (NEM) or Western Australian Wholesale Electricity Market (collectively the ''pool”) for which AGL receives pool generation revenue. Pool generation revenue is a function of volume and pool prices, which are set by the real-time market in each state. In the NEM, the total volume demanded by AGL customers is then purchased from the pool according to the geographical profile of customer demand and is reported as pool purchase volumes and costs. Where AGL’s customer demand volumes exceed pool generation volumes, the generation volume deficit needs to be purchased from the pool by AGL.

In the statutory accounts the amounts associated with these contracts are recognised within cost of sales. Net pool generation revenue and pool purchase costs were $(565) million, down $71 million, reflecting lower generation volumes mainly driven by the staggered closure of Liddell Power Station in April 2023, in addition to the Unit 2 major outage at AGL Loy Yang occurring during extended periods of price volatility in the NEM. Higher prices in the first quarter of FY23, particularly in July 2022, coupled with a number of thermal outages resulted in significantly higher pool generation and pool purchase prices. The net derivative revenue of $193 million decreased by $155 million, driven largely by the performance of the wholesale electricity derivatives.

Delivering on this commitment requires AGL to have a sound understanding of current governance requirements and practices, as well as being attuned to emerging governance trends and shifting stakeholder expectations. Set out below is a summary of selected aspects of AGL’s corporate governance framework and a summary of key governance focus areas during FY23. Throughout FY23, AGL’s corporate governance arrangements were consistent with the Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations (4th edition) published by the ASX Corporate Governance Council. AGL’s 2023 Corporate Governance Statement is available at agl.com.au/CorporateGovernance. AGL’s 2023 Corporate Governance Statement outlines AGL’s arrangements in relation to its Board, Board Committees, Executive Team, risk management framework and financial reporting, diversity and inclusion, key corporate governance policies and shareholder engagement. 7.1 Board skills AGL seeks to maintain a Board of Directors with a broad range of skills, knowledge and experience necessary to provide effective oversight over management and guide the strategic direction of the Company. The Board uses a skills matrix to identify the key skills and experience the AGL Board is seeking to achieve in its membership. The skills matrix is updated regularly by each Director rating their skills, expertise and experience from 1 to 3 for each identified skill. The self-assessment ratings are subsequently considered and approved by the Board. The skills matrix as at 10 August 2023 is set out in Table 7.2.2. In conducting the assessment, Directors were assessed using the following skills rating levels: Significant Experience – regarded to have expert or highly qualified proficiency, knowledge and experience in the subject matter or domain and has been seen to contribute these skills in Board and Committee conversations and critical thinking. Developed Understanding – developed a sound working knowledge and understanding of the subject matter through either past executive or management roles, extensive on-the-job application of skills in Board and Committee activities and/or through training and professional development activities. General Familiarity – possesses an awareness and base literacy around the subject/topic and its relevance to the organisation and the Board. Individual Director assessments were aggregated to inform an assessment of the overall level of capability represented across the Board in each of the identified priority areas. In the eleven identified areas, the Board as a whole was rated either as having Significant Experience or Developed Understanding. Further details about AGL's Board Skills Matrix are set out in AGL's 2023 Corporate Governance Statement available at agl.com.au/CorporateGovernance.  ===== PAGE 58 ===== Governance Summary For the year ended 30 June 2023 56 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 7.2 Key areas of focus during FY23 Table 7.2.1: Board Focus Areas during FY23 Key Focus Areas Business Value Drivers Board • During the first quarter of FY23, overseeing the Review of Strategic Direction which resulted in AGL committing to a strategy to deliver a responsible and accelerated low carbon future with an aim to reshape AGL's energy portfolio into a cleaner and more flexible portfolio, transitioning away from coal and focusing on new renewable and firming capacity. • The release of AGL's inaugural Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP), endorsed by AGL's shareholders at the 2022 Annual General Meeting (AGM), which demonstrates AGL's commitment to transparent communication with its stakeholders about its approach to decarbonisation.

A year of review and renewal FY23 has been a year of significant change and renewal for AGL, reflective of the pivotal period for the broader energy industry as the transition from fossil fuels to a reliable, low carbon energy future evolves. During FY23, AGL set out a revised strategy, provided clarification of longer-term objectives, and had a period of material Board and management renewal.  As Chair of the Committee, one of my first tasks was to oversee a review of the AGL executive remuneration framework to ensure it aligns with and will drive the AGL strategy and the commitments made through the Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP). The refinements to the framework are outlined below with further detail provided in Section 8.1.1. The ‘strike’ against the FY22 Remuneration Report and changes to the remuneration framework In light of the first 'strike' that AGL received at the AGM in relation to the FY22 Remuneration Report, we have spent time engaging with and listening to our stakeholders’ feedback on the remuneration framework and disclosures. Our responses are provided in Section 8.1. During these engagements with stakeholders, we discussed the refinements to the remuneration framework to ensure that there is common understanding of the rationale for the changes. The refinements for FY24 have been received positively by stakeholders and are perceived to be appropriate in aligning with AGL’s strategic objectives. Details of the changes are provided in Section 8.1.1 and are designed to enhance the focus on progressing longer-term decarbonisation objectives whilst maintaining strong cashflows to support future growth and shareholder returns. In summary: • The strategic objectives in the STI scorecard for the Managing Director & CEO (MD & CEO) will increase in weighting from 15% to 20%, aligned with the other executive key management personnel (KMP) to deliver incremental progress against longer- term decarbonisation objectives and future growth; • Operating free cash flow will be introduced as a second financial metric, alongside Underlying Profit after tax, to ensure the operational core generates strong cashflows to support future investment in growth; • The carbon transition metrics in the LTI plan will increase in weighting from 25% to 30% to enhance the focus on the commitments to decarbonisation made through the CTAP; and • The carbon transition metrics have been refined to align with the CTAP commitments. These changes will be implemented for FY24 and will be fully detailed in the Remuneration Report next year. We continue to engage with stakeholders and look forward to receiving further feedback on our FY23 Remuneration Report as we work to improve our remuneration framework and disclosures. Linking FY23 remuneration outcomes to performance The Board has determined that the overall remuneration outcomes for FY23 are reflective of and aligned to shareholder experience. Fixed remuneration The fixed remuneration of both Damien Nicks and Gary Brown, upon appointment as MD & CEO and Chief Financial Officer respectively, was established with reference to market benchmarks but also reflective of their relative experience. This aligns with the AGL approach of establishing an executive’s fixed remuneration initially at a level reflecting their experience that allows progressive increases to apply as the executive performs and becomes more experienced in their role. Message from the Chair of the People & Performance Committee  ===== PAGE 69 ===== Remuneration Report For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 67 Short-term incentives (STI) The performance outcomes in the STI scorecard for the year are as follows: • Underlying Profit after tax was $281m, within the guidance range. This outcome reflects the performance of our generation assets in the second half, the strong performance of our gas portfolio, as well as improvements in customer margin due to disciplined margin management. • An increase in recordable injuries occurred in Q4 FY23 resulting in a below target outcome in both the employee/contractor total injury frequency rate (TIFR) and for the serious impact and fatality potential metric, with no fatalities or serious injuries to employees or contractors. • Strategic Net Promoter Score (NPS) increased to +5, the highest AGL has achieved in a high price environment, and there were improvements in the NPS of two events for which AGL customer advocacy is measured compared with FY22. • Our employee engagement score increased from 57% in FY22 to 67%, reflective of our renewed purpose and values, positive sentiment around a clearer future direction and a returned focus on our people programs following a period of uncertainty. This resulted in STI outcomes of 73.8% of maximum for the MD & CEO and between 72.1% and 73.8% of maximum for other executives. The Board believes this provides a commensurate level of reward to executives for delivering the above performance outcomes and establishing the roadmap for the longer-term strategic objectives for AGL. Long-term incentives (LTI) The FY20 long-term incentive (LTI) grant, the first LTI offer with the four-year performance period, was tested at the end of FY23. The relative TSR and ROE hurdles were not met and therefore there will be no vesting. This is in line with the shareholder experience over the period of the grant. This is the third consecutive year with zero vesting of LTI (the FY19, FY20 Bridging and FY20 LTI Offers). Other remuneration arrangements In August 2022, the Board determined that, with the ongoing uncertainty following the withdrawal of the proposed demerger, and the announcement that the previous MD & CEO would be stepping down, retention awards were necessary for both Damien Nicks and Markus Brokhof, Chief Operating Officer, to ensure continuity of leadership for operations and to mitigate the risks of further destabilisation of the executive team. Details are provided in Section 8.4.4. Upon appointment to the MD & CEO role, Mr Nicks opted to forfeit his award in recognition of the opportunity and the increase in remuneration provided by the new role. Non-Executive Director fees remained unchanged in FY23. The last fee change was in January 2020. The year ahead During FY23, in addition to the review of strategy, the publication of the CTAP and the review of the remuneration framework, we also launched our new purpose and values, further underlining the reset for the business and employees alike. FY24 presents an opportunity to embed these elements into AGL’s foundations to support the delivery of our long-term goals. The AGL employee value proposition remains key to attracting, retaining and rewarding those people who can deliver our long-term goals and the remuneration framework remains a key factor in driving performance while enabling the innovation necessary for the energy transition. The Board will continue to review and monitor remuneration structures and performance metrics to ensure they align with AGL’s strategic objectives. We welcome your feedback on the remuneration practices and disclosures for AGL and look forward to your support at our 2023 AGM. Yours sincerely, Graham Cockroft Chair, People & Performance Committee  ===== PAGE 70 ===== Remuneration Report For the year ended 30 June 2023 68 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 The Directors present the Remuneration Report for AGL Energy Limited (AGL) and its consolidated entities for the year ended 30 June 2023 (FY23), prepared in line with the Corporations Act 2001.

The AGL Board is committed to listening to any concerns raised by shareholders and other stakeholders relating to the remuneration framework or remuneration outcomes and address these concerns where appropriate. The table below summarises the key concerns and issues raised during the engagements with investors and proxy advisors with regard to FY22, noting that proxy advisors were broadly supportive of the FY22 Remuneration Report. Concern Response Short-term Incentives The FY22 STI outcomes did not reflect the costs associated with the withdrawn demerger Over the course of FY22, a considerable amount of focus for management was on the preparation for, and the implementation of the proposed demerger and progressing Board-approved strategic goals. The Board’s decision to withdraw the demerger proposal was one consideration in determining FY22 outcomes against the performance scorecards. The Board considered that the FY22 STI outcomes reflected overall performance of AGL and management in this context. Long-term Incentives The performance metrics in the FY23 LTI offer did not reflect the outcomes of the strategic review or the Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP) Following the outcomes of the strategic review, announced on 29 September 2022, the Board determined to undertake a broader review of the remuneration framework to ensure it remains fit-for-purpose in delivering long-term value for shareholders and driving the energy transition. This included a review of the performance metrics in the LTI. The outcomes from this review are provided in Section 8.1.1. To provide greater certainty to participants during a highly disruptive and uncertain period, ahead of the outcomes of the remuneration framework review being known, the FY23 LTI offer included performance metrics consistent with the FY22 offer, that is a relative TSR metric (weighted 75%) and the carbon transition metrics (weighted 25%). Disclosure of the termination details for the former Managing Director & CEO No details were disclosed of the treatment of the former Managing Director & CEO upon termination The former Managing Director & CEO, Mr Graeme Hunt, ceased to be a key management personnel on 30 September 2022. As a result of the FY23 STI outcomes, Mr Hunt will receive a pro-rata FY23 STI payment of $193,178 for the three month period to 30 September 2022. Mr Hunt was not provided with an FY23 LTI offer. Mr Hunt is eligible to retain a pro-rata number of performance rights for time served of the four-year performance period of the FY22 LTI offer. All other termination provisions were as per the terms of Mr Hunt's contract of employment, summarised in the ASX announcement of 12 August 2021.  ===== PAGE 72 ===== Remuneration Report For the year ended 30 June 2023 70 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 8.1.1 Refinements to the remuneration framework for FY24 Following the 2022 strategic review, publication and approval of the inaugural CTAP, the AGL Board committed to a review of the remuneration framework to ensure that it continues to be fit-for-purpose and delivers long-term value for shareholders whilst driving the transition. The review of the framework included the performance metrics in both the short-term and long-term incentives as the alignment of these with strategy is key to delivering against both annual and longer-term objectives. The refined remuneration framework for AGL is designed to: • Enhance the focus on strategic measures to deliver progress against longer-term decarbonisation objectives and support future growth • Maintain the focus on the operational core to generate strong cashflows that support delivery of future growth and shareholder returns, and • Create long-term shareholder value The refinements being made to the remuneration framework for the financial year ending 30 June 2024 (FY24) are outlined below. FY24 Short-term incentive refinements • Operating free cash flow will be added to the STI scorecard as a financial performance metric, equally weighted with Underlying Profit after tax. This is to sharpen the focus on the operational core to generate cashflows to support delivery of future growth objectives. • An increase to the weighting of the strategic objectives in the performance scorecard for the Managing Director & CEO from 15% to 20%, with the weighting of the financial metric decreasing from 60% to 55%, to enhance the focus on delivering incremental progress against longer-term decarbonisation objectives and future growth. These weightings align with the other executive KMP. FY24 Long-term incentive refinements • For the FY24 LTI offer, the weighting of the carbon transition metrics will increase from 25% to 30% , with relative TSR decreasing to 70%. This is to enhance alignment of the performance metrics with the delivery of the long-term decarbonisation objectives, whilst also creating shareholder value. • The carbon transition metrics have been refined for the FY24 LTI offer to ensure they are aligned with the CTAP and the long-term focus for AGL to progressively decarbonise its asset portfolio with new renewable and firming capacity and to support electrification and customer transition to a low carbon future. In this context, determining the appropriate carbon transition metrics is a critical element in driving progress towards these clear objectives. The carbon transition metrics for the FY24 LTI offer are detailed in Section 8.3.4. During FY23, the Board engaged with investors and proxy advisors on these refinements and generally received support from stakeholders.  ===== PAGE 73 ===== Remuneration Report For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 71 8.2 Key management personnel The AGL KMP are the Managing Director & CEO and executives with operational and/or financial responsibility (together referred to in this report as ‘executives’), and the Non-Executive Directors.

The FY23 remuneration mix at maximum for executives is summarised below. The variable/at-risk component of total remuneration is 70% for the Managing Director & CEO and 65% at maximum for other executives. Managing Director & CEO Other Executive KMP 30% 35% 35% 35% 30% 35% Fixed remuneration Short-term incentive Long-term incentive Note: the remuneration mix for the Managing Director & CEO is for Mr Nicks from appointment to the role on a permanent basis, from 19 January 2023.   8.3.2 Fixed remuneration   What is the purpose of fixed remuneration? • The purpose of establishing fixed remuneration is to attract and retain the right person for the job to lead AGL in tackling the challenges confronting the energy industry. • Fixed remuneration at AGL therefore needs to be competitive to ensure the company can attract and retain those executives with experience in companies or industries undergoing similar transformation. How is fixed remuneration established? • Fixed remuneration is determined by considering market benchmarks against peer companies in the S&P/ASX200 Index, within 50-200% of AGL's market capitalisation. • AGL’s approach is to set an executive’s fixed remuneration initially at a level reflecting their skill and experience that allows progressive increases to apply as the executive performs and becomes more experienced in their role. • Fixed remuneration is reviewed annually in the context of market positioning and performance. This may or may not result in an increase for executives. Are there any other considerations in setting fixed remuneration? • AGL is committed to gender pay equity across employees, including executives. There are no gender pay gaps in fixed remuneration for current executives in roles of equivalent size, based on relative experience.  ===== PAGE 76 ===== Remuneration Report For the year ended 30 June 2023 74 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 8.3.3 Short-term incentive What is the purpose of the STI? The objective of the STI is to reward executives for delivering financial returns and progressing AGL’s strategy and purpose. What are the performance measures? STI scorecards set performance expectations for the following key performance metrics: Managing Director & CEO Other executives 60% 25% 15% 55% 25% 20% Financial Group Strategic Note: the performance metrics shown for the Managing Director & CEO are for Mr Nicks from appointment to the role on a permanent basis, from 19 January 2023. The performance metrics also applied to the former Managing Director & CEO for time served in FY23. For FY23: • Underlying Profit after tax is the key financial measure to drive shareholder returns and operate as efficiently as possible in the market within which AGL operates. • The group operational measures are focused on safety, customer and employee engagement and are aligned with AGL's Business Value Drivers. • The strategic objectives focus on key initiatives to drive the long-term value creation for shareholders. How are performance targets established? • Annual performance targets are determined with reference to a number of inputs: the previous year's performance outcomes, external market conditions, and longer-term business forecasts. Performance targets are set at levels which are considered to be a ''stretch'' in the context of these inputs, stretched beyond business as usual performance standards. • The STI target range for net profit after tax is established early in the financial year based on AGL's budget and the perceived degree of difficulty in that budget based on internal forecasts and prevailing market conditions at that time. • AGL’s budget may not reflect the market guidance range. Guidance is generally released at the time of AGL’s results in August and may change during the year. Guidance provides one input into determining the STI target and can have a broader range than incentive targets. What is the FY23 award opportunity? • The opportunities for STI awards, as a % of fixed remuneration, are as follows: 100% 70% 120% 84% Target Maximum Managing Director & CEO Other executives 0 50 100 150 Note: the Managing Director & CEO opportunity shown is for Mr Nicks from appointment to the role on a permanent basis, from 19 January 2023. For the former Managing Director & CEO, the target and maximum STI opportunities were 44% and 67% of fixed remuneration respectively.  ===== PAGE 77 ===== Remuneration Report For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 75 How does the Board assess performance? • In assessing outcomes under the STI, the Board assesses the quality of the results and the manner in which they were achieved as well as ensuring that those outcomes are aligned with the experience of AGL’s shareholders. • The starting point for considering STI outcomes is Statutory Profit. The Board may adjust Statutory Profit in consideration of any non-cash fair value movements in financial instruments and non-recurring significant items that materially affect AGL’s financial results to derive Underlying Profit after tax. This is to ensure that management are not unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged by items outside their control. • The Board expects an executive delivering against all performance objectives to achieve STI outcomes at their target levels given that performance targets are set at ''stretch'' levels. • The Board applies discretion in the treatment of any significant items and their impact on outcomes against performance targets and subsequent STI awards. Discretion guidelines were implemented in FY21 to formalise this approach. How are STI awards delivered? • Awards are delivered as a mix of cash and Restricted Shares (no performance conditions apply, restrictions lift after two years): - Managing Director & CEO: 50% cash and 50% Restricted Shares - Other executives: 75% cash and 25% Restricted Shares - Former Managing Director & CEO: 100% cash • Restricted Shares carry voting rights and are entitled to receive dividends. What happens upon cessation of employment? • When an executive leaves the organisation prior to the STI payment date by way of resignation or dismissal for cause, the executive would not be eligible to receive any STI award for the relevant year. • Where the Board determines that an executive is a ''good leaver'' they may be entitled to a pro-rated award for the year. The grant and treatment of Restricted Shares is subject to Board discretion. • Generally, Restricted Shares will be subject to forfeiture if an executive resigns prior to the restrictions lifting. 8.3.4 Long-term incentive   What is the purpose of the LTI? • The objective of the LTI is to reward executives for delivering long-term performance, to encourage shareholding and deliver long-term value creation for shareholders. • The performance metrics are selected to align with the AGL purpose of supporting progress for all its stakeholders. What are the performance measures? Two performance measures apply to the FY23 LTI offer: Weighting 75% 25% Relative TSR Carbon transition metrics 1. Relative TSR: A comparative, external market performance benchmark against the companies in the S&P/ASX100 Index. Provides a direct link between executive reward and shareholder return. 2. Carbon transition metrics: Provides the focus for executives to deliver against carbon transition objectives. Comprises three sub-metrics to ensure a balanced assessment. The vesting schedules are provided below under FY23 offer - terms. What is the performance period? • The performance metrics are measured either over a four-year period or at the end of the four-year period (1 July 2022 – 30 June 2026). • All performance measures are to be tested once at the end of the performance period to determine the vesting percentage.   ===== PAGE 78 ===== Remuneration Report For the year ended 30 June 2023 76 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 What is the award opportunity? • The opportunities for FY23 LTI awards, as a % of fixed remuneration, are as follows: Executive KMP (excluding Managing Director & CEO): Threshold = 50% Maximum = 100% Note: No LTI offer was extended to the former Managing Director & CEO in FY23; at the time of the FY23 LTI offer, Mr Nicks was Interim CEO and his LTI offer was based on his substantive role of Chief Financial Officer.  • The number of Performance Rights granted is based on a 30-day volume weighted average share price (VWAP) up to the commencement of the performance period. How does the Board assess performance? 1. Relative TSR: independent assessment of TSR by external advisors is undertaken, based on 30-day average VWAP, and provides the outcome for the Board to consider the final evaluation of performance. 2. Carbon transition: internal calculations are undertaken and are subject to limited assurance by external auditors on an annual basis. Revenue from green electricity and carbon neutral products and services is derived from the reported revenue. The Board determines the final outcome. How are the LTI awards delivered? Awards are delivered in Performance Rights. Participants are not entitled to receive dividends. What happens upon cessation of employment? • Generally, unvested Performance Rights lapse if a participant ceases employment with AGL before the end of the performance period (i.e. through resignation). • Where the Board determines that an executive is a ''good leaver'' they may be entitled to retain a pro-rated number of Performance Rights which remain subject to the plan rules until performance testing at the end of the performance period.

Mr Nicks' fixed remuneration was established around 10% lower than the previous incumbent in the role. In his prior role as Chief Financial Officer, Mr Nicks was provided with a 3.2% increase in fixed remuneration effective 1 July 2022, to align with market benchmarks for that role at the time. • Similarly, the fixed remuneration for Mr Brown, upon appointment to the Chief Financial Officer on a permanent basis, was set with reference to market benchmarks in peer companies. • No other changes were made to executives' fixed remuneration levels during FY23.  8.4.2 FY23 STI outcomes The group STI scorecard outcomes are detailed in Table 8.4.2.1, and the individual strategic objective outcomes are shown in the subsequent tables. Group performance objectives and FY23 outcomes • Financial: Underlying Profit after tax was $281m, in line with expectations and within guidance. This outcome reflects the performance of our generation assets in the second half, the strong performance of our gas portfolio, as well as improvements in customer margin due to disciplined margin management and an increase in customer services. This is partly offset by higher operating costs due to increased maintenance costs, seasonal bad debt expense and the impact of inflation. • Safety: Total injury frequency rate was 2.8 per million hours worked, up from 2.1 for FY22, impacted by a high rate of recordable injuries in Q4 FY23. The serious impact and fatality ratio was 1.9:1, a decline compared to 2.8:1 for FY22. • Customer: The AGL Net Promoter Score (NPS) has continued the progress made in FY22 with an outcome of +5. AGL ranked #1 against tier 1 competitors in Queensland and Western Australia. Despite rising energy costs, event NPS, which measures the advocacy of customers that have recently completed a specific task with AGL, has improved for two of the events measured. • Employee engagement: an engagement score of 67%, up from 57% in FY22, is reflective of the sentiment around the renewed purpose and employee values, a clearer strategic direction and increased stability following a prolonged period of uncertainty. The FY23 STI scorecard results in STI outcomes of between 72.1% and 73.8% of maximum for executives. As outlined in Section 8.3.3, when considering the STI outcomes for executives, the Board takes into account the scorecard results, how those outcomes were achieved, and the experience of shareholders over the period. FY23 has been challenging for AGL with a significant 'reset' of the organisation following the strategic review. The Loy Yang A Unit 2 outage continued to impact results for the first half of FY23 but management have delivered a stronger second half with much improved availability and an increase in customer services. After detailed consideration, the Board determined that the outcomes appropriately reflect the company's performance and executive's contributions against the scorecard for the year and has elected not to exercise discretion to adjust the outcomes.  ===== PAGE 81 ===== Remuneration Report For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 79 Table 8.4.2.1: STI scorecard – group performance objectives and FY23 outcomes  Performance measure Weighting Target range (threshold to max) Target Outcome Outcome relative to target MD & CEO Other execs Financial AGL net profit after tax 60% 55% $200m to $300m $250m  Underlying Profit after tax was $281m, up 25% from FY22.

This was to be provided as 50% cash and 50% equity in August 2023. Upon appointment to the Managing Director & CEO role in January 2023, Mr Nicks opted to forfeit this retention award in full in recognition of the opportunity and increase in remuneration provided by the new role. • Mr Brokhof was provided with a retention award of $450,000, to be paid 50% ($225,000) in cash in August 2023, and 50% ($225,000) delivered in equity in August 2023.  ===== PAGE 86 ===== Remuneration Report For the year ended 30 June 2023 84 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 8.5 Remuneration governance   8.5.1 Role of the People & Performance Committee   What is the purpose of the People & Performance Committee? • The purpose of the People & Performance Committee is to support the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities through the recruitment, retention and remuneration of executives with the capabilities and skills necessary to execute AGL’s strategy. How does the Committee support the Board? • The Committee reviews and makes recommendations to the Board on the remuneration arrangements for the key management personnel. • The Committee provides support to the Board in relation to matters such as governing remuneration and employment policies, practices and programs. • The Committee oversees the preparation of AGL's Remuneration Report which is subsequently reviewed by the Audit & Risk Management Committee as part of the Annual Report. Who sits on the committee? • The People & Performance Committee includes independent Directors of the Board, including members of the Audit & Risk Management Committee, which are reviewed periodically. To what extent does the Committee seek advice, e.g. from remuneration advisers? • To assist in performing its duties and making recommendations to the Board, the Committee has access to management and independent external consultants to seek advice on various remuneration-related matters as required. • Any recommendations made by consultants in relation to remuneration arrangements of KMP are made directly to the Board without any influence from management. Arrangements are in place to ensure any advice is independent of management. • During FY23, the Committee engaged EY to act as independent remuneration advisers. EY did not provide any remuneration recommendations as defined in the Corporations Act 2001 to the People & Performance Committee during FY23. Further details • The complete People & Performance Charter is reviewed at least every two years and is available on AGL’s website: agl.com.au/BoardAndCommitteeCharters.   8.5.2 Management of risk and remuneration The AGL remuneration framework is designed to ensure that executives focus on delivering against the strategic objectives, ensuring that company and shareholder outcomes are primary considerations in the decision-making processes. The framework is structured to mitigate against any excessive risk-taking or short-term decisions by executives through the establishment of scorecard metrics that align with strategic objectives. The use of deferred equity in both the short and long-term incentive plans, and the clawback provisions within those equity plans also assists the company in managing risk.  ===== PAGE 87 ===== Remuneration Report For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 85 8.5.3 Incentive plan governance AGL has the following governance framework in place for its incentive plans:  Clawback • The Board has discretion to prescribe clawback events for any unvested equity awards which may be clawed back from executives. Change of control • The Board will determine at the time a change of control event occurs how to treat unvested equity in accordance with the plan rules, and ultimately has absolute discretion in determining this treatment, taking into consideration market practice. Hedging policy • AGL has a policy in place that prevents executives from entering into any derivative or other financial product in relation to their equity plan(s) participation. Discretion • The Board, in conjunction with the People & Performance Committee, exercises discretion to ensure the quantum of executive remuneration is appropriate considering individual and company performance, for example by adjusting STI and LTI vesting outcomes. This discretion ensures that the quantum of executive remuneration is appropriate. • Discretion guidelines provide a framework to assist the Board with identifying one-off/extraordinary circumstances (e.g. impairments) and whether those circumstances require an adjustment to incentive outcomes. The guidelines support consistency in application over time and does not limit the Board's overarching discretion under AGL's incentive plans.   8.5.4 KMP share ownership To provide for shareholder alignment, AGL operates a minimum shareholding policy for KMP and other executives reporting to the Managing Director & CEO, subject to compliance with AGL’s Securities Dealing Policy. Shareholdings are reported in Table 8.7.2 for executive KMP and Table 8.8.4 for Non-Executive Directors. The minimum shareholding policies stipulate the following requirements: Shareholding requirement Period to satisfy requirement Non-Executive Directors 100% of base annual fee Four years; 50% within two years of appointment; encouraged to hold 10% by the end of the financial year of appointment. Executives Managing Director & CEO 100% of fixed remuneration Up to five years from their initial appointment date to an eligible role.

Includes executives who were KMP at 30 June 2023. 2. AGL can, at its election, make a payment in lieu of part or all of the notice period. 3. Maximum termination payment (exclusive of any payment in lieu of notice) payable if AGL terminates the executive’s employment other than for cause. 4. Termination payments reference fixed remuneration. 5. The executive may also terminate their agreement with three months’ notice in the event of a ‘fundamental change’, which includes circumstances where there has been a substantial diminution of role and responsibility of the executive, in which event they will be entitled to a payment equivalent to nine months’ fixed remuneration. 8.8 Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration 8.8.1 Fee pool The maximum aggregate fee pool for Non-Executive Directors is $2.75 million per annum. The fee pool is regularly reviewed by the Board and, if appropriate, adjusted (subject to shareholder approval), having regard to the anticipated time commitment, workload and responsibilities attached and the fees paid by comparable organisations. The current fee pool was approved by shareholders at the 2016 AGM. 8.8.2 Fee policy Non-Executive Directors receive a base fee. Members of a Committee receive a Committee fee to recognise the associated higher workload and extra responsibilities, and chairing a Committee attracts a higher fee. The Chair of the Board receives a higher base fee in recognition of the added responsibility and time commitment; but does not receive any extra fees for participating in or chairing any Committees. Fees are inclusive of superannuation. There are no additional fees in relation to the Nominations Committee. In setting Non-Executive Directors’ fees, the Board considers the following: • time commitment • workload • risk and responsibility • market benchmark data, sourced from companies with market capitalisation of 50-200% of AGL's To ensure independence, Non-Executive Directors do not receive performance-related remuneration. This allows the Board to focus on governance and both short and long-term strategy. 8.8.3 FY23 fees Fees for Non-Executive Directors remained unchanged during the financial year.

AGL was not a party to any such proceedings during the year. 9.3 Commercial in confidence information Further information about likely developments in the operations of AGL and its consolidated entity and the expected results of those operations in the future has been included in this Directors’ Report except to the extent disclosure of the information would be likely to result in unreasonable prejudice to the consolidated entity. The type of information not disclosed includes commercial in confidence information such as detailed operational plans and strategies that would provide third parties with a commercial advantage. 9.4 Auditor and non-audit services Non-audit services have been provided during the year by the external auditor, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Australia (Deloitte). Disclosure of the details of these services can be found in Note 26 of the Financial Report 2023. The Board has a formal policy on the provision of auditing and related services. Specifically, the external auditor is precluded from providing any services that might threaten its independence or conflict with its assurance and compliance role. Semi-annual reports on the provision of auditing and related services are provided to the Board through the Audit & Risk Management Committee. The Directors are satisfied that the provision of other accounting advice and services by the external auditor is compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors. The policy and procedures in place, and the review by the Audit & Risk Management Committee, enable the Directors to conclude that non-audit services provided did not compromise the external auditor’s independence requirements of the Corporations Act. The external auditor annually provides a letter to the Company Secretary on its independence within the meaning of relevant legislation and professional standards. No officers of AGL were partners or directors of Deloitte during this or prior periods. 9.5 Rounding AGL is an entity to which ASIC Corporations Instrument 2016/191 applies and, in accordance with that Instrument, amounts in the Financial Report and this Directors’ Report have been rounded to the nearest million dollars, unless otherwise stated. 9.6 Auditor’s Independence Declaration A copy of the external auditor’s declaration under Section 307C of the Corporations Act in relation to the audit for the financial year is attached to the AGL Financial Report 2023. 9.7 Indemnification and insurance of officers AGL's constitution indemnifies, to the extent permitted by law, officers of the consolidated entity when acting in their capacity in respect of: • liability to third parties (other than related entities) when acting in good faith; and • costs and expenses of successfully defending legal proceedings and ancillary matters. The Directors named earlier in this Report and the Company Secretary have the benefit of the indemnity, together with any other person concerned in, or who takes part in, the management of the consolidated entity. During the year, AGL paid premiums in respect of contracts insuring all Directors of AGL as listed earlier, all Directors of related bodies corporate of AGL, secretaries and other Officers of the consolidated entity against liabilities incurred in their capacity as Director or Officer, as the case may be, of the consolidated entity. The contract prohibits disclosure of the nature of the liabilities covered and the amount of premium. 9.8 Subsequent events Apart from the matters identified in the financial statements or notes thereto, there has not been any other matter or circumstance that has arisen since the end of the financial year, that has significantly affected or may significantly affect the operations of AGL, the results of those operations, or the state of affairs of AGL in future financial periods. 9.9 Non-IFRS Financial Information The Operating & Financial Review attached to and forming part of this Directors’ Report includes a number of non-International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) financial measures. AGL management uses these non-IFRS financial measures to assess the performance of the business and make decisions on the allocation of resources. Principal among these non-IFRS financial measures is Underlying Profit. This measure is Statutory Profit/(Loss) adjusted for: • significant items (which are material items of revenue or expense that are unrelated to the underlying performance of the business); and • changes in the fair value of financial instruments recognised in the statement of profit or loss (to remove the volatility caused by mismatches in valuing financial instruments and the underlying asset differently). AGL believes that Underlying Profit provides a better understanding of its financial performance than Statutory Profit/(Loss) and allows for a more relevant comparison of financial performance between financial periods.  ===== PAGE 96 ===== Other Required Disclosures For the year ended 30 June 2023 94 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 Underlying Profit is presented with reference to ASIC Regulatory Guide 230 “Disclosing non-IFRS financial information”, issued in December 2011. AGL’s policy for reporting Underlying Profit is consistent with this guidance. The Directors have had the consistency of the application of the policy reviewed by the external auditor of AGL. 9.10 Corporate governance A copy of AGL's Corporate Governance Statement can be found on the AGL website at agl.com.au/CorporateGovernance. 9.11 Environmental regulation AGL's businesses are subject to a range of environmental laws and regulations as well as project and site-specific environmental permits and approvals issued at both the federal and state government levels. On 17 July 2022, at Bayswater Power Station during a Hunter River Salinity Trading Scheme (HRSTS) discharge from a Licenced discharge point from the Lake Liddell Seepage Return System, the maximum discharge rate (136.03 ML/day) was exceeded by 3.47 ML/day for 5 hours and 13 minutes. This event contravened Environment Protection Licence 779 (EPL) Condition E1.3.  On 19 July 2022, AGL Macquarie Pty Ltd (AGLM) notified the NSW Environment Protection Authority (NSW EPA).  AGLM undertook a review of HRSTS operating procedures and included a new risk mitigation action to close off the discharge valve between discharge periods, unless a discharge instruction was received from Water NSW.  On 16 August 2022, NSW EPA issued AGLM with an Official Caution for the alleged contravention of the EPL and the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (NSW). On 30 July 2022, AGL Gas Storage Pty Ltd (AGLGS) became aware of a loss of containment of sales-quality gas within AGL’s Wallumbilla LPG Plant.  It is estimated that 0.5TJ of gas (98% methane) was released to atmosphere.  On 1 August 2022, AGLGS notified the Department of Environment and Science (DES) of the event.  The plant was repaired and hydrotested to confirm its integrity.  On 25 August 2022, DES issued AGLGS with a formal warning for a contravention of section 430(3) of the Environmental Protection Act 1994 (QLD) which states that a person must not contravene a condition of the EA. On 27 September 2022, AGLGS was notified by a landholder of a loss of containment event along the Sirrah Pipeline within AGL’s Silver Springs Gas Field.  The event involved the release of approximately 46kg of natural gas to the atmosphere and 2,000-5,000 litres of produced water (98% produced water, 2% hydrocarbon condensate) from a pipe wall defect in the Sirrah Pipeline.  On 28 September 2022, AGLGS notified the DES.  AGLGS immediately isolated the pipeline and conducted a clean-up and rehabilitation of the impacted area.   AGLGS then developed an inspection, repair and corrosion mitigation plan for the continued safe operation of the Sirrah Pipeline to prevent recurrence.  On 21 February 2023, DES issued AGLGS with a Penalty Infringement Notice (PIN) for contravention of Condition E1 of the EA. Between 25 November and 1 December 2022, an event occurred at Bayswater Power Station, where a discharge of saline water from the Lake Liddell Seepage Return System entered Bayswater Creek.  On 30 November 2022, AGLM notified the NSW EPA of the event.  In response AGLM implemented two Pollution Reduction Programs on the Bayswater Environment Protection Licence 779 (EPL).  On 8 February 2023, the NSW EPA issued AGLM with a Penalty Infringement Notice (PIN) for contravention of Condition O2.1 of the EPL and a formal warning for delayed notification to NSW EPA. On 5 April 2023, the NSW EPA issued a Formal Warning Letter to AGL Upstream Investments Pty Ltd (AGL Upstream) in relation to a contravention of the Petroleum (ONSHORE) Act 1991 (NSW) for the Camden Gas Project Petroleum Operations Plan (POP) during the period of 1 July 2022 to 15 September 2022.  For background, the POPs apply for a financial year.  Each year, AGL prepares a POP during June and submits by 30 June to the Resources Regulator and EPA for approval and for implementation during the following financial year. Understanding that it takes time for the Departments to review the new POP, during the period in question, AGL Upstream had submitted its revised POP but also requested an extension to the existing POP so that it could remain valid until the next POP was approved. The Resources Regulator approved the POP on 15 September 2022.  However due to the Departments approval processing, the existing POP ceased to be valid during this period.   EPA NSW issued a formal warning letter for this occurring.  AGL Upstream considered this warning unreasonable as approval was in the Department’s hands (i.e. out of AGL Upstream’s control).   Following receipt of the formal Warning Letter, AGL prepared the next POP earlier than usual, which was approved on 2 June 2023 until 31 December 2023. Approval of Directors’ Report This Directors’ Report is made in accordance with a resolution of the Board of Directors and is signed for and on behalf of the Board this 10th day of August 2023.

Customer Markets sources its energy from Integrated Energy at transfer prices that reflect wholesale energy costs in each state, along with other energy costs such as those arising from environmental schemes. Customer Markets also includes sales, marketing, brand, and AGL's customer contact and call centre operations. • Integrated Energy operates AGL’s power generation portfolio and other key assets, including coal, gas and renewable generation facilities, natural gas storage and production facilities, and development projects. Integrated Energy runs a large trading operation to manages price risk associated with procuring electricity and gas for AGL's customers, manages AGL's obligations in relation to renewable energy schemes, and controls the dispatch of AGL's owned and contracted generation assets, gas offtake agreements and associated portfolio of energy hedging products. • Investments comprises AGL’s interests in the ActewAGL Retail Partnership, Tilt Renewables, Energy Impact Partners Europe, Ovo Energy Australia Pty Ltd and other investments. In the segment financial results, the ‘Other’ category consists of various Corporate activities. These are not considered to be reportable segments. Segment financial results The measurement of segment results is in line with the basis of information presented to the Board of Directors for internal management reporting purposes. The performance of each segment is measured based on their Underlying earnings before interest and tax (Underlying EBIT) contribution to AGL. Certain items of income and expense are excluded from the segment results to show a measure of underlying performance. These items include changes in fair value of financial instruments and significant items. AASB 8 Operating Segments requires AGL to report segment information on the same basis as the internal management structure. As a result, the Customer Markets segment reports the revenue and margin associated with satisfying the gas, electricity and telecommunication requirements of AGL consumer and business customer portfolio and Integrated Energy reports the revenue, expenses and margin related to AGL's operating sites and AGL's wholesale energy portfolio.  ===== PAGE 104 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 102 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 2023 $m Customer Markets Integrated Energy Investments Other Total Revenue Total segment revenue 8,279 9,317 33 - 17,629 Inter-segment revenue (27) (3,445) - - (3,472) External revenue 8,252 5,872 33 - 14,157 Underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Underlying EBITDA) 371 1,284 (8) (286) 1,361 Depreciation and amortisation (123) (531) - (74) (728) Underlying EBIT 248 753 (8) (360) 633 Net financing costs (258) Underlying profit before tax 375 Underlying income tax expense (100) Underlying profit after tax 275 Non-controlling interests 6 Underlying profit after tax (attributable to AGL shareholders)1 281 Segment assets 2,865 8,307 418 207 11,797 Segment liabilities 772 3,749 17 173 4,711 Other segment information Share of (losses)/profits of associates and joint ventures - - (57) - (57) Investments in associates and joint ventures - 4 393 - 397 Additions to non-current assets 108 603 - 26 738 Other non-cash expenses (100) - - (21) (121) 1.

ACCOUNTING POLICY Segment reporting An operating segment is a component of AGL that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses relating to transactions with other components of AGL. Operating segments are identified on the basis of internal reports about components of AGL that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in order to allocate resources to the segment and to assess its performance. The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Board of Directors. 2. Revenue 2023 Consumer $m Business $m Wholesale $m Other $m Total $m Electricity 4,462 1,417 237 - 6,116 Generation sales to pool 1 - 4,630 - 4,631 Gas 1,736 143 596 27 2,502 Rendering of services 51 49 141 379 620 Other revenue 2 - 202 84 288 Total revenue 6,252 1,609 5,806 490 14,157 2022 Consumer $m Business $m Wholesale $m Other $m Total $m Electricity 4,191 1,258 260 - 5,709 Generation sales to pool - - 4,401 - 4,401 Gas 1,511 123 755 28 2,417 Rendering of services 50 39 91 304 484 Other revenue - - 122 88 210 Total revenue 5,752 1,420 5,629 420 13,221  ===== PAGE 108 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 106 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 ACCOUNTING POLICY Revenue from contracts with customers AGL's primary revenue streams relate to the retail sale of electricity and gas to residential (consumer) and business customers in Australia, the sale of electricity and gas to wholesale customers in Australia and the sale of generated electricity to the National Electricity Market in Australia. Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services is transferred to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which AGL expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The majority of contractual energy supply arrangements with customers have no fixed duration, generally require no minimum consumption by the customer and are able to be terminated by either party at any time without incurring significant penalty. Given this, the enforceable contracts are considered short term (less than 12 months) in nature. There are some longer term contracts particularly those with business and wholesale customers. AGL has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements because it controls the goods or services before transferring them to the customer. AGL’s primary performance obligations are the supply of energy (electricity or gas) over the contractual term. There are either individual contracts representing separate purchasing decisions of customers, or the units of supply of energy represent a series of distinct goods that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer and hence is considered one performance obligation satisfied over time. For the shorter term contracts, the performance obligations are considered to be satisfied, and revenue is recognised, as and when the units of energy are delivered. Additionally, in relation to AGL’s longer term contracts, AGL determines that the right-to- invoice approach to measure the progress towards completion of the performance obligation is most appropriate as it depicts AGL’s performance. AGL uses the units of energy delivered to the customer as estimated as part of the unbilled process (and later verified by meter readings) or as indicated by the customer’s energy meter (where these are known more frequently). In most instances, the transaction price is determined by the unbilled process. For some wholesale contracts, AGL also considers the effects of variable consideration and for some business sales, there is non-cash consideration and consideration payable to the customer relating to renewable energy certificates (RECs). Electricity and Gas revenue Consumer electricity and gas sales Consumer energy sales relate to the sale of energy (electricity and gas) to retail customers. Consumer sales are classified as individual, short term, day-by-day contracts and are recognised as revenue on a day-by-day basis upon delivery of energy to customers. Where the customers are eligible to receive additional discounts (e.g. pay on time discounts to encourage timely payment of energy invoices), AGL considers this to be variable consideration, which is estimated as part of the unbilled process. Portfolio approach for consumer electricity and gas sales AGL recognises revenue from contracts with its consumers at the electricity and gas portfolio levels. Furthermore, AGL has elected to apply the portfolio approach in accounting for the fair valuing of RECs, accounting for connection fees and sales commissions. Recognition at the portfolio level would not differ materially from applying the standard on a contract-by-contract basis. Business electricity and gas sales Business sales represent the sale of energy to business customers. Revenue recognition is largely consistent with consumer sales. These contracts are longer term in nature and represent a series of distinct goods that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer and are treated as one performance obligation satisfied over time based on the output delivered to the customer. For a large majority of business sales customers, revenue is recognised when AGL has the ‘right to invoice’ the customer for consideration that has been determined to correspond directly with the value of units of energy delivered to that customer. Some business sales arrangements also include the transfer of RECs to the customer, which can, in some instances, represent a separate performance obligation. Material right applicable to residential and business sales Where a fixed fee (e.g. connection fee, distribution fee, capacity reservation charge, etc.) received from a customer does not represent a transfer of a good or service to a customer, but the customer is charged an upfront amount, the customer contract contains a material right in that the customer is effectively able to buy additional units of energy at a lower cost per unit. The material right is valued based on its relative standalone selling price. If standalone selling prices are not directly observable, the price is estimated by taking into consideration the discount the customer would receive in a standalone transaction and the likelihood that the customer would exercise the option. Revenue from a material right is recognised as and when the right is exercised by the customer or the right expires, whichever is earlier. Wholesale energy sales Wholesale energy sales represent the sale of electricity and gas to wholesale customers. These involve a high volume of energy usually over an extended period of time. Supply of energy represents a series of distinct goods that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer and is the major performance obligation. It is treated as one performance obligation which is satisfied over time. In some  ===== PAGE 109 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 107 ACCOUNTING POLICY instances, there is an additional performance obligation in these contracts by way of a material right. Revenue is recognised for these arrangements when AGL has the ‘right to invoice’ the customer for consideration that has been determined to correspond directly with the value of units of energy delivered to that customer. Some wholesale electricity arrangements may involve the transfer of RECs to the customer, which may represent a separate performance obligation. Renewable energy certificates (RECs) applicable to business and wholesale sales There are two main instances where RECs pass between AGL and its customers. These include those transferred under a self- surrender arrangement as part of the consideration for energy and those that are sold to customers. Received from customer (self-surrender) As a retailer, AGL incurs costs in relation to its renewable energy obligations for which RECs must be surrendered to the government. For most customers, the costs associated with meeting these renewable energy obligations is factored into the cost of energy (i.e. there is a REC cost component built into the price paid). For some customers, instead of paying for the cost of the energy in cash, they have the option to elect to pay for their energy usage in the form of cash and by self-surrendering RECs. The obligation to remit RECs to the regulator remains with AGL, but the customer is choosing to meet part of its payment by way of surrendering its own RECs rather than paying for the cost of the RECs as part of the overall cost of the energy. The transfer of RECs as consideration in exchange for energy is a form of non-cash consideration. AGL measures non-cash consideration at its fair value at the date of surrender (i.e. the date of transfer by the customer). Transferred to the customer For some customer contracts, AGL sells both energy and RECs to the customer. A customer may purchase RECs to meet its own REC obligations and/or where it wants actual title to the RECs. The RECs sold to a customer represent a separate performance obligation, i.e. a good, as the customer can benefit from the RECs on their own and the promise to transfer RECs to the customer is separately identifiable from the other promises in the contract (e.g. promise to deliver energy). AGL determines the portion of the transaction price that it allocates to the RECs using the relative standalone selling price method. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the proportion of the stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation to the sum of the stand-alone selling prices of all of the performance obligations in the contract. Revenue is recognised as and when the control of the RECs are transferred to the customer, which occurs at a point in time. Where the customer is entitled to all the RECs generated at a specified power plant (e.g. in cases where power plants are located at the customer’s site), transfer of control to the customer occurs as and when the RECs are generated. In other cases where the RECs are transferred to the customer from inventory, control of the RECs transfers upon receipt by the customer. Pool revenue Generation Sales to Pool Pool generation sales and pool purchase costs relate to sales by AGL’s generation assets to the grid and purchases of energy by AGL wholesale on behalf of AGL's retail business. AGL has assessed it is acting as the principal in relation to such sales and purchases of energy to the pool and therefore the transactions are recognised on a ‘gross’ basis. Revenue from these arrangements is recognised at the spot price achieved when control of the energy passes to the grid. Variable consideration If the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, AGL estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods to the customer. The variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and constrained until it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Significant financing component AGL applies the practical expedient in that it does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if it expects, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of the promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. Costs to obtain a contract Costs that are incurred regardless of whether a contract is obtained are expensed as incurred, unless those costs are explicitly chargeable to the customer. Discretionary bonuses paid to sales staff based on meeting annual sales targets, overall profitability and individual performance evaluations are expensed as incurred as they are not directly attributable to identifiable contracts and do not meet the criteria for capitalisation. The direct costs of establishing customer contracts are recognised as an asset when they relate to a specific customer acquisition campaign. The direct costs are amortised over the minimum contract term. Direct costs include customer acquisition fees paid to channel partners and upfront account purchase payments.  ===== PAGE 110 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 108 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 ACCOUNTING POLICY Costs to fulfil The costs incurred by AGL to fulfil a contract with a customer, which may qualify for capitalisation include connection fees paid/incurred by AGL (including those charged by distribution businesses to provide such network services, or those incurred directly by AGL in connecting a customer). These costs do not fall within the scope of any other standard (i.e. the cost is not part of inventory, an intangible asset or property, plant and equipment). Therefore, these costs are capitalised as a contract cost (cost to fulfil) asset and amortised over the life of the customer contract or customer relationship, where material. Cost sharing arrangements AGL enters into cost sharing arrangements whereby the costs to operate and maintain assets that are shared with parties outside the AGL Group are recharged to the parties in accordance with their beneficial interest. These recharged amounts are recognised as revenue when the associated costs to which they relate impact the statement of profit or loss. Revenue is measured with reference to the fair value of the consideration received. Government grants Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that AGL will comply with the conditions of the grant and the grant will be received. Government grants that require AGL to construct an asset are recognised as deferred revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and transferred to profit or loss on a systematic basis over the useful life of the related assets. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Variable consideration and constraints AGL includes variable consideration in the transaction price as estimated at the inception of a contract. However, if it is considered ‘highly probable’ that a significant reversal of revenue recognised will occur in the future, the variable consideration is constrained and not included in the transaction price. AGL’s contractual arrangements contain a number of variable pricing elements including pay-on-time discounts, payment plans, and escalations. Some of these variable elements are resolved during the reporting period. Where they are not, management estimates the likelihood of the variable pricing element eventuating and recognises the variable pricing element to the extent it is not highly probable that it will reverse. Revenue recognition AGL recognises revenue from gas and electricity services once the gas and/or electricity has been consumed by the customer. Management estimates customer consumption between the last invoice date and the end of the reporting period when determining gas and electricity revenue for the financial period. Various assumptions and financial models are used to determine the estimated unbilled consumption. 3. Other income 2023 $m 2022 $m Sale of land 7 - Sale of Wellington North Solar Development Rights1 17 - Sale of purchase option - 20 Total other income 24 20 1.

AGL has adopted the voluntary Tax Transparency Code as endorsed by the Board of Taxation and the Australian Taxation Office. ACCOUNTING POLICY Income tax Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. Current tax Current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year and any adjustments in respect of prior years. AGL’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which AGL expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if AGL has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and the deferred  ===== PAGE 115 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 113 ACCOUNTING POLICY tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either: • the same taxable entity; or • different taxable entities that intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered. Current and deferred tax for the period Current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in profit or loss, except when they relate to items recognised outside profit or loss (whether in other comprehensive income or directly in equity) or a business combination. Tax consolidation AGL Energy Limited (the Parent Entity) and its wholly-owned Australian resident subsidiaries formed a tax-consolidated group pursuant to Australian taxation law with effect from 25 October 2006 and are therefore taxed as a single entity from that date. AGL Energy Limited is the head entity in the tax-consolidated group. On 23 July 2012, AGL Generation Holdco Pty Ltd, a subsidiary 99.99% owned by AGL, and AGL Generation Pty Ltd elected to form a tax-consolidated group with Loy Yang Marketing Holdings Pty Limited and its wholly-owned subsidiary, in addition to the existing group. On 27 July 2012, Great Energy Alliance Corporation Pty Limited (GEAC) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries joined the new tax-consolidated group. AGL Generation Holdco Pty Ltd is the head entity in the new tax-consolidated group. Tax expense/income, deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences of the members of the tax consolidated group are recognised in the separate financial statements of the members of the tax-consolidated group using the ‘standalone taxpayer’ approach by reference to the carrying amounts in the separate financial statements of each entity and the tax values applying under tax consolidation. Current tax liabilities and assets and deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and tax credits of the tax-consolidated group are recognised by the head entity in each tax consolidated group. The members of each of the tax-consolidated group have entered into a tax sharing and tax funding agreement. The tax funding agreement requires payments to/from the head entity equal to the current tax liability/asset assumed by the head entity and any tax loss deferred tax asset assumed by the head entity. The payments are recorded as intercompany receivables/payables. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Deferred tax assets relating to tax losses AGL recognises a deferred tax asset relating to tax losses. The recoverability of this deferred tax asset is dependent on the generation of sufficient taxable income, to utilise those tax losses. Management judgements and estimates are required in the assessment of this recoverability, including forecasting sufficient future taxable income. 8. Dividends Recognised amounts 2023 $m 2022 $m Final dividend Final dividend for 2022 of 10.0 cents per share, unfranked, paid 27 September 2022 (2022: Final dividend for 2021 of 34.0 cents per share, unfranked, paid 29 September 2021). 67 212 Interim dividend Interim dividend for 2023 of 8.0 cents per share, unfranked, paid 24 March 2023 (2022: Interim dividend for 2022 of 16.0 cents per share, unfranked, paid 30 March 2022). 54 105 Dividends paid as per the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows 121 317 Unrecognised amounts Since the end of the financial year, the Directors have declared a final dividend for 2023 of 23.0 cents per share, unfranked, payable 22 September 2023 (2022: 10.0 cents per share, unfranked, paid 27 September 2022). 155 67  ===== PAGE 116 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 114 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 Dividend franking account 2023 $m 2022 $m Adjusted franking account balance (32) (66) ACCOUNTING POLICY Dividends Dividends represent a distribution of profits that holders of ordinary shares receive from time to time. Dividends are not accrued as a liability until a dividend declaration is made by the Board of Directors. The liability is reduced when the dividend is paid. The Board of Directors takes into consideration factors including AGL’s relative capital strength and the existing dividend payout ratio guidelines in determining the amount of dividends to be paid. 9. Trade and other receivables 2023 $m 2022 $m Current Trade receivables 1,159 2,295 Unbilled revenue 832 787 Allowance for expected credit loss (183) (183) 1,808 2,899 Other receivables 32 231 Total current trade and other receivables 1,840 3,130 Non-current Other receivables 17 93 Loans to Joint Ventures 4 - Total non-current trade and other receivables 21 93 Allowance for expected credit loss Balance as at 1 July 183 209 Impairment losses recognised on receivables 133 162 Amounts written off as uncollectible (133) (188) Balance at end of the financial year 183 183  ===== PAGE 117 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 115 The allowance for expected credit loss associated with unbilled revenue and the ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date is detailed below: 2023 2022 Total $m Allowance $m Total $m Allowance $m Unbilled revenue 832 (45) 787 (39) Not past due 854 (11) 2,008 (12) Past due 0 – 30 days 84 (13) 69 (12) Past due 31 – 60 days 43 (13) 38 (9) Past due 61 – 90 days 25 (8) 20 (7) Past 90 days 153 (93) 160 (104) Total 1,991 (183) 3,082 (183) ACCOUNTING POLICY Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Trade and other receivables are recognised at amortised cost, less an allowance for expected credit loss. AGL's policy requires customers to pay in accordance within agreed payment terms. Depending on the customer segment, trade receivables are generally due for settlement within 30 days. AGL assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. For trade receivables, unbilled revenue, contract assets and lease receivables, AGL applies the simplified approach, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables. Unbilled revenue Unbilled revenue represents estimated gas and electricity services supplied to customers but unbilled at the end of the reporting period. Unbilled gas and electricity revenue is not collectible until such time as customers’ meters are read and bills rendered. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Expected credit loss on trade receivables and unbilled revenue AGL uses an allowance matrix to measure expected credit losses of trade receivables and unbilled revenue from its customers. Trade receivable amounts are disaggregated into customer segments. Loss rates are estimated in each age category and are based on the probability of a receivable progressing through to write-off. Factors to estimate the loss rate are based on risk assessment performed for each customer segment and economic factors such as wholesale electricity forward curves, commodity fuel forward curves and prevailing macro-economic information. Unbilled revenue AGL recognises revenue from gas and electricity sales once the gas and/or electricity has been consumed by the customer. Management estimates customer consumption between the last invoice date and the end of the reporting period when determining gas and electricity revenue for the financial period. Various assumptions and financial models are used to determine the estimated unbilled consumption. Some of the assumptions and estimates include: • Volume and timing of energy consumed by the customers • Various pricing plans prevalent and allocation of the estimated volume to such pricing plans • Loss factors • Behavioural discounts.  ===== PAGE 118 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 116 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 10. Inventories 2023 $m 2022 $m Current Raw materials and stores - at cost 276 308 Finished goods - at cost 70 61 Total current inventories 346 369 Non-current Finished goods - at cost - 46 Total non-current inventories - 46 ACCOUNTING POLICY Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs of inventories are determined on a first-in-first-out or weighted average basis. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price for inventories less the estimated costs necessary to sell the inventory. 11. Other financial assets 2023 $m 2022 $m Current Derivative financial instruments - at fair value Cross currency swap contracts - cash flow and fair value hedges - 54 Interest rate swap contracts - cash flow hedges 38 26 Forward foreign exchange contracts - cash flow hedges 1 - Energy derivatives - economic hedges 1,686 4,559 1,725 4,639 Other 6 - Total current other financial assets 1,731 4,639 Non-current Derivative financial instruments - at fair value Cross currency swap contracts - cash flow and fair value hedges 55 54 Interest rate swap contracts - cash flow hedges 76 96 Forward foreign exchange contracts - cash flow hedges 1 - Energy derivatives - economic hedges 484 216 Other 5 5 621 371 Equity instrument financial assets - at fair value through other comprehensive income Unlisted equity securities 8 8 Unlisted investment funds 7 5 15 13 Other 2 - Total non-current other financial assets 638 384 Refer to Note 36 for AGL’s financial assets accounting policy and critical accounting estimates and assumptions.  ===== PAGE 119 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 117 12. Other assets Note 2023 $m 2022 $m Current Green commodities scheme certificates and instruments 228 214 Prepayments 84 85 Total current other assets 312 299 Non-current Defined benefit superannuation plan asset 32 81 81 Total non-current other assets 81 81 ACCOUNTING POLICY Green commodity scheme certificates AGL participates in a number of renewable energy and energy efficiency schemes administered by the Commonwealth and State governments.

ACCOUNTING POLICY Equity accounted investments AGL’s interests in equity accounted investees comprise interests in associates and joint ventures. Associates are those entities in which AGL has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies of the entity. A joint venture is an arrangement in which AGL has joint control and AGL has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, investments in associates and joint ventures are initially recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise AGL’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associates and joint ventures. An impairment loss is measured by comparing the recoverable amount of the investment with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss and is reversed if there has been a favourable change in estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. Unrealised gains on transactions between AGL and an associate or a joint venture are eliminated to the extent of AGL’s interest in the associate or joint venture. Unrealised losses are also eliminated, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of an impairment.  ===== PAGE 122 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 120 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 15. Property, plant and equipment 2023 Plant and equipment $m Right-of-use plant and equipment $m Other Right-of- use assets $m Other $m Total $m Balance at 1 July 2022, net of accumulated depreciation and impairment 5,762 3 164 84 6,013 Additions 496 103 2 3 604 Impairment loss recognised in profit or loss (987) - (4) - (991) Change in estimate related to provision for environmental rehabilitation 399 - - - 399 Disposals (2) - - - (2) Reversal of impairment1 51 - - - 51 Reclassified to held for sale (130) - - (1) (131) Depreciation expense (505) (7) (13) - (525) Balance at 30 June 2023 net of accumulated depreciation and impairment 5,084 99 149 86 5,418 1.

Property, plant and equipment under construction The net carrying amount of property, plant and equipment disclosed above includes expenditure recognised in relation to plant and equipment which is in the course of construction of $440 million (2022: $375 million). ACCOUNTING POLICY Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of the asset. Finance costs related to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised. Cost may also include transfers from other comprehensive income of any gain or loss on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property, plant and equipment. Subsequent costs are capitalised when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to AGL and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Other costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. The gain or loss arising on disposal or retirement is recognised in profit or loss. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost of each asset over its expected useful life to its estimated residual value. Leasehold improvements are amortised over the period of the relevant lease or estimated useful life, whichever is the shorter. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate at the end of each annual reporting period. The following estimated useful lives are used in the calculation of depreciation: • Leasehold improvements − lesser of lease period or up to 50 years • Plant and equipment − Up to 50 years Right-of-use assets (ROU assets) A ROU asset is recognised in relation to each lease and is initially measured at cost comprising the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made before the commencement date (reduced by lease incentives received), plus initial direct costs incurred in obtaining the lease and an estimate of costs to be incurred in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, unless those costs are incurred to produce inventories. A ROU asset is subsequently measured using the cost model less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. AGL does not apply the revaluation model but instead carries all ROU assets at cost. The ROU asset is depreciated over its useful life. The useful life of a ROU asset for depreciation purposes is the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term. Where the ROU asset is adjusted due to changes in the lease liability, the depreciation for the ROU asset is adjusted on a prospective basis. The following estimated useful lives are used in the calculation of depreciation on ROU assets: • Plant and equipment – ROU assets: lesser of lease period or up to 15 years • Other – ROU assets: lesser of lease period or up to 50 years Short-term and low value leases as lessee AGL has elected to apply the practical expedients available for short-term leases (i.e. where the lease period is 12 months or less) and low-value asset leases. As a result of application of these practical expedients, the measurement requirements of accounting standards do not apply and the expense for these leases is recognised on a straight-line basis. Impairment of non-financial assets excluding goodwill At the end of each reporting period, AGL reviews the carrying amounts of its assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, AGL estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.  ===== PAGE 124 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 122 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 ACCOUNTING POLICY An impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss if the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Refer to note 16 for further details on the impairment incurred during the period. 16. Intangible assets 2023 Goodwill $m Software $m Licences $m Other $m Total $m Balance at 1 July 2022, net of accumulated amortisation and impairment 2,446 447 275 84 3,252 Additions - 128 - 5 133 Amortisation expense - (170) (9) (24) (203) Balance at 30 June 2023, net of accumulated amortisation and impairment 2,446 405 266 65 3,182 Balance at 1 July 2022 Cost (gross carrying amount) 3,073 1,488 311 331 5,203 Accumulated amortisation and impairment (627) (1,041) (36) (247) (1,951) Net carrying amount 2,446 447 275 84 3,252 Balance at 30 June 2023 Cost (gross carrying amount) 3,073 1,616 311 336 5,336 Accumulated amortisation and impairment (627) (1,211) (45) (271) (2,154) Net carrying amount 2,446 405 266 65 3,182 2022 Goodwill $m Software $m Licences $m Other $m Total $m Balance at 1 July 2021, net of accumulated amortisation and impairment 2,440 482 285 95 3,302 Additions 6 155 - 12 173 Amortisation expense - (190) (10) (23) (223) Balance at 30 June 2022, net of accumulated amortisation and impairment 2,446 447 275 84 3,252 Balance at 1 July 2021 Cost (gross carrying amount) 3,067 1,333 311 319 5,030 Accumulated amortisation and impairment (627) (851) (26) (224) (1,728) Net carrying amount 2,440 482 285 95 3,302 Balance at 30 June 2022 Cost (gross carrying amount) 3,073 1,488 311 331 5,203 Accumulated amortisation and impairment (627) (1,041) (36) (247) (1,951) Net carrying amount 2,446 447 275 84 3,252 Intangible assets under development The net carrying amount of intangible assets disclosed above includes expenditure recognised in relation to intangible assets which are in the course of development of $67 million (2022: $39 million).  ===== PAGE 125 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 123 Impairment testing for goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives Goodwill, that is significant in comparison to AGL's total carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite lives, has been allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) for the purpose of impairment testing as follows: Year ended 30 June 2023 $m Customer Markets 1,093 Wholesale Gas 1,353 Generation Fleet - Flexible Generation - Total goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives 2,446 Year ended 30 June 2022 Customer Markets 1,093 Wholesale Gas 1,353 Generation Fleet - Flexible Generation - Total goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives 2,446 ACCOUNTING POLICY Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are initially measured at cost. The cost of an intangible asset acquired in a business combination is its fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed at least annually for impairment. Finite lived intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful life and tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting period. The following estimated useful lives are used in the calculation of amortisation for intangible assets with finite lives: • Customer relationships and contracts − 3 to 20 years • Software − 3 to 7 years • Licences – 3 to 35 years An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised. Goodwill Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of the acquisition of the business less accumulated impairment losses, if any. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of AGL’s CGUs or groups of CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, and tested for impairment at least annually. A CGU or group of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the CGU or group of CGUs is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU(s) and then to the other assets of the CGU(s) pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU(s). Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods. Software Software is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition or development of the software. Licences Licences are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Customer relationships and contracts Customer relationships and contracts acquired in a business combination are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the period during which economic benefits are expected to be received. The direct costs of establishing customer contracts are recognised as an asset when they relate to a specific customer acquisition campaign. The direct costs are amortised over the minimum contract term. Direct costs include customer acquisition fees paid to channel partners and upfront account purchase payments. All other customer acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.  ===== PAGE 126 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 124 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Impairment assessment for the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL regularly reviews the carrying values of its assets to test for any impairment. An assessment of indications of impairment for each cash generating unit (CGU) is performed at each reporting period end, and if indications exist, a subsequent recoverable value assessment is performed. Notwithstanding the above, the recoverable value of a CGU containing goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives or intangible assets in development is determined at least annually. These annual assessments are performed in December each year. AGL’s main CGUs are: • Generation Fleet • Customer Markets • Wholesale Gas • Flexible Generation Impairment testing methodology AGL is subject to a number of external factors that impact the performance of its CGUs. This includes, but is not limited to, market prices, external regulatory and social factors that may impact the life of assets, competitor behaviour and new entrants and technological change. To respond to the range of potential outcomes that can result from these factors, AGL applies a scenario analysis approach when determining the recoverable value of assets. Each of the scenarios are assigned a probability weighting to estimate the recoverable value of the CGU overall. The methodology of analysing several modelled outcomes is consistent with AGL’s external reporting disclosures such as the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reports and Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP). The scenarios modelled represent a range of outcomes including differing wholesale market prices, asset lives, and operating costs. If the recoverable amount of a CGU is estimated to be less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount of the CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount with any impairment recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss. Generation Fleet CGU The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use include: • Electricity pool prices; • Station closure dates; • Discount rate; • Generation volumes; • Assumptions associated with regulatory outcomes impacting upon operations; and • Probability weighting applied to each scenario. As part of the review of strategic direction undertaken in September 2022, the estimated recoverable value of the Generation Fleet CGU resulted in the recognition of an impairment expense of $1,008 million (pre tax). A post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 8.5% (FY22: 6.7%) was utilised to derive the recoverable value. For AGL’s fleet of finite life generation assets, cash flow forecasts are based on discrete and long-term cash flow forecasts that reflect the life of the assets. The long-term modelling reflects AGL’s view of the cash flows anticipated from operations, factoring in known events such as planned outages and expectations, and allows for quantification of sensitivities and scenarios. At 30 June 2023, an impairment indicators assessment was performed for the Generation Fleet CGU to determine if there were any indicators of further impairment since September 2022, or reversal of impairment. The assessment has not identified any internal or external indicators that the asset within this CGU is further impaired or the previous impairment expense recognised should be reversed. Accordingly, no further recoverable value assessment was required. The recoverable amount is sensitive to reasonably possible changes in assumed electricity pool prices, discount rates, and expected asset closure dates. It is reasonably possible that a change in these assumptions could lead to a reduction in recoverable value. The interrelationship of changes in these and other assumptions is complex. Changes in the external operating environment, such as closure of large load consumers (aluminium smelters), significant new generation capacity or delays in the closure of other non-AGL owned power stations; or changes to government policies can result in changes of pool prices or may reduce the operating lives of AGL’s assets which can lead to further impairments. Impact of climate change related risk AGL recognises that there is an increased pace of change in the energy industry, community perspectives and associated political landscape. The scenario analysis undertaken as part of AGL’s impairment analysis in September 2022 includes scenarios that are consistent with the TCFD analysis performed and reflects AGL’s commitments as set out in the CTAP. Customer Markets CGU The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use include: • Discount rate; • Terminal growth rate; • Customer numbers and churn; • Gas margins and volumes; • Gross margin including assumptions around regulatory outcomes, constraints that impact pricing of market contracts, customer product swaps and customer discounts; and • Probability weighting applied to each scenario. The outcomes are based on actual regulatory decisions for the current reporting period, which are publicly available, together with AGL’s expectations of regulated network prices and regulated pricing (Victorian Default Market Offer/Default Market  ===== PAGE 127 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 125 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Offer) beyond the current reset period. The assumed future gross margin in unregulated markets is determined with reference to historic achieved revenue rates, AGL’s expectations of future price changes and impact of expected customer discounts. Customer numbers and consumption volumes are estimated based on historical experience, marketing strategies for the retention and winning of customers and the expected competition from new entrants. A post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 7.5% (FY22: 6.7%) and terminal growth rate of 2.5% (FY22: 2%) was utilised to derive the recoverable value for the December 2022 impairment assessment. At 30 June 2023, an impairment indicators assessment was performed for the Customer Markets CGU. The assessment has not identified any internal or external indicator that the assets within this CGU are impaired and accordingly, no further recoverable value assessment was required. Wholesale Gas CGU The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use include: • Discount rate; • Terminal growth rate; • Gas margins and volumes; • Assumptions associated with regulatory outcomes impacting upon operations; and • Probability weighting applied to each scenario. Gas procurement costs are estimated based on the actual contract portfolio, together with an estimate of future margins and volumes beyond the period of the actual contract portfolio. The recoverable amount is sensitive to reasonably possible changes in assumptions. At December 2022, the recoverable amount of the CGU would equal its carrying amount if the long-term gas margin forecast is reduced by $0.24/GJ in isolation. A post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 7.5% (FY22: 6.7%) and terminal growth rate of 2.5% (FY22: 2%) was utilised to derive the recoverable value for the December 2022 impairment assessment. At 30 June 2023, an impairment indicators assessment was performed for the Wholesale Gas CGU. The assessment has not identified any internal or external indicator that the assets within this CGU are impaired and accordingly, no further recoverable value assessment was required. The Wholesale Gas CGU benefits from favourable supply costs associated with existing contractual arrangements. As these contracts lapse and costs reset to terms more consistent with current market conditions, the recoverable value of the Wholesale Gas CGU could potentially decrease. A decreasing recoverable value could give rise to the risk that the recoverable value may be lower than the carrying value and therefore potential impairment in future periods. Flexible Generation CGU At 30 June 2023, an impairment indicators assessment was performed for the Flexible Generation CGU. The assessment has not identified any internal or external indicator that the assets within this CGU are impaired and accordingly, no further recoverable value assessment was required. 17. Trade and other payables 2023 $m 2022 $m Current Trade payables and accrued expenses 1,100 2,558 Accrued distribution costs 434 378 Green commodity scheme obligations 263 207 Other 30 21 Total trade and other payables 1,827 3,164 Trade payables are unsecured and are generally settled within 32 days from end of month of the date of recognition.

CPI bonds • CPI bonds rank pari passu with other unsecured debt and will mature in May 2027. ACCOUNTING POLICY Borrowings Interest bearing liabilities All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, being the amount received less attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest bearing liabilities are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis. Leases At inception of a contract, AGL assesses whether a contract is, or contains a lease. A contract is, or contains a lease, if the contract conveys to the customer a right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. AGL assesses whether: • The contract involves the use of an identified asset – the asset may be explicitly or implicitly specified in the contract. Capacity portions of larger assets would be considered an identified asset if the portion is physically distinct or if the portion represents substantially all of the capacity of the asset. An asset is not considered an identified asset if the supplier has the substantive right to substitute the asset throughout the period of use. • The customer in the contract has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the period of use. • The customer in the contract has the right to direct the use of the asset throughout the period of use – the customer is considered to have the right to direct the use of the asset only if either: - The customer has the right to direct how and for what purpose the identified asset is used throughout the period of use; or - The relevant decisions about how and for what purposes the asset is used are predetermined and the customer has the right to operate the asset, or the customer designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose the asset will be used throughout the period of use. AGL as lessee In contracts where AGL is a lessee, AGL recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the commencement date of the lease for all leases other than short-term or low-value asset leases. Lease Liabilities A lease liability is recognised in relation to each lease and is initially measured at the present value of future lease payments at the commencement date. To calculate the present value, the future lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease (IRIL), if the rate is readily determinable. If the IRIL cannot be readily determined, the incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date is used. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following: • Fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments; • Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date (e.g. payments that vary due to changes in CPI, or commodity prices); and • Amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees, purchase options and termination penalties (where relevant). Variable payments other than those included in the measurement of the lease liability above (i.e. those not based on an index or rate) are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occur. For contracts containing lease and non-lease components, AGL accounts for each lease component separately from the non-lease components of the contract, where material.  ===== PAGE 130 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 128 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 ACCOUNTING POLICY The consideration in the contract is allocated to the components based on their relative stand-alone prices. Subsequently, the lease liability is measured in a manner similar to other financial liabilities, i.e., at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. This means the liability is: • Increased to reflect interest on the lease liability; • Decreased to reflect lease payments made; and • Remeasured to reflect any reassessment of lease payments or lease modifications, or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. After commencement date, the following amounts are recognised in profit or loss with respect to the payments pursuant to the lease: • interest expense: recognised as finance cost; and • variable lease payments not based on an index or a rate: recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs. Short-term and low value leases AGL has elected to apply the practical expedients available for short-term leases (i.e. where the lease term is less than 12 months) and low-value asset leases. As a result of application of these practical expedients, the measurement requirements above do not apply and the expense for these leases is recognised on a straight-line basis. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Leases Lease term Where lease arrangements contain options to extend the term or terminate the contract, AGL assesses whether it is ‘reasonably certain’ that the option to extend or terminate the contract will be made. Consideration is given to the prevalence of other contractual arrangements and or the economic circumstances relevant to the lease contract, that may indicate the likelihood of the option being exercised. Lease liabilities and ROU assets are measured using the reasonably certain contract term. Lease discount rates The discount rate applicable to a lease arrangement is determined at the inception of the contract or when certain modifications are made to the contract. The discount rate applied is the rate implicit in the arrangement, or if unknown, AGL’s incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate is determined with reference to AGL’s borrowing portfolio at the inception of the arrangement or the time of the modification and the amount and nature of the lease arrangement. If the arrangement relates to a specialised asset, incremental project financing assumptions are considered. 19. Provisions 2023 $m 2022 $m Current Employee benefits 220 219 Environmental rehabilitation 86 64 Onerous contracts 17 57 Restructuring 37 27 Other 6 7 Total current provisions 366 374 Non-current Employee benefits 6 6 Environmental rehabilitation 1,316 1,092 Onerous contracts 776 863 Total non-current provisions 2,098 1,961 Movements in each class of provision, except employee benefits, are set out below:  ===== PAGE 131 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 129 Environmental rehabilitation $m Restructuring $m Onerous contracts $m Total $m Balance at 1 July 2022 1,156 27 920 2,103 Changes in estimated provision (361) 29 (2) (334) Additional provisions recognised 714 2 - 716 Provisions utilised and derecognised (56) (21) (118) (195) Reclassed to held for sale liabilities (137) - (53) (190) Unwinding of discount 86 - 46 132 Balance at 30 June 2023 1,402 37 793 2,232 ACCOUNTING POLICY Provisions Provisions are recognised when AGL has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that AGL will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows. The unwinding of the discount is recognised in profit or loss as part of finance costs. Onerous contracts A provision for onerous contracts is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Environmental rehabilitation The provision for future rehabilitation costs is the best estimate of the present value of the expenditure required to settle the rehabilitation obligation at the end of the reporting period, based on current legal requirements and current technology. Future rehabilitation costs are reviewed periodically and any changes are reflected in the provision at the end of each reporting period. The initial estimate of the environmental rehabilitation provision relating to exploration, development and production facilities is capitalised into the cost of the related asset and depreciated/ amortised on the same basis as the related asset. Changes in the estimate of the provision for environmental rehabilitation are treated in the same manner, except that the unwinding of the effect of discounting on the provision is recognised as a finance cost rather than being capitalised into the cost of the related asset. Restructuring A restructuring provision is recognised when AGL has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it. Future operating losses are not provided for. Employee benefits A liability is recognised for benefits accruing to employees in respect of wages and salaries, annual leave, long service leave and sick leave when it is probable that settlement will be required and they are capable of being measured reliably. Liabilities recognised in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at their nominal values using the remuneration rate expected to apply at the time of settlement. Liabilities recognised in respect of long-term employee benefits are measured as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made by AGL in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Provision for environmental rehabilitation AGL estimates the future removal and rehabilitation costs of electricity generation assets, oil and gas production facilities, wells, pipelines, mine and related assets at the time of installation of the assets. In most instances, removal of these assets will occur many years into the future. The requirement for rehabilitation is also subject to community and regulatory expectations which may evolve over time and in practice negotiation is required to arrive at a practical rehabilitation strategy. The calculation of this provision requires management to make assumptions regarding the removal date, application of environmental legislation, the extent of rehabilitation activities required and available technologies. The assumptions are highly judgemental and represents management’s best estimate of the present value of the expenditure required to settle the obligation, given known facts and circumstances at a point in time.  ===== PAGE 132 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 130 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS For the period ended 30 June 2023, environmental rehabilitation has been updated to reflect the changes in assumption associated with the announced closure dates of AGL’s thermal generation assets. A pre-tax discount rate of 6.86% (FY22: 5.14%) has been used for the purpose of discounting the expected future cashflows. In line with AGL’s accounting policy, the Provisions for Environmental Rehabilitation are reviewed on a regular basis. Provision for onerous contracts AASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets defines an onerous contract as a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the least net cost of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil it. A provision for onerous contracts is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. AGL recognised a number of legacy power purchase agreements as onerous for the year ended 30 June 2021. Under these legacy power purchase agreements, AGL makes periodic payments for the electricity and green certificates generated by these assets. The agreements were primarily entered between 2006 and 2012 to support the development of the renewables sector at that time. These offtake agreements were entered at prices significantly higher than current and forecast prices for electricity and renewable energy certificates today. In line with AGL’s accounting policy, the onerous contract provisions are reviewed on a regular basis. 20. Other financial liabilities 2023 $m 2022 $m Current Derivative financial instruments - at fair value Cross currency swap contracts - cash flow and fair value hedges 21 8 Interest rate swap contracts - cash flow hedges - 1 Energy derivatives - economic hedges 1,620 3,475 1,641 3,484 Futures deposits and margin calls - 104 Deferred consideration 26 23 Total current other financial liabilities 1,667 3,611 Non-current Derivative financial instruments - at fair value Cross currency swap contracts - cash flow and fair value hedges 8 - Energy derivatives - economic hedges 739 364 747 364 Deferred consideration 101 127 Total non-current other financial liabilities 848 491 ACCOUNTING POLICY Financial Instruments Refer to Note 36.  ===== PAGE 133 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 131 ACCOUNTING POLICY Deferred consideration To the extent that deferred consideration is payable after one year from the acquisition date, the deferred consideration is discounted at an appropriate interest rate and, accordingly, carried at net present value in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

Some defined benefit members are eligible for pension benefits in some cases. Lump sum benefits are calculated based on years of service and final average salary. The defined benefit plans are closed to new members. The plans are the Equipsuper Fund (EF), Electricity Industry Superannuation Scheme (EISS), State Superannuation Scheme (SSS), State Authorities Superannuation Scheme (SASS) and the State Authorities Non-contributory Superannuation Scheme (SANCS). The Superannuation Industry Supervision (SIS) legislation governs the superannuation industry and provides the framework within which superannuation plans operate. The SIS regulations require an actuarial valuation to be performed for each defined benefit plan every three years, or every year if the plan pays defined benefit pensions. The plans’ trustees are responsible for the governance of the plans. The trustees have a legal obligation to act solely in the best interests of plan beneficiaries. The trustees have the following roles: administration of the plans and payment to the beneficiaries from plan assets when required in accordance with the plan rules; management and investment of the plan assets; and compliance with other applicable regulations. There are a number of risks to which the plans expose AGL. The most significant risks are investment risk, salary growth risk, inflation risk, interest rate risk, legislative risk and changes in the life expectancy for members. AGL also contributes to defined contribution superannuation plans for employees, which are also provided by these plans. Contributions made to these defined contribution plans are expensed as incurred.

The fair value of plan assets include no amounts relating to any of AGL’s own financial instruments, or any property occupied by, or other assets used by AGL. Principal actuarial assumptions The principal actuarial assumptions at the end of the reporting period (expressed as weighted averages) were as follows: 2023 EF % EISS % SSS, SASS, & SANCS % Discount rate active members 5.6 5.6 5.7 Discount rate pensioners 5.6 5.6 - Expected salary increase rate 3.0 3.8 3.2 Expected pension increase rate 2.8 2.9 - 2022 Discount rate active members 5.3 5.3 5.3 Discount rate pensioners 5.3 5.3 - Expected salary increase rate 2.5 3.5 3.1 Expected pension increase rate 2.6 2.7 -  ===== PAGE 146 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 144 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant. Defined benefit obligation Increase 2023 $m Decrease 2023 $m Increase 2022 $m Decrease 2022 $m Discount rate (0.5 percentage point movement) (27) 29 (30) 35 Expected salary increase rate (0.5 percentage point movement) 10 (9) 12 (11) Expected pension increase rate (0.5 percentage point movement) 9 (9) 10 (9) The sensitivity analyses presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated. There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses from prior years. Funding arrangements and employer contributions Employer contributions are determined based on actuarial advice and are set to target the assets of the plans exceeding the total of members’ vested benefits. Funding levels are reviewed regularly. Where assets are less than vested benefits, a management plan must be established to restore the coverage to at least 100%. AGL expects to contribute $13 million to the defined benefit plans during the year ending 30 June 2024. The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation as at 30 June 2023 was EF 9 years; EISS 11 years; and SSS, SASS and SANCS 12 years. Defined contribution superannuation plans AGL makes contributions to a number of defined contribution superannuation plans. The amount recognised as an expense for the year ended 30 June 2023 was $46 million (2022: $48 million). ACCOUNTING POLICY Defined benefit superannuation plans For defined benefit superannuation plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, in the period in which they occur. Changes in the net defined benefit asset or liability, including all actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating AGL’s obligation in respect of the plan are recognised in other comprehensive income when they occur. All other expenses relating to the defined benefit plans are recognised as an expense in the profit or loss. Any defined benefit superannuation plan asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan. Defined contribution superannuation plans Contributions to defined contribution superannuation plans are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Defined benefit superannuation plans Various actuarial assumptions are utilised in the determination of AGL’s defined benefit obligations. AGL uses external actuarial experts to determine these assumptions.  ===== PAGE 147 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 145 33. Share-based payment plans AGL operates the following share-based payment plans: • The Share Reward Plan; and • The Long-Term Incentive plan. AGL has the following other equity arrangements: • The Share Purchase Plan; and • The Restricted Equity Plan. Share Reward Plan (SRP) The SRP is AGL’s complying broad-based employee share plan that enables eligible employees to be granted up to $1,000 of ordinary shares in AGL for no consideration each financial year. The SRP is governed by the AGL General Employee Share Plan Rules. The grant of shares is subject to the achievement of performance metrics and can therefore be scaled down in years where all objectives are not met. Shares granted pursuant to the SRP are subject to a trading restriction of the earlier of three years or the participant’s cessation of employment. Eligible participants include all AGL employees with at least 12 months service at the eligibility date (generally 1 September following the financial year end). Participants in the long-term incentive plan are excluded from any SRP grant. Details of share movements in the SRP during the year are set out below: Grant date Balance at 1 July Number Granted during the year Number Fair Value per share $ Released during the year Number Balance at 30 June Number 2023 30 September 2023 - 329,700 $ 6.58 (31,500) 298,200 30 September 2022 234,973 - - (27,390) 207,583 30 September 2021 167,532 - - (18,147) 149,385 28 September 2020 100,251 - - (100,251) - Total Share Reward Plan shares 502,756 329,700 (177,288) 655,168 2022 30 September 2022 - 293,737 $5.96 (58,764) 234,973 30 September 2021 212,037 - - (44,505) 167,532 28 September 2020 124,221 - - (23,970) 100,251 28 September 2019 117,260 - - (117,260) - Total Share Reward Plan shares 453,518 293,737 (244,499) 502,756 The expense recognised in profit or loss, as part of employee benefits expense during the year in relation to the SRP, was $2 million (2022: $2 million). Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Plan The LTI plan provides for a grant of performance rights to eligible participants subject to AGL’s performance against pre-determined metrics over a four-year performance period (prior to FY20, a three-year performance period applied). The LTI is governed by the AGL Employee Share Plan Rules. Participation is determined annually at the discretion of the Board. Generally, performance rights are forfeited on cessation of employment. The Board has discretion with reference to the relevant facts and circumstances of the cessation to vest all or part of the balance, or to authorise a portion of the award to be retained and assessed post- employment.  ===== PAGE 148 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 146 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 Current LTI Plans For the FY23 and FY22 plan, the performance rights are subject to two performance hurdles, based on: • Relative Total Shareholder Return (Relative TSR) - 75% weighted; and • Carbon Transition metrics - 25% weighted For the FY21 plan, the performance rights are subject to three performance hurdles, weighted equally, based on: • Relative TSR; • Return on Equity (ROE); and • Carbon Transition metrics For the FY20 plan, the performance rights are subject to two performance hurdles, weighted equally, based on: • Relative TSR; and • Return on Equity (ROE) Relative TSR is calculated by ranking AGL’s TSR on a relative basis against the peer group, being S&P/ASX100 companies. ROE measures the amount of Underlying Profit returned as a percentage of average monthly shareholders' equity. Carbon Transition is calculated through three transition metrics. These metrics are based off emissions intensity, controlled renewable capacity and green and carbon neutral revenue. The performance period for the outstanding LTI plans as at 30 June 2023 are as follows: • FY23: Four years from 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2026 • FY22: Four years from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2025 • FY21: Four years from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2024 • FY20: Four years from 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2023 The number of shares vested are determined by the vesting schedules detailed in the tables below.

Other equity arrangements Share Purchase Plan (SPP) The SPP is AGL’s salary sacrifice plan that enables eligible employees to contribute up to $5,000 per financial year from their ongoing fixed remuneration and/or short-term incentive (STI) award into acquiring ordinary shares in AGL. The SPP is governed under the AGL General Employee Share Plan Rules. Shares granted pursuant to the SPP are subject to a trading restriction of the earlier of four years (from the start of the financial year in which they are acquired) or the participant’s cessation of employment. The holding lock is in place to provide for a deferral of income tax for participants. Eligible participants include all permanent AGL employees. Non-Executive Directors, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, and members of the executive team are excluded from SPP participation.

ACCOUNTING POLICY Share-based payments The fair value of performance rights granted to eligible employees pursuant to the AGL Long-Term Incentive Plan is recognised as an employee benefits expense, with a corresponding increase in the employee equity benefits reserve. The fair value is measured at grant date and recognised over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the performance rights. The fair value at grant date is determined by an independent valuer. At the end of each reporting period, AGL revises its estimate of the number of performance rights expected to vest. The amount previously recognised as an expense is only adjusted when the performance rights do not vest due to non-market related conditions. Pursuant to the AGL Share Reward Plan, shares are issued to eligible employees for no consideration. On the grant date, the market value of the shares issued is recognised as an employee benefits expense, with a corresponding increase in the employee equity benefits reserve. Shares under the AGL Share Reward Plan are subject to disposal restrictions and holding locks. 34. Related party disclosures Key management personnel remuneration Key management personnel are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of AGL, directly or indirectly, including the Directors of the Parent Entity.

All other receivables/payables are discounted to determine the fair value if the effect of discounting is material. • The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates that reflect the credit risk of various counterparties. Interest rate and cross currency swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates that reflect the credit risk of various counterparties. • The fair value of borrowings is determined as the present value of future contracted cash flows and credit adjustments. Cash flows are discounted using standard valuation techniques at applicable market yield having regard to timing of cash flows. • The fair value of energy derivatives is determined as the present value of future contracted cash flows and credit adjustments. Cash flows are discounted using standard valuation techniques at applicable market yield having regard to timing of cash flows. • The fair value of lease liabilities is estimated as the present value of future cash flows discounted where the effect of discounting is material. • The fair value of deferred consideration is determined as the present value of future contracted cash flows and credit adjustments. Cash flows are discounted using standard valuation techniques at applicable market yield having regard to timing of cash flows.

The total gains or losses for the year included a loss of $842 million relating to energy derivative Level 3 contracts held at the end of the reporting period (2022: a gain of $870 million). Fair value gains or losses on energy derivatives are included in other expenses in the line item ‘Gain on fair value of financial instruments’ in Note 4. The sensitivity of Level 3 contracts with significant unobservable inputs, where the inputs are higher by 10 percent is $(192) million and lower by 10 percent is $192 million (profit after tax (decrease)/increase)). Input changes were applied to forward prices with references to electricity market and emissions schemes, cost-based indexes, contract volumes and management's assumptions on long-term commodity curves. (c) Capital risk management AGL’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an appropriate capital structure of debt and equity. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, AGL may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. AGL’s overall capital management strategy remains unchanged from 2022. The capital structure of AGL consists of net debt (borrowings offset by cash and cash equivalents) and total equity (comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings). AGL monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio and funds from operations (FFO) to interest expense cover.  ===== PAGE 159 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 157 The gearing ratio is calculated as net debt divided by adjusted total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings, adjusted for cross currency swap hedges and deferred borrowing costs, less cash and cash equivalents. Adjusted total capital is calculated as total equity less the hedge reserve plus net debt. The gearing ratio at the end of the reporting period was as follows: 2023 $m 2022 $m Current borrowings 47 355 Non-current borrowings 2,836 2,523 Total borrowings 2,883 2,878 Adjustment for cross currency swap hedges (24) (89) Adjusted total borrowings 2,859 2,789 Cash and cash equivalents (148) (127) Net debt 2,711 2,662 Total equity 5,119 6,517 Hedge reserve (62) (79) Adjusted equity 5,057 6,438 Net debt 2,711 2,662 Adjusted total capital 7,768 9,100 Gearing ratio 34.9% 29.2% (d) Financial risk management AGL’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk (interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and energy price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. AGL’s overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of markets and seeks to manage the impact of these risks on its financial performance. AGL uses a range of derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the risk management policy and framework. The Board has established the Audit & Risk Management Committee (the Committee), which is responsible for approving AGL’s risk management policy and framework for identifying, assessing and managing risk. The Committee is also responsible for reviewing and updating the risk profile, monitoring the effectiveness of the risk management framework and reviewing at least annually the implementation of the risk management policy and framework. The Committee reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities. AGL has written policies covering specific areas, such as interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, energy price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments. Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed on a continuous basis. (e)  Interest rate risk management AGL is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. The risk is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, and by the use of interest rate swap contracts or other hedging instruments. AGL regularly analyses its interest rate exposure, by taking into consideration forecast debt positions, refinancing, renewals of existing positions, alternative financing, hedging positions and the mix of fixed and floating interest rates. At the end of the reporting period, AGL had the following financial assets and liabilities exposed to floating interest rate risk: Floating rate instruments 2023 $m 2022 $m Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 148 127 Total financial assets 148 127 Financial liabilities USD senior notes (after effect of cross currency swaps) 872 860 Bank loans 1,483 1,670 Interest rate swap contracts (1,450) (1,545) Total financial liabilities 905 985  ===== PAGE 160 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 158 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 Interest rate swap contracts - cash flow hedges The following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding at the end of the reporting period: Outstanding hedging instruments cash flow hedge - receive floating, pay fixed contracts Average contracted fixed interest rate Notional principal amount Carrying value of outstanding hedging instruments 2023 % 2022 % 2023 $m 2022 $m 2023 $m 2022 $m Less than 1 year 1.63 1.60 400 470 8 6 1 to 2 years 0.94 1.63 150 400 8 12 2 to 3 years 1.24 0.94 50 150 3 9 3 to 4 years 1.50 1.24 500 50 39 4 4 to 5 years 1.26 1.50 175 500 21 38 5 years or more 2.74 1.33 425 350 35 51 Total 1,700 1,920 114 120 Financial year 2023 $m 2022 $m Aggregate notional amount of variable rate borrowings 1,700 1,920 Aggregate notional principal of the outstanding interest rate swaps 1,700 1,920 Included in this amount: Forward interest rate swap contracts 250 375 Of which: Commences in 2023 - 125 Commences in 2024 200 200 Commences in 2025 50 50 The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly basis. The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is the Australian Bank Bill Swap (BBSW) reference rate. AGL will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis. During the year, no hedges were de-designated. All underlying forecast transactions remain highly probable. Interest rate sensitivity The following sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the end of the reporting period and the stipulated change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period. At the end of the reporting period, if interest rates had been 50 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, AGL’s profit after tax and other comprehensive income would have been affected as follows: Profit/(loss) after tax increase/(decrease) Other comprehensive income increase/(decrease) 2023 $m 2022 $m1 2023 $m 2022 $m1 Interest rates +0.5% (50 basis points) (3) (9) 3 2 Interest rates -0.5% (50 basis points) 3 9 (3) - 1. Interest rate sensitivity in FY22 was based on 150 basis points movement (f) Foreign currency risk management AGL undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. Foreign currency risk arises primarily from overseas term borrowings and firm commitments for the purchase of plant and equipment which are denominated in foreign currencies. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swap contracts. Forward foreign exchange contracts - cash flow hedges AGL’s Corporate Treasury policy requires the hedging of foreign currency risk using forward foreign exchange contracts. The Corporate Treasury’s policy is to hedge currency exposures of anticipated cash flows in excess of $3 million and to not enter into forward foreign exchange contracts until a firm commitment is in place. The forward foreign exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges.  During the year, no hedges were de-designated and all underlying forecast transactions remain highly probable as per original forecast.  ===== PAGE 161 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 159 There were $26 million of forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of the reporting period (2022: $1 million). The fair value of those contracts was $2 million (2022: nil). The following tables detail the Forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of the reporting period, as well as information regarding their related hedged items. Forward foreign exchange contracts assets and liabilities are presented in the line ‘Derivative financial instruments’ (either as assets or as liabilities) within the statement of financial position: Average exchange rate Contract value (foreign currency) Contract value (local currency) Carrying value of outstanding hedging instruments Cash Flow Hedge - Outstanding contracts 2023 2022 2023 $m 2022 $m 2023 $m 2022 $m 2023 $m 2022 $m Buy JPY 0 to 6 months - 71.56 - 100 - 1 - - Buy Euro 0 to 6 months 0.64 - 5 - 7 - - - 6 to 12 months 0.66 - 1 - 2 - - - 1 to 5 years 0.64 - 11 - 17 - 1 - Cross currency swap contracts Under cross currency swap contracts, AGL has agreed to exchange specified foreign currency loan principal and interest amounts at agreed future dates at fixed exchange rates. Such contracts enable AGL to eliminate the risk of movements in foreign exchange rates related to foreign currency denominated borrowings. The fair value of cross currency swaps at 30 June 2023 was an asset of $26 million (2022: asset of $100 million), of which $117 million (2022: $143 million) is in a cash flow hedge relationship, $(94) million (2022: $(48) million) is in a fair value hedge relationship and $3 million (2022: $5 million) relates to the currency basis of the cross currency swaps.

At the end of the reporting period, if the Australian dollar had weakened or strengthened by 10% against the respective foreign currencies where all other variables remain constant, AGL’s profit after tax and other comprehensive income would have been affected as follows: Profit/(loss) after tax increase/(decrease) Other comprehensive income increase/(decrease) 2023 $m 2022 $m 2023 $m 2022 $m AUD exchange rates +10.0% - - 1 (6) AUD exchange rates -10.0% - - (1) 8  ===== PAGE 162 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 160 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 (g) Energy price risk management AGL is exposed to energy price risk associated with the purchase and/or sale of electricity, gas, oil and environmental products. AGL manages energy risk through an established risk management framework consisting of policies to place appropriate risk limits on overall energy market exposures and transaction limits for approved energy commodities, requirements for delegations of authority on trading, regular reporting of exposures and segregation of duties. It is AGL’s policy to actively manage the energy price exposure arising from both forecast energy supply and customer energy load. AGL’s risk management policy for energy price risk is to hedge forecast future positions for up to five years into the future. Exposures to fluctuations in the wholesale market energy prices are managed through the use of various types of hedge contracts including derivative financial instruments. Energy derivatives – economic hedges AGL has entered into certain derivative instruments for economic hedging purposes under the Board-approved risk management policies, which do not satisfy the requirements for hedge accounting under AASB 9 Financial Instruments. These derivatives are therefore required to be categorised as held for trading and are classified in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as economic hedges. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in profit or loss as part of (loss)/gain on fair value of financial instruments. Energy price sensitivity The following table details the sensitivity to a 10 percent increase or decrease in the energy contract market forward prices. A sensitivity of 10 percent has been used as this is considered reasonably possible, based on historical data relating to the level of volatility in market prices. At the end of the reporting period, if the forward prices had been 10 percent higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, AGL’s profit after tax and other comprehensive income would have been affected as follows: Profit/(loss) after tax increase/(decrease) Other comprehensive income increase/(decrease) 2023 $m 2022 $m 2023 $m 2022 $m Energy forward price +10% (115) (79) - - Energy forward price -10% 113 78 - - The movement in profit after tax is mainly attributable to an increase/decrease in the fair value of certain energy derivative instruments which are not hedge accounted by AGL. The movement in other comprehensive income is due to the reclassification and/or amortisation of historical hedge accounted derivatives.  ===== PAGE 163 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 161 (h) Hedge effectiveness The following table details the effectiveness of the hedging relationships and the amounts reclassified from hedging reserve to profit or loss: Cash flow hedges Fair Value Hedges 2023 USD CCIRS $m IRS $m FX $m Energy $m USD CCIRS $m Carrying amount of the hedging instrument - Assets 117 114 2 - - - Liabilities - - - - (94) Total carrying amount of the hedging instrument 117 114 2 - (94) Change in value of hedging instrument (26) (6) 2 - (46) Change in value of hedged item 26 6 (2) - 44 Change in value of the hedging instrument recognised in reserve (8) 19 2 - n/a Amount recognised in profit or loss on discontinued hedge relationships - (1) - - - Hedge ineffectiveness recognised in profit or loss1 - 2 - - 2 Amount reclassified from hedge reserve to profit or loss2 (18) (25) - - n/a Balance in cash flow hedge reserve for continuing hedges (3) 122 2 - n/a 1.

(i) Credit risk management AGL manages its exposure to credit risk using credit risk management policies which provide credit exposure limits and contract maturity limits based on the credit worthiness of counterparties. AGL’s exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread among approved counterparties.  ===== PAGE 164 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 162 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 Trade and other receivables consist of approximately 3.95 million residential, small business and large commercial and industrial services to customers, in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia. Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of customers and, where appropriate, an allowance for expected credit loss is raised. AGL does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single customer or any group of customers. AGL limits its exposure to credit risk by investing surplus funds and entering into derivative financial instruments only with approved financial institutions that have a credit rating of at least A from Standard & Poor’s and within credit limits assigned to each financial institution. Derivative counterparties are limited to high creditworthy financial institutions and other organisations in the energy industry. AGL also utilises International Swaps and Derivative Association (ISDA) agreements with derivative counterparties in order to limit exposure to credit risk through the netting of amounts receivable from and amounts payable to individual counterparties. At the end of the reporting period, there was a significant concentration of credit risk with certain counterparties in relation to energy derivatives undertaken in accordance with the AGL’s hedging and risk management activities. The carrying amount of the financial assets recognised in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the maximum exposure to credit risk. AGL does not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements to cover this credit risk. (j) Liquidity risk management Liquidity risk is the risk that AGL will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, who have established an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of AGL’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. AGL manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. The following table details AGL’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities with agreed repayment periods. The amounts are based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities on the earliest date on which AGL can be required to pay. The table includes both interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are at floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at the end of the reporting period. 2023 Less than 1 year $m 1 - 2 years $m 2 - 5 years $m More than 5 years $m Total $m Non-derivative financial liabilities Trade and other payables1 1,827 - - - 1,827 USD senior notes 63 63 412 1,211 1,749 Bank loans 89 745 896 - 1,730 CPI bonds 14 15 31 - 60 Lease liabilities 39 36 57 304 436 Deferred consideration 39 40 84 - 163 2,071 899 1,480 1,515 5,965 1.

The classification depends on AGL’s business model for managing financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows. For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or other comprehensive income. For investments in debt instruments, this will depend on the business model in which the investment is held. For investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether AGL has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity instrument at fair value through other comprehensive income. AGL reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes. Measurement At initial recognition, AGL measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss. Debt instruments Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on AGL’s business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which AGL classifies its debt instruments: • Amortised cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. A gain or loss on a debt instrument that is subsequently measured at amortised cost and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised or impaired. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. • Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): Assets that are held for collecting contractual cash flows and through sale on specified dates. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVOCI is recognised in other comprehensive income. • Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL): Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss and presented net in the statement of profit or loss within other gains/(losses) in the period in which it arises. Equity instruments On initial recognition, AGL elects to classify each equity instrument as FVTPL or FVOCI. AGL subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where AGL has elected to present fair value gains or losses on equity investments in other comprehensive income, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains or losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investment. Dividends from such investments continue to be recognised in profit or loss as other income when AGL’s right to receive payments is established. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) on equity investments measured at FVOCI are not reported separately from other changes in fair value. Changes in the fair value of equity instrument financial assets classified as FVTPL are recognised in expenses in the statement of profit or loss as applicable. Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Where derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of changes in fair value depends on the nature of the item being hedged. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging relationship is revoked, the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. AGL documents at the inception of the hedging transaction the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items including whether the instrument is expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged items. AGL documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions at the inception of each hedge relationship. Fair value hedge Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The change in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the change in the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in profit or loss in the line item relating to the hedged item.  ===== PAGE 167 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 165 ACCOUNTING POLICY Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised to profit or loss from that date. Cash flow hedge The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity, limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item on a present value basis from the inception of the hedge. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss, within other expenses. When option contracts are used to hedge forecast transactions, AGL may elect to designate only the intrinsic value of the option contract as the hedging instrument. Gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the change in intrinsic value of the option contracts are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity. Gains or losses related to the time value element of the option are recognised in a cost of hedging reserve. When cross-currency contracts are used to hedge forecast transactions, AGL may elect to designate only the change in fair value of the cross-currency contract related to the spot component as the hedging instrument. Gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the change in the spot component of the cross-currency contracts are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity. The change in the currency basis spread element of the contract that relates to the hedged item is recognised within other comprehensive income in the costs of hedging reserve within equity. In some cases, AGL may designate the full change in fair value of the cross-currency contract (including currency basis spread) as the hedging instrument. In such cases, the gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the change in fair value of the entire cross-currency contract are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, as follows: • The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of hedge contracts are ultimately recognised in profit or loss as the hedged item affects profit or loss within expenses. • The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of the interest rate swaps hedging variable rate borrowings is recognised in profit or loss within ‘finance costs’. When a hedging instrument expires, or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative deferred gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging in equity at that time remains in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. When the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging that were reported in equity are immediately reclassified to profit or loss. Hedge ineffectiveness is recognised in profit or loss within other expenses. USD interest rate benchmark reform AGL has borrowings and derivative financial instruments denominated in USD which are impacted by USD interest rate benchmark reform. Although AGL does not have direct IBOR exposure on account of the borrowings and derivative financial instruments being fixed rate in nature, the valuation of its cross currency interest rate swaps and the underlying hedge relationships reference IBOR. During FY23, AGL has adopted SOFR rates in place of IBOR rates to value cross currency interest rate swaps. The impact from the transition is immaterial. There were no changes to AGL’s risk management practices and the overall economics of the hedging transactions. AGL’s internal hedge accounting documentation has been updated to reflect the use of the SOFR rate as the reference rate for valuation purposes. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Fair value of financial instruments Management uses their judgement in selecting an appropriate valuation technique for financial instruments not quoted in an active market. For derivative financial instruments, assumptions are made based on quoted market rates adjusted for specific features of the instrument. Other financial instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow analysis based on assumptions supported, where possible, by observable market prices and rates.  ===== PAGE 168 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 166 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 37. Parent entity information The accounting policies of the Parent Entity, which have been applied in determining the financial information shown below, are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements.

The address of its registered office is Level 24, 200 George Street, Sydney NSW 2000 Australia. The consolidated financial statements comprise the Parent Entity and its controlled entities (together referred to as AGL). For the purposes of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Parent Entity is a for-profit entity. The principal activities of AGL are described in Note 1. (a) Statement of compliance These consolidated financial statements are general purpose financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations as issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and the Corporations Act 2001. The consolidated financial statements also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Directors on 10 August 2023. (b) Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, except for derivative financial instruments and equity instrument financial assets, which are measured at fair value. Historical cost is generally based on the fair values of the consideration given in exchange for assets. All amounts are presented in Australian dollars, which is the functional and presentation currency of AGL, unless otherwise noted. The Parent Entity is a company of the kind referred to in ASIC Corporations Instrument 2016/191, dated 24 March 2016, and in accordance with that Instrument, amounts in the financial statements are rounded off to the nearest million dollars, unless otherwise indicated. The significant accounting policies that have been adopted in the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements are set out below. (c) Adoption of new and revised accounting standards and Interpretations AGL has applied the required amendments to Standards and Interpretations that are relevant to its operations and effective for the current reporting period for the first time for the financial year commencing 1 July 2022. These did not have any material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts recognised in AGL's consolidated financial statements. (d) Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Parent Entity and entities (including special purpose entities) controlled by the Parent Entity (its subsidiaries). Control is achieved when the Parent Entity is exposed to or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation. (e) Foreign currency transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. (f) Standards and Interpretations on issue not yet adopted The following accounting standards, accounting standard amendments and interpretations are due for adoption for the year ending 30 June 2024 or later: • AASB 2020-1 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current; • AASB 2020-6 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Classification of Liabilities as Current or Noncurrent – Deferral of Effective Date; • AASB 2021-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Disclosure of Accounting Policies and Definition of Accounting Estimates; • AASB 2021-5 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction; • AASB 2022-5 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback; • AASB 2022-7 Editorial Corrections to Australian Accounting Standards and Repeal of Superseded and Redundant Standards;  ===== PAGE 170 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2023 168 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 • AASB 2014-10 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture; • AASB 2015-10 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Effective Date of Amendments to AASB 10 and AASB 128; • AASB 2017-5 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Effective Date of Amendments to AASB 10 and AASB 128 and Editorial Corrections; and • AASB 2021-7 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Effective Date of Amendments to AASB 10 and AASB 128 and Editorial Corrections.

Member of Deloitte Asia Pacific Limited and the Deloitte organisation.            Independent Auditor’s Report  to the Members of AGL Energy Limited        Report on the Audit of the Financial Report    Opinion     We have audited the financial report of AGL Energy Limited (“AGL” or the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the  “Group”), which comprises the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2023, the consolidated  statement of profit or loss, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of  changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial  statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and the directors’ declaration.    In our opinion, the accompanying financial report of the Group is in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001,  including:     (i)   giving a true and fair view of the Group’s consolidated financial position as at 30 June 2023 and of its  financial performance for the year then ended; and   (ii)   complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001.    Basis for Opinion    We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those  standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report section of this  report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the  Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s  APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the “Code”) that are  relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in  accordance with the Code.     We confirm that the independence declaration required by the Corporations Act 2001, which has been given to the  directors of the Company, would be in the same terms if given to the directors as at the time of this auditor’s report.    We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.    Key Audit Matters       Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of  the financial report for the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial  report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.       Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu ABN 74 490 121 060    Quay Quarter Tower  50 Bridge Street  Sydney  NSW  2000    Phone: +61 2 9322 7000  www.deloitte.com.au  AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 171  ===== PAGE 174 =====       Key Audit Matter  How the scope of our audit responded to the Key Audit  Matter  Potential financial reporting impacts of climate  change related risk    Climate change related risk is pervasive to AGL’s  overall financial position and performance given the  industry in which AGL operates.      The associated audit risks we have identified include:   Forecast assumptions used in assessing the  recoverable amount of property, plant and  equipment and intangible assets.  In  particular, that forecast price and volume  assumptions and their interrelationship  with forecast emissions costs and energy  procurement costs may not appropriately  reflect actual changes in supply and  demand due to the impact of climate  change.     As disclosed in Section 3.2 of the operating  and financial review within the Annual  Report and Note 15 to the financial  statements, management has brought  forward the closure dates of AGL’s thermal  coal power stations in line with AGL’s  climate commitments announced as part of  the Review of Strategic Direction (“RoSD”)  and Climate Transition Action Plan (“CTAP”)  in September 2022. The targeted useful  lives of the thermal coal power stations  may be further reduced as Australian  federal and state governments move  towards ‘net zero’ emissions targets. As a  consequence, the depreciation expense  may be materially increased, a material  impairment  of  property,  plant  and  equipment may be required in the future  and the provision for environmental  rehabilitation may need to be materially  increased due to the potential acceleration  of timing of performing rehabilitation.     Regulatory change in respect of emissions  schemes and targets may result in  increased  requirements  for  capital  expenditure.               We have considered the areas of AGL’s financial statements  whereby climate change related risk could have a financial  reporting impact and determined audit procedures to  specifically respond to this.  Our procedures included,  amongst others, the following:     In respect of forecast assumptions used by management in  assessing the recoverable amount of property, plant and  equipment and intangible assets, in conjunction with our  valuation specialists, our procedures included, but were not  limited to:     assessing and challenging the key assumptions for  forecast price and volume assumptions used in the  forecast cash flows. We compared these  assumptions to historical results and economic  data and industry forecasts, considering the  impact of climate change related risk, where  applicable. In doing this, we obtained third party  outlook reports and information assessing the  National Electricity Market, which included  information related to energy pricing, emissions  costs, procurement costs, supply, demand,  government policy and targeted thermal coal  power station closure dates.    In respect of the targeted useful lives adopted by  management as announced in the CTAP, our procedures  included, but were not limited to:    determining whether the earlier closure of AGL’s  thermal  coal  power  stations  has  been  appropriately reflected in the value in use  discounted cash flow modelling, as well as the  calculation of depreciation expense; and    challenging management’s assertion at 30 June  2023 that no further changes were required to  useful lives as a consequence of the potential  impact of climate change related risk. We  compared the assertions to third party outlook  reports and information evaluating the National  Electricity Market which included expected  thermal coal power station closure dates.     We have considered draft and finalised state and federal  regulation in respect of current and future emissions  schemes, including The Safeguard Mechanism, and the  impact this may have on the net realisable value of AGL’s  172 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023  ===== PAGE 175 =====       Key Audit Matter  How the scope of our audit responded to the Key Audit  Matter  renewable energy certificate balances and completeness of  recorded obligations.    We have also assessed the appropriateness of the  disclosures included in Note 15, Note 16 and Note 19 to the  financial statements and consistency with the operating  and financial review section of the Annual Report. Carrying value of property, plant and equipment and  intangible assets     As disclosed in Note 15 and 16 to the financial  statements at 30 June 2023 property, plant and  equipment totaling $5,418 million and intangible  assets totaling $3,182 million, including goodwill of  $2,446 million, are included in the consolidated  statement of financial position.    On 29 September 2022 AGL announced the results  of the RoSD which included the announcement that  the closure date for Loy Yang (''LY'') Power Station  would be brought forward to 2035 from 2045 and a  consequent impairment of $706 million (post tax)  would be recognised to the associated carrying value  of inventory and property, plant and equipment.      Where a cash generating unit (“CGU”) contains  goodwill, management conducts annual impairment  tests (or more frequently if impairment indicators  exist) to assess the recoverable amount of property,  plant and equipment and intangible assets. This  assessment is performed through the preparation of  discounted cash flow value in use models using  impairment  scenario  analysis.    The  annual  impairment assessment for the year ended 30 June  2023 was carried out at 31 December 2022 and  management has considered whether indicators of  impairment are present at 30 June 2023.    The evaluation of the recoverable amount requires  significant  judgement  by  management  in  determining the key assumptions supporting the  forecast cash flows of each CGU including:    energy prices in the short and long term;    energy procurement costs and generation  volumes;     thermal coal power station closure dates;    timing and quantum of future  environmental  rehabilitation costs;      Our procedures included, but were not limited to:    obtaining an understanding of the process flows  and key controls associated with the valuation  models, prepared by management and approved  by the AGL Board, used to estimate the  recoverable amount of each CGU and impairment  expense, where applicable;    evaluating management’s methodologies and  their documented basis for key assumptions  utilised in the discounted cash flow valuation  models, which are disclosed in Note 16;    in conjunction with our valuation specialists,  assessing and challenging:  o the identification of each CGU;  o the identification and allocation of cash flows  for the purposes of assessing the recoverable  amount of each CGU;  o the key assumptions for forecasting energy  prices and demand used in the forecast cash  flows (see ‘Potential financial reporting impact  of climate change related risk’ above); and   o the discount rate applied by comparing to our  independent estimate, third party evidence  and broker consensus data.    comparing the term of forecast cash flows  included in the valuation models to the targeted  closure dates of thermal coal power stations as  announced to the market in the CTAP;    checking the mechanics and mathematical  accuracy of the cash flow models;    agreeing forecast cash flows including capital  expenditure to the latest forecasts approved by  the AGL Board;    assessing management’s historical forecasting  accuracy through retrospective analysis by  comparing to actual results and whether the  estimates had been determined and applied on a  consistent basis;  AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 173  ===== PAGE 176 =====       Key Audit Matter  How the scope of our audit responded to the Key Audit  Matter    timing  and  quantum  of  future  capital  expenditure to meet current and expected  regulatory emissions requirements;    applying appropriate discount rates; and    scenario analysis and probability weighting of  each scenario to estimate the value of each  CGU.          challenging  the  scenarios  and  probability  weighting of those scenarios, including further  sensitivity analyses in terms of future energy prices   and the discount rate applied; and     assessing and challenging the consideration by  management of reasonably possible changes in  key assumptions that would be required for each  CGU to be impaired and considering the likelihood  of such movement in those key assumptions  arising.     We have also assessed the appropriateness of the  disclosures included in Note 4, Note 15 and Note 16 to the  financial statements.  Derivative financial instruments    AGL enters into various financial instruments  including derivative financial instruments, which are  recorded at fair value, to economically hedge the  Group’s exposure to variability in interest rates,  foreign exchange movements and energy prices.      These derivative financial instruments include long  term energy purchase and supply contracts which in  some cases have significant contractual volumes  and/or pricing linked to commodity prices.    At 30 June 2023, derivative financial assets totaled  $2,346 million (current assets of $1,725 million and  non-current assets of $621 million), as disclosed in  Note 11 to the financial statements, and derivative  financial liabilities totaled $2,388 million (current  liabilities of $1,641 million and non-current liabilities  of $747 million), as disclosed in Note 20 to the  financial statements.    Significant judgement is required by management in  the valuation of and accounting for these derivative  financial instruments including:    understanding and applying contract terms;     forecasting of energy prices in the short and  long term;     forecasting of emissions trading outcomes and  prices; and     applying appropriate discount rates.       Our procedures included, but were not limited to:     obtaining an understanding of the internal risk  management process and the systems and key  controls associated with the origination and  maintenance  of  complete  and  accurate  information relating to contracts containing  derivative financial instruments, and the valuation  of derivative financial instruments;     obtaining an understanding of the relevant  contract terms in derivative financial instruments  to assess the appropriateness of the relevant  accounting applied; and    in conjunction with our treasury and capital  markets specialists, testing on a sample basis the  valuation of derivative financial instruments  including:  o assessing  hedge  documentation  and  effectiveness where appropriate;  o evaluating the integrity of the valuation  models; and   o assessing the incorporation of the contract  terms and the key assumptions into the  valuation models, including future energy  prices and future energy demand used in  the forecast cash flows, and discount rates  by comparing to market data.    We have also assessed the appropriateness of the  disclosures included in Note 11, Note 20 and Note 36 to the  financial statements.      174 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023  ===== PAGE 177 =====       Key Audit Matter  How the scope of our audit responded to the Key Audit  Matter  Unbilled revenue and accrued distribution costs    Unbilled revenue of $832 million, as disclosed in  Note 9 to the financial statements, represents the  estimated value of electricity and gas supplied to  customers between the date of the last meter  reading and 30 June 2023 where no invoice has been  issued to the customer at the end of the reporting  period.     Accrued distribution costs of $434 million, as  disclosed in Note 17 to the financial statements,  represents the estimated distribution costs related  to energy consumption between the date of the last  invoice from the distributor and 30 June 2023.    Significant management judgment is required in the  calculation of unbilled revenue and accrued  distribution costs, including estimation of allowance  for expected credit losses. Management exercise  this judgement in the calculation of:     consumption profile for electricity and gas  retail portfolios;    pricing applicable to customers between  the last invoice date and the end of the  reporting period; and    application of consumption profiles of  portfolios against relevant published  distribution tariff rates.            Our procedures included, but were not limited to:    obtaining an understanding of the process flows  and key controls management has in place to  determine the estimate of unbilled revenue,  related allowance for expected credit losses and  accrued distribution costs;     understanding and challenging management’s  assumptions relating to volume, customer pricing  and distribution tariff rates used in determining  unbilled revenue and accrued distribution costs  by:  o  on a sample basis, agreeing data underlying  the calculation of the estimated volume to  supporting systems, having performed  testing of the key controls in those systems; o  comparing the prices applied to customer  consumption with historical and current  data; and  o  comparing the distribution tariff rates  applied to relevant published distribution  tariff rates.    assessing and challenging the allowance for  expected credit loss estimate applied to unbilled  revenue by:  o  evaluating management’s forward-looking  macroeconomic assumptions and scenario  weightings;  o  testing the completeness and accuracy of  critical data elements used in the expected  credit loss models; and  o  testing the recoverability of debtors  through  subsequent  cash  collection  analysis.    in conjunction with our data analytics specialists:  o calculating an independent estimate of the  expected unbilled revenue at 30 June 2023  using  historical  customer  consumption,  purchase volumes and pricing data, and  comparing this to the reported unbilled  revenue; and  o calculating an independent estimate of the  expected accrued distribution costs at 30 June  2023  utilising  information  supplied  by  distributors and tariff data and comparing this  to the reported accrued distribution costs.  AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 175  ===== PAGE 178 =====       Key Audit Matter  How the scope of our audit responded to the Key Audit  Matter  We have also assessed the appropriateness of the  disclosures in Note 2, Note 9 and Note 17 to the financial  statements.  Provision for environmental rehabilitation    As disclosed in note 19, AGL have recognised a  provision for environmental rehabilitation of $1,402  million (FY22: $1,156 million) in respect of the future  removal and rehabilitation costs of electricity  generation  assets  (including the  coal  mine  associated with Loy Yang Power Station), oil and gas  production facilities, wells, pipelines and related  assets at the time of installation of the assets. In  most instances, removal of these assets will occur  many years into the future. The calculation of this  provision  requires  management  to  make  assumptions regarding the timing and quantum of  rehabilitation cash flows, including closure date of  the associated asset, application of environmental  legislation and future regulatory and societal  expectations, the extent of rehabilitation activities  required and available technologies.        Our procedures included, but were not limited to:    obtaining an understanding of the process flows  and key controls management has in place to  determine the estimate of the provision for  environmental rehabilitation;    understanding the relevant data sources of the  forecast cash flows including use of estimates from  external experts;    where relevant, agreeing cash flow estimates to  draft or final contractual arrangements;    assessing management’s external expert for  objectivity and competence in preparing cash flow  estimates;    comparing forecast timing of rehabilitation cash  flows to closure dates of relevant assets as  announced to the market as part of the CTAP;     understanding and challenging discount rates  applied to the forecast cash flows against relevant  market data; and    verifying the accuracy of the calculation of the  rehabilitation provision.    We have also assessed the appropriateness of the  disclosure included in note 19.    Other Information     The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included  in the Company’s annual report for the year ended 30 June 2023 but does not include the financial report and our  auditor’s report thereon.     Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and accordingly we do not and will not  express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.     In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing  so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report or our knowledge  obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed,  we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.  We have nothing to report in this regard.      176 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023  ===== PAGE 179 =====       Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Report    The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair  view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal  control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true  and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.     In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group to continue as  a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of  accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic  alternative but to do so.     Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report     Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from  material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with  the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can  arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be  expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.    As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and  maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:        Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error,  design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient  and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement  resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,  intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.     Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that  are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness  of the Group’s internal control.     Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates  and related disclosures made by the directors.     Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based  on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that  may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a  material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related  disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our  conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However,  future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.     Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures,  and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that  achieves fair presentation.     Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business  activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial report. We are responsible for the  direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit  opinion.    AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 177  ===== PAGE 180 =====       We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit  and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our  audit.     We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding  independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought  to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.     From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in  the audit of the financial report of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.

Basis for Conclusion  We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with Australian Standard on Assurance  Engagements ASAE 3000 Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial  Information (‘ASAE 3000’), issued by the Australian Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.   We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our  conclusion.  AGL’s responsibilities   The Management of AGL are responsible for:   •  ensuring that the Subject Matter is properly prepared in accordance with the Reporting Criteria;   •  confirming the measurement or evaluation of the underlying Subject Matter against the applicable  criteria, including that all relevant matters are reflected in the subject matter information;  •  designing, establishing and maintaining internal controls to ensure that the Subject Matter is  properly prepared in accordance with the Reporting Criteria;   •  selecting and applying appropriate Reporting Criteria;   •  maintaining adequate records and making estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.    Our Independence and Quality Control  We have complied with the independence and other relevant ethical requirements relating to assurance  engagements and apply Auditing Standard ASQM 1 Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and  Reviews of Financial Reports and Other Financial Information, Other Assurance Engagements and Related  Services Engagements in undertaking this assurance engagement.  Assurance Practitioner’s responsibilities   Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Subject Matter based on the  procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained. ASAE 3000 requires that we plan and  perform our procedures to obtain limited assurance about whether, anything has come to our attention  that causes us to believe that the Subject Matter is not properly prepared, in all material respects, in  accordance with the Reporting Criteria.   A limited assurance engagement in accordance with ASAE 3000 involves identifying areas where a material  misstatement of the subject matter information is likely to arise, addressing the areas identified and  considering the process used to prepare the subject matter information. A limited assurance engagement  is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk  180 | AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023  ===== PAGE 183 =====   3    assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in  response to the assessed risks.  The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less  in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in  a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained  had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable  assurance opinion about whether the subject matter information has been properly prepared, in all material  respects, in accordance the Reporting Criteria.   Our procedures included:  •  Review of AGL’s processes relating to stakeholder identification, engagement and responsiveness,  including an assessment of stakeholder engagement outcomes and how this process and the outcomes  have been presented in the 2023 Annual Report  •  Review of AGL’s process to identify and determine material issues to be included in the 2023 Annual  Report with examination of underlying assessments and evidence on a sample basis  •  Interviews with a selection of AGL executives and senior management, including AGL’s sustainability  management team concerning the overall governance structure, corporate sustainability strategy and  policies used for managing and reporting sustainability performance across the business  •  In respect of the FY23 Selected Annual KPI scorecard disclosures:   •  interviews with a selection of AGL management responsible for selected FY23 Annual KPI scorecard  disclosures to understand the compilation and review processes;  •  conducting site visits at a sample of facilities;  •  applying analytical and other review procedures including assessing relationships between the  reported information and other financial and non-financial data;  •  examination of evidence for a small number of transactions or events;  •  analysing and inspecting on a sample basis, the key systems, processes and procedures and  controls relating to the collation, validation, presentation and approval process of the information  included in the 2023 Annual Report;  •  review underlying evidence on a sample basis to corroborate that the information is prepared and  reported in line with the relevant reporting criteria.  Inherent limitations  Because of the inherent limitations of an assurance engagement, together with the inherent limitations of  any system of internal control there is an unavoidable risk that it is possible that fraud, error, or non- compliance with laws and regulations, where there has been concealment through collusion, forgery and  other illegal acts may occur and not be detected, even though the engagement is properly planned and  performed in accordance with Standards on Assurance Engagements.   Restricted Use  The applicable criteria used for this engagement was designed for a specific purpose of assisting  management of AGL in their reporting of the Selected Annual KPI scorecard disclosures, as a result, the  subject matter information may not be suitable for another purpose.   This report has been prepared for use by management of AGL for the purpose reporting on the subject  matter information presented in the 2023 Annual Report. We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for  any reliance on this report or on the Subject Matter to which it relates, to any person other than the  management of AGL or for any purpose other than that for which it was prepared.

Term Explanation Strategic Net Promoter Score (NPS) NPS is a measure of overall brand performance and is based on how likely a customer would be to recommend AGL as an energy provider. AGL’s NPS is measured quarterly via an external survey that asks customers across all energy retailers “On a scale of 0-10, how likely is it that you would recommend Retailer X to a friend or colleague?” The NPS is calculated by subtracting the proportion of responses of zeros to sixes from the proportion of responses of nines and tens. The performance measure relates to the NPS measured in Q4 of the reporting year. Ombudsman complaints Reported figures represent complaints to the various state energy Ombudsman offices that are provided to AGL for resolution. Enquiries and complaints referred to other agencies or instances where the customer has been advised by the Ombudsman to contact AGL directly are not included.

Emissions data is based on measured emissions from material sources, which make up approximately 99% of total Scope 1 and 2 emissions, with estimates for minor sources. Environmental regulatory reportable incidents (ERR) Up to and including FY22, ERR comprised incidents that trigger mandatory notification provisions under legislation and/or environmental licences.  In FY23 there was a change to the Environmental Regulatory Reportable (ERR) incidents definition. From FY23, an ERR incident is any Event that meets the notification criteria of a Regulatory Authority and may include: an Event that caused actual or potential material or serious environmental harm; a breach of an environmental licence condition that is not an administrative non-compliance; and monitoring unable to be completed due to availability of plant or specialist. An ERR incident may include events that have occurred on AGL managed site by an independent party. This definition change has resulted in an increase in ERR events reported as it comprises previous ERR and Voluntarily Regulatory Reportable (VRR) events into one figure. Pool generation volume Pool generation volume refers to electricity that AGL generates that is sold into the National Electricity Market and the Western Australian Wholesale Energy Market (together termed “the pool”) and considers marginal loss factors, non-scheduled generation and auxiliary usage. Digitally active services to customers (%) Digital Active (%) is the percentage of contracts considered to be Digital Active as a proportion of total contracts (excluding Staying Connected customers). Digital Active customers are defined as customers that have accessed one of AGL’s digital channels (including MyAccount, App, Web etc.) at least once in the last 180 days. Historical data for Digital Active customers has been updated to reflect a change in the calculation methodology. Digital only customers (%) Digital only refers to the percentage of residential customers who, in the last 90 days, have only interacted with AGL via AGL's Digital ecosystem, including agl.com.au, help and support, MyAccount and the Mobile App. This includes customers on both ebill and direct debit.  Major IT incidents Data relates to the number of major IT incidents impacting a technology service, system, network or application ranked as ‘critical’ or ‘high’ in accordance with AGL’s IT incident management processes. A 'critical' IT incident refers to a complete interruption of service, system, network, application or configuration item identified as critical. A 'high' IT incident applies when the service, system, network, application or configuration item can perform but where performance is significantly reduced and/or with very limited functionality. Operations can continue in a restricted mode. From FY21, data includes Perth Energy (acquired during FY20), Click Energy (acquired during FY21), and any incidents related to Southern Phone services that are sold through AGL's multi-product offerings (NBN and mobile). From FY22, data includes Solgen and Epho (acquired during FY21).  Reportable privacy incidents Data comprises ‘eligible data breaches’ as defined in the Privacy Act 1988. An eligible data breach arises when there is unauthorised access, disclosure, or loss of personal information and AGL has not been able to prevent the likely risk of serious harm with remedial action. 1. AGL’s controlled boundary includes all electricity assets (generation and/or storage) for which AGL has operational control as defined by the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007; and/or contracted rights to control the dispatch of electricity of the asset.  ===== PAGE 191 ===== Corporate Directory and Financial Calendar AGL Energy Limited Annual Report 2023 | 189 Directory AGL Energy Limited ABN 74 115 061 375 Registered office Level 24, 200 George St Sydney NSW 2000 Australia Mailing address: Locked Bag 3013 Australia Square NSW 1215 Telephone: +61 2 9921 2999 Fax: +61 2 9921 2552 Web: agl.com.au Financial calendar 10 August 2023 Full Year result and final dividend announced 24 August 2023 Record date of final dividend 22 September 2023 Payment date of final dividend 21 November 2023 Annual General Meeting AGL recognises the Aboriginal and Torres Straits Islander peoples as the Traditional Owners of the lands on which we work, and acknowledges those communities’ continuing connections to their lands, waters and cultures.
