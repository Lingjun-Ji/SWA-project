We do that across the state, over  vast distances, and under challenging conditions.  The Corporation is owned by the state and is governed by a board of 7 directors  appointed by the government. The Board has a legislated mandate but must work  closely with government to help it deliver its priorities. And the people that rely on  our services have expectations as well. That is the balancing act the Board has to  perform. The biggest change in our operating environment has been our shift to the  new super department, the Department for Housing and Urban Development,  created by government to tackle the housing crisis in South Australia. The signal  from government is that we need to accelerate the provision of critical water and  sewerage infrastructure and $1.2 billion has been allocated for that task. The last year has seen the culmination of the regulatory review that occurs every  4 years. Our operation is scrutinised by an independent regulator that sets the broad  operating parameters – how much we can earn, how much we can spend, and what  performance standards we are required to meet. However, the government of the  day has the final say in the prices we charge customers, how much we can spend,  and the dividend we pay back to the state. With the completion of that process,  our course is set for the next regulatory period, however it is worth reflecting on  the challenges ahead. Water utilities across Australia, and in comparable countries in the western world,  grapple with the short and long-term demands of maintaining and replacing  expensive infrastructure as it ages and wears. SA Water and the state government  are mindful of this need to invest, yet at the same time balance the costs to the  public for these essential services. Transparency and openness about condition,  solutions and costs are essential. The board recognises the important role it plays  in working with government to ensure our long-term viability and continuing  performance. To conclude, I acknowledge the effective working relationship with government,  especially Minister Champion, Minister Close, and Treasurer Mullighan. I thank the board for its collaborative and diligent operation, and recognise the  particular contributions of Janet Finlay and Chris Ford, whose terms concluded in  August 2024.  David Ryan and his executive have provided outstanding service, as have  the staff and extended network of partners. I thank them sincerely. Allan Holmes Chair of the Board  ===== PAGE 6 ===== 6 A message from  the Chief Executive  Over the past 12 months, our people have  achieved significant outcomes for South Australia.  Cost-of-living pressures continue to impact many of our customers, and we have  been planning and preparing for the future as we move into a new 4-year regulatory  period. I’m enormously proud of our people and partners for their work providing  essential water services for our state.  In 2023-24, as we came to the end of a regulatory period, we accomplished a  significant amount to benefit our customers and our community.  Water security remains an important part of our strategy, with our Kangaroo  Island Desalination Plant hitting major milestones including submerged pipelines  and completed marine works. On the Eyre Peninsula, the ongoing planning and  development of our proposed desalination project continues, as we work with the  community to ensure an ongoing, reliable supply of water in our drying climate.  We also finished building 2 desalination plants in regional South Australia.  Oodnadatta celebrated first water in August 2023 and residents of Marla received  the first drinking water from their desalination plant, which has brought the  community safe and clean drinking water. I’ve had the pleasure of seeing these new assets – and the local communities –  firsthand. In the past year, I‘ve had the opportunity to visit remote communities in the  Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands and spend some time with our people  who help deliver services on the ground. Travelling from west to east, and then onto  Marla and Coober Pedy, I saw how our assets and these services are enabling these  remote communities to thrive. We achieved an outstanding outcome through the regulatory determination process  for 2024-28 and will deliver on these commitments as determined by the Essential  Services Commission of South Australia (ESCOSA). Our people have the skills,  experience and expertise in both the business and through our partners to deliver for  our customers. The final determination included $3.3 billion in net capital expenditure  – including $1.2 billion of investment to support housing growth as directed by the  state government – and $2.3 billion in operating expenditure. Through managing the growth of our community and essential services, we also  maintain our asset reliability. Much of our infrastructure can last more than 100 years  and service multiple generations and we continue to renew older existing assets  each year. In the past 12 months, we invested $87.5 million in our water main network  and infrastructure, and another $31.6 million in our wastewater pipe network and  infrastructure. Main break numbers remain low, and capital projects and major works  were delivered to ensure continued access to safe and clean drinking water for our  customers every day.  ===== PAGE 7 ===== 7 A message from the Chief Executive 7 It is important that we continue to build a workforce that is diverse, inclusive and  reflects the community we serve. Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Strategic  Plan developed in 2023-24 sets out how we will achieve this to support improved  outcomes for our people and our customers. A new Diversity, Equity and Inclusion  Council was formed to govern this work and ensure we achieve the outcomes set  in the plan. The council has representatives from across our business ensuring a  collaborative and collective approach to help us shift how we interact with  customers and inspire local communities and our partners. The health and wellbeing of our people, partners, contractors and visitors remains  a high priority and underpins our commitment to ensuring the safety of our people.  Delivery of our Health and Safety Improvement Plan has seen us advance work on  15 critical risks and deliver important wellness checks. Our focus in this area has  started important conversations in our business and keeps our people informed,  supported and safe in their day-to-day tasks. Our commitment as a participant in the United Nations Global Compact is  reaffirmed as we continue to work towards delivering services and achieving positive  outcomes for our community and the planet. As part of this commitment, we are  a signatory to the Australian water industry’s commitment to support the United  Nations Sustainable Development Goals.  We have been recognised by our industry and peers with 9 state finalists and 2  national winners in the Australian Water Association Awards, a national and state  winner in the IoT (Internet of Things) Awards, and a national finalist placement in the  CIPS (Chartered Institute of Procurement) and Supply Excellence Awards. As we look towards the future, our work this year and over the 2020-24 regulatory  period has laid a strong foundation for the next steps in our journey to support  South Australia’s growth and prosperity. As a state, we’re facing our largest housing infrastructure challenge in a generation.  In the 2024-28 regulatory period, we will invest $1.2 billion to support delivery of the  South Australian government’s Housing Roadmap. Working with the government and  industry, we will deliver water and wastewater services to help unlock new housing in  the wider Adelaide metropolitan area. I thank our people and partners for their tireless work and continued dedication  to delivering for our customers and state. Our collective efforts have seen us set a  strong platform for the future, and I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve accomplished.  Thanks also goes to the Chair of our Board, Allan Holmes, and our Board of  Directors for continuing to guide our business to deliver trusted water services  for a healthy and sustainable South Australia. David Ryan Chief Executive  ===== PAGE 8 ===== About SA Water  ===== PAGE 9 =====  ===== PAGE 10 ===== 10 10 Our vision Delivering trusted  water services  for a sustainable  and healthy South  Australia. Our organisation We are South Australia’s leading provider of water services for more than  1.8 million people. For more than 165 years we have been working together with  South Australians to ensure a reliable supply of safe, clean water and a dependable  sewerage system. We deliver for customers by ensuring continuity of service, making  smart asset decisions, responding to changing operational environments and  achieving operational efficiencies to keep costs down. As a statutory corporation, we report to an independent board and balance the  delivery of services in a competitive market with our responsibility to provide a  financial return to government. We are included in the portfolio of Minister for Housing Infrastructure, and work  closely with South Australian government agencies including:  	• Department of the Premier and Cabinet  	• Department of Treasury and Finance  	• Department for Environment and Water  	• SA Health  	• Environment Protection Authority. Our strategy A new strategy was developed to achieve our vision of delivering trusted water  services for a sustainable and healthy South Australia. A focus on measuring  customer trust, service delivery, sustainability and our people, sets our 2020-25  strategy on a clear direction and charts our course for 5 years. It maintains a  view towards 2050 because decisions we make can have a long-term impact  on the wellbeing of our customers and community, and the future sustainability  of South Australia. All water sources, delivery and  service options considered,  including inﬂuencing policy and  decisions.  Water for the future Safe, smart, reliable and affordable services - now and for the future. Driving customer outcomes Climate change action with a  reduce and reuse mindset. Proactive environmental  leadership   Promote the health and wellbeing  of active, thriving communities.  Healthy  communities Our people for the future A more diverse, inclusive and capable workforce.  Delivering trusted water services for a sustainable and healthy South Australia Success is: maintained trust, water quality, asset reliability, service continuity, efficient and affordable Success is: waste reduced, increased  by-product reuse, climate change resilience  Success is: greener, cooler communities,  reconciliation in action Success is: secure customer access to ﬁt for  purpose water Success is: safe and healthy workplaces, high employee engagement, creativity through diversity  ===== PAGE 11 ===== 11 About SA Water 11 Our services Every day, we provide essential water services to  cities, suburbs and towns across South Australia.  As one of the most efficient water utilities in Australia, we are continually improving  the way we do this for our customers to keep prices as low and stable as possible  over time. To deliver value for money, we strive to make smart, long-term investments,  and the best use of new technologies. We remain focused on what is important to  our customers and meeting our legal and regulatory responsibilities. We are the custodians of the longest water mains supply network of any Australian  water utility at a length of more than 27,000 kilometres. In addition, we manage  more than 9,000 kilometres of sewerage mains and a 451 kilometre recycled water  network. We manage drinking water quality from catchment to tap, working cooperatively  with SA Health to ensure the continued protection of public health and supply of  high quality, safe drinking water for our customers across the state. Overview of our network and assets As at June 2024, including all SA Water-managed infrastructure in remote Aboriginal  communities in South Australia.  ===== PAGE 12 ===== 12 12 Our water supply areas (as at August 2024)  ===== PAGE 13 ===== 13 About SA Water 13 Our wastewater treatment plants (as at August 2024)  ===== PAGE 14 ===== Year in review  ===== PAGE 15 ===== 15 Year in review 15 Highlights 258+ billion litres of water delivered to 750,499 homes  and businesses 93% customer satisfaction $702.3 million capital investment 300,000+ customers receiving eBills 55.6 kilometres of new water mains installed 46,505 water samples collected 412,000 visitors to reservoir reserves  ===== PAGE 16 ===== 16 16 Water price increase less than the consumer price index Water and wastewater prices for 2023-24 were capped at 4.8 per cent, well below  the Australian inflation rate of 7.0 per cent.  This meant the average metropolitan residential customer paid $24 less on their  combined water and sewerage bill in 2023-24 than if the price had held to the  consumer price index. In the Bureau of Meteorology’s National Performance Report for 2022-23 (released  in February 2024), which analyses and compares the performance of water utilities  across the country, the ranking of our annual residential combined water and  sewerage bill (based on 200 kilolitres) sits fourth cheapest of the 15 comparably-sized  utilities across Australia. Research and development builds capability  Research and development helps us meet the changing needs of our business,  builds the knowledge and capability of our people, and ensures we are prepared  for challenges and opportunities in the future.  In 2023-24, we delivered key research and development projects to:  	• continue knowledge building and assess the feasibility of assisted restoration  options to promote seagrass recruitment and long-term recovery, as part of the  10-year research program to guide interventions for regeneration of seagrass in  Adelaide's coastal waters 	• develop an acid resistant concrete for use in aggressive wastewater network  environments using a waste product from our water treatment plants 	• explore operational improvements to mitigate greenhouse gas generation from  wastewater treatment plant sludge drying lagoons. Sustaining and expanding our networks  Our continued focus to improve and maintain our water and wastewater networks  saw us invest $87.5 million in our water network and infrastructure, and $31.6 million  in our wastewater network and infrastructure.  In 2023-24 we installed 55.6 kilometres of new water mains through our water main  management program, with 6.2 kilometres laid in metropolitan Adelaide and 49.4  kilometres in country areas of the state.  As part of our 4-year, $155 million water main management program, new water  mains were installed throughout the state, at the following locations:  Location Meters of mains installed Lyndhurst  6,384 Gulnare 2,475 Chinbingina  5,582 Reeves Plains 2,933 Windsor Gardens  577 Croydon  562 South Plympton  517 Keswick  460 Salisbury 348 Driving customer  outcomes  We provide our  customers with safe,  smart, reliable and  affordable water  services. To achieve this,  we maintain trust by  ensuring water quality  and asset reliability, and  provide continuity of  service by preventing or  minimising temporary  service interruptions.  We deploy connected  and intelligent assets to  make smart decisions  and operate efficiently  so our services remain  affordable.  ===== PAGE 17 ===== 17 Year in review 17 We invested $87.5 million in our water network and infrastructure. Main leaks and breaks In 2023-24, 3,862 water main leaks and breaks were reported across our 27,000  kilometre network, compared with 3,722 in 2022-23. While this is a slight increase,  it is still in line with historical trends and predicted models. Meeting our customer service standards Performance measures and service standards set by our economic regulator, the  Essential Services Commission of South Australia, guide how we measure our success  in delivering what our customers and the community expect.  In 2023-24, we achieved 93 per cent customer satisfaction against a target of  93 per cent. Of the 138,390 fault-related phone calls we received during the year,  118,584 (86 per cent) were answered by our Customer Care Centre in Adelaide within  our target timeframe of 50 seconds, ahead of our 85 per cent target.  Other notable achievements include:  Measure Target Achieved First contact resolution 85% 100% Water quality responsiveness (metropolitan Adelaide) 97% 99% Water quality responsiveness (regional South Australia) 99% 100% Connection application responsiveness 95% 97% Water event responsiveness (high priority) metro 99% 100% Water event responsiveness (high priority) regional 99% 99% Sewer event responsiveness metro 99% 100% Sewer event responsiveness regional 99% 100% We met 21 of our 22 customer service standards. Our response to sewer overflow  clean-ups in metropolitan Adelaide was at 96 per cent, just short of the 98 per cent  target. This was primarily due to customers requesting partial or whole clean-ups at a  different time of day to better suit them, or where work was hampered due to access  or safety issues.  ===== PAGE 18 ===== 18 18 Summer messaging a hit with customers Approaching the 2023-24 summer season, the Bureau of Meteorology predicted  a hotter, drier summer for South Australia which was expected to impact our  customers and community. We responded with a summer messaging campaign that focused on informing  customers of the environmental benefits and financial savings of using water more  efficiently, along with waterwise tips to help them make changes.  For the first time, we tailored content to provide practical tips that were relevant to  different groups of customers.  Customer research showed our customers were aware of the campaign and  agreed that we educated them to be water conscious. This was supported by  the campaign results which demonstrated a wide reach, with more than one million  social media impressions and a click-through rate that exceeded government  benchmark standards. Sewer smell solutions  in Whyalla  A $4 million odour control unit was  installed in Whyalla to improve the  management of sewer network odour  within hotspot areas of the regional city.  The unit, an intricate system of filters,  pipes and valves, connects to the sewer  network through existing pipework and  uses a biofilter and activated carbon  filters to absorb odorous compounds  and reduce sewer smells. In June, we completed the rehabilitation  of more than 2,700 metres of sewer  mains across Whyalla as part of  our ongoing investment in reliable  wastewater services. The $2 million  project involved relining pipes with a  PVC liner being fed inside the pipes to  create a new surface and restore its  structural integrity.  Several of the city’s roads, such as  Booth Street, Cudmore Terrace, Nicolson  Avenue and Playford Avenue have  benefited from this project. Our summer messaging encouraged customers to use water efficiently.  ===== PAGE 19 ===== 19 Year in review 19 Pipalyatjara sewer services upgrade  The $770,000 upgrade to wastewater infrastructure at Pipalyatjara in the Anangu  Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands has supported increased demand for more local  housing and improved environmental performance of the community’s wastewater  pump station. The upgrade ensures the pump station can take on extra sewage and minimise the  risk of overflows. Sewer network upgrades in the Adelaide Hills We upgraded more than 100 metres of sewer main in Bridgewater as part of our  investment in reliable wastewater services for the Adelaide Hills. We also installed  a new pipe and built a gabion wall to improve erosion protection. The existing  100-millimetre-diameter pipe travels underneath Cox Creek to our Hahndorf  Wastewater Treatment Plant. Stirling sewerage storage tank up and running In July 2023, we completed work on our new one megalitre concrete wastewater  storage tank in Stirling. The tank, which is partly underground, stands at 21 metres long and 13 metres wide  and was built to provide extra capacity within the local sewerage network and  reduce the risk of sewage overflows during heavy rainfall events. Tea Tree Gully Sustainable Sewers project We have now converted more than 700 properties from the old community  wastewater management system and laid 15,000 metres of sewer pipes as part  of the Tea Tree Gully Sustainable Sewers project. A new wastewater pump station in Banksia Park, the first in the program, was  also completed in November 2023 and it has the capacity to receive and transfer  wastewater from 750 homes. We installed sustainable landscaping, watered by Tea Tree Gully Council's recycled  water network, to minimise the visual impact of the new station. Work on the project has been well received by our customers, resulting in an overall  post-conversion customer satisfaction rating of more than 95 per cent.  Myponga spillway gate upgrade  Major work took place at Myponga Reservoir as part of our $3.7 million upgrade  of the dam spillway gates, to ensure the long-term safety of the structure and to  secure the Fleurieu Peninsula’s water supply. Myponga’s 3 spillway gates were removed and refurbished to ensure they keep  operating reliably. The gates facilitate controlled release of water from the reservoir  based on its capacity and rain inflows from the catchment. Upgraded wastewater infrastructure at  Pipalyatjara in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara  Yankunytjatjara Lands.  ===== PAGE 20 ===== 20 20 Our Adelaide service delivery partnership Our Adelaide service delivery partnerships with Service Stream and SUEZ continued  in 2023-24. Metro field operations service provider, Service Stream:  	• completed 106,727 work orders and achieved 7 out of 7 customer service standards  set by the Essential Services Commission of South Australia (including best  endeavours) 	• maintained customer satisfaction through optimised delivery solutions, such  as non-dig-up sewer repairs and preventative sewer maintenance techniques 	• delivered services for our customers with an average customer satisfaction score  of 95 per cent 	• continued to operate and maintain the Community Wastewater Management  System in Tea Tree Gully 	• supported our capital delivery teams in delivering more than 6,000 metres  of new and replacement water mains in metropolitan areas 	• supported the rapid mobilisation of the 2023 Adelaide 500 supercar event by  ensuring our water and wastewater networks were ready for increased customer  demand 	• supported regional teams, particularly in the Barossa, with dedicated crew  members allocated to the region 	• planned, assessed and provided comprehensive condition assessment of  septic tank effluent drainage scheme networks in Aboriginal communities in  South Australia 	• cleaned, assessed and provided recommendations for wastewater assets in remote  communities including Gerard, Raukkan, Point Pearce, Davenport, Nepabunna,  Yalata and Koonibba, Pukatja, Fregon, Kaltjiti, Amata, Indulkana, Mimili and  Pipalyatjara 	• won the SA Training Awards 2023 Industry Collaboration Award with TAFE SA for  developing and delivering Service Stream’s bespoke Certificate III in Water Industry  Operations (Networks). Adelaide Service Delivery Project team. Our production and treatment alliance  partner SUEZ delivered projects  including a depot upgrade at our  Roseworthy site, new switchboards at  O’Halloran Hill and Seaview Downs  pump stations, a wastewater filtration  plant at Anstey Hill, and an upgrade  of the Bolivar inlet works to ensure it is  ready for wastewater systems growth.  In operating our wastewater  treatment plants, SUEZ produced  29,715 megalitres of recycled water,  supplied 83,565 tonnes of biosolids for  farmers in South Australia, and achieved  a 12 per cent reduction in their waste  footprint compared to 2022-23. Other initiatives included collaborating  with local land care groups, biodiversity  groups and community members to  continue driving revegetation projects  at our Glenelg and Aldinga wastewater  treatment plants. SUEZ’s innovation was recognised by an  Australian Water Awards National Safety  Award at Ozwater’24 in May, which  they won for their portable chlorine  disinfection skid.  ===== PAGE 21 ===== 21 Year in review 21 Water for the future Our production and  treatment activities  ensure the water we  provide is fit for our  customers to use and to  be recycled or returned  to the environment.  We harvest, store, treat,  distribute and reuse  water to provide fit-for- purpose water services  to our customers to  stimulate economic  growth and meet  customer needs, and  look for opportunities  to positively influence  policy and decisions. Delivering climate independent water on Kangaroo Island As the Kangaroo Island Desalination Plant nears completion. We laid 3 large  underwater pipelines off the coast of Penneshaw. The 200-metre-long submerged  pipelines include 2 intake pipes which will draw in seawater for treatment into safe,  clean drinking water at the new, 2 million-litre-per-day capacity desalination plant  near Hog Bay Road. The third outfall pipe will return saline concentrate from the desalination process  to the ocean, in accordance with strict environmental guidelines. The plant and pipe network which will deliver water to customers has been  commissioned and is set to deliver water to new customers from mid 2024. This  includes delivering water to people living in American River, Island Beach, Baudin  Beach and Sapphiretown.  Penneshaw’s new desalination plant will work in tandem with the existing nearby  desalination facility and Middle River Water Treatment Plant to increase the security  of Kangaroo Island’s drinking water supply for future generations. A section of pipeline being laid off the coast of Penneshaw.  ===== PAGE 22 ===== 22 22 We continued our conversation with the  local community about the Eyre Peninsula  Desalination Project. The Marla Desalination Plant is producing up to 87,000 litres of water each day. Water for remote communities  In a drying climate and with increasing customer demand, sustainable and climate  independent water sources are a growing focus for our people. As our available  water sources are set to reduce over the coming decades, we need to consider new  water sources to deliver secure and resilient sources of drinking water. In August 2023, the first water was delivered from the desalination plant in  Oodnadatta. This gave residents and visitors of the outback town safe, clean  drinking water from their taps for the first time. The small-scale reverse osmosis plant can produce up to 210,000 litres of drinking  water each day. Marla’s desalination plant was completed in January 2024 and is delivering safe,  clean drinking water to residents and businesses directly from their taps. The plant produces up to 87,000 litres of water every day and was constructed  inside a shipping container to protect it from the harsh weather in the area. Located in the state’s Far North, Marla’s water supply has historically been  designated as non-drinking, with residents sourcing their own drinking water from  private rainwater tanks, water carting or bottled products. We continued to progress infrastructure upgrades so that we can deliver safe, clean  drinking water to the regional towns of Yunta, Manna Hill and Terowie in the state's  north-east. We expect these upgrades to be completed by mid-2024.   ===== PAGE 23 ===== 23 Year in review 23 Water wise gardening. Water security for Eyre Peninsula  We are addressing water security on the Eyre Peninsula by working with the  community and stakeholders to build a desalination plant at Billy Lights Point. The desalination plant is critical to augment supply, currently drawn from an under- stress Uley South Basin, the regions primary source of drinking water and deliver a  long-term, climate-independent drinking water source for the 35,000 people in this  community.  We are proceeding with plans to build a more than $300 million desalination plant  to secure water supply after extensive engagement with community and stakeholders  and the detailed consideration of social, environmental and technical factors.  In 2023-24 we made significant progress on the project by way of design and  development approvals. We were able to progress beyond concept design by using  an early contractor engagement process. The plans developed will support the  submission of a development plan to the State Planning Authority and the progress  of other federal and state approvals. The design process has required a number of  terrestrial and marine studies to be completed, including geotechnical activities to  collect soil and rock samples from the ocean floor to determine the site’s geology  and potential construction method. In May, we began talking with Eyre Peninsula  communities about using water wisely in and around their homes and encouraged  people to be part of ensuring a secure water future for the region.  We also began a review of our Water Security Response Plan to prepare for all  scenarios, including what actions may need to be taken in response to a licensed  water reduction or if there are significant delays to the proposed desalination plant.  Housing roadmap We are working with the state  government and industry to plan and  deliver viable water and wastewater  solutions for housing growth across the  state in response to South Australia’s  new housing infrastructure roadmap  released in June 2024. The project  requires us to deliver the single largest  expansion of our metropolitan water  and wastewater network in decades. It  includes directly enabling the delivery of  25 kilometres of new trunk water main,  43 kilometres of trunk wastewater main,  4 new pumping stations and 2 new  water storage tanks.  The state government’s commitment to  the housing roadmap will deliver 40,000  new homes, including an extra 17,000  new homes in the state's growth areas.   The greatest number of new homes  will be unlocked in the priority areas of:  Angle Vale (2,200), Riverlea (3,980) and  Roseworthy (1,562).  Construction on water and wastewater  infrastructure is scheduled to  commence in late 2024, when we will  also begin building our resourcing,  developing governance, and community  engagement with key stakeholders and  communities.   ===== PAGE 24 ===== 24 24 Healthy  communities We support and  promote the health and  wellbeing of an active,  thriving South Australia.  This is achieved by  building sustainable and  liveable communities.  We share new ways of  using water effectively  and efficiently to  create comfortable  green spaces that  support wellbeing.  Through actions to  achieve reconciliation,  we support stronger  Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander  communities by helping  to create economic  opportunities. Recreational access at our reservoir reserves  In 2023-24, our 10 reservoir reserves welcomed more than 412,000 visitors.  Through our Reservoirs Partnership Program, which supports grassroots events and  projects held at reservoir reserves, we supported 4 organisations: Nature Play SA,  RecFish SA, Walking SA and Paddle SA. In a pioneering effort to conserve and study the endangered Murray cod,  we partnered with RecFish SA, along with their partners Pembroke School and  AusOcean, to launch a ‘CodPod’. This is an artificial breeding habitat in Happy Valley  Reservoir to help monitor breeding activity of Murray cod. The project aims to foster natural breeding habitats for this iconic species, crucial  for both recreational fishing and environmental health. Murray cod are being monitored at Happy Valley Reservoir  to learn more about their breeding activity.   ===== PAGE 25 ===== 25 Year in review 25 Our Brand Ambassadors at the Kulilaya  Festival, April 2024. Community education, events and engagement  New artworks can be found on water infrastructure from Minlacowie on Yorke  Peninsula to Loxton in the Riverland and Lochiel Park in Adelaide’s north-east.  Seven new murals were painted on our infrastructure around South Australia in  2023-24, brightening pump stations and tanks for communities and visitors. In this reporting period we also: 	• delivered 144 sessions of The Well education program, which included incursions,  tours, workshops, and a program created specifically for students in the APY Lands 	• delivered community presentations and site tours for 793 South Australians to  increase their knowledge of the work we do to deliver safe, clean drinking water  across the state 	• booked 229 events for our Quench Benches and fountains, including 16 Aboriginal  and Torres Strait Islander community events across the Riverland, Port Lincoln and  Yorke Peninsula 	• sent brand ambassadors to attend community events including the VAILO  Adelaide 500, the National Pharmacies Christmas Pageant and WOMADelaide,  where BYOB bottles were provided for a $5 donation to the event charity partners. More than 35,000 people learnt about and engaged in a range of projects  underway across the state through our Water Talks website including the:  	• Tea Tree Gully Sustainable Sewers project  	• Eyre Peninsula Desalination Project  	• Tailem Bend to Keith pipeline valve upgrades 	• Myponga Dam safety upgrade. Using a school and community  approach to promote water literacy in  remote communities, we partnered with  Atria Group to develop and deliver a  unique education program to 6 schools.  In this program, we worked with school  communities to discover, record, and  share the local water stories. This  included sessions at Amata School,  Pipalyatjara School, Murputja School,  Pukatja/Ernabella School, Indulkana  School, and Yunyarinyi/Kenmore Park  School. The program is based on a two-way  learning philosophy that embraces both  traditional Anangu knowledge and the  modern science and technology behind  water sources and treatment, bringing  them together to encourage new  generations of water advocates.

We  make decisions that  reduce waste and  grow opportunities to  reuse resources and  by-products of our  production processes  to create environmental  benefits. Keeping sewers healthy The number of wastewater network blockages caused by ‘unflushables’ such as  sanitary waste has been increasing, and so we delivered geographically targeted  advertising in May and June 2024 that focused on suburbs with a high rate of  blockages. The focus was on what people can’t flush and rinse, such as non- flushable wet wipes and tissues, to encourage behaviour change. Messages were  shared through digital channels (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Mamamia  podcasts) and on the back of toilet doors in shopping centres in the targeted areas.  The campaign will be evaluated to inform future activity. Tonnes of biosolids More than 83,000 tonnes of biosolids, sourced from our sewage treatment facilities,  were supplied as soil conditioners across 13,000 hectares of broadacre cropping land  in South Australia. Providing biosolids to the agriculture sector promotes sustainable  farming practices and reduces agricultural input costs, benefiting both farmers and  the environment. Protecting native birds across South Australia We implemented 2 significant initiatives to help conserve native bird species  across South Australia in 2023-24, and these initiatives showcase how we support  biodiversity preservation. Our River Murray operation team and contractors participated in an innovative  trial to monitor fairy tern breeding at the Murray Mouth site. Maritime Constructions,  our partners for dredging work, collaborated with BirdLife Australia to undertake a  breeding monitoring program for endangered birds including fairy terns, little terns,  and hooded plovers. Despite challenges posed by storms and significant rainfall, the breeding season  yielded a successful outcome with 14 fairy tern chicks and 13 fledglings recorded.  This is a testament to the effectiveness of our monitoring program. Expanding owl habitats on Kangaroo Island In this reporting period, we expanded our network of nest boxes to provide refuge for  native owls at the Middle River Reservoir Reserve on Kangaroo Island. This initiative  is part of a broader program to enhance the habitat for barn owls and boobook  owls. These owls contribute to the local ecosystem’s balance by controlling rodent  populations that attract feral cats.  ===== PAGE 27 ===== 27 Year in review 27 One of the newest owl nest boxes provided for native owls. Our targeted campaign provided messages  about what not to flush and rinse. Restoring our environment  Our ecosystem restoration project highlights our efforts to conserve biodiversity  at Hope Valley Reservoir Reserve. In 2023-24, we began to restore 3 hectares of  South Australian blue gum grassy woodland, and we have introduced more than  30 species of trees, shrubs and native grasses. This significantly improves the  biodiversity value and natural amenity of the area. The collaboration between our  rangers and Reservoirs SA volunteers to deliver this work has supported improved  habitat for woodland birds such as the white-winged chough (rated rare in South  Australia) that has already been observed using the site. A restoration initiative began in December 2023 at Myponga Reservoir Reserve  to recreate 7 hectares of habitat for the nationally endangered southern brown  bandicoot. Once the vegetation becomes established, it will double the extent of  suitable habitat available for the existing population of bandicoots and support  other threatened species such as heath goanna, yellow-footed Antechinus and  western pygmy possums. In March 2024, we established seed production areas across 3 sites in the Mount  Lofty Ranges to ensure there is enough seed supply to support future restoration  and revegetation programs. These 'seed farms' are cultivating more than 80 species  of understory plants (native grasses, herbs, and sedges) so we can re-introduce  them back into reservoir reserves and support biodiversity, conservation priorities  and improve the ecological function of our restoration efforts. Many of these species  have conservation significance such as the pale everlasting (endangered in South  Australia) and swamp wallaby-grass (rare in South Australia).  ===== PAGE 28 ===== 28 28 Our people  for the future We proactively grow  a diverse and inclusive  business with people  who reflect the  community we serve.  This brings creative  thinking and diversity  of thought to build  innovation, embracing  technology to help  us be safer and more  efficient. Our people  work safely and are part  of a high performing  culture where learning  and collaboration  deliver great customer  outcomes. Improving health, safety and wellbeing  This year we made significant progress in the delivery of our Health and Safety  Improvement Plan objectives. The 3-year program, which will finish in December  2024, aligns the Health and Safety Management System across our business  with international work health and safety standards.  Programs of work delivered in 2023-24 included: 	• occupational hygiene testing based on business-specific occupational hygiene  hazards and potential exposures 	• reviewing and updating our standards and procedures to support improved  contractor health and safety management 	• updating emergency management plans and risk management programs  and plans 	• adding new and updated operational risk management tools, including Safe  Work Method Statements and Job Hazard Analysis, Plant and Equipment Risk  Assessments, and associated health and safety leadership risk management  activities 	• delivering a critical risk program with 15 critical risks identified. In the reporting period, our high potential incident frequency rate result of 3.0  was significantly better than our target of 6.7.  Our end-of-year total recordable injury frequency rate result of 6.0 was slightly  above our target of 5.5. The lost time injury frequency rate of 3.0 was also above  our target of 2.0. Diversity, equity and inclusion  In 2023-24 our new Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Strategic Plan came into  effect. This will guide delivery on our 2030 goal: enabling diversity and inclusion as  a part of everything we do. To oversee implementation of the plan, we formed the  Diversity Equity and Inclusion Council with representation from across the business.  Other activity delivered in 2023-24 included: 	• improving accessibility by providing translations to key parts of our customer  bills on our website and to stakeholder organisations  	• initiating a workforce review to improve Aboriginal workforce representation 	• sponsoring the Women in STEM Career’s program run by the University of Adelaide 	• promoting and celebrating diverse experiences through our employee networks  groups Together for Women, Pride Together, Kauwi Miyurna and Able Together  	• continuing cultural awareness training 	• partnering with the Clontarf Foundation which supports young Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander men to participate in education, employment and society  in a positive way. We achieved: 	• 46.84 per cent of leadership positions held by women (DEI target: 50 per cent) 	• 1.85 per cent Aboriginal employment (DEI target: 3 per cent). In August 2023, we released a report on barriers to women working in STEM. In  response to this report, we have created a Women in STEM Action Plan to address  some of the barriers. This is being delivered through the Capital Delivery Strategic  KPI Program.   ===== PAGE 29 ===== 29 Year in review 29 Disability access and inclusion  At the end of 2023 we closed off our Disability Access and Inclusion Plan (DAIP)  with 32 out of 39 actions complete.  We delivered on actions that included training our customer care centre teams to  recognise and respond to customers experiencing vulnerability and developing a  Priority Services Register enabling us to identify customers living with disability, while  protecting their privacy.  We also created easy-read documents for our customer communications and  reviewed and improved accessibility to information of publicly accessible sites.  Other actions, including building partnerships with education providers to identify  opportunities to students and offering disability awareness training to leaders, will  be revisited in the new DAIP. Highlights included: 	• piloting a new accessible worksite checklist with our Customer Experience team  and Major Framework Partners (MFPs)  	• working with our MFPs to review the accessibility of our construction sites 	• disability and inclusion training for our MFPs to help their teams better understand  the needs of people living with disability. In June 2024 we became a signatory of the Autism Inclusion Charter, an initiative  of the South Australian government that demonstrates the ongoing commitment  of government agencies to improve outcomes for autistic and other neurodiverse  people.  The opportunity to join the state government’s Neurodivergent Public Sector  Employee Network was made available to our people, as was online autism  awareness training, and we began working on developing our next disability  access and inclusion plan.  Performance management  Our annual performance appraisal and  development cycle is aligned to the  financial year and includes setting goals,  supporting our people’s development  and having performance discussions.  In 2023-24, 99 per cent of our people  completed their annual performance  reviews.

SA Water continues to comply  with the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water  Act 2011 including water quality monitoring,  the notification of incidents, and successfully  completed an independent audit against criteria  in the Act during March and April 2024.  Monitoring of drinking water supplies was in accordance with SA Health approved  monitoring programs. During 2023-24, SA Water collected 46,505 samples from  drinking water supplies throughout the state. Samples were analysed for compliance  with the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines (2011) (ADWG) and results reported  to SA Health in line with agreed reporting protocols. Compliance with the ADWG  for E. coli was achieved in 100.00 per cent of metropolitan Adelaide samples and  99.93 per cent of regional samples. Overall compliance with the ADWG for health- related parameters was 99.99 per cent for metropolitan systems and 99.92 per cent  for regional areas.  There was a decrease in the number of detections of E. coli in drinking water  samples in 2023-24. Detections were low-level and in isolated samples, with follow- up samples clear of E. coli. Overall compliance of E. coli monitoring remained high.  Incidents were notified and managed under the interagency Water/Wastewater  Incident Notification and Communication Protocol and reported in a timely manner.  Appropriate remedial actions and responses were implemented following incidents  to ensure the protection of public health was maintained at all times.  The total number of incidents notified by SA Water during 2023-24 (179) was the  same as 2022-23. One Priority Type 1 incident raised during 2023-24 due to the  detection of high concentrations (>100,000 cells/ml) of an atypical cyanobacterium  Microcystis aeruginosa in the River Murray. The incident was later downgraded  following confirmation that it was non-toxic. The algal bloom was closely monitored  during its duration to ensure that the water treatment plants were operating  effectively for the removal of cyanobacterial cells and taste and odour compounds.  There was an increase in the detection of elevated cyanobacteria concentrations in  drinking water reservoirs but these were managed appropriately to prevent risks to  drinking water quality.  The detection of enteric protozoa  (Cryptosporidium and Giardia) in  drinking water catchments and source  waters was reduced in 2023-24 possibly  influenced by lower rainfall in the first  6 months of 2024. There were 3 Type 1  incidents involving detection of enteric  protozoa including one in treated  product water (Cryptosporidium) and 2  at the inlets to drinking water treatment  plants. The Cryptosporidium detected  in the treated water sample was not  human infectious. Protozoa were not  detected in follow up samples. No faults  were detected from the continuous  monitoring of treatment plant  performance during the periods when  the protozoa were detected. Installation  of ceramic membranes for the treatment  of wastewash water at the Anstey Hill  Treatment Plant provided additional  protection for drinking water quality. The number of incidents (3) for  drinking water reservoirs open to  recreational activities has decreased  since 2022-23 (9). These incidents  were managed effectively and did  not have a measurable impact on  drinking water quality. The detection  of high concentrations of toxic  cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis  raciborskii in Lake Alexandrina led  to advice being issued to the public  not to use Lake Alexandrina for body  contact recreational activities. While  Lake Alexandrina is not a drinking  water source it is used for recreational  purposes and continues to be closely  monitored.   ===== PAGE 31 =====  ===== PAGE 32 ===== 32 32 Safe drinking water legislation  The Safe Drinking Water Act 2011 (the Act) and Safe Drinking Water Regulations  2012 provide the regulatory framework for drinking water providers in South Australia  and are administered primarily by SA Health.  Provisions in the Act are underpinned by the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines  (ADWG) and prescribe requirements for drinking water providers, including:  	• registration of drinking water providers with SA Health  	• development and implementation of risk management plans  	• establishment of approved drinking water quality monitoring programs  	• notification of incidents or non-compliance  	• audits and inspections to determine compliance with the Act  	• use of National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) accredited laboratories  for sample testing  	• reporting of water quality test results to SA Health and providing consumers  with drinking water quality information.  As a registered drinking water provider, we have established risk management plans,  including approved monitoring programs and an incident notification protocol. We  provide water quality testing reports for metropolitan and regional water supplies  on a monthly basis.  An independent audit was undertaken in March and April of 2024, as required by  the Act. The 9-day audit examined a selection of representative drinking water  supplies. It encompassed both desktop assessments and on-site visits, which included  travelling to South Australia’s largest water treatment plant at Happy Valley, ground  water supplies in the South East and some of our Riverland water supplies.  The audit recognised that we comply with the requirements of the Act, and that the  drinking water in the schemes audited is managed in accordance with the intent of  the ADWG. Highlights identified by the auditor included:  	• a drinking water management system that is comprehensive and implemented 	• proactive management of drinking water quality that is a core aspect of how we  operate this has been further enhanced in the past year by adoption of  a specific drinking water quality policy that outlines how we achieve this aim 	• close integration of our partner organisations (Production & Treatment Alliance,  Service Stream and TRILITY) 	• a new tank inspection procedure and related training program that has been  implemented to ensure that tanks are regularly inspected. While the audit demonstrated a very high level of compliance, 3 non-conformances  and a number of improvement actions were identified, as is expected with a detailed  assessment. As in previous years, these items will be evaluated and corrective actions  will be implemented. Catchment to tap  We manage drinking water quality  from catchment to tap in line with our  Drinking Water Quality Management  System to ensure a consistent and  reliable supply of high quality, safe  drinking water for our customers. This  management system is based on the  Framework for Management of Drinking  Water Quality outlined in the ADWG  and endorsed by the National Health  and Medical Research Council. The  framework outlines good drinking water  supply management, based on the best  available scientific evidence that will  assure drinking water quality and safety  at the tap.   ===== PAGE 33 ===== 33 Water quality 33 Water quality monitoring and testing We operate 87 drinking water supplies that serve customers across metropolitan and  regional South Australia. This includes 2 new drinking water supplies commissioned  this financial year at Oodnadatta and Marla. Both sites feature newly constructed  desalination plants that use reverse osmosis technology to treat and remove salt  and other impurities that are naturally present in the groundwater. We implement SA Health-approved drinking water quality monitoring programs   to ensure the quality of our supply. These programs involve collecting around  409,000 results from samples at various stages of the water supply system, including  catchment areas, source water, treatment processes, and distribution networks up to  the water meter on individual properties. We monitor for health and aesthetic compliance and to optimise water quality.  Samples are collected by trained field workers to make sure they are taken correctly  and that field results have a high degree of integrity. Our Australian Water Quality  Centre conducts laboratory analyses in compliance with ISO 9001 Quality Systems  and NATA requirements. In 2023-24 we were proud to celebrate 50 years  of continuous accreditation to the NATA 17025 Standard.

Direct exceedances of the ADWG were used rather than the 95th percentiles for compliance of individual chemical parameters.  Before calculating per cent compliance for health-related chemicals, individual results are rounded to the same number of significant  figures as the guideline value in the ADWG (as prescribed in the ADWG and agreed with SA Health). We analysed 46,505 test analytes from our drinking water supplies (customer  tap sample locations) throughout South Australia to determine health-related  compliance. We achieved 99.95 per cent E. coli compliance across customer tap  sample locations with detections in 5 regional systems. These E. coli detections all  occurred in the presence of chlorine or chloramine residuals at levels sufficient to  mitigate risk. Plant operation and residuals from various locations around the time  of the detections were reviewed and all were within specifications. Follow-up samples  showed consistent residuals, with no E. coli detected.  ===== PAGE 34 ===== 34 34 Compliance with ADWG health-related  parameters across customer tap sample  locations was above target at 99.94 per  cent. While we strive for 100 per cent  compliance at all times, the ADWG  acknowledges that occasional  exceedances may occur and for  most characteristics these occasional  excursions beyond the guideline value  are not necessarily an immediate  threat to health. In accordance with the  guidelines and the interagency Water/ Wastewater Incident Notification and  Communication Protocol, all detections  were immediately communicated to SA  Health, investigated by us and corrective  actions implemented as agreed with SA  Health. SA Health confirmed that the  drinking water we provide to customers  is safe and that our responses effectively  mitigated any risks to public health. Incident management We apply the ADWG Framework for Management of Drinking Water Quality which  includes 2 components for the management of incidents: 1.	 communication 2.	 incident and emergency response protocols.  Our Water Quality Incident and Emergency Management Protocol is in place and we  have a web-based incident management system to record and generate notifications  of water quality incidents. These are aligned to the interagency Water/Wastewater  Incident Notification and Communication Protocol that is maintained by SA Health  to adopt the principles of the ADWG and satisfy requirements of the Act and Safe  Drinking Water Regulations 2012.  SA Health defines 3 types of health-related incident classifications based on a  precautionary approach: 1. Priority Type 1 incident notification An incident that, without immediate appropriate response or intervention,  could cause serious risk to human health and is likely to require immediate  interagency meetings to consider responses. Procedures for Type 1 incident  notifications also apply. 2. Type 1 incident notification  An incident that, without appropriate response or intervention, could cause serious  risk to human health.  3. Type 2 incident notifications An incident that, without appropriate response or intervention, represents a low risk  to human health. Number of incidents in statewide drinking water supplies (metropolitan and regional) Reporting period Priority Type 1 Type 1 Type 2 2023-24 0 50 129 2022-23 2 48 129 2021-22 0 50 86 2020-21 1 45 57 2019-20 1 36 63 Note: these notifications do not include wastewater, recycled water and non-drinking supplies. Priority Type 1 and Type 1 incidents are immediately reported to SA Health, while  all Type 2 notifications are reportable within 24 hours, in line with the interagency  Water/Wastewater Incident Notification and Communication Protocol.  In the 2023-24 period, no Priority Type 1 incidents were reported. But the total number  of reportable incidents remained consistent with the previous financial year. The introduction of chlorate Type 1 incident criteria in June 2023 and subsequent  SA Health approved extra monitoring locations led to an increase in Type 1  disinfection by-product notifications. Whilst chlorate is not a health parameter  currently in the ADWG, SA Health have indicated that it may be incorporated in  future editions.   ===== PAGE 35 ===== 35 Water quality 35 In 2023-24, we continued to address  the causes of preventable Type 1  notifications. Strategies used to achieve  this include ongoing operational  and capital improvements, incident  management training, optimisation of  our drinking water quality monitoring  program and continuous improvement  of our Drinking Water Quality  Management System.  The proactive water quality  management of our water supply  systems and the detection and  management of risks continued during  2023-24. Changes in reporting criteria  issued by SA Health in the interagency  Water/Wastewater Incident Notification  and Communication Protocol also  occurred and contributed to a change in  reporting requirements. Incident Response Index The Incident Response Index (IRI) drives and guides correct responses when a Priority  Type 1 or Type 1 incident is detected. The IRI is assessed against a number of criteria,  with each component in the IRI designed to help manage water quality incidents.  Criteria used in the IRI based on total reportable SA Health Priority Type 1 and Type 1  incident notifications are:  	• incident reported to relevant agencies by phone immediately (less than one hour)  	• incident entered into the incident management system in less than 2 hours  	• initial effective response taken within 3 hours  	• written report to the Minister for Housing Infrastructure by 3pm the next  business day  	• root cause analysis completed within 10 working days  	• preventive actions implemented within agreed timeframes. The overall 2023-24  strategic target for the IRI is 85 per cent compliance.

Across these 2 teams, we continue to proactively identify improvements  to the feedback management processes across our business.  All forms of organisational feedback, including complaints, are valued and help  us to build customer trust and confidence as well as improve our performance in  delivering excellent customer experiences. In 2023-24, we received a total of 3,198 complaints. This equated to 3.94 complaints  per 1,000 customers, which is higher than the 3.55 complaints per 1,000 customers  received in 2022-23. This increase was driven by our continued commitment to  improving complaint recognition and capture, including broader training for our  people in complaint management. The increase continues to be viewed as a positive  indication of our improvement and has not been identified as a specific trend or  operational issue at this time.  The most common complaint types received in 2023-24 related to:  1.	 water quality 2.	 operations and maintenance in the metropolitan Adelaide area 3.	 meter reading and estimates.  Of the customer complaints received, 41.39 per cent were resolved at the first point  of customer contact, which is an increase from 36 per cent in 2022-23. We responded  to 97.43 per cent of complaints within target times, with 7.74 per cent of complaints  escalated to the industry ombudsman.  A total of 281 complaints on a range of issues were escalated to the Energy and  Water Ombudsman of South Australia (EWOSA) for review in 2023-24. This was an  increase from 184 complaints in 2022-23. The highest complaint type escalated to  EWOSA remains, costs incurred for high water use, which has remained a consistent  trend over the past 3 years.  Through our complaint management process, the customer advocate team  completes root cause analyses, post complaint reviews and case studies for  complaints throughout the year. Case studies include a full account of the complaint  details, a summary of the case investigation, the outcomes, and any applicable  process improvement recommendations. We continue to review our processes, strive for best practice guidelines and improve  our recognition and capture of customer complaints at first contact. This work is  designed to collect insights for our business and improve our overall customer  experience.  Supporting customers In 2023-24, 1,367 new customers joined  our Payment Assistance Program. The  program helps residential customers  with support to help pay their bills. At  30 June 2024, 2,732 residential customers  had participated in a financial hardship  program with a $2,590 average bill  balance. The program connects  customers with support to help them  better manage their bills, and in  2023-24, 834 residential customers  successfully exited the program.  Recognising the financial constraints  that many people are experiencing,  we proactively promoted the Payment  Assistance Program, targeting people  who were experiencing, or at risk of  experiencing, financial hardship. We  saw a positive impact with increased  inquiries about support available, both  through payment extensions and the  Payment Assistance Program.   ===== PAGE 47 ===== 47 Supplementary reporting items 47 Ministerial directions  ===== PAGE 48 ===== 48 48  ===== PAGE 49 ===== 49 Supplementary reporting items 49 DIRECTION TO THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN WATER CORPORATION  PURSUANT TO SECTION 6 OF THE PUBLIC CORPORATIONS ACT 1993  BACKGROUND  1.

SA Water has been able to navigate these challenges and perform to expectation.  It has met important service standards and delivered a financial dividend to  government. However, more serious challenges lie ahead. The troubled water sector in the  United Kingdom provides a warning we need to heed. Water utilities in the  UK were privatised in the hope that they would deliver better value for money.  However, there has been widespread public dissatisfaction as the industry has  performed poorly. Wastewater has leaked and overflowed causing significant  public nuisance and environmental degradation. Analysts have attributed this  to a serious lack of investment in repairing and replacing aging infrastructure,  and in technology to meet contemporary standards.  The UK regulatory regime also comes in for sober criticism in that it has allowed debt  levels to rise appreciably, failed to invest in infrastructure to keep pace with demand,  and yet at the same time, paid significant dividends to owners.  The lesson for South Australia from the UK experience is to take notice of where  under-investment leads. We need to ensure our infrastructure is fit for purpose  and maintained in serviceable condition. If it isn’t then we will suffer a similar  fate to the UK. SA Water is in public ownership. We have an independent regulator that determines  whether its business plans are prudent and efficient, the amount of revenue the  business can earn and hence spend, and the service standards SA Water is required  to meet. This model can serve us well. The challenge for the SA government is,  however, more complex. It is mindful of the impact of water bills on customers when  the cost-of-living is rising steeply, the level of state debt incurred when money is  borrowed to fund capital works, and competing demands for other public services. The Board of SA Water is responsible for the good governance of the Corporation,  and it has a critical role to put the case to government for sound investment and  expenditure to run the SA Water business. As the next period of regulation begins  in 2024, the Board and government will strive to find the right balance.  To conclude, I acknowledge the contribution of all Board directors, and John Bastian,  in particular, as his term concluded in August 2022. I thank David Ryan, our Chief  Executive, and his outstanding executive team for their dedication and leadership  of the Corporation. Finally, to the staff and partners of SA Water, thank you for  your dedication and service to all South Australians. Allan Holmes Chair of the Board SA Water has continued  to do what it is meant  to do – provide  essential water and  wastewater services  to South Australian  communities.  The 2022-2023 year has been an  especially challenging year. Costs of  doing business have risen sharply. Our  energy costs, like those of households,  have skyrocketed, and inflationary  pressures have bitten. In addition, the  cost of building new infrastructure and  repairing old, has increased well beyond  the Consumer Price Index. Materials are  in short supply and there is a labour  shortage. Contents  ===== PAGE 4 ===== A message from the Chief Executive 4 5 Water quality monitoring was crucial to managing flood impacts on our many  customers who rely on the river as the source of their drinking water. Additional  sampling, testing and analysis services provided assurance throughout the flood.  We contributed to the wider state response through the State Emergency Centre  and as lead for the state government’s Engineering Functional Support Group.  Throughout the flood event, we took care of our people by managing the new  and evolving health and safety risks the flood presented. Health and safety leadership training delivered this year was a success, supporting  our leaders and developing their safety mindset, and helping keep our people safe  and well at work. Throughout all this, our financial performance remained strong with a $237.1 million  contribution to the government to further support our state’s economy. As 2022-23 came to an end, we had our sights on the future as we prepared for our  next regulatory period, 2024-28. Our Regulatory Business Plan was submitted to our  economic regulator, the Essential Services Commission of South Australia, in August.  Incorporating robust customer research and engagement, our plan outlines our  proposed areas for investment in the 2024-28 regulatory period. Work also progressed with partners and stakeholders on developing a strategy  to ensure a resilient water future for Greater Adelaide, ensuring water security over  the coming 50 years. Demand for water will increase while our drying climate will  reduce available sources and we are working now to ensure Greater Adelaide will  be resilient in the face of future uncertainty and extreme weather. I thank our people for the incredible work they’ve delivered this year, and their  dedication to our customers and community. Their tireless efforts have delivered  outstanding outcomes, many of which are detailed in this report. Thanks also goes to Allan Holmes and our Board Directors who continue to support  and guide our organisation to deliver trusted water services for a healthy and  sustainable South Australia. David Ryan Chief Executive A message from  the Chief Executive  The past year has presented significant challenges  for our business and I’ve seen our people respond  with great focus and purpose in order to deliver  for our customers and community. In a changing economic environment, with cost of living pressures affecting  our community and our business, I’m enormously proud of how our people have  continued to ensure essential water services for South Australians. This has been  achieved while responding to the major flooding event along the River Murray. We have performed strongly against our customer service standards which track  how we’re meeting our customers’ expectations. In particular, it has been pleasing  to see customer satisfaction at 96 per cent against our target of 93 per cent, and  first contact resolution at 100 per cent, well above our target of 85 per cent. These  achievements reflect the excellence our people show in their work every day. Our capital delivery performance has been strong, with significant progress made on  critical projects including work on the new seawater desalination plant at Penneshaw  on Kangaroo Island. Construction on the plant’s structure is complete and work on  pipelines well underway. Our Board reaffirmed its commitment to Billy Lights Point  as the preferred location for a desalination plant to ensure water security for the  Eyre Peninsula. Our teams continue to work closely with the local communities on  Kangaroo Island and the Eyre Peninsula to deliver these important projects. Water quality in remote communities has been improved with a reverse osmosis  desalination plant delivered for Kaltjiti in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara  Lands. A small-scale desalination plant has also been delivered for the community  of Oodnadatta. In addition to maintaining and improving our day-to-day operations and managing  a changing external environment, our response to the River Murray flood event  was outstanding. This once-in-a-generation flooding event was the largest seen in the river since 1956.  Our people rose to the challenge to keep our customers and communities safe;  protect our water and wastewater assets to prevent or reduce damage; and maintain  the highest levels of service possible for the largest number of customers possible. Our coordinated and planned approach to the flood event saw more than 100,000  customers protected from service impacts. Significant community engagement was  undertaken, particularly in Mannum, to support customers who were proactively  disconnected from the sewer network to protect the town’s wider network from flood  inundation. With engagement coordinated seamlessly with our operational response,  we maintained positive relationships with the community through this difficult time.  ===== PAGE 5 ===== About SA Water  ===== PAGE 6 ===== About SA Water 8 9 Our water supply areas Our vision Delivering trusted water services for a  sustainable and healthy South Australia.

As one of the most efficient water utilities in Australia, we are continually improving  the way we do this for our customers, to keep prices as low and stable as possible  over time. To deliver value for money, we strive to make smart, long-term investments,  and the best use of new technologies. We remain focused on what is important to  our customers and meeting our legal and regulatory responsibilities. Of Australia’s water utilities, we are the custodians of the longest water mains  supply network at more than 27,000 kilometres. In addition, we manage more than  9,000 kilometres of sewerage mains and a 448 kilometre recycled water network. We manage drinking water quality from catchment to tap, working cooperatively  with SA Health to ensure the continued protection of public health and supply of  high quality, safe drinking water for our customers across the state. Overview of our network and assets  ===== PAGE 8 ===== Year in review 13 Highlights 228+ billion  litres of water  delivered to  737,721 homes  and businesses 96%  customer satisfaction $562.4 million  capital investment 64.9 kilometres  of new water  mains installed 70,678  water samples  collected  Lowest number  of water main  breaks since 2014 417,959  visitors to  reservoir reserves 300,000+  customers  receiving eBills 24 hectares  of native bushland  restored at Millbrook  Reservoir Reserve Year in review  ===== PAGE 9 ===== Year in review 14 15 Innovation We used innovative approaches to tackle major issues like protecting our assets,  ensuring service continuity, and maintaining drinking water quality. During the River Murray response we: 	• protected a crucial Murray Bridge wastewater disposal pipeline from very strong  river flows by using a barge, supported by divers, to lower concrete mattresses  across it. 	• protected high-voltage cables using rubber wrap and floating debris booms  and additional parallel pumping systems to make sure the Murray Bridge to  Onkaparinga pipeline could keep operating. 	• monitored source water quality by intensive river sampling and drone surveys,  gathering intelligence from up-river interstate utilities, optimising treatment plants,  strategically switching water storages, and introducing additional chlorination  plants into our networks to maintain high levels of drinking water quality across  South Australia. 	• participated in the first-ever Australian deployment of DefenCell, a new technology  using lightweight geotextile cells that facilitate rapid roll-out. This was delivered in  partnership with the State Emergency Service, which sourced the material for use  in several locations as part of the broader government flood response.  Lessons learnt During the recovery phase we completed a thorough review to identify lessons  that will help us prepare for future events. The flood has highlighted the great value of capable and committed people,  a strong customer focus, a culture of trust and empowerment, business-wide  cooperation, collaboration and teamwork, clear priorities and objectives. It has  also underlined the importance of robust assets and resilient services, effective  customer and stakeholder engagement, and integrated systems that support  effective decision-making. Lessons learnt have identified actions including updates to our business continuity  planning, fatigue management systems, asset design standards and incident  management practices. In addition, Engineering Functional Support Group has  received a Commonwealth grant to lead a statewide technical review of flood  defence measures including DefenCell, levees and sandbagging. Support for the state  government response Throughout the flood we worked closely  with other government agencies and  emergency service organisations. Gerard and Narrung, 2 Aboriginal  communities directly impacted by the  floods, were supported. We liaised  directly with community leaders, local  government, and state government  agencies to assess infrastructure risks  against river level projections and ensure  alternatives were available if the flood  disrupted drinking water and wastewater  systems. In collaboration with the State  Emergency Service and private  water carters, we supported supply  of emergency drinking water to  vulnerable households that usually  relied on private supplies. Through the Engineering Functional  Support Group, we contributed to  the State Emergency Centre, Zone  Emergency Support Team and Incident  Management Team, coordinating  engineering advice and providing  practical assistance in preparing levee  specifications, monitoring levees and  responding to levee failures. We also  provided clay for emergency levees  constructed by local governments along  the river, and donated surplus sandbags  to protect large private levees in the  lower River Murray. Special sampling, testing and analysis  services were provided by our team  to support decision-making in the  Riverland, the lower lakes, and  southern beaches, as well as for  SA Health. We also provided boating  support for electricity utilities to move  around the flooded landscape. Incident response approach Our flood response was led by a coordinated business-wide Incident Management  Team, with 3 clear objectives: 1.	 Keep our people, customers and communities safe. 2.	 Protect our water and wastewater assets to prevent or mitigate damage. 3.	 Maintain the highest levels of service possible, for the largest number  of customers possible. A coordinated and planned approach to the event saw services maintained for  more than 100,000 customers in the river zone, and more than 45 different systems  and major assets assessed for risk and protected. Community engagement and support Comprehensive engagement was undertaken with communities along the river. This  included direct communication with affected customers, proactively preparing them  for disruptions to their water and wastewater services, as well as involvement in  government community information sessions. Customer engagement was a particular focus in Mannum. A risk assessment  identified the potential for flooding to impact the low-lying areas of Mannum’s  wastewater network. Our Field Services team proactively disconnected 127 sewerage customers to  protect individual residences and businesses and ensure the town’s sewerage  network continued to operate.  The Engagement team contacted every impacted customer directly through door  knocking, phone calls and letters, and worked with them to understand their plans  and provide practical support, mindful that some properties were occupied by  residents, and some were holiday houses. Alternative services, including drinking water, temporary showers and portaloos,  were provided at our Mannum depot for customers who remained in their homes.  Bill support was provided to customers who were proactively disconnected from the  Mannum wastewater network. Their sewerage charge was waived for the billing  quarter in which their service was temporarily disconnected (October to December  2022). Their full bill – water and wastewater – was waived for the following quarter  (January to March 2023) in recognition of flood impacts. River Murray  flood response In October 2022, with  heavy rain falling in the  Murray-Darling Basin  catchment and flooding  in New South Wales  and Victoria, we began  preparing for a high  flow event. An event  on this scale hadn’t  occurred since 1956. The River Murray flood was declared a  major emergency on 21 November 2022.  In addition to keeping our people safe,  protecting our assets and maintaining  essential water and wastewater services  for our customers, we contributed to the  statewide government response. There was strong support from  our major framework partners, key  contractors, lead suppliers, other  government agencies, local governments  and local landholders throughout the  event.  ===== PAGE 10 ===== Year in review 16 17 Main break numbers down Across our network, we recorded the lowest number of water main leaks and  breaks since 2014. This is due to a wetter than average end to 2022 and continued  investment in maintaining our water network. In 2022-23, 3,486 water main leaks and breaks were reported across our  27,000 kilometre network, compared with 3,627 in 2021-22. Meeting our customer service standards Performance measures and service standards set by our economic regulator,  the Essential Services Commission of South Australia, guide how we measure  our success in delivering what our customers and the community expect. In 2022-23, we achieved 96 per cent customer satisfaction against a target of  93 per cent. Of the 225,101 phone calls we received during the year, 86 per cent  were answered by our Customer Care Centre, based in SA Water House, within  our target timeframe of 50 seconds, ahead of our 85 per cent target. Other notable achievements include: Measure Target Achieved First contact resolution 85% 100% Water quality responsiveness (metropolitan Adelaide) 97% 100% Water quality responsiveness (regional South Australia) 99% 100% Connection application responsiveness 95% 97% Water event responsiveness (high priority) metro 99% 100% Water event responsiveness (high priority) regional 99% 100% Sewer event responsiveness metro 99% 100% Sewer event responsiveness regional 99% 99% We met 21 of the 22 customer service standards. Our response to sewer overflow  clean-ups in metropolitan Adelaide was at 95 per cent, just short of the 98 per cent  target. This was primarily due to customers requesting partial or whole clean-ups at a  different time of day to better suit them, or where work was hampered due to access  or safety issues. Smart maintenance gets a boost Our Smart Maintenance program is introducing technology to provide real-time  monitoring, helping us to proactively maintain our assets and better inform  maintenance decisions. This year, the Diagnostic and Prognostic Maintenance  (DPM) project installed technology at 21 major pump stations. DPM collects real-time machine vibration and temperature data from our pump  sets using advanced digital technology. The data is then analysed using artificial  intelligence to give us critical information via our new smart infrastructure dashboard.  We began using the dashboard in May. It displays: 	• current and historical asset condition  	• forecasted performance that considers asset health condition and operational  requirements 	• tracking details for autogenerated work orders to address faults identified early 	• maintenance history and performance reports 	• increased data analytics to improve maintenance decision-making. When fully implemented this automation will see fewer breakdowns, extend the life of  our assets, ensure greater pump availability, and ultimately lower our operational costs. Water price increase less than the Consumer Price Index As part of our ongoing commitment to keep water and sewerage prices as low  and stable as possible, our Board and the South Australian Government approved  2022-23 price adjustments capped at 3.2 per cent on average – nearly 2 per cent  less than the Consumer Price Index (CPI).  From 1 July 2022 the average metropolitan residential customer’s combined water  and sewerage bill increased annually by $34, compared to $54 if price adjustments  reflected full CPI of 5.1 per cent. Businesses saw an average increase of $130  compared with $208.  In the Bureau of Meteorology’s National Performance Report, which analyses and  compares the performance of water utilities across the country, the ranking of our  annual residential combined water and sewerage bill (based on 200 kilolitres) sits  third cheapest of the 15 comparably-sized utilities across Australia.  Sustaining and expanding our networks  Our continued focus to improve and maintain our water and wastewater pipe  networks saw us invest $91.4 million in our water pipe network and infrastructure,  and $17.4 million in our wastewater pipe network and infrastructure.  In 2022-23 we installed 64.9 kilometres of new water mains, with 19.8 kilometres laid  in metropolitan Adelaide and 45.1 kilometres in country areas of the state, through  our water main management program.  As part of our 4-year, $155 million water main management program, new water  mains were installed throughout the state, including:  	• 6,000 metres in Lyndhurst 	• 5,380 metres in Port Pirie East 	• 4,530 metres in Merghiny  	• 4,120 metres in Reeves Plain 	• 1,260 metres in Wandana  	• 2,000 metres in West Beach  	• 1,118 metres in Sellicks Beach 	• 822 metres in Two Wells  	• 805 metres in Cumberland Park 	• 600 metres in Prospect. We installed 64.9 kilometres of new water mains in 2022-23. Driving customer  outcomes  We provide our  customers with safe,  smart, reliable and  affordable water  services. To achieve  this, we maintain trust,  ensure water quality  and asset reliability, and  provide continuity of  service by preventing or  minimising temporary  service interruptions.  We deploy connected  and intelligent assets to  make smart decisions  and operate efficiently  so our services remain  affordable.  ===== PAGE 11 ===== Year in review 18 19 Walls are up in Green Patch  water tank build Work on our new 32-million-litre  concrete water tank in Green  Patch, near Port Lincoln, reached a  major milestone in 2022-23, with all  112 panels craned into place to form  the 88-metre-wide structure. With the structure now in place,  installation has begun to seal the inside  of the tank so the quality of drinking  water is protected once the tank is filled  and in operation.  Warren Reservoir dam  valve refurbishment Refurbishment work on the intake  and scour valves at Warren Reservoir  began with a 5-week drawdown of the  water level. It was lowered to zero per  cent so that crews could safely access  the base of the dam wall. The project included the safe relocation  of about 4.5 tonnes of the reservoir’s  native fish and turtles to the nearby  South Para Reservoir, including species  like bony bream, Murray cod, golden  perch and silver perch. Port Lincoln Wastewater  Treatment Plant upgraded  In June 2023, work was completed on  the Port Lincoln Wastewater Treatment  Plant as part of our $400,000 investment  to enhance sewage treatment and  the plant’s overall performance for the  ongoing supply of around 100 million  litres of recycled water each year. Floating aerators in one of the plant’s  treatment basins and seals along the  basin were rehabilitated to improve the  efficiency of the biological process that  breaks down nutrients in sewage. Queensbury upgrade to keep sewer odour at bay Work began in October on a $1.6 million upgrade of our wastewater pump station  in Queensbury to improve odour control and support ongoing residential growth. The Queensbury pump station pumps more than 15 million litres of sewage each  day to the Bolivar Wastewater Treatment Plant where it’s treated for reuse and return  to the environment. Upgrade for Whyalla’s Recycled Water Plant An upgrade to our recycled water plant in Whyalla was complete in October 2022.  The project was part of our $200,000 investment to enhance sewage treatment and  the plant’s overall performance.  More than 1,300 diffusers in the plant’s treatment basins were replaced, improving  the efficiency of the biological process that breaks down nutrients in sewage. The basins, capable of holding around 1.3 million litres of sewage, underwent an  extensive clean as part of the upgrade. Whyalla Recycled Water Plant currently supplies around 2.5 million litres of recycled  water a day. It is used by the local council to help irrigate and green Whyalla’s ovals,  parks and golf courses. Basins at the Whyalla Recycled Water Plant underwent an extensive clean. Unflushables are flushed  out of our sewers Communication and media activity from  July to October 2022 about what not  to flush or rinse resulted in a significant  reduction in ‘unflushables’, such as  wet wipes and cooking fats and oils,  entering the state’s sewers. The message to change flushing  and rinsing habits provided practical  tips and the impact continued after  the communication activity finished.  Between August 2022 and February  2023, there was a 40 per cent reduction  in sewer blockages caused by items that  should not be flushed or rinsed. The overall rate of sewer blockages  dropped to a 2-year low helping reduce  the number of overflows inside customer  properties. This was supported by a targeted  sewer cleaning program with proactive  maintenance to help reduce blockages  and overflows in hotspot suburbs such  as Athelstone, Blackwood and Rostrevor. Sustainable sewers  for Tea Tree Gully  On 1 July 2022 we welcomed all  residents connected to the Tea  Tree Gully Community Wastewater  Management System as our customers,  with management and operation of the  system transferring to us from the City  of Tea Tree Gully Council, and sewerage  fees and charges coming into effect for  all 4,700 properties. In August 2022, we completed  construction at our pilot sites on  Glenere Drive, Dawson Drive, Angas  Court and North East Road in Modbury,  and connected more than 60  households and businesses to our  network. Construction continued for  stage one of the program which will  connect approximately 500 properties  in Modbury North, St Agnes and  Banksia Park. More than 60 households and businesses were connected  to our wastewater network in Tea Tree Gully. The Green Patch tank’s 112 concrete panels were craned into place. Our Healthy Sewers campaign drove positive behaviour changes in the community.  ===== PAGE 12 ===== Year in review 20 21 Smart metered hydrant trial In 2022-23, we began a trial of smart metered hydrants throughout the state.  Fitted with GPS technology, the hydrants: 	• are easy to locate if missing  	• are geofence-enabled to provide greater clarity about meters or fireplugs that  are unavailable for customers due to maintenance work  	• can provide alerts and information when fireplugs have been used incorrectly 	• can determine how much water has been extracted from a main which can  help us respond to water quality complaints in a specific area. An online customer portal is now available through our website for individual  customers to monitor their metered hydrant water use. Improving digital services Digital services available for our customers and our people continue to be  improved and automated to provide better customer interactions and enable  better self-service.  Our projects have:  	• helped customers to select and manage their preferred communication channels  	• allowed eBill customers to be notified earlier if their water use is higher through a  high water use notice. This also enables a more efficient turnaround time for leak  detection 	• helped reservoir reserve visitors to easily purchase permits, and reservoir rangers  to quickly verify them, through a new online fishing permits system 	• improved security by introducing multi-factor authentication for payment refunds  in mySAWater  	• helped our team better use and manage over 14,000 assets through a new digital  media asset tool  	• reduced manual workload and saved time (96%) by automating direct debit  dishonours  	• consolidated ‘Supply by measure’ customer accounts to accurately and consistently  calculate bills aligned to customers with the same land use 	• helped our customers to better learn about and track connection requests for  drinking water, recycled water, sewerage, and water for fire services with a self  service digital offering.  In May, we reached 300,000 customers registered to receive eBills. Research builds capability Undertaking research helps us meet the changing needs of our business, builds the  knowledge and capability of our people, and ensures we are prepared for challenges  in the future. In 2022-23, key research focused on:  	• identifying options to control the unwanted growth of aquatic plants in the pumps  supplying the Virginia Pipeline Scheme that cause on-going challenges for our  customers and damage to our infrastructure 	• developing a more efficient DNA-based tool for identifying the sources of faecal  contamination in our source waters. This research enables us to better identify  hazards in our source waters and take appropriate steps to manage catchments  or treatment processes.  Services for Cape Jaffa  Marina customers In October 2022, following a formal  direction from the Minister for Climate,  Environment and Water, we entered  into an agreement with the Cape Jaffa  Anchorage Essential Services to operate  and maintain the non-drinking water  and wastewater services for the Cape  Jaffa Anchorage Marina. The agreement  saw us temporarily operating these  services from 31 October 2022, to ensure  continued services for marina customers.  Procurement  excellence certification In March 2023, our Supply Chain  team achieved Procurement Excellence  Programme certification from the  Chartered Institute of Procurement  and Supply (CIPS), a professional body  working for procurement and supply  professions around the world. Our procurement capabilities were  assessed against 98 criteria across  5 separate topics. This award places  us in an elite group of just 20 Australian  organisations, and we are only the  second Australian water utility to  achieve certification. This achievement  demonstrates our procurement function  is world-leading and robust, providing  effective governance for supply  assurance and compliance.  Paul Rucioch, Mike Gibbons, Jacqueline  Guerin, John Minuzzo and Nicola Murphy  accepting the CIPS certification from  Charlotte Payne (second from left). Accessible information  for customers As part of our 2020-22 Disability, Access  and Inclusion Plan and our Wider World  program, we produced and published  7 accessible Easy Read documents for  customers with low literacy or limited  English skills. The 7 documents, available at sawater. com.au, our front counter in SA Water  House, and via our Customer Assist  team and financial counsellors, focused  on topics our customers identified as  important to understand. The documents  cover:  	• how to understand and pay your  water bill 	• how to find water leaks and read  your meter 	• how to save water at your home 	• support for paying your bill 	• water prices for homes 	• how to keep sewers healthy 	• our Disability Access and Inclusion  Plan. Bacterial DNA testing  first for the Australian  Water Quality Centre The Australian Water Quality Centre  (AWQC) became the first laboratory in  Australia to apply accredited molecular  testing technology specifically to  optimise water quality management. Attaining full National Association of  Testing Authorities (NATA) accreditation  for its bacterial DNA molecular analysis,  the AWQC’s DNA testing method  enables us to characterise entire  microbial communities. This has revealed  a diversity of microorganisms we have  not been able to see before because  they were so difficult to isolate using  traditional methods. This has significant benefits for improving  public health, water quality research and  operational decision-making. In addition, the AWQC improved the customer experience by implementing a  TouchPoint digital phone system. Calls to AWQC are now routed directly to the  AWQC, bypassing our Customer Care Centre. The new TouchPoint system provides: 	• an improved caller experience 	• fast, efficient call handling and transfer 	• a livestream dashboard displaying call statistics for easy, centralised administration  and reporting. Drones support water quality monitoring In a first for our business, the use of a drone was trialled as a safe and effective way  to take water samples, particularly from hard to access locations such as some parts  of the River Murray. Water sampling is part of our ongoing, comprehensive water quality monitoring  program, with 70,678 water samples collected during 2022-23, and is a crucial step  to make sure safe, clean drinking water is provided across South Australia. The drones can collect a single 2-litre water sample or 4 individual 250 millilitre  samples. They can be remotely operated from the shore or riverbank to reduce risks  associated with on-water operations, and are programmed with GPS to streamline  sampling and make it more consistent. Algal management improvements In 2022-23, we partnered with the CSIRO to test ‘CyanoSat’, a shoebox-sized  hyperspectral imager, to help improve algal management. The imager flew 2  drone missions over Warren Reservoir to capture hyperspectral imaging that  was comparatively analysed against our own algal management data. This new  hyperspectral imager enables the entire water body to be quickly surveyed by  exploiting algal colour differences to detect and differentiate species.  In addition, a trial was undertaken at Warren Reservoir to assess the effectiveness  of EarthTec, an alternative copper-based product. Copper dosing is used to help  control algal blooms. EarthTec is released directly from the shoreline into the reservoir  via a gravity fed hose and has the potential to dramatically reduce sludge disposal  costs from a water treatment plant because it involves significantly lower copper  concentrations.  A suite of Easy Read documents is available on our website.  ===== PAGE 13 ===== Year in review 22 23 Water for the future Our production and  treatment activities  ensure the water we  provide is fit for our  customers to use, and to  be recycled or returned  to the environment. We  harvest, store, treat,  distribute and reuse  water to provide fit-for- purpose water services  to our customers to  stimulate economic  growth and meet  customer needs. Creating a resilient water future  In 2022-23 we began leading a cross-government project that is developing a  Resilient Water Futures Strategy. A collaborative, integrated approach to water  management for Greater Adelaide will inform a strategy due to be delivered to  the South Australian Government in June 2024.  This year, the project has achieved milestones including: 	• development of a robust stakeholder consultation and governance program 	• co-development of a vision and strategic priorities for a secure and resilient  water future for Greater Adelaide 	• a complete system assessment of all water sources and demands,  and determined the scale of current and future water challenges. Extensive community engagement was undertaken to understand ideas, values  and preferences about water security, service levels and water management  options including: 	• input from our Customer Challenge Group – which helped define our options  evaluation criteria 	• adaptive Planning Forums – with more than 70 water sector delegates  collaboratively developing the adaptive plan 	• First Nations' roundtables – working in partnership with Kaurna, Peramangk,  Ngarrindjeri and Ngadjuri representatives to embed First Nations' knowledge  and values in our water management and planning. Desalination for remote communities A new solar-powered, small-scale reverse osmosis desalination plant was completed  in August at Kaltjiti in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands, replacing the  existing water treatment plant. Delivering high-quality drinking water to the remote Aboriginal community, the plant  can produce up to 120,000 litres of water each day. It is fitted with 38 kilowatts  of solar panels and additional battery storage, helping to harness the region’s  traditionally warm and sunny weather to reduce carbon emissions and our reliance  on power from the local grid. In Oodnadatta, a new small-scale reverse osmosis desalination facility was complete,  sourcing water from the Great Artesian Basin. Planning and works continued for new drinking water supplies to Marree and Marla. The Oodnadatta desalination plant and storage tank. Keeping our systems and data safe and secure In 2022-23, we appointed a General Manager Technology as well as a Chief  Information Security Officer, strengthening our innovative use of solutions and  technology, while ensuring we have safe and secure systems and data. Our  investment in cyber security continues to be a priority and we constantly respond  to the changing cyber threats and sophisticated cyber attacks we see in Australia  and in the water industry.  We continue to strengthen our security and build resilient systems and processes.  To understand the rapidly changing threats we face and be able to respond quickly,  we established our Cyber Security Operations Centre in August, enabling us to  respond quickly to cyber threats. The centre: 	• triages alerts and cyber incidents raised by our users and cyber security tools 	• identifies weaknesses and vulnerabilities in our applications and supporting  infrastructure, and works collaboratively to pre-emptively resolve issues 	• identifies trends and cyber threats that may impact our systems or people  and apply remediations/mitigations to reduce cyber risks for our business. Our Adelaide Service Delivery partnership Our Adelaide Service Delivery partnership with Service Stream and SUEZ continued  into its second year. In 2022-23, our Metro Field Operations Service Provider, Service Stream has: 	• completed 101,872 work orders, the majority of which related to customer calls,  while achieving 7 out of 7 customer service standards set by the Essential Services  Commission of South Australia (including best endeavours) 	• improved customer satisfaction and outcomes in conjunction with our teams  through optimised delivery solutions, such as non-dig-up sewer repairs and  preventative sewer maintenance techniques that support longer term asset  solutions 	• delivered services for our customers with an average customer satisfaction  score of 95 per cent 	• taken on the operation and maintenance of a community Wastewater  Management System in Tea Tree Gully and developed a targeted maintenance  program improving service level outcomes for our new customers resulting in  a 50 per cent reduction in the number of overflows on this network 	• supported our capital delivery teams in delivering several projects in regional  areas, including water main relay projects in Port Pirie, Moonta and Kadina,  and metropolitan relay works in Enfield and Warradale 	• supported the rapid mobilisation of the 2022 Adelaide 500 race event by ensuring  our water and wastewater networks were ready for increased customer demand 	• supported our regional teams to prepare and respond to the unprecedented  River Murray flood 	• significantly increased data collection from the field, enhancing analysis and  reporting of field performance.

Since public access  began in 2019, we have recorded more than one million visitors. Our program to open reservoir reserves was recognised with 5 awards in 2022-23: 1.	 Environmental Excellence Award from the Urban Development Institute of Australia  (UDIA) South Australia’s 2022 Awards for Excellence.  2.	 The Social and Community Infrastructure Award, also from the UDIA South  Australia. 3.	 Social and Community Infrastructure Award at the 2023 UDIA national awards.  4.	 Organisational Excellence Award at the 2022 Australian Water Association  South Australian awards. 5.	 Community Based Initiative of the Year at the 2022 national Parks and Leisure  Australia Awards of Excellence.  Water security  for Eyre Peninsula  In April 2023, the state government  accepted our Board’s recommendation  of Billy Lights Point as the site for a  desalination plant on Eyre Peninsula.  The plant will provide a new reliable,  climate-independent source of drinking  water, to reduce the pressure on existing  groundwater sources and the River  Murray. Key stakeholder engagement activities  were undertaken in 2022-23 giving  the Eyre Peninsula community an  opportunity to provide feedback,  including community information  sessions, and presentations to local  councils, other government bodies  and local schools. Community Marine Science Forums were  held to provide the community with an  understanding of the science undertaken  by the South Australian Research and  Development Institute to inform the  decision to recommend Billy Lights Point  as the preferred site.  A Project Information Centre was  established in central Port Lincoln to  provide local residents with an ongoing  connection with the project team so  they could ask questions and seek  information related to the project. Community members attending a Marine  Science Forum at the Project Information  Centre in Port Lincoln. Members of the project team talked to  students at Navigator College in Port Lincoln  about the new desalination plant. Delivering climate independent water on Kangaroo Island Construction was completed in May on the structure of Penneshaw’s new seawater  desalination plant, with building work also commencing on the internal fit out and  the plant’s retaining wall.  In addition, more than 11 kilometres of a 19.3 kilometre pipeline was completed  between Cygnet River and Haines which will transport water produced at the  plant. We also built a 75-metre causeway to complete 75 of 190 metres of marine  trenching for the pipeline. The pipeline to bring seawater from the ocean to the new plant was 90 per cent  complete as at the end of June 2023. In addition, public consultation on the plant’s  landscaping plan was complete and officially endorsed by Kangaroo Island Council. Construction of the structure for the new desalination plant at Penneshaw was completed. Northern Adelaide Irrigation Scheme review The Northern Adelaide Irrigation Scheme (NAIS) provides recycled water from  Bolivar Wastewater Treatment Plant to the Northern Adelaide Plains for agri-food  production use. A review of the scheme was undertaken to inform future approaches to drive scheme  take-up and economic growth in the region. The review assessed the current and  future demand for NAIS recycled water in the region, stakeholder perceptions of the  NAIS pricing and service delivery, and potential opportunities to help NAIS further  facilitate economic growth. After engagement with our customers and stakeholders to ensure their views were  represented, a draft NAIS report was released for public consultation in April 2023.  The report has since been updated with additional feedback from the consultation  process and presented to government for its consideration. Agri-food production is a major user of water from the Northern Adelaide Irrigation Scheme.  ===== PAGE 15 ===== Year in review 26 27 Our work to promote reusable drink  bottles – Bring Your Own Bottle (BYOB)  – encourages our community to avoid  single use plastic bottles of water by  bringing reusable bottles to fill with  tap water when out and about. We  continued our BYOB focus at community  events this year and promoted our BYOB  app which maps drinking fountains  and bottle filling stations across South  Australia.  Through our Water Talks website, more  than 60,000 people learned about  and engaged on a range of projects  underway across the state including: 	• Tea Tree Gully Sustainable Sewers 	• Mount Bold Dam safety upgrade 	• Eyre Peninsula desalination project 	• Kangaroo Island’s new seawater  desalination plant project 	• our planning for 2024-28. Artwork on infrastructure Five sites had artwork completed this  year: the Minlacowie and Wool Bay  Tanks, the River Torrens outlet wall,  and the Loxton and Swan Reach  pump houses. Artwork is part of  our commitment to improving the  visual amenity of our infrastructure in  metropolitan and regional communities  throughout South Australia. The mural  on the Minlacowie tank has provided a  talking point for ongoing conversations  on the value of the Narungga people’s  knowledge, experience and contribution  to the region.

The Reservoir Volunteer program continued, and we partnered directly with  93 community members at reservoir reserves on conservation activities such as  revegetation and bush care, fish stocking, and community events at Myponga,  Happy Valley, Mount Bold, Hope Valley, Warren, South Para and Barossa reservoir  reserves. In December 2022, we supported the Williamstown Action Group’s Santa Dash Fun  Run as part of our Reservoir Partnership Program.  Reservoir Rangers Jake Williams and Sam  Haniford at Happy Valley Reservoir Reserve. The inaugural Santa Dash fun run  was held in December 2022 at  South Para Reservoir Reserve. Greening our communities This year, we helped transform our land holdings and land around our infrastructure  into greener spaces to support thriving communities.  In July 2022, a garden was established at the Port Pirie depot, featuring a variety  of local flora carefully selected for their visual appeal and adaptation to the local  environment. The garden includes more than 200 seedlings local to the region.  A greening project for Port Pirie was initiated and a Memorandum of Administrative  Agreement was signed with the Department for Environment and Water outlining  the agreed greening Port Pirie scope of work. We also undertook site surveys and  soil sampling to inform final greening designs for this project. Research and greening  initiatives have been shared with the Port Pirie Council which is leading the project.  Our work for the Port Pirie greening program was recognised with an Australian  Institute of Landscape Architects South Australian Landscape Architecture Award. In May 2023, we partnered with the City of Charles Sturt by leasing our vacant  land and transforming a disused pump station building in St Clair for the use  of a new community garden. Our field operations team at the Port Pirie Depot with their flourishing native garden. Wastewater surveillance  for SARS-CoV-2 Our Research and Science teams  continued to work with South Australian  and interstate health regulators to  conduct wastewater surveillance for  SARS-CoV-2. As the amount of clinical  testing and self-reporting decreased,  we continued to support SA Health to  monitor wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 in  Adelaide and key regional locations.  Testing was also expanded to include  variant testing, working with the South  Australian Health and Medical Research  Institute to analyse wastewater samples  and identify the COVID-19 variants  circulating in the community. Community education,  events and engagement This year, 4,417 students and their  teachers participated in our education  program The Well, with a quarter of  these students coming from regional  schools. Our Community Education team gave  a range of presentations and tours,  and held an open day at the Adelaide  Desalination Plant. Community groups  that participated in presentations  included a recently arrived migrant  group and people from low socio- economic communities. Migrants and  a group of customers who are blind also  toured the Adelaide Desalination Plant. A new education program was  developed and piloted in schools on the  Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara  Lands. In 2022-23, our Quench Benches and  vintage caravan Miss Isla delivered clean  drinking water at 158 community events  including NAIDOC Week Family Day,  WOMADelaide, the Adelaide 500 and  the Christmas Pageant.  ===== PAGE 16 ===== Year in review 28 29 Bolivar’s biogas breaks  renewables record In July 2022, we achieved a record- breaking level of 3,099 megawatt hours  of renewable energy generation from  biogas at Bolivar Wastewater Treatment  Plant. This surpassed our yearly average  of 2,800 megawatt hours and resulted  in 112 per cent energy sufficiency for  the month, with excess green energy  exported to the grid. Bolivar Wastewater  Treatment Plant had an average energy  self-sufficiency rate of 95 per cent in  2022-23.  Bolivar Wastewater Treatment Plant  was 95 per cent energy self-sufficient. Building bushfire resilience In 2022-23, our Research team began work to investigate the use of low-cost remote  sensors to help measure water quality challenges and other impacts following  bushfires. The research will inform future bushfire recovery efforts. In November 2022 we completed a 3-year project, delivered by the University of  New South Wales, which conducted research to improve our understanding of the  impact of fires on native habitat. The outcomes of this research are now being used  to improve prescribed burning methods to reduce the risk of bushfires. Conservation and restoration of reservoir reserves In 2022-23 we restored a 24-hectare site at our Millbrook Reservoir Reserve into  a thriving open grassy woodland habitat with 82 native plant species and more  than 2.2 million native grasses. The restoration project was recognised with the Environmental Stewardship Award  at the 2023 Parks and Leisure Australia South Australia Awards of Excellence. We made significant progress in reconstructing Eyre Peninsula Blue Gum Woodland  and Sheoak Grassy Woodland at Tod Reservoir Reserve on the lower Eyre Peninsula.  These on-ground native vegetation offsets cover 12 hectares and biodiversity gains  are tracking above target. Two aerial operations were carried out to remove feral deer and goats from the  Mount Bold and Scott Creek area, in collaboration with Landscapes South Australia  Hills and Fleurieu, the Department for Environment and Water, and Forestry South  Australia. The removal of these animals has a crucial role in safeguarding the  region’s biodiversity and facilitating the recovery of vegetation affected by the Cherry  Gardens bushfire. The operation in November removed 286 deer and 61 goats, and  in June, 375 deer and 12 goats were removed. As part of an extensive fauna monitoring program, we partnered with a wildlife  organisation to remove feral cats from land around Middle River Reservoir on  Kangaroo Island, helping protect the endangered southern brown bandicoots  and the critically-endangered Kangaroo Island dunnart. Recycled water for irrigators This year we reached an in-principal agreement with Willunga Basin Water to enter  a new long-term contract through to 2052 for the supply of climate-independent  recycled water to around 240 irrigators across the McLaren Vale region, providing  water security to Willunga Basin Water customers. Willunga Basin Water supplies  about 6,000 megalitres a year of recycled water, which is sourced from and treated  at our Aldinga and Christies Beach wastewater treatment plants. Proactive  environmental  leadership As a leader in  environmental  management, and by  partnering with our  stakeholders, customers  and community, we are  taking action to adapt  to climate change,  and finding ways to  reduce our greenhouse  gas emissions. We  make decisions that  reduce waste and  grow opportunities to  reuse resources and  by-products of our  production processes  to create environmental  benefits. Zero Cost Energy Future  The Zero Cost Energy Future initiative earned multiple awards in 2022-23. It  was presented with the Consult Australia Awards for Excellence in the Superior  Sustainability category, the Premier’s Climate Change Council South Australia Climate  Leaders Awards in the climate change category, the Engineers Australia Excellence  Awards South Australia as a project award, and the Australian Institute of Energy  South Australia awards as the South Australian Energy Project of the Year.

Reducing waste and introducing circular economy To promote sustainability and responsible practices, in 2022-23 we: 	• developed a circular economy approach to guide how we effectively integrate  circular practices throughout our operations 	• completed a circular economy procurement project, which involved a  comprehensive review of our procurement practices. As a result, we developed a  specialised tool to help our people identify products with recycled content suitable  for use by our business 	• reused demolition materials for fill projects and improved sorting and separation  processes for recycling 	• incorporated recycled aggregates for pipe embedment, reducing our reliance  on raw materials. For instance, we used 10 mm and 14 mm recycled aggregates  instead of raw materials for pipe embedment in the Tea Tree Gully Sustainable  Sewers project. These achievements are part of our commitment to introducing circular economy  into our business for a more sustainable future.  ===== PAGE 17 ===== Year in review 30 31 Disability access and inclusion By 30 June, 86 per cent of actions in our Disability Access and Inclusion Plan were  complete. This year we delivered initiatives including increased accessibility to  information at public sites such as signage at reservoirs, a visitor accessibility guide  for SA Water House, and business-wide awareness through events organised by our  Able Together network group. The reporting period for our plan has been extended  to the end of 2023 to align with Inclusive SA’s State Inclusion Plan with  a report to the Department of Human Services due in early 2024. Performance management Our annual performance appraisal and development cycle is aligned to the financial  year, which includes setting goals, supporting our people’s development and having  performance discussions. In 2022-23, 98 per cent of our people completed their  annual performance reviews. Our people  for the future We proactively grow  a diverse and inclusive  business with people  who reflect the  community we serve.  This brings creative  thinking and diversity  of thought to build  innovation, embracing  technology to help  us be safer and more  efficient. Our people  work safely and are part  of a high performing  culture where learning  and collaboration  deliver great customer  outcomes. Improving health and safety and wellbeing The once-in-a-generation River Murray flood made 2022-23 a challenging year for  our people. While operating along the River Murray is part of our daily work, the  flood changed the operating landscape by introducing new hazards and dangers,  such as working in and around flood waters. Our Health and Safety team worked  alongside operational teams to support the health, safety and wellbeing of our  people working on our flood response and those directly affected by the flood.  While the flood required some adjustments to our Health and Safety Improvement  Plan, key projects were completed including the second psychological hazards  climate survey and the roll out of Health and Safety leadership training. This bespoke  training develops our leaders’ safety mindset, while giving them tools to continue  their development on the job.  The leadership program was further complemented by a 2-day Incident Cause  Analysis Method investigation course delivered in March 2023 which supports our  commitment to quality incident management.  This focus on quality incident management helps create a safe workplace for our  people as evidenced by our performance against key safety measures. Our end  of year result of 5.0 for the total recordable injury frequency rate was favourable to  the target of 5.5. The high potential incident frequency rate result was 6.3 against a  target of 6.7.  Technology improvements continued to be pursued to mitigate health and safety  risk exposures. These included trialling drone water sampling and, in collaboration  with UniSA, wearables to identify fatigue indicators. Diversity, equity and inclusion In 2022-23, a new Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Strategic Plan 2030 was endorsed,  together with an accompanying governance structure. The plan sets our 2030 goal  to be an innovative organisation where diversity and inclusion is part of everything  we do.  As at 30 June 2023, women comprised 48.89 per cent of our leadership, favourable  to our target of 40 per cent and continuing the recent upward trend. The percentage  of women overall in our business is 32.39 per cent. Through the Capital Delivery Strategic KPI Program, a report on women working in  science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) fields was prepared together  with our major framework partners. The report highlighted the barriers women in  STEM face, focusing on women who graduated with a STEM degree in the past 5  years and who are working in a STEM field. To understand early barriers, the focus  included senior high school students in years 10, 11 and 12, university students and  early career professionals. The report will be used to identify opportunities and  implement activities to address the barriers and encourage greater participation of  women in STEM careers.  Our sponsorship of the University of Adelaide’s Women in STEM careers program  continued, giving students the opportunity to connect with industry professionals  and learn about career options available when they have completed their studies. Our employee networks groups, Together for Women, Pride Together, Kauwi Miyurna  and Able Together, continued to promote and share their experiences to celebrate  the diversity of our workforce.  In 2022-23, Aboriginal employment was at 2.09 per cent and cultural awareness  training has been reviewed with a plan in place to ensure it is specific to our needs,  building a more inclusive culture. A partnership with the Clontarf Foundation which provided traineeship opportunities,  was extended until December 2025 with one trainee joining the team in Whyalla.  ===== PAGE 18 ===== Water quality 33 32 Safe drinking water legislation The Safe Drinking Water Act 2011 (the Act) and Safe Drinking Water Regulations  2012 provide the regulatory framework for drinking water providers in South Australia  and are administered primarily by SA Health. Provisions in the Act are underpinned  by the ADWG and prescribe requirements for drinking water providers, including: 	• registration of drinking water providers with SA Health 	• development and implementation of risk management plans  	• establishment of approved drinking water quality monitoring programs 	• notification of incidents or non-compliance 	• audits and inspections to determine compliance with the Act 	• use of National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) accredited laboratories  for sample testing 	• reporting of water quality test results to SA Health and providing consumers  with drinking water quality information. As a registered drinking water provider, we have established risk management  plans, including approved monitoring programs and an incident notification protocol.  We provide water quality testing reports for metropolitan and regional water supplies  on a monthly basis with results showing a very high level of compliance. An independent audit was undertaken in February 2023 as required by the Act.  The audit spanned a duration of 2 weeks focusing on examining a selection of  representative drinking water supplies. It encompassed both desktop assessments  and on-site visits which included travelling to the Anangu Pitjantjatjara  Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands. The 2-week audit recognised overall compliance with the Act. Highlights identified  by the auditor included: 	• A mature drinking water management system. 	• A culture that recognises the importance of drinking water quality – this is deeply  embedded within the organisation, and is to be applauded. 	• Staff who are adaptable, dedicated, skilled and sharing. 	• Water planning for, response during, and recovery from the River Murray flood.  This event would test any organisation, and the level of dedication to ensuring  the best outcomes are noted and congratulated. 	• Contract partners to SA Water are also much more integrated now into the overall  delivery of safe water. It is apparent that water quality, not contractual limits is the  primary driver of interactions, and all partners were observed to be undertaking  their roles in a collaborative and cooperative fashion. 	• In response to previous audit findings, SA Water not only addressed the specific  concerns but took a wider view to review the finding, determine the most  appropriate solution and implement it across the business. Overall, the audit showed a very high level of compliance, however, as expected,  with a detailed audit, 2 non-conformances were identified as well as a number  of improvement actions. As in previous years, these items will be assessed and  corrective actions will be taken. Water quality SA Health  statement SA Health and SA Water  work cooperatively to  ensure the continued  protection of public  health in relation to  the supply of drinking  water across the state.  SA Water complied with  all requirements under  the Safe Drinking Water  Act 2011 including the  notification of incidents  under the interagency  Water/Wastewater  Incident Notification  and Communication  Protocol.  During 2022-23, SA Water conducted 46,089 tests for analytes in drinking water  supplies throughout the state for compliance with the Australian Drinking Water  Guidelines (2011) (ADWG). These results were reported to SA Health in line with  agreed reporting protocols. Compliance with the ADWG for E. coli was achieved  in 99.97 per cent of metropolitan Adelaide samples and 99.96 per cent of regional  samples. Overall compliance with the ADWG for health-related parameters was  99.98 per cent for metropolitan systems and 99.85 per cent for regional areas.  The total number of incidents notified by SA Water during 2022-23 (179) was higher  than in 2021-22 (136) but most of this was due to an increase in Type 2 incidents.  There were 2 Priority Type 1 incidents during 2022-23 for enteric protozoa detected  in treated water samples. Both of these incidents were managed appropriately to  prevent risks to drinking water quality. The impact of the River Murray flooding event in December 2022 resulted in an  increase in incidents particularly related to elevated levels of cyanobacteria, and  physical parameters such as high turbidity. The flood waters contributed to overall  poor water quality in the River Murray resulting in treatment and disinfection  challenges at water treatment plants fed by River Murray water. Incidents relating  to disinfection by-products also increased.  High rainfall events led to a significant increase in the detections of enteric protozoa  (Cryptosporidium and Giardia) in drinking water catchments and source waters.  There were 42 Type 2 incidents involving detection of enteric protozoa in the  catchment following rain events or at the inlets to drinking water treatment  plants. No faults were detected from the continuous monitoring of treatment  plant performance during the periods when the protozoa were detected  in the source water.  The number of incidents (9 ) related to recreational use of reservoir reserves was  lower than in 2021-22 (20). The incidents did not have a measurable impact on  drinking water quality.  There was a small increase in the number of detections of E. coli in drinking water  samples in 2022-23. Appropriate remedial action was taken to minimise the impact  to public health. Overall compliance of E. coli monitoring remained very high.  All water quality incidents were notified by SA Water in a timely manner. Appropriate  remedial actions and responses were implemented following incidents to ensure the  protection of public health was maintained at all times. No incidents required public  notification during the reporting period.   ===== PAGE 19 ===== Water quality 34 35 Drinking water quality and performance In 2022-23, we demonstrated robust management of water quality by consistently  providing safe, clean drinking water to our customers despite the challenges posed  by the flood event in the River Murray. Statewide, metropolitan and regional drinking water supply systems  health-related performance, 2022-23 Health-related  parameters Statewide systems (number  of test analytes) Metropolitan  systems  Regional Samples free from  E. coli 99.96% (10,229) 99.97% (3,167) 99.96% (7,062) Samples compliant  with ADWG health  parameters* 99.89% (46,089) 99.98% (12,655) 99.85% (33,434) Target: 99.90% Target: 99.90% Target: 99.90% *Percentage of routine results at customer tap sample locations within drinking water systems  which comply with the ADWG health limits (including E. coli). Direct exceedances of the ADWG were used rather than the 95th percentiles for compliance  of individual chemical parameters. Prior to calculating per cent compliance for health-related chemicals, individual results are  rounded to the same number of significant figures as the guideline value in the ADWG (as  prescribed in the ADWG and agreed with SA Health). We analysed 46,089 test analytes from our drinking water supplies (customer  tap sample locations) throughout South Australia to determine health-related  compliance. We achieved 99.96 per cent E. coli compliance across customer tap  sample locations with exceptions in one metropolitan and 3 regional systems.  Compliance with ADWG health-related parameters across customer tap sample  locations was marginally below target at 99.89 per cent. This result can be largely  attributed to the flood event which saw a short-term rise in disinfection by-products  in several of the systems fed directly from the River Murray. Although we aim for 100 per cent compliance all the time, the ADWG recognises that  occasional exceedances may occur with most guidelines for chemicals based on a  lifetime of exposure. In accordance with the guidelines and the interagency Water/  Wastewater Incident Notification and Communication Protocol, all detections were  immediately communicated to SA Health, investigated by us and corrective actions  implemented as agreed with SA Health. SA Health has confirmed that drinking water provided to customers by us was safe  and that appropriate responses and corrective actions were implemented for all  exceedances and these mitigated any risks to public health. 2022-23 2021-22 2020-21 90.00% 91.00% 92.00% 93.00% 94.00% 95.00% 96.00% 97.00% 98.00% 99.00% 100.00% 99.96% 99.97% 99.93% 99.97% 99.96% 100.00% Regional Metropolitan Compliance with E. coli levels at metropolitan and regional drinking water supply  system customer tap sample locations since 2020-21 (customer tap sample  location tests free from E. coli).  Catchment to tap We manage drinking water quality from catchment to tap in line with our Drinking  Water Quality Management System to ensure a consistent and reliable supply of  high quality, safe drinking water for our customers. This management system is based on the Framework for Management of Drinking  Water Quality outlined in the ADWG and endorsed by the National Health and  Medical Research Council. The framework outlines good drinking water supply  management, based on the best available scientific evidence that will assure  drinking water quality and safety at the tap.  Water quality monitoring and testing The 85 drinking water supplies we operate serve customers across metropolitan and  regional South Australia. This year we have merged what was previously reported as  country and remote Aboriginal communities into one category (regional). To maintain quality, we have SA Health-approved drinking water quality monitoring  programs with samples collected and analysed throughout all aspects of the water  supply system, including catchment and source water, treatment processes, and the  distribution network up to the water meter on individual properties. We monitor for health and aesthetic compliance and to optimise water quality.  Samples are collected by our trained field workers to make sure they are taken  correctly, and field results have a high degree of integrity. Laboratory analyses are  carried out by our Australian Water Quality Centre in accordance with ISO 9001  Quality Systems and NATA requirements.

The IRI is assessed against a number of criteria,  with each component in the IRI designed to help manage water quality incidents. Criteria used in the IRI based on total reportable SA Health Priority Type 1 and Type 1  incident notifications are: 	• incident reported to relevant agencies by phone immediately (less than one hour) 	• incident entered into the incident management system in less than 2 hours 	• initial effective response taken within 3 hours 	• written report to the Minister for Climate, Environment and Water  by 3pm the next business day 	• root cause analysis completed within 10 working days 	• preventive actions implemented within agreed timeframes. The overall 2022-23 strategic target for the IRI is 85 per cent compliance. The Incident Response Index achieved for metropolitan and regional incidents  for 2022-23 System IRI Metropolitan 100% Regional 95% Target 85%   Incident management We apply the ADWG Framework for Management of Drinking Water Quality  which includes 2 components for the management of incidents: 1.	 communication 2.	 incident and emergency response protocols. Our Water Quality Incident and Emergency Management Protocol is in place and we  have a web-based incident management system to record and generate notifications  of water quality incidents. These are aligned to the interagency Water/Wastewater  Incident Notification and Communication Protocol that is maintained by SA Health  to adopt the principles of the ADWG and satisfy requirements of the Act and Safe  Drinking Water Regulations 2012. SA Health defines 3 types of health-related incident classifications based  on a precautionary approach: 1. Priority Type 1 incident notification  An incident that, without immediate appropriate response or intervention, could  cause serious risk to human health and is likely to require immediate interagency  meetings to consider responses. Procedures for Type 1 incident notifications also  apply.  2. Type 1 incident notification An incident that, without appropriate response or intervention, could cause serious  risk to human health. 3. Type 2 incident notifications An incident that, without appropriate response or intervention, represents a low risk  to human health. Number of incidents in statewide drinking water supplies (metropolitan and regional) Reporting period Priority Type 1 Type 1 Type 2 2022-23 2 48 129 2021-22 0 50 86 2020-21 1 45 57 2019-20 1 36 63 2018-19 1 24 54 2017-18 2 42 90 Note: these notifications do not include wastewater, recycled water and non-drinking supplies. Priority Type 1 and Type 1 incidents are immediately reported to SA Health, while  all Type 2 notifications are reportable within 24 hours, in line with the interagency  Water/Wastewater Incident Notification and Communication Protocol. In 2022-23, there were 2 Priority Type 1 incidents reported due to the detection of  Cryptosporidium in product water from a water treatment plant (WTP). In one of the  instances, the WTP had ultraviolet disinfection, which is an effective barrier against  Cryptosporidium, and in the other the Cryptosporidium was non-infectious.  The poor source water quality following the River Murray flooding event from  December 2022 led to treatment and disinfection challenges in our water treatment  plants and networks. This, in turn, caused an increase in turbidity, disinfection,  disinfection by-products, cyanobacteria, enteric protozoa and bacteriological  incidents. During 2022-23, there was a decrease  in chemical detections and a significant  improvement in non-compliance at  reservoirs with recreational access  resulting in a decrease in contamination  incidents. The rise in Type 2 incidents can also be  attributed to increased rainfall events  during the year leading to an increase  in enteric protozoa detections in our  surface water catchments. In 2022-23, we continued to address  the causes of preventable Type 1  notifications. Strategies used to  achieve this include refresher training,  optimisation of our drinking water  quality monitoring program, ongoing  operational and capital improvements,  and continuous improvement of our  Drinking Water Quality Management  System. The proactive water quality  management of targeted water  supply systems and the detection and  management of risks continued during  2022-23. Changes in reporting criteria  issued by SA Health in the interagency  Water/Wastewater Incident Notification  and Communication Protocol also  occurred and contributed to a change  in reporting requirements.  ===== PAGE 21 ===== Do you have a  larger file size of  this same image?

Public interest disclosure Through our Public Interest Disclosure Procedure, we are committed to encouraging  and facilitating disclosure, in the public interest, of information about substantial risks  to public health, safety or the environment, or about corruption, misconduct and  maladministration in public administration. There was one matter disclosed to a responsible officer of the agency under the  Public Interest Disclosure Act 2018 in August 2022. Following an internal investigation,  we reported the matter to the Officer for Public Integrity (OPI). Upon review, the  OPI referred the matter to the Independent Commission Against Corruption South  Australia (ICAC). ICAC’s investigation concluded with no findings of corruption,  misconduct, maladministration or otherwise. Risk management Strategic risk management supports our forward planning and critical thinking  to enable well-informed decision-making across our operations.  Risk management is controlled by our Governance Policy and supported by  our Risk Framework which has been developed to align with the requirements  of the SA Government Risk Management Guide and aligns to the principles of  risk management as set out in the international risk management standard ISO  31000:2018 Risk Management – Guidelines. Our risk profile is reported regularly to our Board through its Governance,  Finance and Risk Committee. Supplementary  reporting items  ===== PAGE 26 ===== Supplementary reporting items 48 49 Ministerial directions Complaints All forms of organisational feedback including complaints are seen as opportunities  for us to improve our performance in delivering excellent customer experiences,  as well as building customer trust and confidence and developing operational  efficiencies.  We strive to capture, understand, and resolve complaints at first contact whenever  possible. Our Customer Advocate team helps investigate and respond to complaints  which were not able to be resolved on first contact. Additionally, we proactively look  for ways to improve the feedback management processes across the business. In 2022-23, we received 3.55 complaints per 1,000 customers, up from 2.94 complaints  per 1,000 customers in 2021-22. This increase was driven by improved focus on better  complaint capture and training our people in complaint management. It is viewed  as a positive indication of improvement and not identified as a specific trend or  operational issue. More than one third (36.24 per cent) of all complaints received were recorded as first  contact resolution complaints. We responded to 97.18 per cent of complaints within  target times, with 7.03 per cent of complaints escalated to the ombudsman. Together with the Water Services Association of Australia and other Australian water  utilities, we are reviewing and implementing best practice guidelines to extend our  ability to capture customer complaints resolved at first contact, to build valuable  insights for our business and improve the overall experience for our customers. The most common complaint types received in 2022-23 related to: 1.	 water quality  2.	 meter reading and estimates  3.	 repairs and maintenance of infrastructure in the metropolitan area. In 2022-23, the Energy and Water Ombudsman of South Australia (EWOSA)  referred 1841 complaints to us on a range of issues, which is an increase from 144  in 2021-22. The highest complaint type remains costs incurred for high water use,  which is consistent with complaints referred in 2021-22. This year, 81 per cent of customers who had a complaint handled by our Customer  Advocate team indicated they were satisfied with our complaints handling process. Through our complaint management process, the Customer Advocate team  completes root cause analyses, post complaint reviews and case studies for  complaints throughout the year. Case studies include a full account of the complaint  details, a summary of the case investigation, the outcomes, and any applicable  process improvement recommendations. In response to customer feedback, we continue to implement changes, and in the  past year this has included: 	• improvements to complaint recording and data collection including staff training 	• meter reading procedures. Supporting customers In 2022-23, 1,053 new customers joined  our Customer Assist Program. The  program helps residential customers  with support to help pay their bills. At  30 June 2023, 1,916 residential customers  had participated in a financial hardship  program with a $2,936 average bill  balance. The program connects  customers with support to help them  better manage their bills, and in  2022-23, 655 residential customers  successfully exited the program. 1	 The number of EWOSA complaints referred to us may differ between our reporting and  EWOSA’s due to variances in reporting practices.  ===== PAGE 27 ===== Supplementary reporting items 50 51  ===== PAGE 28 ===== Appendices  ===== PAGE 29 ===== Appendix A 54 55 Appendix A – Audited financial statements South Australian Water Corporation  annual financial statements for the  year ended 30 June 2023.  ===== PAGE 30 ===== Appendix A 56 57  ===== PAGE 31 ===== Appendix A 58 59  ===== PAGE 32 ===== Appendix A 60 61  ===== PAGE 33 ===== Appendix A 62 63  ===== PAGE 34 ===== Appendix A 64 65  ===== PAGE 35 ===== Appendix A 66 67  ===== PAGE 36 ===== Appendix A 68 69  ===== PAGE 37 ===== Appendix A 70 71  ===== PAGE 38 ===== Appendix A 72 73  ===== PAGE 39 ===== Appendix A 74 75  ===== PAGE 40 ===== Appendix A 76 77  ===== PAGE 41 ===== Appendix A 78 79  ===== PAGE 42 ===== Appendix A 80 81  ===== PAGE 43 ===== Appendix A 82 83  ===== PAGE 44 ===== Appendix A 84 85  ===== PAGE 45 ===== Appendix A 86 87  ===== PAGE 46 ===== Appendix A 88 89  ===== PAGE 47 ===== Appendix A 90 91  ===== PAGE 48 ===== Appendix A 92 93  ===== PAGE 49 ===== Appendix A 94 95  ===== PAGE 50 ===== Appendix A 96 97  ===== PAGE 51 ===== Appendix A 98 99  ===== PAGE 52 ===== Appendix A 100 101  ===== PAGE 53 ===== Appendix A 102 103  ===== PAGE 54 ===== Appendix A 104 105  ===== PAGE 55 ===== Appendix A 106 107  ===== PAGE 56 ===== Appendix A 108 109  ===== PAGE 57 ===== Appendix A 110 111  ===== PAGE 58 ===== Appendix A 112 113  ===== PAGE 59 ===== Appendix A 114 115  ===== PAGE 60 ===== Appendix A 116 117  ===== PAGE 61 ===== Appendix A 118 119  ===== PAGE 62 ===== Appendix A 120 121 Appendix B – Drinking water quality data Table 1 2022-23 metropolitan Adelaide source water quality – inlets to water treatment plants (WTP) Parameter Samples Min Max Ave* Samples Min Max Ave* Anstey Hill WTP Hope Valley WTP Colour – true (456 nm) [HU] 12 14 94 44 12 10 60 39 Dissolved organic carbon [mg/L] 52 6.3 17.3 10.5 52 5.0 13.5 9.3 Fluoride [mg/L] 12 0.10 0.25 0.16 12 0.19 0.28 0.25 Hardness – total [mg/L] 13 87 106 98 13 112 167 146 Nitrate as nitrogen [mg/L] 26 <0.003 0.090 0.040 26 <0.003 0.216 0.055 pH [pH units] 12 7.3 7.8 7.5 12 7.9 8.4 8.1 Phosphorus – total [mg/L] 26 0.021 0.111 0.043 26 <0.005 0.061 0.030 Total dissolved solids [mg/L] 12 78 308 191 12 256 385 329 Turbidity [NTU] 12 6.9 110 45 12 1.1 3.6 1.9 Barossa WTP Little Para WTP Colour – true (456 nm) [HU] 12 13 54 35 7 27 58 42 Dissolved organic carbon [mg/L] 52 6.1 13.3 10.1 32 8.0 10.9 10.0 Fluoride [mg/L] 12 0.24 0.31 0.27 7 0.25 0.28 0.27 Hardness – total [mg/L] 13 82 95 90 13 106 137 124 Nitrate as nitrogen [mg/L] 26 <0.003 0.068 0.016 26 0.053 0.201 0.112 pH [pH units] 12 7.3 7.7 7.5 7 7.5 7.9 7.8 Phosphorus – total [mg/L] 26 0.009 0.050 0.018 26 0.016 0.069 0.034 Total dissolved solids [mg/L] 12 257 275 271 7 280 307 298 Turbidity [NTU] 12 0.34 2.2 1.2 7 3.8 14 8.0 Happy Valley WTP Colour – true (456 nm) [HU] 12 34 71 55 Dissolved organic carbon [mg/L] 52 7.6 12.3 10.3 Fluoride [mg/L] 12 0.22 0.27 0.25 Hardness – total [mg/L] 13 93 130 109 Nitrate as nitrogen [mg/L] 26 <0.003 0.215 0.066 pH [pH units] 14 7.1 8.2 7.8 Phosphorus – total [mg/L] 26 0.020 0.082 0.046 Total dissolved solids [mg/L] 14 217 302 270 Turbidity [NTU] 12 1.6 19 7.8 *Limit of reporting (LOR) values replaced with half LOR prior to calculating average.  ===== PAGE 63 ===== Appendix B 122 123 Table 2 2022-23 metropolitan Adelaide distribution system – customer tap water quality  against Australian Drinking Water Guidelines Parameter Health  guideline Aesthetic  guideline Samples Min Max Ave* % Compliance# Anstey Hill metro system Chlorine residual – free [mg/L] ≤ 5 -
