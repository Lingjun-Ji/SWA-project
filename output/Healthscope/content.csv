In Karen’s words: “This artwork tells a story representing the values of Healthscope and the importance  of community in the journey of care. The Boab tree represents healing, respect and individuality.   The Eucalyptus leaves are a representation of their use in Smoking Ceremony to welcome people and  their use as bush medicine to heal. Meeting circles represent both the community and the staff that  come together to provide care. The Journey symbol represents both the diversity of people who come  to Healthscope and the journey of their healthcare. The Rainbows are the symbol of hope.” CEO Message Together with the Healthscope Board, I’m delighted  to launch Healthscope’s ‘Innovate’ Reconciliation  Action Plan.  We launched our inaugural Reconciliation  Action Plan in 2019, setting out a framework to  develop our relationships with Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander communities across our 38  hospitals, setting out actions that we would take  to promote cultural awareness and strengthen our  partnerships with with First Nations people.   In early 2020, Healthscope, faced the challenge of  responding to the coronavirus pandemic, which  significantly impacted our operations and forced  us to pause several initiatives while we supported  the country’s Covid public health response.   Despite the challenges presented through the  pandemic years, we have continued to move  forward on our reconciliation journey. Our board  and executive leadership committees now perform  an ‘Acknowledgment of Country’ at the start of all  meetings and we recognise NAIDOC and National  Reconciliation Week across all our hospitals and  support offices. All our sites display artwork by  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artists. We’ve  partnered with Aboriginal artists Stan Yarramuna  and Karen Lee who provide cultural support and  insights to our corporate team.  Our Northern Territory hospital, Darwin Private  continues to partner with the Fred Hollows  Foundation to perform eye surgery for members  of remote communities. This year, Healthscope  has implemented cultural diversity and sensitivity  e-learning across our organisation which includes  a module on culturally safe healthcare for First  Nations people.   However, we know there’s still more to do.  Our “Innovate” Reconciliation Action Plan outlines  four key objectives to deepen our connection to  First Nations communities.  We will seek to build and establish relationships  with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  stakeholders and organisations and use our  influence to promote reconciliation and positive  race relations.    We’ll focus on increasing our understanding,  recognition and respect for Aboriginal and Torres  Strait Islander culture, history, knowledge and  rights through learning and observing cultural  protocols.  We’ll look to provide employment and economic  opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islanders both in our organisation and by actively  engaging Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  businesses as suppliers.  Finally, we’ll continue to build accountability and  transparency by reporting what we achieve through  this Reconciliation Action Plan as well as our  learnings and challenges.   I look forward to the opportunity to continue  our learning and reconciliation journey, using  our Reconciliation Action Plan as the framework  to guide us in a in our conversations with First  Nations peoples.  Greg Horan  CEO  Healthscope Operations  ===== PAGE 3 ===== Healthscope RAP 2024-2025 5 4 Healthscope RAP 2024-2025 Message from  Reconciliation Australia  Reconciliation Australia commends Healthscope on  the formal endorsement of its inaugural Innovate  Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP). Commencing an Innovate RAP is a crucial and  rewarding period in an organisation’s reconciliation  journey. It is a time to build strong foundations and  relationships, ensuring sustainable, thoughtful, and  impactful RAP outcomes into the future. Since 2006, RAPs have provided a framework  for organisations to leverage their structures  and diverse spheres of influence to support the  national reconciliation movement.  This Innovate RAP is both an opportunity and  an invitation for Healthscope to expand its  understanding of its core strengths and deepen  its relationship with its community, staff, and  stakeholders.  By investigating and understanding the integral  role it plays across its sphere of influence,  Healthscope will create dynamic reconciliation  outcomes, supported by and aligned with its  business objectives.  An Innovate RAP is the time to strengthen and  develop the connections that form the lifeblood  of all RAP commitments. The RAP program’s  framework of relationships, respect, and  opportunities emphasises not only the importance  of fostering consultation and collaboration with  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and  communities, but also empowering and enabling  staff to contribute to this process, as well.  With close to 3 million people now either working  or studying in an organisation with a RAP, the  program’s potential for impact is greater than ever.  Healthscope is part of a strong network of more  than 2,200 corporate, government, and not-for- profit organisations that have taken goodwill and  intention, and transformed it into action.  Implementing an Innovate RAP signals  Healthscope’s readiness to develop and strengthen  relationships, engage staff and stakeholders in  reconciliation, and pilot innovative strategies to  ensure effective outcomes. Getting these steps right will ensure the  sustainability of future RAPs and reconciliation  initiatives, and provide meaningful impact toward  Australia’s reconciliation journey. Congratulations Healthscope on your Innovate  RAP and I look forward to following your ongoing  reconciliation journey.  Karen Mundine  Chief Executive Officer  Reconciliation Australia Our vision for reconciliation Healthscope’s vision for reconciliation is a private healthcare system that embraces Aboriginal and Torres  Strait Islander peoples and non-Indigenous Australians, and embodies equity, acceptance and celebration  of our shared history. We aspire to be the best place for care and to work in Australian healthcare, delivering experiences that  make a difference every day. This means better care for all Australians, including Aboriginal and Torres  Strait Islander peoples who have unique healthcare needs. We want to deliver outstanding healthcare and  become an employer of choice for  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. Our business Healthscope is Australia’s only national private hospital operation and healthcare provider with a network  of 38 hospitals and Independence Services that service every state and territory. We create jobs for  approximately 18,000 people and provide work for as many accredited medical practitioners. Our people  are known for achieving exceptional clinical outcomes, transparent public reporting and positive patient  feedback that leads the industry. No matter the role, every day our people make a difference to the lives of  our patients and their families and it is a privilege to be part of their care. Distribution of our hospital sites  can be seen in diagram 1 below.  ===== PAGE 4 ===== 15 1 1 11 7 1 1 4 11 1 3 Healthscope RAP 2024-2025 7 6 Healthscope RAP 2024-2025 Our Healthscope Network Victoria 15  Private hospitals 11  Independence Services New South Wales 11  Private hospitals 1  Independence Service ACT 1  Private hospital Queensland 7  Private hospitals South Australia 4  Private hospitals Western Australia 1  Private hospital Tasmania 1  Private hospital Northern Territory 1  Private hospital 3  Independence Services Diagram 1: Healthscope Hospital site location About Healthscope We are committed to delivering industry leading quality of care for patients and services for doctors  through our hospitals. Each day, our staff and doctors provide care for thousands of patients in the  communities we serve, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.  In 2020/21, we treated 669,865 patients, delivered 13,044 babies and performed more than 414,000 surgical  procedures. Our success comes from working as a team, and our purpose, “we work together for better  care” was developed from a collaborative process involving staff members from across the organisation. Striving to be the best place for care and to work in Australian healthcare embodies the work our team of  dedicated staff, nurses and doctors do each day. Importantly, our purpose sets out what we aspire to do  better tomorrow, including providing more care to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. To date  this has been predominantly in the area of Ophthalmic surgery, working closely with The Fred Hollows  Foundation.  Healthscope has opportunity and desire to grow the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff  employed. Currently, 0.004% (38) of Healthscope staff have identified as Aboriginal and or Torres Strait  Islander people. One strategy to achieve this is to ensure we offer the opportunity for employees to self- identify as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the on-boarding process and via annual staff  surveys, as well as removing any barriers that may exist for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples  joining our organisation. Through the implementation of our first Reflect RAP in 2019 and the ongoing  commitment to acknowledging and respecting the histories and cultures of Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander peoples, more staff have come forward and self-identified. This is an indicator of a positive  cultural change within our organisation. Healthscope plans to continue to capture this information at point  of recruitment and via our annual staff survey for existing staff. Healthscope’s sphere of influence primarily involves the provision of private, compensable, Department of  Veteran Affairs and public honorary and relief health services in all Australian States and Territories. We  maintain relationships and responsibilities with regulators, governing bodies, administrators, clinicians,  workforce, patients, consumers, clients, communities and other stakeholders; such as the Fred Hollows  Foundation. We all work together to ensure good clinical outcomes and confidence that systems are in  place to ensure the reliability, safety and quality of health care.  ===== PAGE 5 ===== Healthscope RAP 2024-2025 9 8 Healthscope RAP 2024-2025 RAP Timeline 2019 Implemented an Acknowledgment of Country policy.  This policy sets the expectation that all events  and committee meetings will acknowledge the  traditional custodians of the land on which they  meet.  This practice has helped bring our Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander histories and heritage to the  fore of our business.  2020 Darwin Private Hospital partnered with Fred Hollows  foundation to restore sight to 17 Aboriginal people.  Jan 2021 The team at Norwest Private Hospital along with  NSW/ACT State Manager unveiled four beautiful  art pieces by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  peoples’ artist Karen Lee as a way of reaffirming the  hospital’s commitment to continued engagement  with their local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  people’s community. Local First Nations elder Graham Davis King held a  smoking ceremony for the artwork’s unveiling.  2021 Jarni McGuire, a Whadjuk, Ballardong and Yued  woman created an artwork titled ‘Healing’. This is  featured in plaques displayed at the entrance of  Mount Hospital to acknowledge and show respect  to the Traditional Owners of the lands, and our  boodja (country) and growth. Staff printed their  handprints on the artwork to acknowledge unity  and commitment to strengthen relationships  between community, land and the hospital. 2021 Nepean Private staff helped to run a COVID-19  vaccination clinic for Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islanders in Penrith, NSW. 2021 Nepean Private held a smoking ceremony on the  site of their redevelopment before construction  commenced in October 2021, led by Bigambul and  Dharug elders.  A smoking ceremony was also performed at the  official opening of the redevelopment in August  2023 by Shane Laws a Dharug elder.  2022 Healthscope’s Indigenous Recruitment Program  commenced at Gold Coast Private hospital, resulting  in the successful recruitment of four First Nations  staff into Assistant in Nursing (AIN) and other roles.  2022 Corporate Office Reconciliation Week morning tea,  with catering supplied by an Aboriginal and Torres  Strait island business, Pawa and attended by the  artist and musician Stan Yarramunua.   2022 A group of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  children visited Hunter Valley Private Hospital to  give a didgeridoo performance and present artwork  they had created.  2022 Katrina Amos, a First Nations woman with lived  experience, spoke at The Victoria Clinic’s 2022  NAIDOC week event. She has also created artwork  for the clinic that is displayed in the main entrance.  2022/23 Healthscope Independence Services in Darwin  supported clients to return to the remote  communities they come from. In addition to the  wellbeing benefits to clients, return to country  trips have provided the opportunity for our team to  deepen their understanding of  the importance of  kinship and community to our First Nations clients. 2023 Corporate office morning tea to mark Reconciliation  Week with a performance by Yorta Yorta man Stan  Yarramunua. The event was catered by Mabu Mabu  an Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander owned  business.  2023 A Cultural Diversity and Sensitivity e-learning  package, which includes a module on culturally safe  healthcare for First Nations people, was rolled out  across the organisation.   2023 The team at Ringwood Private Hospital supported  an indigenous community in WA, Jungarni Jutiya  Indigenous Corporation, by providing clothing  and accessories for their community’s NAIDOC  week ball. The team sent over 25kg of items to  enable community members to participate in the  celebrations. 2023 Knox Private Hospital invites Yakadi player and  Dharug man Kiernan Ironfield to perform at the  opening of Knox Private Hospital’s north tower.   ===== PAGE 6 ===== Healthscope RAP 2024-2025 11 10 Healthscope RAP 2024-2025 Our RAP As Australia’s only national private hospital group, Healthscope bears responsibility to help “close the gap”  in healthcare outcomes and well-being indicators for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples by 2033,  as detailed in the National Agreement on Closing the Gap.  This drove Healthscope to introduce its first Reflect RAP in 2019, and remains the driving force behind our  desire to work alongside Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to create stronger communities of  hope, wellbeing and unity for all, particularly in the area of vision. The gap in vision The gap in eye health outcomes and levels of access to vision services between Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander Australians and non-indigenous Australians is decreasing but remains significant.  •	 Blindness and vision loss is three times more  common among Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander adults than it is among other Australians  •	 Vision loss and blindness are the fourth largest  contributor (after heart disease, diabetes, and  road traffic accidents) to the health gap between  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians  and other Australians  •	 More than 90% of blindness and vision loss  experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander adults is preventable or treatable •	 Blindness and vision loss are more common  among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults  living in outer regional and very remote areas As seen in the Sunday Territorian newspaper article titled, “The Gift of Vision” acknowledging Healthscope  working together with Fred Hollows Foundation to restore sight for 17 Aboriginal People in December 2020.  Healthscope continues to grow this work with the Fred Hollows Foundation.  Healthscope’s General Counsel and Company Secretary is our national RAP Champion. Together with the  Reconciliation Steering Committee and the Diversity and Inclusion working group, the RAP Champion  has ensured that reconciliation remains on the Healthscope agenda with the support of the Board and  Executive. Some steps we have taken include the following:  •	 Board and Executive Leadership Committees  perform an “Acknowledgment of Country” at the  beginning of all meetings  •	 Chief Executive Officer (CEO) provides a  formal address to the business for National  Reconciliation Week and NAIDOC Week,  •	 First Nations catering companies were engaged to  provide morning tea for both weeks, •	 Ongoing relationship with Aboriginal artist Stan  Yarramunua who provides cultural support and  insight to our corporate team, and performs with  his digeridoo at events. To encourage participation  in these events outside of the corporate team,  we endeavour to capture and circulate digital  recordings of these events throughout the  organisation.  •	 Two First Nations members on the RAP Steering  Committee  •	 Development of a list of Aboriginal and Torres  Strait Islander suppliers and small businesses was  distributed to all hospital sites for the purchase of  gifts required throughout the year •	 Corporate and hospital based social media  acknowledgments of First Nations dates of  significance •	 Newsletter articles on Aboriginal and or Torres  Strait Islander activities across the organisation •	 First Nations information about each week was  added to menus and cards on meals service trays  at some hospital sites •	 Entrance foyer poster displays celebrating First  Nations dates of significance •	 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artworks  displayed in corporate main reception and all  facility foyers List of RAP Steering  Committee members •	 Chair: General Counsel and  Company Secretary •	 Secretary: Assistant Company Secretary •	 Coordinator:  National Manager Patient  Reported Experiences and Outcomes •	 Member: Director of Nursing Darwin Private  Hospital •	 Member: Senior Manager Corporate Affairs •	 Member: Assistant Director of Nursing –  Perioperative Darwin Private Hospital •	 Member: Support Services Operations  Manager, Norwest Private Hospital  •	 Member: National Manager Patient Reported  Experience and Outcomes  ===== PAGE 7 ===== Healthscope RAP 2024-2025 13 12 Healthscope RAP 2024-2025 Other Aboriginal and or  Torres Strait Islander Relations Stan Yarramunua, a local Indigenous artist who was commissioned to do the Healthscope national art work  which tells the story of Healthscope journey towards reconciliation to date; has become an ongoing support  for our business. He agreed to perform at our Welcome to Country at the 2023 National Reconciliation  Week’s morning tea at our corporate office, as well as to provide general advice when and as needed and  his time permits. Karen Lee, a Wiradjuri woman has been commissioned for four artworks at our Norwest hospital in NSW.  In addition, she has been engaged as a community liaison on our RAP Steering Group. All Healthscope hospital sites have been encouraged to have at least one Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander peoples consumer representative on one of their committees and to develop a site based  Reconciliation Engagement Plan (REP). The site based REP is to support implementation of the overarching  Corporate RAP and build on relations with local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The Quality  Manager at each hospital is the Aboriginal and or Torres Strait Islander champion.  Hospitals are also supported centrally by the National Cultural Diversity & Inclusion Committee (former  Reconciliation Team).  As part of Healthscope’s governing body, a member of the corporate Clinical Quality and Safety team has  been appointed to chair these meetings. The National Cultural Diversity & Inclusion Committee meets  quarterly and reports to the Corporate Quality Review Committee.  Refer Diagram 2 below. The purpose of this Committee is to discuss priorities to address specific health  needs of Aboriginal and or Torres Strait Islander peoples and implement and monitor strategies to meet  those needs. It is an opportunity to share how hospitals can develop meaningful, lasting relationships with  their local Indigenous community, how to redress past wrongs and move towards an equitable healthcare  system for all Australians. The continuing impacts on health and wellbeing are evident in the unacceptable  gaps between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and other Australians in health outcomes,  including infant and child mortality, disease burden, and life expectancy.  Board Executive Leadership Team RAP Steerco Clinical Quality and Safety National Cultural Diversity & Inclusion/ Team Diagram 2: Governance Structure for the National Reconciliation Team/Committee Key changes on our reconciliation  journey include: •	 Increased staff awareness of the cultural values  and beliefs, with almost 70% of staff having  undertaken cultural competency training for  best practice. Healthscope aims to have >90% by  the end of the current Innovate RAP September  2024. Negotiations are in progress with Aboriginal  and Torres Strait Islander Consultants who are  developing a tiered learning package tailored  to Healthscope’s needs. The tiered learning will  be appropriate to different designated work  groups across the business. For example, there  will be learning packages for clinical, non-clinical  support, admission and administrative staff. •	 Healthscope has an Acknowledgment of Country  Policy. This policy sets the expectation that all  events and committee meetings will acknowledge  the traditional custodians of the land on which  they meet. Prior to developing our first RAP, there  was no such policy and an Acknowledgment  of Country was not practiced. This practice has  helped bring our Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander histories and heritage to the fore of our  business.  •	 Appropriateness of Care policy in draft - This  policy aims to inform staff about the customs,  values and beliefs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander people’s in relation to their health. It  outlines how Aboriginal health is not just the  physical well-being of an individual, but refers to  the social, emotional and cultural well-being of  the whole Communities in which each individual  is able to achieve their full potential thereby  bringing about the total well-being of their  Communities. •	 NAIDOC and National Reconciliation Weeks are  key dates in the Healthscope calendar. These were  celebrated across the business in a variety of  ways. The difficulties of COVID may have stopped  some of the “face to face” activities planned  for 2021, however every part of the Healthscope  business managed to acknowledge and celebrate  these weeks either via virtual groups, screen  savers on all PC’s, poster and historic displays,  menus / meal service tray cards and social media  releases to name a few. The journey of developing  a RAP has seen the profile of Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander peoples and the cultures  and histories elevated to a level not seen within  our business previously.  •	 There has also been an organisation wide  emphasis on embedding the opportunity for  stakeholders to self-identify as being Aboriginal  and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Healthscope  front line staff have been provided with culturally  sensitive training, visual and written aids about  asking the question which has given them the  knowledge and confidence to explain the purpose  of why we ask. By implementing this training,  we hope to achieve a culturally safe way for  Aboriginal and Torres Straits Islander peoples to  self-identify and provide cultural safe care.   ===== PAGE 8 ===== Healthscope RAP 2024-2025 15 14 Healthscope RAP 2024-2025 •	 Identification policy in draft. Health service  providers will be required to establish processes  to accurately identify and record Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander status. These processes  should ensure that all people, regardless of  appearance and across all service areas, are  asked whether they identify as being of Aboriginal  and/or Torres Strait Islander origin. Our People  and Culture department are reviewing existing  anti-discrimination policies to ensure inclusion  of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander needs  to ensure Healthscope policies promote self- determination for Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander peoples across a range of social,  economic and health indicators. These include  exposure to racism across all domains of  contemporary Australian society with associated  harmful effects on their health and wellbeing.  •	 Prior to commencing our reconciliation journey,  no Healthscope policies incorporated the cultural  needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  peoples. Healthscope will consult with our  consumers (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders  and non-Indigenous Australians) to ensure  our people and culture polices are reflective  of the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander peoples and inclusive of all Australian  communities.  •	 Since developing the Reflect RAP, Healthscope  now chooses to engage Aboriginal and Torres  Strait Islander caterers for corporate functions.  There has been a palpable shift in the mindset of  our Executive and it is hoped this example from  the leadership group will flow through the entire  business.  •	 Procurement are also exploring additional  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander suppliers –  cleaning products is one example. A barrier for  procurement in the past has been related to cost  and the scale of supply required.  Hospital Highlights •	 The team at Norwest Private Hospital along with NSW/ACT State Manager unveiled four beautiful art  pieces by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples artist Karen Lee as a way of reaffirming the  hospital’s commitment to continued engagement with their local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  peoples community. •	 Acknowledging the Aboriginal land on which Norwest Private sits, and paying respect to Elders past,  present and emerging, Elder Graham Davis King held a Smoking Ceremony for the unveiling. •	 The General Manager met with the incredibly talented Karen Lee and together they explored Norwest’s  journey including their beginning, life, people and land. The project gave the team the unique opportunity  to recognise and celebrate the Traditional Custodians of the land on which Norwest sits. •	 Each of the four (4) pieces represent important elements of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  peoples, histories of the Hills district, the historic Bella Vista farm, the cultural diversity of our people,  doctors, partners, patients and families, and the natural environment on which our hospital stands.  The pieces are now on display in the hospital’s entrance foyer. Karen Lee and Elder Graham Davis King are  continuing their partnership with the hospital on this journey.  •	 John Fawkner Private Hospital Victoria has established excellent relations with the local Merri-bek Council  and sits on their Reconciliation Committee. This has fostered improved relations with local Elders who  have visited the hospital and provided input on a number of fronts, including establishing an Aboriginal  and Torres Strait Islander peoples mentor program, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples health  information packages and a monthly newsletter article to highlight a few of the initiatives underway at  John Fawkner. We look forward to continuing to deepen and improve this relationship. •	 We are currently exploring the opportunity to sponsor a nursing traineeship for Aboriginal and Torres  Strait Islander students. Healthscope currently has an Aboriginal nurse that took part in a nurse training  course for Aboriginal and Torres Straits Islander peoples in NSW. She has told us about her experience  and how grateful she was for such an opportunity.  ===== PAGE 9 ===== Healthscope RAP 2024-2025 17 16 Healthscope RAP 2024-2025 RELATIONSHIPS By building strong relationships between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and working  together, we can listen, learn and make a positive difference. As the only national private hospital provider  and operator of the largest private hospital in Darwin, Healthscope hopes to play an integral role in  improving health outcomes for Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. We also hope to  enrich and provide opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to gain employment,  develop professional skills and participate in the nation’s economy, while maintaining a continued  connection to Country. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures enrich the diversity of Australia’s  society, provides deep links into ancient cultural histories, offer different views to living in this country and  a wealth of stories. Healthscope aims to improve the cultural awareness and competency of our workforce  to better meet the needs of its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients and foster improved and  lasting relations with Aboriginal and or Torres Strait Islander peoples. Our relationship with Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander peoples would be mutually beneficial and will enable us to provide better care to  some of our most vulnerable patients.
