This report is the first of its kind for our organisation, as we find new ways to  communicate the positive change we seek to make, and share the impact of  our work on the lives of individuals and communities. The data and stories shared  in this report, reflect the work we have undertaken in the 2023-24 financial year.  OUR IMPACT  Long-term impact goals: Clients live well  on dialysis Improved health  outcomes – physical,  social, emotional,  cultural wellbeing Contribute to keeping  community, culture and  spirit strong More Indigenous  communities access  dialysis services on country Grow the next generation  of Indigenous health  leaders Care  for country PURPLE HOUSE SOCIAL IMPACT REPORT 2024 2  ===== PAGE 5 ===== Since the founding of Western Desert Nganampa Walytja Palyantjaku  Tjutaku Aboriginal Corporation (Purple House) more than two decades  ago, our mission has been to improve the lives of people with kidney  disease, reunite families and reduce the impact of the disease  in our communities.  The growing number of people from remote  communities in the Western Desert (Central  Australia) forced vast distances from home  to access dialysis treatment was the catalyst  for a success story grounded in First  Nations leadership, self-determination and  innovation. The creation of Purple House  in 2003 responded to the need to get  people home with family, to fulfil their cultural  obligations, pass on knowledge, and keep vital  connections to Country. 20+ years later Purple  House is getting people home on country through  the provision of permanent dialysis services in 20  remote communities across the NT, WA and SA,  with more on the way. Our model also includes a  welcoming, safe space and a responsive set of  culturally appropriate health and social support  services to look after people when they are in town.  OUR STORY Purple House is  recognised for its  unique model of care,  guided by the values  and priorities set by  our Pintupi Directors: “We will ensure that  Walytja (family), Tjukurrpa  (dreaming), Ngurra  (Country) and Kunnyi  (compassion) are central to  all that we do and say.” PURPLE HOUSE SOCIAL IMPACT REPORT 2024 3  ===== PAGE 6 ===== We help our people to maintain vital connections to  Country, culture, family and community.  Getting patients home through the provision of remote dialysis services  supports their health, wellbeing and spirit to stay strong. The longer-term  impacts are profound – important traditional knowledge and practices are  maintained by having the right people on country, at the right time to pass  on the legacy of the longest living culture on the planet.

As an Aboriginal community-controlled organisation we pride ourselves on strong Indigenous  leadership, guided by our Directors who are Pintupi Luritja people representing the Western  Desert communities who founded us. Purple House has created an environment which deeply  values and celebrates the cultural knowledge, lived experience and relationships brought by  our Indigenous staff.

PURPLE HOUSE SOCIAL IMPACT REPORT 2024 6  ===== PAGE 9 ===== I’ve been with Purple House  6 years now…I love the place!  I started as a Support Worker,  then moved up to Case Manager  and now I’m the Social Support  Coordinator. Purple House is  amazing with the environment  they’ve been able to create…  does a great job employing a lot  of Aboriginal staff who speak  language, it’s good for the staff  and the clients. Purple House  provides a lot of support – to be  able to work my way up knowing  that Purple House has their trust in  me…it shows other Aboriginal staff  that they can come along  that journey as well. Daniel Stone,  Social Support  Coordinator Staff profile Patient Preceptors Purple House Patient Preceptors work alongside dialysis  patients helping them navigate their kidney disease  journey. The Preceptors have lived experience of kidney  disease, dialysis, transplantation and the issues faced by  Aboriginal people accessing renal services. This makes  them a powerful conduit between community members  and the mainstream health system. They provide expert  advice and education to patients and their communities  and promote cultural safety through education and  advocacy with service providers. “Makes it easy when you’re someone  who is well respected. We respect every  community…not telling what to do but  listen first. Then see what we can do.”   Lachlan Ross, Patient Preceptor Staff profile I just love working here  because it’s Aboriginal owned  and controlled…supporting  the growth of the Aboriginal  workforce is a really important  thing. We know that when we have  local Aboriginal people working in  an organisation like this, providing  services for Aboriginal  patients, that’s best  practice.

It involves a coordinated effort across the organisation, from arranging transportation, accommodation,  and support staff, to coordinating with our remote dialysis and primary health care teams to secure the  necessary clinical approvals. Purple House offers various health promotion and exercise activities to  ensure our patients are healthy, strong, and mobile enough for these trips. Although the trips are brief,  they significantly impact the mental, physical, cultural, and spiritual health of our patients, as well as the  families who get to see their loved ones again.   RETURN TO COUNTRY 150+   patients and clients  participated in  Return to Country  trips in 2023-24 PURPLE HOUSE SOCIAL IMPACT REPORT 2024 8 Watch the video: Keeping  people healthy in town  ===== PAGE 11 ===== Patient story Patient story Elizabeth hadn’t been home for two years, and  this return to country trip in late 2023 was a  special one. The journey took eight days and  involved two staff members, along with countless  grandkids eagerly awaiting her arrival. Elizabeth  said that before the trip she was “coughing up… body felt sick and her body feels free and no  longer coughing”. She wants to stay home longer  and is working towards that, saying, “I want to do  physio”.  The trip included ceremonies, visits to  waterholes, a sorry camp, men’s emu dance and  women teaching dances to the kids. For our staff,  it was a privileged opportunity to witness living  culture while supporting a member of the Purple  House family. For Elizabeth, the impacts included  a visible improvement in her health, priceless  family connections and keeping her spirit strong. We transported Frances home, her sister had passed away and the funeral was in Kalkarindji. She was  in Katherine, so we picked her up…a nine-hour drive including stops. That return to Country was really  important for Frances to be with her family grieving during this sad time. She’s in a wheelchair, so us  being there with our bus and two staff members, we were able to transport her to the funeral and  around to visit family…they were very thankful! It was beautiful to see them all together. If she hadn’t  gotten back for that it would have really broken her heart.  She wouldn’t stop saying thank you…there  was a sense of recharge and an uplift.

Ngurra (Country) is at the heart of  everything we do, whether we’re getting  people home on Country or increasing  the sustainability of the way we work. Purple House has long been a leader and innovator in remote  healthcare and our work in this area continues to grow.  Dialysis is a water intensive treatment – a challenge  when you’re working in some of Australia’s driest regions,  in communities with some of the poorest water quality.  In response, Purple House has developed innovative  engineering solutions to ensure we can continue getting  people home on Country, while saving thousands of  litres of water through recycling.  A Coober Pedy gem At the back our new Coober Pedy dialysis unit sits the  product of an innovative engineering solution, designed  to clean and recycle water for dialysis treatments.  Biomedical Engineer Michael Smith, designed the  system to re-process water-waste so that it can be  safely re-used for dialysis treatment.  This is one of three sites piloting water-saving technology.

Renal friendly, fresh meals help to keep people strong and well. Sharing a  meal and catching up with friends and family in a culturally safe space also  has a powerful impact on social connection and emotional wellbeing. At our home base in Mparntwe (Alice Springs), Purple House provides a  nutritious daily breakfast and lunch for clients in town. Our remote Aged  Care sites in Yuendumu and Mt Liebig provide breakfast and lunch daily,  either enjoyed at the centre or delivered to a client’s home. Clients also  receive a weekly hamper of food for the weekend. We actively engage  our clients in menu design and seek feedback. This approach ensures  that meals are healthy and culturally relevant. HEALTHY FOOD Cooking on Country 28,909  HEALTHY MEALS  PROVIDED – in town and through  our remote aged care  services Cooking around a fire with friends and  family is a favourite activity. Clients like  to go on bush trips to cook up kangaroo  tails, damper and vegetables over  the fire. It’s another way we support  connections to Country, wellbeing  and time for knowledge sharing.  Cooking Group In 2024, Purple House clients started a  cooking group at our Social Enterprise  Hub. The recipes, selected by the  participants, are nutritious and made  with simple, accessible ingredients. The  impact has been increased confidence and skills  and greater capacity to make healthy meals for  their families. A recipe book resource is also being  developed for all clients.  Healthy Hearts Day During National Heart  Week we hosted a health  promotion event featuring  visiting health professionals.  Cardiologists shared about their  services, there was a hands-on dissection  of real lamb hearts, and the Renal Dietitian  helped patients cook roo-tail bolognaise.  Patients appreciated being able to ask  questions and share knowledge with their  families in a safe space, free from many of  the barriers of mainstream healthcare. 11 PURPLE HOUSE SOCIAL IMPACT REPORT 2024 Watch the video:   Bush foods  ===== PAGE 14 ===== In the early days, patients from  remote communities in town  missed the healing properties  of bush medicine and its  connection to Country, so  they began making it over  the fire in our garden.  This led to the creation of our social  enterprise, Bush Balm, which provides bush  medicine year-round for our clients at no  cost to them through our wellbeing program.  It has also developed a thriving retail and  wholesale business, reaching customers  nationally and internationally.  Bush Balm  celebrates and shares traditional knowledge  through its products and a bush medicine  demonstration program, reaching diverse  audiences and highlighting the value of  integrating traditional healing practices with  Western clinical services. The enterprise  also emphasises Indigenous employment,  with a team of local young women making  the balms and ensuring this traditional  knowledge is passed on.
