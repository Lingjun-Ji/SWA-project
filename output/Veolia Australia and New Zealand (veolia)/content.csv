What did you take away from it? Estelle Brachlianoff. Strong progress in all our businesses, especially  energy and water technologies; excellent financial and extra-financial  results; new commercial victories; new impetus and a new dimension  to the Group thanks to the integration of Suez: 2023 was another   record-breaking year for Veolia! Our financial results reflect this success.  Our revenue rose to €45.4 billion, a 9% increase. Our EBITDA is more  than €6.5 billion – it increased by 7.8%, exceeding our set target.  Our efficiency gains and synergies from the acquisition of Suez are both  ahead of our roadmap. Our current net income of €1,335 million has  doubled in five years. Our post-tax ROCE is 8.3%, two years after acquiring  Suez. But our success has also been extra-financial, with a Net Promoter  Score of 53 testifying to excellent customer satisfaction, and an exceptional  employee commitment rate of 89%. It can also be seen in the cubic  meters of water saved and tons of carbon avoided. Antoine Frérot. Veolia’s present success has been built patiently, year after year.  None of it has happened by chance: it comes from early strategic positioning  in an extremely promising market – that of ecological transformation –  combined with strict operational management and our employees’ creativity  and dynamism. Beyond 2023, what is your assessment of the recently concluded  Impact 2023 program? Estelle Brachlianoff. It has been a great success! All our financial targets  were achieved or outperformed. And we achieved practically all our   extra-financial targets. In four years, the Group has clearly changed in size  and prospects. It is more international, with 40% of its revenue generated  outside Europe, including $5 billion in the United States, and is in the top 3  in its businesses for all the countries key to its growth. It has gained in  attractiveness, visibility, and influence. It has emphasized its leadership,  becoming the global champion for ecological transformation. Antoine Frérot. To truly appreciate the value of Veolia’s performance, you  must consider the circumstances in which it was achieved. The past four years  have been marked by a series of crises: the coronavirus pandemic, the return  of inflation, war in Ukraine, volatility in the energy markets, and so on. And yet,  despite this chaotic background, Veolia has moved forward on a profitable  growth trajectory, demonstrating its ability to deal with crises, be they health,  economic, geopolitical or energy-related. “2023 was another  record-breaking  year for Veolia!  Our financial  and extra-financial  results reflect  this success.” ESTELLE BRACHLIANOFF ESTELLE BRACHLIANOFF Chief Executive Officer   of Veolia ANTOINE   FRÉROT Chairman of Veolia Joint interview   with 6 — INTEGR ATED REPORT 2023-2024 VEOLIA — 7  ===== PAGE 6 ===== Estelle Brachlianoff. After 170 years, Veolia is younger, stronger, and more  dynamic than ever! From its origin to the present day, it has retained a spirit  of excellence and creativity. Antoine mentioned the crises Veolia has overcome  during the last four years. When a company is 170 years old, its solidity,  resilience and agility are no longer in question. Our Group has seen its share  of headwinds and unfavorable conditions, not least recently, but they did  not keep it from growing or prospering. What are the general principles of your new GreenUp   strategic program? Estelle Brachlianoff. It’s a program to accelerate ecological transformation  in the face of growing worldwide demand. Decarbonization, depollution  and resource regeneration are among our municipal and industrial  customers’ priorities. These 3 issues alone represent a colossal market,  estimated to be worth a potential €2.5 trillion! With GreenUp, our objective is not just to offer our services in areas that  are already “green,” but also and above all to “green up” things that are  currently definitely not, by tackling environmental black spots. We want  to go where our efforts are most needed, that is, where greenhouse gas  emissions are largest, where pollution is most serious, where resources  are scarcest. For example, with the planned phasing-out of coal in  our electrical power plants in Poland, Germany, and the Czech Republic. The program will run between 2024 and 2027. It prioritizes three growth  drivers: local energy, to decarbonize using bioenergy and by improving  energy efficiency; new water solutions, to save and recycle this precious  resource; and hazardous waste treatment, to reduce pollution and  thus improve health and protect biodiversity. These 3 business areas,  which currently account for 30% of our revenue, will generate 70%  of Veolia’s growth over the next four years. This program will enable us to consolidate our main strongholds in Europe,  to continue our internationalization (especially in North America, the Middle  East, and Australia), and take advantage of new geographical opportunities. To do this, the Group will leverage its leading position in key countries and  businesses (and, of course, the combination of these), its diversified contract  portfolio, its culture of operational efficiency, and its close local relationships. Antoine Frérot. We will also draw on Veolia’s capacity for innovation, and  on our 14 research and development centers in particular. We will double  the investment budget for innovation in order to invent the solutions  of tomorrow. These include carbon capture and recycling, electric vehicle  battery recycling, treatments for new pollutants, and generative AI. With GreenUp, Veolia is articulating its ambition to be the company that  makes ecological transformation possible for regions, cities, and industries.  The company that can rapidly implement an ecosystem of solutions.  The company that forges the missing link in ecological transformation,  because it makes the connection between the demand for environmental  protection – which has never been so strong – and the offer of concrete,  affordable, high-impact, ready-to-go solutions. Your Group also celebrated its 170th anniversary in 2023.   What has that inspired in you? Antoine Frérot. Immense pride and immense gratitude. Immense pride  in the road travelled, because the small drinking water business formed  170 years ago in Lyon has risen to the rank of world leader in ecological  transformation. And immense gratitude to all the employees, each  generation of whom has brought the best of themselves to expand  and enhance our Group: we are the heirs of their vision, their work  and their inventiveness. By agreeing to leave a large part of the fruits of their labor and support  with the company, these previous generations provided a springboard  for the generations that followed to build higher and go further. Our  generation should naturally do the same, to help future generations  prove this company’s usefulness to the whole of society and celebrate  future anniversaries with the same success. “Decarbonization,  depollution and  resource regeneration  are among our  municipal and  industrial customers’  priorities. These  3 issues alone represent  a colossal market,  estimated to be worth  a potential €2.5 trillion!” ESTELLE BRACHLIANOFF 8 — INTEGR ATED REPORT 2023-2024 VEOLIA — 9  ===== PAGE 7 ===== “With GreenUp,  Veolia is articulating  its ambition to be  the company that  can rapidly implement  an ecosystem  of solutions, the  company that forges  the missing link  in ecological  transformation.” ANTOINE FRÉROT “Veolia’s biggest asset  is its employees,  with their expertise,  their involvement  and their enthusiasm  to be part  of transforming  the world!” ESTELLE BRACHLIANOFF Energy plays an important part in the GreenUp strategic program.   Can you tell us more about that? Estelle Brachlianoff. Energy occupies a central position in ecological  transformation as an area open to decarbonization and a business that  already represents €12 billion in revenue for Veolia. We have set ourselves  extremely high targets for 2030 in this area: to become number 1 in heat  networks in Europe; to become number 1 in energy efficiency services in  Europe and the Middle East; and to increase our capacity in bioenergies  and renewables by 50% to 8 GW. Our strategy for this is to harness unused  low-carbon local energy and improve energy efficiency. What is low-carbon  local energy? This is energy produced from non-recyclable waste,  wastewater and sludge from treatment plants, waste heat from factories,  residual cold, etc. In total, our Group has decided to invest €4 billion by 2030  in harnessing this currently untapped energy potential. Antoine Frérot. Our energy, water and waste businesses are not separate  – they intersect, and they nourish and stimulate each other. Where these  three types of activity intersect is where growth will be strongest, and also  where our geographies and our customer portfolios coincide. What is Veolia’s main asset for implementing this GreenUp program? Estelle Brachlianoff. If I had to single out one asset, I would say Veolia’s  employees, with their expertise, their involvement, and their enthusiasm  to be part of transforming the world! Our employees’ commitment  is the Groups’ energy. The internal survey we carried out last November  emphasized that 89% of them feel committed. This is higher than in  comparable companies and a legitimate source of pride and confidence  for our company. Antoine Frérot. Our confidence in the ability of our Group to reach these  targets is also based on its achievements. What has it accomplished  over the last few years? As Estelle pointed out, it successfully concluded  its ambitious Impact 2023 strategic program along with the merger  with Suez, while outperforming the targets set. There is no reason it  shouldn’t be the same with this new program! 10 — INTEGR ATED REPORT 2023-2024  ===== PAGE 8 ===== A TRANSFORMED  GROUP … like the successful trajectory of the Impact  2023 program, despite multiple unexpected  shocks. What is the recipe?

Despite this,  Veolia was able to successfully complete its Impact 2023 strategic program. The Group  has proved its ability to bounce back, successfully merging with Suez to become the  global champion for ecological transformation, fully equipped to face a world under- going brutal crises and profound changes. 2022 AT VEOLIA…   AND IN THE WORLD January Integration of Suez teams and  businesses begins to create the global  champion for ecological transformation. March The Russian invasion of Ukraine begins,  creating tensions in the energy market and  a return to inflation for most of the world.   The EU’s 27 leaders agree to gradually reduce  their dependence on Russian fossil fuels.   Launch of the ReSource Plan, which aims  to reduce the Group’s energy consumption  by 5% while increasing its production of green  energy by 5%.

November At COP26, Veolia  presents its adaptation and mitigation  solutions for reducing its customers’ carbon  impacts. These will be packaged in the  GreenPath Zero Carbon solution in early 2023. 14 — INTEGR ATED REPORT 2023-2024 VEOLIA — 15  ===== PAGE 10 ===== Veolia’s ecological transformation plan, with  its purpose acting as a compass, enabled the  Group not only to withstand every crisis, but to  resist and bounce back. Rigor, agility, and boldness…   the keys to success The recipe for success has three main ingre­ dients. First, clear strategic choices, driven by  the Impact 2023 program, based on rotating  assets to finance additional growth; consoli- dating businesses such as hazardous waste  treatment and plastics recycling, and reducing  or exiting others such as construction or facility  management; and a constant focus on quality  of execution. Next, an ability to react to crises,  illustrated by the adoption of a series of adap- tation plans: Recover and Adapt, launched in  April 2020, and allowed the Group to return to  2019 pre-Covid earnings in just six months;  ReSource was implemented from March 2022  onward to reduce the Group’s and its custom- ers’ energy consumptions by 5%, and increase  its green energy production by 5%, in two years.  And, lastly, the decision, in the middle of a  global crisis, to acquire the 29.9% stake in Suez  that Engie had decided to divest, and subse- quently launch a public takeover for the rest of  the business. With that, Veolia embarked on a major change  in scale that now makes it the preferred part- ner for meeting the challenges of ecological  transformation. In terms of results, practically  all targets – financial and extra-financial – in  the Impact 2023 program were achieved, if not  outperformed (see page 29). The measurement  of multifaceted performance has also become  a key element in managing the Group. Veolia-Suez: synergies  in full operation Just two years after integrating the first Suez  businesses, the operation is a great success.  This confirms the Group’s initial conviction  that it had a decisive advantage for bringing  the operation to a successful conclusion:  two extremely similar business cultures with  similar outlooks on the business and its future.  From the earliest months, commitment indi- cators proved revealing: record numbers of  both new and existing employees subscribed  to the Sequoia 2022 employee share owner- ship scheme, and this was corroborated  by Sequoia 2023. Toward the end of 2023,  the internal Voice of Resourcers survey revealed  that 82% of respondents said they were  ­confident of the Group’s capacity to achieve  its goal of becoming the champion for ecolo­ gical transformation. On the commercial  side, this integration manifested in more inno- vative solutions  and enhanced global  ­products and services. In financial terms, the  expected synergies of €500 million over four  years are well ahead of schedule, reaching  €315 million by the end of 2023 (against a tar- get of €280 million). A strong local presence: the  bedrock of an “antifragile” leader Over these last four years, Veolia has been able  to rely on its globally managed multi-local  operational model, a real asset when naviga­ ting crises and their social, economic, and poli­ tical consequences. Aware that, acting alone,  it would not be able to create the best possible  ecology of solutions, the Group has sought out  allies in a bid to strengthen its local presence.  By working with all stakeholders at the heart  of every region, all around the world, in a  healthy local dialogue, the Group can achieve  its ecological transformation ambitions.—  THREE FRUITS OF CROSS-FERTILIZATION The merger with Suez has accelerated  Veolia’s change in scale, positioning  the Group favorably for a number of  flagship contracts. •	In Switzerland, where regulations  around treated wastewater quality and  micropollutant discharge are some of  the strictest in the world, the combination  of VWTS ozone treatment technology  and VWT nitrogen removal and wastewater  treatment technologies has optimized  the elimination of micropollutants in an  effective and economical process. •	In Hong Kong, where teams from Veolia  and its partner China State Construction  were able to build a relationship of trust  with the Environment and Ecology Bureau,  the two entities have been appointed to  manage the West New Territories (WENT)  resource regeneration project. •	In France, a wastewater reuse project  for the Sud Roussillon federation of  communities is the fruit of a spontaneous  cooperation between two business units  (BUs) on either side of the border: Agbar  in Spain and Veolia Water France. IMPACT 2023   DELIVERING   ON COMMITMENTS Nothing unfolded as expected but, despite numerous twists and turns, Veolia was able  to adapt, react and seize opportunities to conclude its Impact 2023 strategic program  in line with its commitments and delivering on its ambition to become the reference  company for the ecological transformation. IMPACT 2023 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE LEVERS •	The hazardous waste business is booming,  having expanded from €2.5 billion to  €4.2 billion in four years, with a Capex  of €500 million currently assigned to the  construction of new factories that will  bear fruit in the next program. •	District heating and cooling networks  in Europe are performing well, serving as  shields against energy price volatility,  becoming sources of improved efficiency,  and accelerating the transition away from coal. •	The traditional businesses of municipal  water and solid waste are showing  resilience, thanks to the Group’s efficiency  plans and synergies. Water technologies  have been particularly successful in  the exit from construction and are again  profitable and ready for a phase of  stronger growth. 16 — INTEGR ATED REPORT 2023-2024 VEOLIA — 17  ===== PAGE 11 ===== VWTS/VWT World leader in water  technologies EUROPE No. 1 in municipal water No. 1 in solid waste No. 1 in hazardous waste No. 2 in heat networks No. 2 in energy efficiency  for buildings UNITED KINGDOM No. 1 in solid waste SPAIN No. 1 in municipal   water POLAND No. 1 in heat   networks GERMANY No. 2 in solid waste MIDDLE EAST Joint no. 1  in municipal water Joint no. 1   in hazardous waste No. 1 in energy efficiency  for buildings UNITED STATES No. 1 in municipal  water O&M No. 3 in regulated water No. 3 in hazardous  waste CHILE No. 1 in   municipal water No. 1 in hospital  waste CZECH REPUBLIC No. 1 in municipal  water and  industrial water AUSTRALIA No. 1 in solid waste No. 1 in municipal  water CHINA No. 1 in industrial  water management No. 2 in municipal water No. 2 in heat   networks JAPAN No. 2 in plastics  recycling No. 2 in municipal  water FRANCE No. 1 in municipal water No. 1 in hazardous waste No. 2 in solid waste 2023 HIGHLIGHTS AROUND THREE STRATEGIC PILLARS Decarbonization Operation and maintenance of the  country’s first waste-to-energy plant  in Istanbul, the largest in Europe •	 1.1 million metric tons of   non-recyclable household waste  converted into energy annually •	 560,000 MWh of electricity  produced annually •	 1.5 million metric tons CO2 eq.  avoided annually(1)  A biomass-gas power plant entered  operation in Braunschweig to replace  the old coal-powered installation •	 800 GWh of heat produced •	 25% of green electricity generated •	 50% carbon footprint reduction Implementation of a pioneering  cold energy recovery solution to  produce low-carbon local energy  in the Port of Barcelona •	 131 GWh of local, low-cost,  environmentally friendly energy  produced annually •	 42,000 metric tons CO2 eq.  avoided annually Depollution Integrated waste management  for the Gold Coast, Australia’s   second-largest local authority •	 5% increase in household and  organic waste recovery rate by 2025 •	 90% guaranteed methane  capture rate •	 77,000 metric tons CO2 eq.  avoided annually Construction began on an electric  vehicle battery recycling plant •	 Hydrometallurgical extraction of  copper, nickel, cobalt and lithium •	 Treatment capacity of 20,000 metric  tons annually Acquisition of two hazardous waste  treatment plants at the Al-Ruways  complex in Abu Dhabi •	 70,000 metric ton annual  treatment capacity •	 Maximized recovery of resources  (oil and water) from oil and gas  industry waste Resource efficiency and regeneration Public drinking water distribution  service for Lille Métropole •	 10% reduction in water  extractions over 10 years •	 65 million m3 conserved over  the contract period Operation of the La Mé drinking  water treatment plant, one  of West Africa’s largest drinking  water production facilities •	 240,000 m3 of drinking water a day,  enough to meet the daily needs  of 2.4 million people in Abidjan Design, construction and operation  of the extension to the West  New Territories (WENT) resource  regeneration site in Hong Kong •	 Up to 90 million metric tons   of non-recyclable waste treated  over the next 20 years •	 90% guaranteed methane capture  rate 10 million metric tons CO2 eq.  of emissions avoided over 20 years (1) Official evaluation carried out by İSTAÇ/IMM. A LEADER WORLDWIDE As its Impact 2023 strategic program comes to an end, Veolia has changed dimensions:  now more international, it is the world leader of the ecological transformation, with  essential services businesses ready to depollute, decarbonize, and conserve and  ­regenerate resources to protect the environment and safeguard human health. Thanks  to its transformative merger with Suez, the Group is now one of the top three companies,  in each of its business lines, in every key country where it operates.

Changes to the Board of Directors One key event in 2023 was the departure of Louis  Schweitzer, who, as Vice-Chairman of the Board  of Directors and Chairman of the Nominations  Committee, played a decisive role in moderniz- ing the way the Board operates. Senior Director  Maryse Aulagnon has taken over as the new  Vice-Chairwoman of the Board of Directors.  Pierre-André de Chalendar succeeds Louis  Schweitzer as Chairman of the Nominations  Committee, and Antoine Frérot takes his place  as Chairman of the Purpose Committee. First full year   of separate governance On March 14, 2023, at an executive session  specifically dedicated to assess the adoption of  separate governance, the Board of Directors  unanimously praised the working relationship  between the non-executive Chairman and the  Chief Executive Officer. Seminar on the Group’s  2024-2027 strategy In December 2023, all directors attended a sem- inar dedicated to the 2024-2027 strategic pro- gram. On the agenda were: a presentation of  the program’s aims; an analysis of the geopo- litical, economic, political, financial, social,  techno­logical, and competitive context; a study  of key concerns; and a detailed review by busi- ness and by region. Participants were then  given a financial summary of the program and  its quantified aims for other elements of multi­ faceted performance, in particular the proposal  to accelerate the Group’s decarbonization trajec- tory and how to secure its implementation.

The Committee produced a  shorter version of the purpose together with  a headline, and it has since been widely distri­ buted (see page  28). The Committee also  worked hard to simplify the multifaceted per- formance framework to make it easier to take  on board, proposing to align it with the three  pillars of the new strategic program: decarbo­ nization, depollution, and resource efficiency  and regeneration. COMPOSITION OF THE  EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE The Executive Committee  is a forum for discussion,  consultation and decision- making on general policy,  and its role is to implement  the Group’s major strategic  directions. It is composed  of 14 members. Changes to the Executive Committee The Executive Committee is a forum for discus- sion, consultation and decision-making on  ­general policy, and its role is to implement the  Group’s major strategic directions. It is composed  of 14 members representing all Veolia’s geo- graphical zones. In 2023, the Executive Committee saw the  appointment of Anne Le Guennec, the new  Senior Executive Vice President, Worldwide Water  Technologies Zone. In addition, responsibility for  the Italy and Africa/Near and Middle East Zone  is now shared between Laurent Obadia for the  Africa/Near and Middle East Delegate Zone and  Helman le Pas de Sécheval for Italy. Multifaceted performance sponsors Veolia’s multifaceted performance commit- ments apply to all activities in all countries,  where they are closely monitored. To ensure  representation and oversight, each objective  benefits from the support of a sponsor on the  Executive Committee. All these assignments  were reviewed when multifaceted performance  targets and indicators were defined in connec- tion with the GreenUp strategic program. — BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ COMMITTEES   AS AT DECEMBER 31, 2023 ACCOUNTS AND  AUDIT COMMITTEE 6 members 100% independent 97% attendance rate NOMINATIONS  COMMITTEE 4 members 75% independent 100% attendance rate PURPOSE   COMMITTEE 6 members 80% independent 100% attendance rate COMPENSATION  COMMITTEE 5 members 100% independent 100% attendance rate RESEARCH,  INNOVATION  AND SUSTAINABLE  DEVELOPMENT  COMMITTEE 5 members 100% independent 100% attendance rate UNIVERSAL  REGISTRATION  DOCUMENT 2023 Including the annual financial report For more  information,  see the Universal  Registration  Document 2023. 22 — INTEGR ATED REPORT 2023-2024 VEOLIA — 23  ===== PAGE 14 ===== Risks and opportunities Issues such as climate change, scarcity of resources,  pollution, threats to biodiversity, health and safety,  and consumer protection are driving growing  demand from our stakeholders for solutions  to protect their health and preserve the planet,  its climate and resources.

MISSION   ACCOMPLISHED At the end of four years of the Impact 2023 strategic program, practically all of its 18 multi­ faceted performance targets have been achieved. Committed to building an ecosystem ­of  alliances with its stakeholders, Veolia is well on the way to meeting the ambitious challenge  it set itself: to become the reference company for the ecological transformation. This is enshrined in the Group’s purpose.  To take its stakeholders’ expectations more  fully into account in creating and sharing  value, Veolia designed its Impact 2023 strate- gic program around multifaceted performance,  organized into five categories – commercial,  environmental, human resources, social, and  economic and financial  – with 18  related  objectives. Four years later, almost all have  been achieved or outperformed. Recycled  ­plastic volumes and diversity are the only indi- cators not to have reached their respective  targets, despite clear improvement through- out the period. Financial and extra-financial  requirements in alignment Multifaceted performance was managed  ­subject to robust operational governance, with  an Executive Committee sponsor and a perfor- mance officer for each objective, and a network  of almost 100 purpose officers responsible for  its implementation. The Group includes multifaceted performance  indicators (climate, diversity, access to essen- tial services, and circular economy/plastics) in  the variable compensation calculations for  16,000 of its employees, with financial criteria  representing only 50% of the criteria.  SUCCESS FOR VEOLIA’S PURPOSE  IN ITS SHORTER VERSION Four years on from adopting its purpose,  Veolia decided to complement the  initial text with a shorter version  to make it easier for employees to  take ownership, more clearly highlight  its key elements for all stakeholders,  and accelerate its take-up. Launched  to mark World Environment Day,  the “Ecological transformation, that  is our purpose” campaign achieved  particularly high engagement rates.  These excellent results were later  confirmed by the 2023 Voice of Resourcers  survey: 70% of the 122,000 respondents  were familiar with the Group’s purpose  (up 11 points compared with 2022),  and 93% believe they contribute to it  on a daily basis. 28 — INTEGR ATED REPORT 2023-2024 VEOLIA — 29  ===== PAGE 17 ===== Interview JEAN-MICHEL SEVERINO Chairman of the Critical   Friends Committee VEOLIA’S ESG PERFORMANCE LEADERSHIP RECOGNIZED IN EXTRA-FINANCIAL RATINGS Recognized in the most selective stock  market sustainability indices and  by ESG scoring organizations noted  for the quality of their analysis,  Veolia is keen to contribute to evolution  in the methodologies used, which,  to remain relevant, must take detailed  account of the specific challenges  in each of a company’s business sectors. To make these assessments even more  representative, Veolia advocates the  inclusion of scope 4: greenhouse gas  emissions erased for third parties compared  with other existing solutions, currently  a blind spot in environmental ratings.  This scope would allow recognition of the  efforts some organizations are making  to decarbonize the economy. The Critical Friends Committee celebrated its ten-year anniversary in 2023. Which of the Committee’s discussion topics have been most striking for you? Jean-Michel Severino. Among the more recent topics, how to articulate the  Group’s purpose and defining the multifaceted performance measurement  framework were both the focus of intense and meaningful discussions. I could  also mention more specific themes such as phasing out coal or Veolia’s  climate strategy. And, of course, the challenge of aligning the merger with  Suez with the Group’s purpose. What have you learned from the four years implementing  multifaceted performance? J.-M. S. I have a lot of admiration for the route Veolia has taken. None of that  was a foregone conclusion or easily achieved! I’ve seen the company mature  and progress in its convergence of financial and extra-financial performance.  Achieving such an ambitious goal without compromising on financial  requirements is a complex matter. This maturity is the result of the past  ten years, during which Veolia has experimented and learned the lessons from  successes and failures alike, on an environmental as well as a social level.  Additionally, the social aspect of the next strategic program is clearly  qualitatively superior and has been formalized in a way that would not  have been possible even five years ago. What exactly do you expect from Veolia in its 2024-2027 strategy? J.-M. S. I think that Veolia’s ability to reconcile the social and the environmental  will be absolutely essential to the success of its new program. The requirement  for environmental quality has an impact on people’s lives, making things more  difficult and costly. Take water scarcity, for example, which poses problems of  both quantity and quality. Net-Zero Water is an appropriate ambition for  our warming world. But, if its implementation makes water more expensive for users, new inequalities  will be created. Veolia therefore faces the challenge of delivering even better  environmental services in access conditions that the population can cope with. Increased dialogue  with local stakeholders The multifaceted performance model at the  heart of its purpose ensures Veolia’s sustainable  long-term growth while creating solid relation- ships of trust with its stakeholders. In 2021,  Veolia empowered this collective intelligence,  capable of accelerating the ecological transfor- mation, using an innovative “+1, for an ecology  in action” methodology. The method has now  been rolled out at BUs, contract, and project  ­levels: these are the “+1 in action” initiatives, the  first practical applications of which include “+1  Arianeo”, which opens up contract governance  to stakeholders (Métropole Nice Côte d’Azur),  “+1 employee representatives” in support of  social dialogue, and “+1 Inspire 24-27” to ensure  stakeholder input into the GreenUp strategic  program. Veolia intends to maintain the link  with the original collective of around 50 stake- holders to continue the conversation around key  ecological transformation issues. — (1) These highly selective indices only rate the most advanced companies in terms of sustainability within each business sector  (the top 10% of the 2,500 largest multinational companies from the S&P Global Broad Market Index™ for the World Index, and the top 20%  of the 600 largest European companies from the S&P Global Broad Market Index™ for the Europe Index).

MULTIFACETED  PERFORMANCE  PROGRESS  REPORT 2023 THE HEART OF VEOLIA’S  MULTIFACETED PERFORMANCE  THE CRITICAL FRIENDS COMMITTEE Since 2013, Veolia has been  supported by a Critical Friends  Committee. This space for  collective reflection allows  external observers to offer their  viewpoints on strategic topics  in relation to the Group’s  corporate responsibility, in  order to foster and support its  drive for continuous progress.  The committee is composed  of independent experts in  human resources, social, and  environmental issues, who  are drawn from institutions,  the academic community,   non-profit organizations, and  company partners. “I’ve seen Veolia mature and  progress in its convergence  of financial and extra-financial  performance.” Stock market sustainability indices: inclusion  in the DJSI (Dow Jones Sustainability Indices)  World and Europe(1), the FTSE4Good Index Series  and the CAC 40 ESG index S&P Global: No. 1 in the Multi and Water Utilities(2)  sector, rated “Top 1%” in the Sustainability Yearbook  2024, CSA score of 83/100(3)  ISS-ESG: “Prime” rating, top 10% in the Multi-Utilities  sector, scored B(4) Moody’s Analytics: 72/100, leader in  the Waste and Water Utilities Europe sector   (average score in the sector is 53/100) CDP Climate Change: “Leadership” rating,   scored A– CDP Water Security: “Leadership” rating, scored A– EcoVadis (2022): 75/100, 98th percentile (i.e. top 3%) VEOLIA — 31  ===== PAGE 18 ===== An expanded portfolio  to accelerate transformation The merger with Suez has added momentum  to Veolia’s growth thanks to an expanded port- folio of solutions and projects. This includes original solutions that can be  duplicated and adapted across the Group (see  box), such as wastewater reuse in Spain,  Jordan, Morocco and California. Additionally, an improved network and  enhanced coverage of local markets has been  a factor in the densification of businesses  –  waste in Australia, hazardous waste in  Europe,  etc.  – and commercial synergies:  the contract to manage resource regeneration  facilities for the West New Territories in  Hong Kong; and Turkey’s first waste-to-energy  plant in Istanbul. This makes for a unique portfolio thanks to its  linking of technologies for strategic industries  such as microelectronics/pharmaceuticals,  strategic metals, and wastewater treatment. A single entry point for  water technologies The merging of the VWT and VWTS water  technology portfolios has heightened  Veolia’s impact in major markets around  the world. Operating in the same geographical areas,  they also complement one another in terms  of business areas: wastewater reuse, drin­ king water, micropollutant treatment,  ­effluent recycling, ultrapure water for light  industry, and lithium extraction from eva­ porative crystallization of brines for heavy  industry, with a standardized approach to  supporting key accounts such as Exxon,  BASF, Intel, Nestlé and GSK. The aim is to  provide a single entry point, whatever the  customer’s needs. Hazardous waste,   a buoyant market Veolia’s hazardous waste treatment and reco­ very solutions continue to prosper all around the  world, having surpassed the 2023 target of  €4 billion in revenue. This activity remains a  ­priority for the Group, with challenges that  include consolidating its leadership position in  North America, Europe, and Asia. In the  United States, its record-breaking performance  is ­primarily due to the favorable reindustriali- zation context, which is conducive to rate  increases and a good mix of waste treated.  This is a dynamic that Veolia hopes to repro- duce in Japan, where the Group recently  acquired two local SMEs. Veolia also stands  out due to its innovative solutions. As the  European leader in recycling end-of-life bat- teries, its hydrometallurgical demonstrator  project was selected for the “France 2030”  investment plan. This advanced technology  can recover the lithium, nickel and cobalt from  used batteries in a sufficiently pure state to  be reused in new batteries. This is enough to  meet the stringent requirements of the new  EU Battery Regulation. The Group also conti­ nues to consolidate its position as the strate- gic partner for ecological transformation,  particularly in the Middle East, where, in 2023,  changing regulations enabled  THE INCREASING IMPACT OF NEW “COPY & ADAPT” SOLUTIONS Following the project to regenerate and sell  recycled plastics under the PlastiLoop brand  in 2022, Veolia has continued its worldwide  rollout of innovative solutions in 2023. Its  GreenPath Zero Carbon package is a collection  of 100 solutions drawing on the Group’s  expertise across its three business activities.  It provides the ideal foundation to help  customers accelerate their decarbonization.  The future solutions to be rolled out in “copy  & adapt” mode are already in place around  the Group’s three strategic priorities: •	decarbonization: alternative energy  production (RDF, biogas), waste heat  recovery, solar panel installations on Group  and customer sites, electricity flexibility; •	depollution: treatment of micropollutants  and pesticide residues in water; •	resource efficiency and regeneration:  wastewater reuse, zero liquid  discharge (ZLD), recovery of strategic  metals (nickel, cobalt and lithium)  from used batteries and from effluent,  plastics recycling.

Customer feedback as  a performance indicator Customer focus – one of the major priorities  of Impact 2023 because it is essential to  anticipating necessary changes to solutions  and practices – means regularly evaluating  customer satisfaction. Veolia has chosen  the Net Promoter Score (NPS) approach, a  refined analysis methodology developed at  the local level, where it is the easiest to  understand and identify customers’ propen- sity to recommend the company and its  ­services. Customers are allocated to one of  three ­categories: promoters, passives, and  detractors (see box). For 2023, our NPS rose  to  53  (from  48 in 2022), in line with our  ­target of over 30. The proportion of revenue  covered by impact studies remains stable at  82%, exceeding the Impact 2023 target of 75%  despite the enlarged perimeter due to the  integration of Suez. Digital innovation in support  of our businesses Veolia is boosting the marketing of its solu- tions and customer-focused culture, using  artificial intelligence to optimize its operations  and meet the demands of decarbonization  and the circular economy. The Group’s most  recent worldwide solution, the Hubgrade by  GREENPATH  ZERO CARBON: OVER 100 SOLUTIONS  FOR A SUSTAINABLE  DECARBONIZATION MODEL Thanks to its complementary expertise  in energy, water and waste recovery, Veolia is  positioned across the entire decarbonization  value chain. With GreenPath Zero Carbon,  Veolia is able to offer local authorities,  manufacturers and tertiary-sector companies  solutions for reducing their direct and indirect  greenhouse gas emissions, upstream and  downstream of their value chain. Based on  operational audits, and using environmental  impact calculators, Veolia can co-design  and implement roadmaps for its customers,  furnishing them with the most appropriate  solutions to reduce the carbon footprints  of their businesses, optimize their energy  efficiency, provide low-carbon supply  sources, optimize their recycling, create  local green energy loops, and even reuse  their wastewater. it to acquire two hazardous waste treatment  plants – for incineration, physical-chemical  treatment, radioactive waste, etc. – belon­ ging to ADNOC Refining, the United Arab  Emirates’ national oil company. Its move into  Al-Ruways, the region’s largest industrial  complex and site of the Middle East’s largest  oil refinery, has more than doubled Veolia’s  hazardous waste activity in the region. Becoming the world’s  largest depolluter These new additions join the 54 factories  – including 35 from the acquisition of Suez –  integrated between 2019 and 2022. Today,  Veolia is the undisputed market leader,  ­present on every continent, with a solid base  from which to become the most depolluting  company in the world. This base has three  strong pillars: in Europe and the United  States (contributing €2.2 billion and €1.3 bil- lion in revenue respectively), and now the  NPS AND THE EXECUTIVE  CALLBACK PROGRAM To understand and win over detractors,  Veolia launched the Executive Callback  Program initiative. Under this program,  a manager calls every customer that has  expressed dissatisfaction in order to  understand their reasons and deal promptly  with their concerns. The initiative is still being  rolled out, but is already achieving great results. In the United States, having left the  comment “Not sure that Veolia is the right  choice,” accompanied by an NPS of 2, one  customer had been deemed lost at the end  of the contract term. The Veolia team   worked hard to rebuild the relationship  and better understand their dissatisfaction,  which related to power plant operations.  The effect of this was quantified in the 2023  survey, with an NPS of 7, along with the  observation “For water treatment, Veolia  would be a good partner” and a request  to extend the contract, which had been  due to expire in 2024. Veolia range of digital services (see box on  page 36), perfectly illustrate Veolia’s ability  to provide digital solutions as ways to  ­manage the production and consumption of  water, energy, and waste. AI is also making  inroads into selective waste sorting with  Veolia’s Portik project, a solution based on  the latest cloud technologies. Implemented  in  September  2023 at the ultra-high-­ performance next-generation sorting center  in Bègles, France, Portik assesses the quality  and purity of the waste stream exiting the  industrial sorting process.  8 innovation hubs  on 3 continents. 1 innovation e-learning course  available in 13 languages. 34 — INTEGR ATED REPORT 2023-2024 VEOLIA — 35  ===== PAGE 20 ===== A culture of innovation inside  and outside the company In the context of ecological transformation,  innovation is also finding its way into business  models and the concepts of value, social equity,  and accessibility. Wastewater reuse for cities,  agriculture, and industry is just one example.  The technologies exist, but the barrier to  implementing this innovation is the lack of  social acceptance of its use in agriculture, and  even more so for drinking water. By cooperating  with stakeholders, Veolia is identifying all the  questions being asked in the regions (What  matters to them? What are the different  expectations?) in order to include and answer  them during the innovation process. To enable  every employee to better identifying and roll  out innovation opportunities, whether incre- mental or disruptive, Veolia has created a  “school of innovation” – Innov’Academy. ­ In 2023, the academy focused on creating  workshops aimed at spreading a shared under- standing of innovation and raising awareness  of the four key behaviors and actions that  encourage innovation. It also designed training  courses on the Design Thinking method, aimed  at managers and innovation project leads,  along with innovation e-learning available in  13 languages and introduced to all BUs to  encourage assimilation. Veolia also created eight innovation hubs to  foster links between its various geographical  zones. This ecosystem-based approach to  innovation allows the Group to target its  research and duplication topics more precisely.  In North America, for example, the Group  worked alongside local startups, providing  open access to its expertise and helping  them ­develop innovations in the field of water  treatment (see box). — OPEN INNOVATION CREATES GROWTH To anticipate trends, and discover and  maintain original solutions that enhance  its own solutions and accelerate their  rollout, Veolia is establishing programs  and collaborations with external partners: •	IMAGINE H2O (United States and Asia):  building solutions to water problems  with the world’s best entrepreneurs; •	Greentown Labs (United States):  North America’s largest climate tech  startup incubator; •	Industrial Liaison Program (United States):  multinational industry’s most  comprehensive portal to MIT resources; •	Go Seeds (Spain): a Veolia program providing  startups with access to the Group’s resources  to trial their technology and benefit from  mentoring and our network of in-house  experts. The ultimate aim is for Veolia  to validate their technical solutions and  become one of their first customers; HUBGRADE  BY VEOLIA MAKING AN ALLY OF AI The Smart City Expo World Congress 2023,  in Barcelona, provided a launchpad for  the new Hubgrade by Veolia range of digital  services. This tool for ecological evolution  had already been used within the Group for  several years, but only internally until then  – there are now more than 60 Hubgrade  centers in 20 countries – and it is far more  than just a digital performance solution.  What makes it so special? It combines the power of digital and  advanced artificial intelligence with  the Group’s expert knowledge in the fields  of water, waste, and energy to provide  a real boost to ecological transformation. •	U-Start (Germany): a Veolia accelerator  program for startups specializing in clean  technologies, launched in 2016 to promote  cooperation on the circular economy,  climate action, and resource preservation; •	Incubateur HEC Paris (France): a program  providing custom support to startups,  enabling entrepreneurs to rapidly  consolidate their business models and  position their technologies on the market. “+1” – what the  stakeholders said “Our challenge is to make a  structural change. To break  the habit of taking baby steps  in policymaking. Successful  ecological transformation  requires disruptions in the  ways products and projects  are designed. We need  to create and develop these  disruptions together.” Pascal Berteaud, Director General,  Cerema, France “There are two main  challenges: making people  aware, and convincing them  to seek out the technical and  human potential available  to us.

Accelerating   our carbon trajectory In response to the climate emergency, Veolia  has embarked on an ambitious trajectory tar- geting Net-Zero Carbon by 2050. In support of  this, the Group has reaffirmed its commitment  to invest €1.6 billion in phasing out coal in  Europe by 2030, with more than €500 million  already injected since 2019. This project to  ­onvert its coal-powered energy production  assets to use lower-carbon and more local  energies has already benefited district heating  networks in Braunschweig (Germany), Přerov  (Czech Republic), and Poznań (Poland). Thanks to its unique position in the energy  value chain, the Group’s expertise provides the  missing link in local decarbonization for all its  municipal and industrial customers worldwide,  in a market worth an estimated €500 billion. With an investment of €4 billion by 2030,  Veolia hopes to harness more than 400 GWh  of untapped local energy reserves: bioenergy,  energy produced from the water cycle, residual  heat and cold, larger and more efficient dis- trict heating networks, more energy-efficient  ­buildings and industry, etc. PUBLICATION OF THE FIRST VEOLIA CLIMATE REPORT Having signed up to the Science- Based Targets initiative (SBTi)  Business Ambition for 1.5 °C  campaign in 2021 and submitted its  targets for validation in December  2023, the Group is committed to  a trajectory of Net Zero by 2050. The Group has also defined a key  milestone for 2032, with the target  of reducing its scope 1 and 2 emissions  by 50% and its scope 3(1) emissions  by 30% from 2021 levels. This ambitious  but realistic climate strategy is set out  in the first Veolia Climate Report.

Performance in water networks With many regions facing severe droughts and  growing investment needs in response to new  regulations or health challenges, the climate  emergency has prompted Veolia to move its  model toward compensation based on value  rather than volume. For example, in 2023, the Group renewed its  contract to supply water to the 66 communities  that make up Lille Métropole (France) for a  ­further ten years.

In a first for France, it stipulates  that Veolia must reduce water consumption by  10% throughout the contract’s duration. Also in  France, the Group is involved in the launch of  the “Éco d’Eau” scheme, the first collective  action for preserving this precious resource.  From elected officials to consumers and net- work operators, everyone is playing their part.  Some 600 communities – representing more  than 3 million people – have already joined  “Éco d’Eau”, as have nonprofits, NGOs, busi- nesses, schools, and media organizations.

In the  same spirit as Net-Zero Carbon, Veolia is com- mitted to Net-Zero Water, which means put- ting back as much water as we take for  human activities. One of the effective  responses, treated wastewater reuse (REUT  – Reuse of Treated Wastewater), is one of the  technologies in which Veolia is proficient and  can offer to its customers. In keeping with  environmental and public health needs, these  processes produce water of appropriate  ­quality for each use, helping to reduce con- sumption. This is a technology whose time  has come, as regulatory obstacles begin to  dissolve – the European regulation that came  into force in June 2023 shows clear intent to  promote REUT as an alternative to drinking  water for agricultural irrigation in all member  states, and, in France, four decrees to facilitate  REUT for a wider range of uses have been pub- lished since mid-2023. On course for Net-Zero Water In response to the growing challenges of  water availability and quality all over the  world, Veolia will be investing $1.5 billion a  year in infrastructure and technology, as well  as in research and innovation, in 52 countries,  to improve access to water and sanitation,  and reduce the water footprints of their cities  WASTEWATER   REUSE AT THE HEART OF THE  JOURDAIN PROGRAM In late 2023 in Sables-d’Olonne, as part  of the Jourdain Program, the Vendée Eau  association opened France’s first wastewater  reuse (REUT) unit for the indirect production  of drinking water. Veolia attended the opening  as the designer, builder, and operator of  the facility at the heart of this pioneering  program. Its ambition is to provide a  complementary resource to produce drinking  water in the Vendée and prepare the region  for possible summer water shortages. This Veolia-designed refining plant is a  concentration of innovation using Barrel™,  the Group’s patented low-pressure   reverse-osmosis technology. Its process of disinfection using UV  irradiation and chlorination ensures fresh  water production in compliance with every  applicable quality standard. During  the demonstration phase (2024-2027),  this facility will facilitate the reuse of up  to 500,000 m3 of water – equivalent  to 15,000 people’s consumption – with  the aim of quadrupling this volume in  the longer term. 76.4% efficiency rate of drinking  water networks in 2023.  With this rate, Veolia has  been far outperforming  the Impact 2023 target since  2021, and is going further  in reducing the pressure on  conventional resources with  the rollout of alternative  solutions such as REUT. and industry. This commitment, undertaken  at the United Nations Water Conference in  March  2023, makes the Group a major  ­contributor to achieving 13 of the UN’s  17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  This significant investment comes with four  priorities. These include sustainable mana­ gement of water resources and improved effi- ciency in the drinking water networks that  Veolia operates to further increase total out- put; and wider rollout of REUT technology on  a global scale in order to rapidly deploy this  tried-and-tested solution where it can help  address water shortages. The solutions  already exist, but, to massively duplicate them  across every region, it is essential that all key  players –  governments, local authorities,  NGOs, and private enterprises – are united  and act together. Accelerating plastics recycling Veolia is spearheading materials circularity, in  part through its PlastiLoop solution, the first  integrated platform for circular polymers,  which is supported by a vast worldwide net- work of business experts and plastics recy- cling plants. Veolia further increased its  capacity with its acquisition of the Spanish  group La Red and now has 38 plants. Despite  this, the Group did not meet its 2023 target  40 — INTEGR ATED REPORT 2023-2024 VEOLIA — 41  ===== PAGE 23 ===== of 610,000 metric tons a year of plastic waste  recycled worldwide. This was primarily due to  an unfavorable market environment. The price  of recycled materials is indexed against that of  virgin raw materials – including the currently  extremely volatile price of oil. The drop in the  price per barrel in 2023 caused the price of  ­virgin oil-based PET to crash by a third to €600  per metric ton. The capacity is in place, but the  markets are not there yet. Renewal of the Group’s  biodiversity commitment The preservation of natural environments and  biodiversity is one of Veolia’s multifaceted per- formance objectives. Since 2020, the Group has  rolled out protection and enhan­cement plans on  the 114 sites worldwide identified as the most  sensitive in terms of environmental quality or  the activities taking place. The Group has a range  of tools and ­solutions in this area: biodiversity  footprint measurement based on life-cycle  ­analysis, an ecological site management guide,  a “zero-phyto” charter, e-learning courses to raise  biodiversity awareness for all employees, and, of  course, nature-based solutions (see box on  La Marjal), including for managing the large  water cycle. The progress rate for these action  plans reached 85% by the end of 2023, easily out­ stripping the Group’s target of 75%. Veolia now  aims to make this experience in biodiversity  management available to its customers for their  industrial sites. Also in 2023, Veolia performed a systematic  ­analysis of the impacts and dependencies on  biodiversity of its activities and value chain, in  line with its commitment to incorporate  Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures  (TNFD) recommendations in its publi­cations  from 2024 onward (2023 URD). — “+1” – what the  stakeholders said “We are all aware of planetary  issues. But we have a problem  with understanding the  diagnosis and with listening.  The challenge is to create  multifaceted perspectives to  share a better vision and a  better understanding of the  problems that connect us all.” Pierre-Emmanuel  Reymund, Delegate Director   of Regional Partnerships  and Innovations,  Toulouse Métropole “Faced with this crisis, we  must work together and share  our vision to foster collective  thinking and find concrete  solutions. We must not ignore  the weak signals that are  actually very clear warnings!”  Emma Haziza, Hydrologist, and founder  and president of Mayane 85% progress rate of action plans  for protecting and enhancing  natural environments, far  surpassing the target of 75%. ACT4NATURE STRENGTHENING THE GROUP’S  BIODIVERSITY STRATEGY In January 2024, Veolia renewed its  commitment to the Act4nature International  initiative for the period 2024-2027. It has  set itself objectives in line with previous  commitments, with targets that are more  ambitious or more closely align to the Group’s  biodiversity strategy with the international  frameworks created at COP15 or the  requirements of the CSRD. The Group has introduced a number of other  new initiatives, including a goal of zero  deforestation by 2027, the inclusion of an  on-site biodiversity management solution in  its commercial offerings, greater incorporation  of biodiversity in its purchasing criteria,  the definition of a replanting target covering  all its “sensitive” landfill sites, and a target  of 1.5 billion cubic meters of fresh water a year  saved (though wastewater reuse, desalination,  and leak reduction) by 2027. LA MARJAL SPAIN’S FIRST FLOODABLE  URBAN PARK Created on the initiative of Aguas de Alicante  – a joint venture between Veolia’s Spanish  subsidiary and the local council in Alicante –,  La Marjal meets a vital need: to protect  the city from severe floods while also  regenerating biodiversity and contributing  to local people’s health and wellbeing.  Designed to resemble natural Mediterranean  wetlands, this park is home to four types  of indigenous plants, with two ponds built  around a retention basin. Two collectors  in the flood-prone areas gather rainwater  and channel it into the ponds. Responsibility  for operating and maintaining the park are  shared between the local council (gardening,  irrigation systems, landscaping, cleaning,  security, and social activities) and Aguas de  Alicante (water quality, algae control, pumps,  rainwater inlet control, and the management  of ornithology centers). 42 — INTEGR ATED REPORT 2023-2024 VEOLIA — 43  ===== PAGE 24 ===== Now being rolled out across all our geographies VEOLIA CARES Employee benefits for all Resourcers Contact your HR manager to learn more THERE IS A PLACE WHERE ALL OUR EMPLOYEES CAN HAVE EMPLOYEE BENEFITS THE ENTIRE WORLD PARENTAL LEAVE HEALTH COVER DEATH BENEFITS VOLUNTEER’S DAY SUPPORT FOR CARERS Resourcing the world HUMAN RESOURCES PERFORMANCE MORE UNITED Committed ambassadors… At the conclusion of the exemplary merger that took  place in 2022, all Veolia’s human assets came together to cement a shared cultural  identity within the Group. And they now need to assimilate the skills needed for  ecological transformation and the consolidation of Veolia’s health and safety culture. A collective more  committed than ever Now fully operational, the Group’s teams are  all strongly engaged and aligned with its  ­ecological transformation ambitions, and  there are two clear proofs of this. The first  is  the 2023 results of the annual Voice  of  Resourcers survey, where new Veolia  employees showed an excellent overall  engagement rate of 89%, equivalent to the  2022 level. The participation rate reached a  record high level of 79%, 7 points higher than  in 2022. This significant increase in the num- ber of respondents (almost 122,000, com- pared with 114,000 in 2022) backed up the  engagement rate, which remained at  the above-mentioned extremely high level  of 89%. Similarly, confidence in the Group’s  capacity to achieve its goal remains solid  at 82%. The other marker of employee com- mitment was the success of the Sequoia  2023 employee shareholder scheme. The  scheme was available to 190,000 employees  in 49 countries, and almost 79,000 – close to  42%  – of them subscribed. As every year  since 2018, Sequoia confirms Veolia’s ambi- tion to closely involve its employees with  the development of their company and its  value creation. Universal social benefits Convinced that collective strength, solidarity,  and inclusivity are essential to meeting  the challenges of ecological transformation,  in 2023, the Group launched the Veolia Cares  program. Implemented across every geo- graphical region, this program has been  hugely successful both internally and in  terms of public opinion (in the media and  across social networks). Having since been  added to the HR Essentials, Veolia Cares pro- vides the Group’s 218,288 employees with a  social protection framework in every country  where it operates – each with its own dis- tinct legal and cultural background, includ- ing where there is no legal requirement for  such provision. Unprecedented in its scope,  this is a powerful expression of the Group’s  commitment to multifaceted performance. The program also drives engagement, which  is already extremely high among Veolia  employees. This is amply illustrated by the  increasing impact of the Resourcers for  Communities citizen engagement program,  launched in 2022 (see page 50).  VEOLIA CARES SOCIAL PROTECTION FOR ALL In response to geographical disparities  in social protection in the environmental  services businesses, Veolia rolled out  the Veolia Cares program globally on  September 1, 2023. Some of its strongest  measures include: ten weeks of maternity  leave and one week of coparenting leave,  which apply to every couple regardless  of their sexual orientation, support  for employees caring for loved ones, and  health and bereavement cover.

This safety  culture continues to evolve across the Group and,  in 2023, enabled it to achieve its target of a lost  time injury frequency rate below 5 (at 4.95). Ecological transformation  requires the right skills Veolia’s training offer is evolving to support its  employees with the skills they need for ecolo­ gical transformation. Throughout 2023, the Veolia Academy organ- ized workshops with zones and BUs to help  them identify training levers for meeting skill- set development needs. These include new  online resources exclusive to Veolia, covering  topics such as data, cybersecurity and genera- tive AI, innovation, hazardous waste, local ener- gies, GreenPath Zero Carbon, introduction to  planetary boundaries, etc. Not forgetting the  environmental awareness courses in partner- ship with LinkedIn Learning and Climate School.  And, because a solid knowledge base is crucial  to grasping the urgency of environmental issues  and incorporating ecological transformation  into our day-to-day work, two in-person work- shops – the Ecological Transformation Fresco  and the “2 tonnes” serious game workshop – are  being organized in numerous entities interna- tionally (see box). “+1” – what the  stakeholders said “Veolia’s purpose is now  understood and shared by all  its employees in Asia. So much  so that I never have to explain  what CSR or sustainable  development mean. Everyone  understands that they are  a source of values essential to  our business.” Aurore Yang, Purpose Officer,   Asia-Pacific Zone, Veolia “Veolia does extremely  interesting work consulting its  employees and stakeholders  about how they can  contribute to ecological  transformation and what  they can bring to the table  based on their knowledge,  skills and experience.” Luis Fredy Sosa Quintero, Quality Management   Department Director,   University of Boyacá,  Colombia 27.2% Diversity rate among Executive  Resourcers, a group that includes  around 500 employees at grade  16 or above, up two basis points  in 2023 (compared to the end  of 2022). Diversity and inclusion,   a rising index Diversity, gender identity, disability, and social  and ethnic origin are the four pillars of Veolia’s  Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) action plan, which  is supported by a network of representatives of  all the Group’s geographical zones, who, in  2023, gathered for their first international con- gress. This was an opportunity to discuss the  role of the Group’s D&I policy in its multifa­ ceted performance and to explore the action  levers to be implemented for each of the four  pillars. Several initiatives to promote diversity  took place in 2023, including another Yes  WEDO Week event on March 8, on the theme  “For an inclusive digital world: innovation and  technologies for gender equality.” In all, more  than 200 initiatives were identified thanks to  the 50 entities that took part. To mark International Day of Persons with  Disabilities and also one year since Veolia  signed the ILO Global Business and Disability  Network Charter, around a thousand emplo­ yees joined an online webinar on the theme of  neurodiversity in the workplace. To reflect  Veolia’s support for the United Nations’ five  LGBTI standards of conduct, the Group organ- ized a webinar to raise awareness of LGBTI+  people’s experiences in the workplace and  made three dedicated e-learning modules  available to Group entities. — RAISING AWARENESS OF OUR BUSINESSES’  CARBON FOOTPRINT Launched in 2022, the Ecological  Transformation Fresco went from strength  to strength in 2023. More than 5,000 Veolia  employees attended this workshop, with  250 subsequently asking for training to  run it themselves. The “2 tonnes” workshop  is a collaborative serious game in which  participants must activate the correct  levers to build their low-carbon transition  scenario for 2050. This fun and educational  workshop helps participants understand  the individual and collective actions that  can significantly reduce our carbon footprint.  It was offered to all Group entities, and, in  2023, 45 facilitators ran 95 sessions, with  a total of 940 people taking part. Rollout  of the workshop continues to gather pace,  particularly in the United States. THE “ZERO   ACCIDENT TARGET – A CHOICE” The International Health and Safety Week  again attracted huge employee involvement  in 2023, with a new element: the involvement  of external stakeholders (subcontractors,  temporary staff, customers, etc.), to continue  building a solid partnership in this area and  make progress along the Group’s trajectory  toward “zero accident”. Since 2019, Veolia  has emphasized the need to change behavior  to make workplaces safer and healthier.  This year’s theme of “Safe Reflex” ties in with  this approach, with the aim of raising awareness  of the unconscious errors that can arise from  dangerous habits and cause accidents, in order  to better handle and counteract them. 4.95 Lost time injury frequency rate.  Veolia improved its frequency  rate in 2023, passing under  the target threshold of 5.0 set  by the Impact 2023 program. 46 — INTEGR ATED REPORT 2023-2024 VEOLIA — 47  ===== PAGE 26 ===== SOCIAL PERFORMANCE MORE USEFUL As a simultaneously global and local Group, Veolia has deep roots in the regions where  it operates and offers responsible local support. Whether providing essential services or  contributing to public health and improving living conditions for local populations, the  Group innovates and forms alliances with all stakeholders to cobuild useful, high-impact  initiatives – innovative models for relationships and value creation. Improved access   to essential services To ensure sustainable access to essential ser- vices for the most vulnerable populations and  develop solutions to meet local challenges,  Veolia engages with local authorities, its part- ners, and its customers. The inclusive support  mechanisms available to the Group can be  financial, relating to the price of water (social  pricing), help with paying bills (payment  plans, debt forgiveness, water voucher  schemes, etc.), or alternative supply solutions.  Since 2020, Veolia has worked to better under- stand decentralized water access systems,  which can supplement the network in many  areas, including in suburban zones. One such  project was implemented in some rural areas  of Cambodia not connected to the drinking  water network, alongside several partners: the  startups Tergys and GreenCitizen, the NGO  1001fontaines, and the Veolia Foundation. The  project’s objectives were to improve access to  high-quality water and decarbonize its pro- duction through the development of a new  “kiosk” model. This combines UV ultrafiltra- tion, solar energy, and digital tools to improve  access to drinking water for 100,000 people.  The project launched in November 2023 and  will be completed in the first half of 2024. This  pilot will open up the exploration of other  decentralized access projects in other geo- graphical areas. Ethics and compliance:  no performance without trust Ethics and compliance are a natural and  perfect fit with Veolia’s focus on responsi- bility and usefulness. More than that, they  BU/entity, Veolia behaves ethically and in  compliance with regulations (up 3 points  from 2022), and 80% would be comfortable  with raising an alert over any fraud or cor- ruption suspicions (up 2 points from 2022). Regional activity with  a multiplier effect The Utopies study of the 2022 business year  carried out in 2023 was able to quantify the  effects of Veolia’s activity beyond its direct  impacts (employment and value added by  the Group).

We have to know what they  think and how they think.” Phil Carbins,  General Manager Business  Development, Veolia  Australia & New Zealand These flows rose sharply in 2023 (see graphic  and box), largely as the result of a particular  macroeconomic context – namely, the effect  of incorporating Suez businesses in many  countries and BUs in 2022, which contributes  in large part to the 40% payroll increase  between 2021 and 2022. The study shows  that the Group’s spending is massively rein- vested in the countries where it operates: 86%  of purchases are made locally. It should be  noted that, in France, this dynamic primarily  benefits SMEs, which represent 74% of  Veolia’s suppliers. Developing employee  engagement with local charities With the local services that it delivers, but also  through its local installations and employees,  Veolia is a major contributor to regional dyna- mism and plays a full part in local ecosystems  in connection with the various stakeholders.  It is precisely to facilitate its employees’ direct  engagement with local nonprofits that the  Group developed its citizen mobilization pro- gram, Resourcers for Communities. Trialed in  VERSO BY VEOLIA, MAKING SENSE OF TRANSFORMATION  LIKE NEVER BEFORE An easily accessible environment for scientific  exploration, the Group’s new YouTube  channel answers questions, from the simplest  to the strangest, on every “green” topic. Aboard a 100% electric Veolia truck, three  influencers and popular scientists take  to the road to meet the Veolia experts,  customers, and partners working every  day for a more sustainable world. With its  three types of content – “Scientifacts”,  “Wait – let me explain” and “Under way”,  the channel is particularly popular with  schools and the media. VEOLIA’S SOCIOECONOMIC FOOTPRINT IN 2023 Terra Academia,   a coalition of stakeholders Backed by Veolia and its economic, academic,  public, and nonprofit partners, this school for  ecological transformation is organized in a  regional network of campuses, the first two of  which opened at the beginning of 2024 in  Arras and Paris, France. Terra Academia pro- vides short-form training courses and modular  study aimed at young people, particularly  those with qualification-based training in  green professions; at professionals active in, or  retraining with the skills for, the ecological  transformation and shortage occupations; at  entrepreneurs, executives and managers; and  at elected officials and local public service  directors. An initial course to introduce young  people to ecological transformation profes- sions has been available since January 2024  with the employment services in Arras, and the  first iteration of the training program to help  entrepreneurs incorporate environmental  issues into their business models will run in  Paris and Arras in spring 2024. Promoting dialogue with the public To inform, analyze, decipher, spark debate,  encourage dialogue – Veolia has created a  social media ecosystem to help the greatest  number of people understand and take on  board the crucial issues in relation to ecolo­ gical transformation. Following the Culture  Green program of weekly quizzes on the eco- logical transformation and its solutions,  which launched in 2021 to inform and enter- tain (web app, quiz game, etc.), and Up to Us,  an Instagram account created in 2022 to bring  together English speakers aged 18 to 40 (40%  of the target in the United States), in 2023,  the Group started its own YouTube channel,  Verso by Veolia, aimed at people aged 18 to 34  (see box). — According to the Utopies 2023  study, Veolia’s activities  supported 1,561,629 full-time  equivalent (FTE) jobs, that is  a multiplier coefficient of 8:  for every direct job with Veolia,  7 jobs are supported in the  economy. Veolia activities  created €77.4 billion in added  value, that is a multiplier  coefficient of 3.4: for every  €1 of added value that Veolia  creates, an additional €2.40  is generated in the economy. several pilot entities in France and Morocco, it  is now being rolled out across France, inclu­ ding at the headquarters in Aubervilliers. This program creates a framework for all  those volunteers keen to take on social and  public-interest missions based on the themes  of environment and inclusion, and helps turn  ideas into action via a dedicated platform that  publicizes the needs of local nonprofit orga­ nizations. Separately from this initiative,  mobilization is now possible in every Group  BU through the Veolia Cares policy (see  page 45). In 2023, this amounted to 3,500 FTE  employees mobilized and 1,400 actions carried  out with more than 700 partners worldwide.

This healthy position  helps assure the Group’s long-term future and its capacity to invest and continue  to act for the benefit of all its stakeholders. 2023   another record year For the seventh consecutive year, Veolia is  posting results that illustrate strong,  above-target growth: €45,351 million in reve­ nue (up 9%), EBITDA up 7.8%, and current net  income up 14.9% to €1,335 million, double  the 2018 value. This uninterrupted growth reflects not only  the Group’s resilience and ability to adapt,  but also its sound positioning in the boom- ing ecological transformation market.  Demand for Veolia’s services has never been  so high, with a full and still-growing order  book worldwide for Water Technologies  alone – up 12.1% to €4,700 million – show- ing that water scarcity and quality have  become key issues for towns and cities as  well as for industry. The Group has also been  relentless in its pursuit of efficiency, with  €389 million of savings made, along with  benefits from the acquisition of Suez in the  form of €168 million of cost synergies, well  above target for the year. demanding multiple criteria defined by  Brussels. Focused on climate in 2021 and  2022, from 2023, the taxonomy also covers  water resources, the circular economy, pollu- tion prevention, and biodiversity. This allows  a more complete illustration of all the  Group’s environmental contributions,  for example through hazardous waste treat- ment, water reuse, and the quality of the  water output from its wastewater treatment  plants. Scrutiny of Veolia’s activity in 2023  shows that investment rates that are eligible  and aligned with the taxonomy are respec- tively 75% and 44.5%. This is well above the  rates corresponding to the current revenue  and reflects the priority accorded to ecolo­ gical transformation in the investment  choices being made.  ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE €26,010 million €415 million 6.4% 57.9% of Veolia’s   revenue eligible for the  European taxonomy The green taxonomy confirms Veolia as a  highly significant contributor to ecological  transformation, with 57.9% of its 2023 reve- nue corresponding to activities that contri­ bute strongly to the European Union’s  environmental objectives. Of these so-called  “eligible” green taxonomy activities, those  considered sustainable represent 40.2% of  the Group’s total revenue, or, in other words,  more than two-thirds of its eligible activities.  The operating conditions for these satisfy the  €45,351 million €1,335 million 8.3% Annual Annual €1,000 million €942 million €1,683 million Annual +14.9% Strong growth in Veolia’s current  net income (Group share) to  €1,335 million, clearly surpassing  the 2023 performance target. 2023   REVENUE SHARE BY OPERATIONAL SEGMENT Veolia’s 2023 revenue increased by 9.0%  compared with 2022, at constant scope  and exchange rates.

ANALYSIS OF 2023 REVENUE ACCORDING  TO GREEN TAXONOMY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Veolia is now able to analyze financial flows according to ESG criteria, at the level of its  20,000+ local operations. The €45,351 million in revenue from 2023 was therefore scrutinized  using a digital application called Green Grideo, which places this complex system within  the reach of operational teams at business-unit level. The result: 40.2% of 2023 revenue  is sustainable according to the taxonomy’s climate requirements, i.e. more than two-thirds  of eligible climate activities. VEOLIA SHARE CAPITAL BREAKDOWN   BY NUMBER OF SHARES (as at December 31, 2023)   A GROUP SUPPORTED BY A SOLID  BASE OF EMPLOYEE SHAREHOLDERS Available to 190,000 employees in 49 countries,  the Sequoia 2023 employee share ownership  scheme, launched in September of that  year, attracted 79,000 subscribers, an uptake  rate of almost 42%. The total of around  €22 million invested (lever included) led  to an issue of 10,027,792 new shares, equivalent  to 1.4% of total stock, increasing the stake  held by employees to 7.5%. Offered annually  since 2018, the Sequoia employee shareholding  operations illustrate Veolia’s ambition  to closely involve its employees with the  development of their company and its  value creation. CSRD ENHANCING THE TAXONOMY Following the introduction of the green  taxonomy, the European Union is scaling up  extra-financial reporting for businesses.  Applicable from the 2024 fiscal year onward,  the Corporate Sustainability Reporting  Directive (CSRD) represents a significant  step forward in making environmental, social,  and governance (ESG) information a new  pillar of corporate economic performance.  With the aim of standardizing extra-financial  information and preventing greenwashing,  it introduces a new requirement to report  and verify standardized sustainability  information. It also creates a strong connection  between financial and extra-financial  status. This change, which further enhances  the taxonomy, resonates with Veolia, which  has been working for many years to align  its activities with its purpose and multifaceted  performance, and, from 2024, with its new  GreenUp strategic program. The CSRD  therefore presents the Group with a remarkable  opportunity to construct an educational  framework around its added value and to  plan its medium-term strategy. for  some hazar­dous waste, which are crucial  to managing pollution risks all around  the world. — 1.5% OF REVENUE FROM ACTIVITIES  VEOLIA IS PROPOSING    for the next extensions to the taxonomy’s  scope (hazardous waste landﬁll, RDF from  non-recyclable waste, etc.)    40.2%  OF REVENUE ELIGIBLE  AND ALIGNED  Primarily:  • municipal water  • selective collection, sorting, and  recycling of non-hazardous waste • district heating networks • building energy performance services  • hazardous waste 23.2% FROM  “NEUTRAL” ACTIVITIES , with no signiﬁcant  environmental impact  17.7% ELIGIBLE BUT NOT ALIGNED   1.5% SCOPE NOT STUDIED This is partly due to  selectivity around best  practice, which excludes:  • non-selective waste   collection and related   downstream activities  • incineration of   non-hazardous waste  • landﬁlls • building energy services   without optimization  And partly to the exclusion  of “brown” activities: • energy from coal 15.9% OF REVENUE NOT ALIGNED WITH  THE PRINCIPLES PROMOTED BY THE COMMISSION   7.49%  Employees 75.64%  Public and  other investors 5.23% Caisse  des dépôts 1.43%  Veolia  Environnement 5.15%  Blackrock 5.06%  Crédit Agricole 54 — INTEGR ATED REPORT 2023-2024 VEOLIA — 55  ===== PAGE 30 ===== GREENUP  STRATEGIC PROGRAM … like our strategic program to guide us  through to 2027. With GreenUp, Veolia  aims to be the most decarbonizing,  depolluting and regenerating company  in the world. The benchmark company for  ecological transformation. The champion  of an ecology that transforms. VEOLIA — 57 VEOLIA — 57  ===== PAGE 31 ===== The demand for ecological transformation  has never been so strong. In a world commit- ted to achieving carbon neutrality and gradu- ally reducing its reliance on fossil fuels,  industries and regions need a high-impact set  of proven, affordable, and replicable solutions.  Solutions that enable them to reduce their  carbon footprints but also help them adapt to  the already visible consequences of climate  change –  especially in regard to water  resources – protect public health, and harness  new local resources to boost sovereignty  and autonomy. With the launch of its new strategic program,  GreenUp, Veolia is making a commitment to  accelerate, transform, and provide tangible,  affordable, replicable decarbonization, depol- lution, and resource regeneration solutions  that will help protect human health and the  environment. Building on the great success of  Impact 2023 and the transformative acquisi- tion of the Suez group, which makes Veolia  one of the top three companies in the coun- tries where it operates, the Group has never  been so well placed to meet its customers’  ecological transformation needs. With the  solutions it already has available or is in the  process of inventing, Veolia is already suppor­ ting them with local, low-carbon energy; with  recovered, treated, and reused water; and  with collected, recycled and reclaimed waste. With GreenUp, Veolia aims to move up another  gear by focusing its efforts where they are  most anticipated, most necessary, and most  transformative, namely where greenhouse gas  emissions are the highest, where pollution is  the most serious, and where natural resources  are the scarcest. — VEOLIA, THE MISSING   LINK IN ECOLOGICAL   TRANSFORMATION 10 million metric tons  of hazardous waste  eliminated in 2027, removing the same amount  of pollutants harmful to  health and ecosystems Programme stratégique 2027 is about making Veolia  the champion of… 1.5 billion m3 of fresh   water saved in 2027 decarbonization depollution regenerating  natural resources 18 million metric tons CO2 eq.  erased in 2027 (scope 4)  and downward emissions  trajectory compatible  with warming of +1.5 °C  (scopes 1 and 2) Programme stratégique 2027 IT MEANS ‘GREENING’ INDUSTRIES,  cities, and regions.

The targets are 8 GW of bio­ energy produced locally by Veolia and a  3 GW flexible installed base by 2030, i.e., at  least 50% growth; 	• water technologies and new solutions for  recycling water and treating new forms of  pollution. The ambition for 2030 is strong  revenue growth of over 50% with both  manu­facturers and cities;  	• treatment of hazardous waste and pollu­ tants in order to safeguard human health  and ­ecosystems. The target is more than  12 million metric tons treated and 50%  more revenue by 2030. More than 50% (€2 billion) of this strategic  program’s investment for growth will be  devoted to these boosters, which currently  represent 30% of the Group’s revenue. This is  equivalent to the amount invested across all  business areas over the 4 years of the Impact  2023 program. As for Veolia’s areas of strength, solid  and  resilient bases for services essential  to people and industry in which Veolia is  the  European or world leader, the Group  will focus its efforts on maintaining ope­ rational excellence and consolidating its  leader­ship position. — Expanding  local bioenergy   production Local-origin bioenergy production is  at the nexus of Veolia’s water, waste,  and energy businesses. The Group  is a major force in low-carbon local  energy in France, producing 73 GWh  of biomethane (which is injected  into the gas network) at its industrial  ecology hub in Claye-Souilly  and 163 GWh at the wastewater  treatment plant it operates in  Valenton. It aims to unlock the vast  reproduction potential in other  regions such as Australia, Asia, and  also Latin America, where it produces  35 GWh of biogas for industry at  its non-hazardous waste landfill site  in São Paulo, Brazil. Building the public  water service  of the future Renewed for another 12 years in  January 2024, the flagship public  water service management contract  for the Paris region (2025-2036)  is unique in many respects since it  reflects the future of water services.  Veolia’s proposal to the Syndicat des  eaux d’Île-de-France (Sedif), which  serves 4 million people in 132 towns  and villages, contained many “world  first” innovations, including a two- stage modular membrane filtration  process combining nanofiltration and  low-pressure reverse osmosis that can  treat micropollutants and endocrine  disruptors. With this, Veolia has  raised the bar for sustainable and  safe regional water management. Accelerating  in the treatment  of hazardous waste In the Middle East, since 2018,  Veolia has been developing massive  treatment capacities for hazardous  waste in world-class petrochemical  hubs: industrial services, incineration,  physico-chemical treatments,  landfill, etc. With these efforts,  the Group is contributing to the  introduction of stricter environmental  legislation and helping the Emirati,  Saudi and Kuwaiti authorities roll out  compliant services. Once its Saudi  installation is fully operational, the  Group will be the region’s largest  private operator and leading solutions  provider, supplying essential services  to its industrial customers. VEOLIA — 61  ===== PAGE 33 ===== To ensure the best chance of achieving its  ambition of successful ecological transfor­ mation, Veolia must optimize its existing  ­solutions to their maximum advantage even  as it creates new ones, and strengthen its  coope­ration with stakeholders. Accelerating innovation   to create the solutions   of tomorrow This requires an increased injection of  resources, with over €200 million more to be  invested in research, industrial pilots, and the  acquisition of new technologies to add to  the Group’s 4,800 existing patents. This will  also be achieved by leveraging Veolia’s size,  through its network of 14 research and inno- vation centers and 8 thematic hubs around the  world, to closely address each region’s needs.  For ­example, Veolia supports research into the  treatment of new pollutants such as endocrine  disruptors, pesticide residues, and PFASs. Continuing to make   the difference for our customers Veolia will emphasize the combination of its  expertise in water, waste, and energy, as well  as how these overlap, and also consolidate its  strong presence in each country and its ability  to replicate solutions from one country to  another. To achieve this, the Group will make  use of digital solutions with integrated AI and  generative AI. It already uses conventional AI  and machine learning in various operational  applications such as leak detection and energy  production optimization, and now it has  recently launched testing of a range of new  applications made possible by generative AI. Mobilizing the energy  of all stakeholders To achieve successful ecological transfor­ mation, Veolia needs cooperation from every  quarter: public opinion as a stimulus, govern- ment bodies as instigators, industry and the  regions as partners and cobuilders, banks and  public funding bodies as investors, and so on. Pursuing internationalization  at a faster pace Veolia’s ongoing objective is to generate 50%  of its revenue outside Europe, primarily in three  geographical zones: the United States, the  Middle East and Australia. Veolia’s geogra­ phical footprint is already largely international,  with 20% of its revenue generated in France,  40% elsewhere in Europe, and 40% outside  Europe. The idea is not to reduce activity in  Europe but to capitalize on more rapid growth  outside Europe. The objective is to be in the top  three for each business area in every country  where the Group is present.— INNOVATING AND UNITING FOR A SUSTAINABLE   AND DESIRABLE FUTURE Multifaceted performance aligned  with the challenges of GreenUp In its GreenUp strategic program, Veolia  commits to 15 multifaceted performance  objectives. For each of these, it has defined  an indicator and a target for 2027.  These 15 indicators reflect the operational  implementation of Veolia’s purpose  at Group level and will be audited annually. Decision-making in BUs and at headquarters  – on budgets, major projects and transactions,  variable compensation for management  teams, etc. – will be evaluated in terms of  the 5 multifaceted performance dimensions  and the 15 priority objectives for the entire  duration of the GreenUp program.

VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 1  ===== PAGE 4 ===== MESSAGE FROM ANTOINE FRÉROT Chairman of Veolia At Veolia, “ecological transformation is our  Purpose”. The simplicity and ambition of  this statement are what drive our Group’s  220,000 employees. What could be more  difficult or more important than fighting  greenhouse gas emissions, the increasing  scarcity of natural resources and pollution  of all kinds? What could be more complex  or more exhilarating than making the  world, which has lived for too long on  ecological credit, sustainable? Few missions are as exciting as these, and  this  is  reflected  in  our  employee  commitment rate of 89%. This record level  is an essential asset in achieving our  objectives and implementing our new  2024-2027 strategic program. Because  employee commitment is what fuels the  Group everyday! And people only mobilize  for a company whose values and vision  they share, and which gives meaning to  their work. In 2023, Veolia published a short version of  its Purpose to facilitate its appropriation by  all employees, highlight the key aspects for  all parties who engage with the Group, its  stakeholders, and accelerate its roll-out.  Like the initial text adopted in 2019, this  second, more concise, version was drafted  collectively. EMPLOYEE  COMMITMENT IS  WHAT FUELS OUR  GROUP EVERYDAY! The Group’s Purpose is what drives it,  inspires it, guides it. It unites and mobilizes  its employees, giving them the strength to  surpass their limits, go further and “move  mountains” in the service of human  progress. It is the source of the Group’s  success, even though it was only formally  set-out in recent years. It explains its  resilience and sustainability, which are  both quite exceptional as the Group has  just celebrated its 170 th anniversary. Our Company was created in 1853 to bring  pure water to the people and protect them  from the water-borne epidemics that  ravaged cities. A major issue at a time  when Pasteur said: “We drink 90% of our  diseases”. Over the decades, it expanded its  activities into other businesses, other  technologies, other customer bases, other  countries. Throughout its existence, our  Company has reinvented itself to offer its  partners cutting-edge solutions to meet  their new needs. It renewed itself once  again in 2022 on its merger with Suez to  meet the challenges of the 21 st century. The development of our Group has been an  extraordinary human adventure. Today’s  Veolia is the result of intense cooperation  between  countless  passionate  and  persevering employees, each of whom has  brought the best of themselves. We are the  heirs of their vision, their work and their  inventiveness. The greatest tribute we can pay them is for  our Group to continue making its mark in  environmental businesses, true to its  heritage and its values; to become the  undisputed world champion of ecological  transformation, which our world so badly  needs. 2 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 5 ===== INTERVIEW WITH ESTELLE  BRACHLIANOFF Chief Executive Officer of Veolia What are the major achievements  of 2023?  Strong growth in key markets, excellent  operating and financial results, a new  impetus and dimension for the Group  thanks to the integration of Suez… 2023  was once again a highly successful year for  Veolia! These repeated successes are no  coincidence: they can be explained by the  relevance of our strategy and the quality of  its  execution,  by  the  creativity  and  dynamism of our employees and by the  quality of the relationships our Group has  built with its stakeholders.  2023 was also marked by the launch of the  Care  program,  which  guarantees  a  common base level of social protection for  key life moments, even in countries where  nothing is provided for by law... I am  particularly proud of this program, as our  employees  are  both  our  Company’s  primary asset and its future: which is why  we are constantly seeking to better protect  them and provide the best working  conditions.  The new governance structure introduced  in July 2022, separating the duties of  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is  working very smoothly, according to our  values and in keeping with the Group’s  strategic projects.  What is your assessment of the  recently completed 4-year strategic  program, Impact 2023?  A great success! All of our financial targets  were met or exceeded. And we achieved  nearly all of our non-financial targets.  The merger with Suez is a success on three  levels, human, commercial and financial:   the teams are fully integrated, we have an  expanded  portfolio  of  solutions  and  references, strengthening our growth and  we are well ahead of the planned synergies. The Group has clearly changed its size and  outlook! It is more international and is in  the Top 3 companies in each of its  businesses, in all countries key to its  development. It has gained in appeal,  visibility and influence. It has enhanced its  leadership, creating the global champion of  ecological transformation.  Expanding this champion and methodically  unlocking  its  immense  development  potential are the goals of our new  2024-2027 strategic program.  THROUGH ITS  STRATEGIC  PROGRAM, VEOLIA  AFFIRMS ITS  AMBITION:   TO BE  THE COMPANY THAT  MAKES ECOLOGICAL  TRANSFORMATION  POSSIBLE. Can you outline the main points of  this new 4-year program?   As its name GreenUp suggests, this  strategic program serves the ecological  transformation of cities and industries. It  focuses on three growth boosters: local  energy  to  decarbonize;  new  water  solutions to save and recycle this precious  resource; and hazardous waste treatment,  to depollute and thus improve health and  protect biodiversity.  This program will allow us to consolidate  our main European strongholds, continue  Veolia’s  international  expansion  (particularly in North America, the Middle  East and Australia) and exploit new  geographic opportunities. To achieve this, our Group will leverage its  leading position in key countries and  businesses,  its  diversified  contractual  portfolio, its culture of operating efficiency,  and its close relations with the territories.  And also its ability to innovate and invent  the solutions of tomorrow. Through this program, Veolia affirms its  ambition: to be the company that makes  the ecological transformation of territories,  cities and industries possible. The company  that serves as a one-stop shop for the quick  and efficient implementation of ecological  solutions.  The  company  that  best  decarbonizes, depollutes and regenerates  natural resources. The company with the  most positive impact on its stakeholders!

Accordingly, Veolia has committed to a multifaceted performance which is equally attentive to and has the same high  standards for economic and financial, commercial, human resources, corporate social and environmental performance. Under  the 2023 Impact program, 18 progress objectives were defined for 2023.  This commitment is broken down in all Group processes, so that the multifaceted performance objectives drive the  management of activities.

The Group  has attained a historic level of activity with robust profitability.  Detailed comments on the financial indicators can be found in  Chapter 5. Human resources performance ■Employee commitment: in 2023, the employee commitment rate  remained at an excellent level at 89%, with a survey participation  rate of 79%, up on 2022. These excellent results, above the target  rate of 80% set in the Impact 2023 plan, testify to strong support, a  high level of confidence among employees in the implementation  of the strategic plan, and the success of the merger with Suez (see  Section 4.4.4.3.1 below). ■Safety at work: “zero accidents” is both an objective and a  performance driver for the Group. In 2023, the lost time injury  frequency rate continued to fall, reaching the target rate of 5 set in  the Impact 2023 plan (Tf = 4.95) (see Section 4.4.3.1 below). ■Employee training and employability: Veolia has an ambitious  training policy, notably to accompany the Group’s strategy to make  Veolia the reference company for ecological transformation (see  Section 4.4.42.1 below). With 29 training hours per year on average  per employee, Veolia largely exceeded the target set in the  Impact  2023 plan. ■Diversity: actions implemented to promote diversity and increase  the number of female executives in the Group (recruitment  process, young talents policy, Executive Resourcers succession plan  (Top 500), specific development programs) were continued. In  2023, the percentage of women appointed among the Executive  Resourcers (Top 500) continued to increase (30.7% for the period  2020-2023), but remained insufficient to achieve the ambitious  target of 50% for the period 2020-2023 set in the Impact 2023 plan.  (see Section 4.4.5.3 below). Environmental performance ■Combating climate change: this objective is twofold: • reducing GHG emissions: investment in decarbonizing energy  production in Central and Eastern Europe increased by close to  €147 million in 2023. This investment, primarily concentrated in  Poland and the Czech Republic, brings total investment under  the plan at the end of 2023 to €529 million, above the  €400 million target set in the Impact 2023 strategic plan (see  Section 4.2.3.2.1 below). With the start up of the Braunsweigh  (Germany), Prerov and Kolin (Czech Republic) plants, the  reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is now effective; • avoided emissions: in 2023, Veolia continued its efforts to  decarbonize its customers’ activities, particularly with regard to  waste recycling, material and energy recovery, low carbon  and  renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions (see Section  4.2.3.2.1 below). ■Circular economy: plastic recycling. Despite a sharp increase in the  Group's recycling capacity (c. 725 thousand metric tons), production  fell in 2023, particularly in France, Germany and China, due to a  difficult market environment (see Section 4.2.2.2 below). With  465 thousand metric tons of recycled plastic exiting Veolia plants,  the Impact 2023 target of 465 thousand metric tons was not  achieved. ■Protection of environments and biodiversity: in 2019, the Group  inventoried its sensitive sites with regard to protecting  environments and biodiversity. The Impact 2023 plan target of 75%  progress in 2023 was exceeded (85% at the end of 2023), with the  mobilization of all the Business Units enabling this indicator to  gain 19 points in one year (see Section 4.2.4.3.1 below). ■Sustainable management of water resources: the 2023 target of a  water distribution network efficiency rate of 75% by 2023, was  again exceeded in 2023 (see Section 4.2.5.2 below). Action plans  undertaken by the Group (renewal work, break-up of networks into  sectors, meter maintenance, leak detection) consolidate the  improvement in the efficiency rate and the reduction in related  drinking water losses. Commercial performance ■Customer and consumer satisfaction: 2023 campaign results  confirm the excellent momentum in deploying the Net Promoter  Score (NPS), with 82% of Group revenue covered. The score of 53  remains a good level compared to companies operating in  comparable sectors. For the first time in 2023, the entities  transferred on the combination with Suez were included in the  calculation of this indicator. ■Development of innovative solutions: this indicator seeks to  measure the Group’s ability to disseminate priority innovations in a  structured manner. In 2023, 17 innovations were recorded in at least  ten contracts signed by the Group (See Section 1.4.3 below). ■Hazardous waste treatment and recovery: with revenue of  €4.2  billion, the liquid and hazardous waste segment again  exceeded the €4 billion target set by the Impact 2023 plan. Social performance ■Job and wealth creation in the territories: the study conducted in  2023 covered 58 countries (see Section 4.3.2.2 below). The results by  country, published on the internet, are accessible in each country  to all Group stakeholders. ■Ethics and compliance: in 2023, 88% of respondents to the  commitment survey positively answered the question “Does Veolia  act ethically in my country and satisfy compliance rules in its  activities?” This score exceeds the target rate of 80% set in the  Impact 2023 plan and is all the more robust given the significant  increase in the number of employees surveyed (see Section 4.6.3.2  below). ■Access to essential services (water and sanitation): this indicator  measures the number of inhabitants benefiting from inclusive  measures to access and retain access to services, whether through  physical or contractual solutions (see Section 4.3.3.2 below). The  Impact 2023 target (+12% vs. 2019) was significantly exceeded in  2023 (+24.7%). This result is driven in particular by the inclusion of  retention measures in Veolia’s offerings in countries well served by  the network, and the expansion of network coverage to previously  unserved neighbourhoods.

Veolia starts 2024 with considerable confidence, launching its new GreenUp program for the period 2024-2027 (see Section 1.2.1). GreenUp presents a value creation model that combines our 3 strongholds and 3 boosters to accelerate our profitable growth: ■essential services strongholds in the infrastructure model: Municipal water, Solid waste and District heating. These businesses provide essential  services under long-term contracts with strong visibility of cash flow generation and will have solid growth in the coming years. ■growth boosters, rooted in our bastions, will drive our growth: • water technologies and new solutions; • in the energy business segment, bioenergy, renewable energy, flexibility and energy efficiency • and hazardous waste treatment. GreenUp in a nutshell:   Firm financial and non-financial commitments thanks to a unique positioning in a growing market that make it possible to commit to net income  growth at around 10% per year between 2023 and 2027 (for more details see Section 1.2.1).

It won its first public service concession for the  distribution of water in the city of Lyon, France. It went on to  expand its activities in France in the cities of Nantes (1854),  Nice (1864), Paris (1860) and later in the Greater Paris region  (1869). 1880 A treaty granted Compagnie Générale des Eaux a contract for  the production and distribution of water in Venice. Contracts  followed for Constantinople in 1882 and Porto in 1883. 1975 Compagnie Générale des Eaux created SARP Industries for  hazardous waste recovery. SARP Industries rapidly became  the first European center for processing liquid toxic waste. 1980 Compagnie Générale des Eaux took control of: ■Compagnie Générale d’Entreprises Automobiles (CGEA)  (which would become CONNEX and ONYX, and later  Veolia Transport and Veolia Propreté, respectively); ■Compagnie Générale de Chauffe and Esys-Montenay  (which would later merge to form Dalkia); ■all of its subsidiaries involved in design, engineering and  operating activities relating to drinking water and  wastewater treatment, grouping them together in  Omnium de Traitement et de Valorisation (OTV). It also began to expand significantly into other countries. 1998 Compagnie Générale des Eaux became “Vivendi” and  renamed its main water subsidiary “Compagnie Générale des  Eaux”. 1999 Vivendi established “Vivendi Environnement” to consolidate  all of its environmental services activities: Water (Vivendi  Water), Waste (ONYX), Energy services (Dalkia) and Transport  (CONNEX). 2000 Vivendi became Vivendi Universal. Vivendi Environnement  shares were admitted for trading on the Paris stock exchange  on July 20, 2000. 2001 Vivendi Environnement shares were included in the CAC 40 in  August and were listed on the New York Stock Exchange in  the form of American Depositary Receipts (ADR) in October. 2002 Vivendi Universal gradually reduced its stake. At the same  time,  Vivendi  Environnement  carried  out  a  major  restructuring to refocus on its core environmental services  activities. 2003 Vivendi Environnement became Veolia Environnement.  (1)  2005 Veolia Environnement rolled out the Veolia brand, applying it  across its divisions (Veolia Eau, Veolia Propreté, Veolia Énergie  and Veolia Transport). 2006 Vivendi  Universal  withdrew  completely  from  Veolia  Environnement’s share capital. 2011 Veolia Environnement and Caisse des dépôts et consignations  announced the creation of Veolia Transdev, after merging  their respective subsidiaries, Veolia Transport and Transdev. The Group presented its strategic plan and its mid-term  outlook, aimed primarily at refocusing its activities and  business portfolio. 2013 The Group embarked upon a significant organizational  change. The Group’s activities were organized by geographic  zone rather than by business line and division. Veolia  Transdev became Transdev Group. 2014 Veolia Environnement and EDF finalized the agreement  relating to their joint subsidiary, Dalkia. EDF took over all of  Dalkia’s activities in France and retained the Dalkia brand,  while the Group assumed control of the international  business activities. At the same time, the Group took over all  the Latin-American activities of Proactiva, the joint subsidiary  held with FCC. The Veolia Environnement ADR have not been listed on the  New York Stock Exchange since December 23, 2014. The ADR  securities are now traded on the US over-the-counter market. 2015 The Group unveiled its 2016-2018 strategic plan focusing on  two key areas: (i) increasing revenue by achieving a better  balance  of  municipal  and  industrial  contracts  and  strengthening the Group’s position outside of Europe, and; (ii)  pursuing its strategy of reducing costs and improving  operating efficiency. At the COP 21, Veolia reaffirmed its commitment to the fight  against climate change. This commitment is founded on  three key initiatives to curb greenhouse gas emissions: the  circular economy, implementation of the polluter-payer  principle and a reduction in methane emissions. 2016 Veolia Environnement signed an agreement with Caisse des  dépôts et consignations covering its withdrawal from  Transdev Group. Caisse des dépôts et consignations acquired  20% of the share capital of Transdev Group. The Group  acquired the assets of Chemours’ Sulfur Products Division,  strengthening its waste processing and recycling offering for  the Oil & Gas sector in the United States. It also acquired the American start-up, Kurion, and now has a  comprehensive offering in the nuclear clean-up sector,  thereby creating Veolia’s Nuclear Solutions business. 2019 Veolia Environnement sold its remaining stake in Transdev  Group to the Rethmann group. At the Combined General Meeting, Veolia officially gave itself  a Purpose. Veolia completed the divestiture of its energy assets in the  United States to Antin Infrastructures Partners for €1.1 billion 2020 On February 28, the Group unveiled its 2020-2023 strategic  program: Impact 2023. On October 5, Veolia Environnement acquired Engie’s 29.9%  stake in Suez and confirmed its intention to file a takeover bid  on the remaining Suez shares. 2021 Veolia continued its Suez combination project. The successful  completion of Veolia’s public tender offer for Suez was  published on January 10, 2022 by the French Financial Markets  Authority (AMF), with settlement-delivery on January 18,  2022. The squeeze-out procedure for Suez shares on Euronext  Paris was performed on February 18, 2022 and the shares were  delisted at that date. 2022 Following the merger with Suez in 2022, Veolia strengthened  its ambition to create a global champion of ecological  transformation.

ABOUT THE GROUP History and general introduction 22 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 25 ===== 1.1.2  PURPOSE Veolia was one of the first French groups to define its purpose,  adopted by its Board of Directors in April 2019. The Group’s purpose  was drawn up in consultation with its various stakeholders and  approved by the Board of Directors, and articulates why Veolia  exists and what it does and how, for the benefit of all its  stakeholders. This purpose, which is the fruit of more than 160 years  of history, is in line with Veolia’s “Resourcing the World” mission  statement. The purpose states the fundamental way in which Veolia will act. It  is both the direction in which the Group is heading and a means to  show the extent of its ambition and to give its actions a firmer long- term foundation. All Veolia’s stakeholders are informed of its  purpose - whether employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders,  partners or the territories where it operates - so that they know  what it means and can contribute to its practical application. In 2023, Veolia adopted a short version of its purpose to facilitate its  appropriation by all employees and more strongly highlight its key  elements for all stakeholders, thus supporting, strengthening and  accelerating its deployment. Ecological transformation means acting to reconcile human  progress and environmental protection. We develop and implement locally solutions to depollute vital  resources and preserve them from depletion, solutions to  decarbonise our ways of living and producing and adapt them to  the consequences of climate change. All over the world, attuned to local cultures, we strive to improve  the health and quality of life of communities. At Veolia, we tackle economic, social and environmental issues as  an inseparable whole to the benefit of the largest number of  people. The long version of the purpose can be found on Veolia.com. 1.1.3  GENERAL INTRODUCTION Veolia is a world leader in environmental services and offers a  complete range of solutions for managing Water, Waste and Energy  on five continents. In 2022, the Group operated in 57 (1) countries, generated revenue of  €45,351.2 million and employed 218,288 people. In 2022, Veolia’s organization is divided into seven geographic zones  (France and Special Waste Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, North  America, , Asia Pacific, Iberia and Latin America, North America, Italy- Africa-Middle East) and an additional worldwide zone (Water  technologies). In the geographic zones, the organization is structured by delegated  zone or country (Business Unit), with the directors for each country  responsible for the Water, Waste and Energy business lines within  their scope. Veolia Environnement is included in the Euronext Paris CAC 40 index.

In a world  committed to achieving carbon neutrality and gradually reducing  fossil fuels, industries and territories need to be steered towards  proven, affordable and replicable solutions: solutions that enable  them to reduce their carbon footprint, but also adapt to the already  visible consequences of climate change, notably on water resources,  preserve the health of populations, and exploit new local resources to  gain greater sovereignty and autonomy Veolia is focusing on being the missing link of this ecological  transformation to meet growing market demand.  Today, Veolia operates in a market where demand outweighs supply:  decarbonization,  climate  change  adaptation  and  mitigation,  management of the scarcity of resources, preservation of the quality  of life and health of individuals, search for competitiveness and  sovereignty for players and territories. The Group has never been as strong with unique solutions across the  entire value chain of business lines that are vital to ecological  transformation or as well-positioned to assist its customers in  addressing these various challenges.  It is in this context that Veolia launched its new strategic program for  2024-2027, GreenUp. 1.2.1  VEOLIA'S STRATEGIC PROGRAM FOR THE PERIOD 2024-2027: GREENUP For Veolia, ecological transformation requires solutions which  decarbonize, depollute and regenerate and therefore preserve health,  well-being and purchasing power, the strategic autonomy and  attractiveness of territories and the performance of industrial  customers.  This impact demonstrates the importance of dedicating efforts to  greening, transformation, and not just to what is already “green”: this  is precisely the objective of GreenUp. Veolia is also accelerating its  own decarbonization trajectory, with a reduction in emissions (scope 1  & 2) of -50% by 2032, compatible with the 1.5°C warming trajectory of  the Paris Agreement.  One ambition: be the benchmark company for  ecological transformation The Group operates in buoyant markets that are no largely correlated  with economic cycles. It is guided by a governance and management  that have demonstrated their ability to deliver results, whatever the  context.  The Group’s strength also lies in the fact that its employees are its  leading shareholder. It is an employer of choice with an employee  engagement rate of 89% and has top rankings in ESG classifications.   With GreenUp, Veolia proposes to take real action towards ecological  transformation, accelerate, transform and deliver genuine affordable  and replicable solutions. With GreenUp, Veolia is also accelerating the profitable growth of its  activities worldwide. The Group will strengthen its position as global  and European leader in its strongholds, municipal water, solid waste  recycling and recovery and heating networks, and step up the growth  of its booster activities with the highest impact: water technologies  and new solutions, hazardous waste treatment and bioenergy,  flexibility and energy efficiency. Their rapid, large-scale deployment  will help erase 18 million tons of CO2 emissions (scope 4), preserve 1.5  billion m3 of water and treat 10 million tons of hazardous waste by  2027.  One priority: boost the growth of a century old   foundation To achieve its growth, Veolia acts as a solutions integrator, combining  its different businesses - Water, Waste and Energy - to help its  customers decarbonize, depollute and regenerate resources. To  achieve this, the Group relies on the combination of its core  businesses (“strongholds”) with growth boosters, strengthened by its  worldwide presence in order to duplicate and deliver proven solutions  in the 57  (2) countries where it operates.  The acceleration of GreenUp will therefore rely on the strongholds on  which these boosters can develop. They account for 70% of Veolia’s  activity today and will continue to fuel its growth, contributing by 30%  by 2027 with €2 billion earmarked for investment as part of the plan. These are the robust foundations of essential services to the territories  or to industry, often comparable to infrastructures. For these activities,  such as heating networks, municipal water and solid waste, Veolia  maintains its global and European leadership thanks to its operational  excellence and innovation efforts.  Spearheads of Veolia’s growth, the boosters are strategic activities to  which the Group will devote a major share of its resources, as part of  its GreenUp plan and aims to achieve revenue growth of +50% by  2030. They already account for 30% of its revenue and will generate  70% of its 2024-2027 growth. Veolia will allocate half of its growth  investments to these activities, i.e. €2 billion, as much as for all the  activities in the previous strategic plan. Decarbonizing local energy The first booster of the GreenUp program involves bioenergy, energy  efficiency in buildings and industries, and flexibility. Producing local,  low-carbon energy for all its municipal and industrial customers  worldwide: this is Veolia’s commitment. Its ambition is to produce 8  GW of bioenergy and have a flexible installed capacity of 3 GW by  2030. ABOUT THE GROUP Strategy 24 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 (2) Countries where Veolia has a permanent establishment, employees and capital employed in excess of €5 million.  ===== PAGE 27 ===== From the production of bioenergy from non-recyclable waste and  wastewater to heat and cold recovery, energy efficiency solutions and  CO2 capture, the Group is focusing on the production of local,  affordable, low-carbon energy, with a 18 MtCO2 reduction target for  2027. With revenue of more than €12 billion (3) in this sector in 2023, Veolia is  accelerating the development of these innovative solutions to enable  its customers to optimize and balance their energy mix, while  accelerating the production and consumption of renewable energies.  Water technologies and new solutions A central pillar of Veolia’s activities, the water business has guided the  Group for 170 years, positioning Veolia as a leader in this sector. The  Group intends to maintain its operational excellence while offering  technological innovations to its customers, moving from water  distribution activities  to water science activities. Water technologies and new solutions are the program’s second  booster. They will preserve water resources and treat new pollutants.  Veolia aims to become the water services provider of the future by  focusing on the efficiency of its solutions, such as the reuse of treated  wastewater, the treatment of water and pollutants, including micro- pollutants using cutting-edge technologies, or the production of  drinking water. With a unique portfolio of proprietary solutions and technologies, and  revenue of €18 billion in this sector, Veolia is aiming for  1.5 billion m 3  of water saved by 2027.  Hazardous waste treatment As the world leader in hazardous waste treatment and present on  every continent, Veolia is accelerating its activities with its customers  with the deployment of unique offers. Hazardous waste treatment is the third booster in this program. This  will process the most toxic and harmful components to preserve the  health of individuals and ecosystems.  The Group intends to accelerate circular economy solutions and  innovation in lithium battery recycling, with the construction of  several facilities, including one in Europe for copper, cobalt, nickel and  lithium refining. With revenue of over €14 billion in 2023, Veolia will continue to  develop its activities and put all its expertise in hazardous waste  treatment to work for its customers with the aim of processing 10  million tons of polluting waste by 2027. Innovate and combine our strengths to accelerate Even though the priority of the Veolia boosters is to deploy and  replicate our existing solutions to our customers and in other regions,  Veolia is also speeding up the development of future solutions that  will drive the Group’s growth in the years to come. Already a leading player in the research and development of  environmental solutions, with over ten R&D centers worldwide and  almost 5,000 patents, the Group will significantly boost its  investments in innovation, doubling them with an additional €200  million.  Veolia is preparing to design tomorrow’s technologies to address the  future challenges of its customers, for example, decarbonizing by  creating value from biogenic carbon or regenerating resources by  working to recycle and recover strategic metals from used batteries or  incorporating artificial intelligence in our operations to detect leaks or  optimize energy production,  With GreenUp, Veolia is also seeking to capitalize on its unique  international positioning to replicate its solutions from one country to  another. The goal of expanding the Group’s international coverage is  governed by key principles: maintaining our presence if the Group has  a Top 3 ranking in a given country and the diversification of capital  employed (<5% in most countries where Veolia operates). During  GreenUp, Veolia’s growth will be stepped up in three zones: United  States, Middle East and Australia.   Veolia also plans to boost the efficiency gains generated by digital  technology and artificial intelligence as part of its annual savings plan,  particularly to optimize the water and energy consumption of its  customers, improve waste sorting and recycling and strengthen  predictive maintenance. Accelerate for greater ecological transformation  impact With GreenUp, Veolia confirms its ambition to combine activity  growth while accelerating its ecological transformation impact with  the following objectives for 2027: ■decarbonize by erasing 18 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent  through local decarbonizing energy and the circular economy; ■preserve and regenerate resources by reducing its footprint on  drinking water resources abstracted by over 1,5 billion m3; ■combat pollution and preserve the health of populations, by  processing 10 million metric tons of hazardous waste. This ambition is supplemented by an activity decarbonization  trajectory, in accordance with the Paris agreements, for both its own  operations and the assets of its customers. Veolia undertakes to:  ■reduce its scope 1 & 2 emissions by 50% by 2032 while stepping up  its investments mainly to phase-out coal in Europe and capture  biogas in landfills; ■increase scope 4 erased emissions by 50% by 2030; ■achieve Net Zero in 2050. At the end of 2023, this accelerated plan was submitted to the  approval of the SBTI. Veolia will achieve this reduction in emissions by:  ■reducing the emissions of its Energy activities by phasing out the  use of coal in Europe (investment plan of €1.6 billion between 2018  and 2030), while relying more on green energies and capitalizing  on its expertise in energy efficiency; ■reducing the emissions of its Waste activities mainly by capturing  biogas, using low-emission vehicles and removing plastics in its  waste-to-energy facilities; ■the Water activity will also contribute by increasing the use of  green energies. Rigorous management based on a multifaceted  performance  From creation to implementation, Veolia’s Purpose has been  supported and steered at the Company’s highest level. It is widely  distributed and shared throughout the Group. The Board of Directors  validated the text of the Purpose and the multifaceted performance  objectives and related indicators and controls its proper performance.  To this end it calls on the Purpose Committee, a Board committee  which monitors progress achieved by the Group and directs choices  relating to the Purpose and multifaceted performance. ABOUT THE GROUP Strategy VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 25 3 Including energy revenues from water and waste.  ===== PAGE 28 ===== The Group Executive Committee and Management Committee directly  monitor its implementation. They are assisted by a Purpose steering  committee which monitors progress and difficulties encountered and  proposes new lines of action. The opinion of the Critical Friends  Committee of independent experts is regularly sought, with the aim  of challenging the Company and helping it stay on course.  The Strategy and Innovation Department steers Veolia’s strategy with  a multifaceted performance perspective, aligned with the Group’s  Purpose. A member of the Executive Committee was tasked specifically with  stakeholder issues. The aim is to find an innovative approach to Group  relations with stakeholders and support Group Business Units in this  area, as well as to strengthen the relationship of trust and cooperation  with stakeholders. The creation of partnership ecosystems offers a  means to deploy Group solutions sustainably. A network of Purpose  Officers in the Business Units and head office support functions seeks  to mobilize and support local teams with the roll-out of the Purpose.  Finally, employees are mobilized by their managers through internal  networks and during special events, to make them the leading players  in their Company’s Purpose. To steer this new program, Veolia will focus on its multifaceted  performance guided by its purpose. A veritable tool to monitor all  aspects of performance (employees, society, planet, customers,  shareholders), the multifaceted performance indicators were reviewed  and simplified. An Executive Committee member was appointed as  sponsor to support each objective and ensure their achievement.  Fifteen new indicators will be taken into account in the remuneration  of at least 16,000 Group managers to unite all employees around this  ambition. Each indicator relating to the objectives is measured and published  regularly during the course of the program to monitor progress. These  indicators are verified by an independent third-party.

ABOUT THE GROUP Business lines 30 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 33 ===== Customer service Customer satisfaction is extremely important to Veolia and it  implements solutions enabling it to guarantee a high level of service  and develop a close relationship. These solutions call on a range of  multichannel customer relationship management tools, including: ■customer service centers, where Veolia can respond to a range of  consumer inquiries; ■local and mobile branches; ■web portals; ■mobile applications that customers can download onto a  smartphone and use to carry out key transactions relating to their  water service; ■a range of payment and social support solutions. Water treatment equipment, technologies  and facilities The Group has a portfolio of more than 550 proprietary technologies  (including  physicochemical,  biological,  thermal  and  hybrid  treatments), enriched since the acquisition of Suez WTS to include  ultra-filtration and nano-filtration membrane technologies, reverse  osmosis, electro-separation, oxygen diffusion, ozone production and  chemical formulations, enabling it to tackle the most complex water  purification (PFAS, virus, micropollutants) and reuse challenges for all  applications (drinking water, industrial process water, ultrapure water,  wastewater and seawater). Veolia  Water  Technologies  (VWT),  a  subsidiary  of  Veolia  Environnement, offers industrial companies and public authorities a  comprehensive range of solutions and services designed to optimize  their water usage, from supplying drinking and industrial process  water to treating wastewater, managing wastewater sludge and  recycling and reuse solutions (including the recovery of byproducts,  raw materials and energy). Veolia combines technology and engineering services to develop  complete water treatment solutions, which may take the form of  either packaged products or bespoke turnkey systems or sectors. VWT  designs drinking water production and wastewater treatment plants  around the world for a range of industrial and municipal customers.  Through its subsidiaries, VWT also offers water treatment equipment  and technology, as well as mobile operational response solutions. VWT’s sanitation services transform wastewater into a resource. Using  all of the Group’s technologies, it helps municipalities to produce  reusable water, fertilizers, nutrients and thermal and electrical energy  from wastewater. The Company also works with mining, exploration, operating and  engineering companies to respond to all their water needs, from  producing drinking or desalinated water at remote sites to treating  industrial process water and wastewater. Digitalizing the business Veolia uses and develops technologies using artificial intelligence as a  lever  to  address  environmental  challenges,  strengthen  the  performance of its installations and improve customer service. The  ecosystem was strengthened by the integration of Agbar’s expertise  into the Group, accelerating the development of solutions. These  solutions include: ■control centers integrated into operations, which monitor service  levels in real time and communicate any anomalies to the  customer service centers to program on-site visits; ■an energy management system, which closely monitors the  consumption of water installations operated by the Group and  identifies areas for optimization. Veolia has also developed an e-monitoring service enabling private  individuals, local authorities and industrial companies to better  manage their consumption. 1.3.1.2  Waste Veolia is one of the leading players in the management of liquid, solid,  non-hazardous and hazardous waste. The Group operates across the entire waste life cycle, from collection  to final processing and makes waste recycling and recovery a priority.  Veolia plays a key role in the circular economy, developing innovative  solutions to increase rates of waste recycled and recovered as  materials and energy. Waste collection Due to the wide range of waste categories (household waste, non- hazardous commercial and industrial waste, construction waste, green  waste, hazardous industrial and service sector waste), waste collection  is a major logistics challenge. Veolia provides door-to-door household  waste collections, as well as collecting waste from communal disposal  points, non-hazardous commercial and industrial waste and green  waste (keeping green spaces clean). It also collects hazardous waste  from industrial and service sector customers, including biomedical  waste from hospitals and laboratories and waste oil (e.g. from ships  and gas stations). In addition, it handles dispersed hazardous waste,  which must be separated during collection, either in individual  containers or mixed with other recyclable materials. Waste of the same type is taken either to transfer stations, where it is  picked up by larger trucks, or to sorting centers, where it is separated  by type and then sorted before being sent to the appropriate  processing center. Veolia offers its customers a range of collection systems that can be  adapted to suit their specific economic and regional requirements.  New technologies have been developed in France, such as vehicles  powered by biofuel, hybrid vehicles and alternative methods of  transporting waste (e.g. by river or rail). Recycling and recovering materials from waste Veolia’s goal is to process waste with a view to reintroducing it into  the industrial production cycle and achieving the highest possible rate  of recycling and material recovery. Veolia works upstream in partnership with local regions and industrial  companies to structure the sorting and recycling sectors. Veolia  manages high-performance sorting centers for non-hazardous  industrial waste and waste from selective collections, which  guarantee recovery rates of over 50%. The Group’s research and  development center developed TSA2, a patented process for industrial  application that enhances the performance of sorting facilities and  enables the production of high-quality secondary raw materials.  Thanks to a remotely operated sorting procedure, it is now possible to  refine the sorting process even further to achieve recovery rates of  over 95%. Veolia works downstream, in partnership with industrial companies,  to address ecological transition challenges by developing plastic  recycling solutions (PET, PP, PE, etc.). Veolia is now a partner of choice  for the production of recycled (or circular) polymers meeting the  highest performance standards demanded by the market for  mechanical recycling processes. Veolia also provides recycling services for complex waste, such as  electrical and electronic devices and fluorescent bulbs. ABOUT THE GROUP Business lines VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 31  ===== PAGE 34 ===== Recovery of organic waste Wastewater treatment plant sludge and green waste as well as  organic waste produced by households, restaurants, the food and  beverage sector and agriculture, are recovered for use in specific  biological sectors. Processing involves either controlled composting or anaerobic  digestion at anaerobic digestion plants. Compost produced is used as  fertilizer in agriculture and methane generated by fermentation is  recovered using the same process as for biogas at landfill sites. Waste-to-energy recovery Non-hazardous waste that cannot be recycled is transported to  incineration plants or landfill sites. Veolia is also working on the  transformation of non-hazardous waste that cannot be recycled into  refuse-derived fuels for use by public authorities and industrial  companies in combustion and energy production processes. The incineration process produces energy in the form of steam that  can either be used to power urban or industrial heating networks or  converted to energy using turbines. The electricity produced is then  fed into the national grid. At landfill sites, Veolia captures biogas produced by the fermentation  of organic waste. This biogas may then be fed directly into a  distribution network, used to produce electricity with turbines or  engines, or used as fuel for vehicles. Decommissioning and decontamination Veolia manages decommissioning projects for industrial facilities and  end-of-life equipment, such as aircraft, ships, trains and oil platforms.  The Group provides dismantling, asbestos removal, material recovery,  final waste processing and site remediation services. Veolia also participates in the rehabilitation of areas where the soil  was previously contaminated. Its subsidiary, SARP Industries,  rehabilitates brownfield sites, cleans up accidental spills and brings  active industrial sites into line with applicable environmental  regulation. Processing of hazardous liquid waste Through its specialist subsidiaries, Veolia is a world leader in  processing,  recycling  and  recovering  hazardous  waste  and  decontaminating land. Depending on the source and composition of the hazardous waste it  may be incinerated or processed using physiochemical or biological  techniques at specialized facilities or stabilized and buried in special  landfill sites. For waste from nuclear activities, Veolia cleans up nuclear facilities  and processes low and medium-level radioactive waste through the  entity, Veolia Nuclear Solutions. Urban and industrial cleaning services  and sanitation The cleanliness of streets and public areas is an important factor in  cities’ appeal and is a major public health and safety issue for citizens. Veolia provides urban cleaning services 24/7 founded on performance  commitments: upkeep and cleaning of public spaces, mechanical  street and facade cleaning solutions. Veolia offers industrial customers production line upkeep and  maintenance services and a comprehensive range of specialist services  to optimize the performance of the industrial tool and extend its life. The Group has also developed emergency services to treat accidental  pollution on public roads or at industrial sites. Through its specialized subsidiary SARP, Veolia provides liquid waste  management services that largely involve pumping and transporting  sewer network liquids and oil industry residues to processing centers.  The Group has developed a range of environmentally friendly  procedures for managing liquid waste, including on-site collection and  the recycling of water during processing. Used oil, which is hazardous  for the environment, is collected before being processed and re- refined by SARP Industries, a specialist in managing hazardous waste. 1.3.1.3  Energy In the energy sector, Veolia focuses its activities on the energy  performance of regions and industrial companies: local energy loops  (heating and cooling networks, local supply loops), energy services for  buildings, energy services for industrial companies (industrial utilities).  Veolia’s value proposition seeks to guarantee the energy performance  of the regions and industrial companies (i) by reducing end  consumption, (ii) while optimizing local energy production, (iii)  improving the energy mix by promoting renewable energies and  recovering waste energy and (iv) developing and managing flexibility  services  to  optimize  and  build  the  resilience  of  regional  infrastructures. This positioning allows the Group to respond to the challenges facing  all customer segments, both municipal (energy optimization,  development of renewable energies and network balance in  developed countries, development of regional infrastructure and the  need for autonomy in emerging countries) and service sector and  industrial (energy optimization, security of supply, corporate social  and environmental responsibility in developed countries, security of  supply and need for autonomy in emerging countries). Veolia supports ecological transition both in its own installations and  in partnership with customers by implementing solutions aimed at  eliminating the use of coal as the primary energy. Heating and cooling networks Veolia is one of Europe’s leading companies for managing urban  heating and cooling networks, particularly in Central and Eastern  Europe. The operation and maintenance of heating and cooling  networks enables the supply of heating, hot water and air  conditioning to public and private facilities, including schools, health  centers, office buildings and apartment blocks. Heating networks help  improve air quality as the centralized units are equipped with better  flue treatment systems. Cooling networks also help remove heat  islands by centralizing production. The heating and cooling networks enable the use of an energy mix  favoring the use of renewable and recovered energies: geothermal,  biomass, thermal solar, cogeneration or the recovery of heat produced  by incineration of household waste, wastewater treatment plants, etc.  They help reduce the carbon footprint of cities and enable heat and  cold emitter and receiver sites to be linked and a region’s overall  energy position to be optimized. Veolia uses its unique expertise to design, build, operate and maintain  heating and cooling networks, manage energy supplies (particularly  those from renewable sources) and deliver services to end customers. Local supply loops Local supply loops respond to an underlying trend tied to the  integration of local renewable energies and the need for resilience in  the electricity management system. Veolia’s offerings focus on the production (cogeneration, biomass,  waste-to-energy recovery, biogas, hydraulic, etc.) and distribution of  electricity (distribution voltage of 50 kV or less) at regional level (city,  district, industrial park) and electricity distribution alone when  operating together with another Veolia activity (waste or water), as in  Morocco. ABOUT THE GROUP Business lines 32 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 35 ===== Energy services for buildings Veolia develops energy services to reduce the energy consumption and  CO2 emissions of buildings while maintaining occupant comfort levels.  Veolia carries out energy audits of buildings, which are then used to  draft improvement plans encompassing the installation of more  efficient energy equipment, tools for monitoring consumption and  managing the building’s performance and measures encouraging  occupants to save energy. These services can also include local energy  production. Veolia is developing indoor air quality monitoring and improvement  offerings for its customers (care facilities, leisure buildings, office  buildings, etc.) for whom indoor air quality is becoming a major issue.  These offerings are based on audits, improvement measures involving  purifiers or the renovation of ventilation systems and the monitoring  of performance indicators. Veolia has created a hypervision system and management service to  control the efficiency of buildings and infrastructures: Hubgrade.  Designed as an integrated management platform, Hubgrade collects  data real-time which is then analyzed by the Group’s experts to  optimize on-site visits. In terms of building energy efficiency, this tool  generates up to 15% additional energy savings in comparison to  existing energy efficiency services available on the market. Hubgrade  also enables the centralized monitoring and improvement of other  environmental indicators, such as water consumption, waste  production or indoor air quality. Veolia currently manages  33 Hubgrade centers around the globe. Industrial utilities Veolia’s energy solutions meet the reliability, quality, availability, and  cost requirements of industrial companies for whom energy is an  essential element of their competitiveness. The Group optimizes  industrial utilities, whatever their nature (production of steam, cold,  electricity, compressed air), as well as the use of process energy and  the energy consumption of industrial buildings. Veolia thereby  contributes to securing its customer’s energy supply and reducing  their energy and carbon footprint: ■optimizing industrial utilities: steam, electricity and compressed  air; ■optimizing the use of process energy (aligning use with needs and  identifying sources of waste energy and recoverable byproducts); ■optimizing the energy consumption of industrial buildings; ■reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Veolia offers its customers: ■a secure supply and effective mix of energy in terms of quantity,  quality and cost; ■industrial processes; ■a guarantee that their facilities will remain operable, in the form of  specific service commitments. Its Energy solutions encompass the entire conversion cycle, from  purchasing energies entering a site (fuel oil, gas, biomass and biogas)  to building new facilities or modernizing existing ones and selling the  electricity produced on the market. Veolia works with its customers to  help them optimize their energy procurement and upgrade their  facilities to improve their energy efficiency, both in terms of cost and  atmospheric emissions. 1.3.1.4  Multi-business contracts with  industrial customers Industrial outsourcing and integrated services The main characteristics of the industrial outsourcing market are: ■increasing requests for integrated services from technical and  multi-services business lines, often accompanied by a demand for  environmental optimization services; and ■offerings that must be international, or at the very least continent- wide, with the industrial customers adopting increasingly multi- site and/or multi-country approaches. From an operational standpoint, there are necessary changes to the  customer relationship: the service provider becomes the industrial  customer’s sole point of contact and a dialogue develops to seek  solutions which satisfy the interests of both parties. By outsourcing  the management of technical and multi-services to a specialist, the  customer can refocus on its core business and benefit from best  practices for the services delegated. The combination of these two  factors helps improve the performance and competitiveness of  industrial sites. By placing its business synergies, its know-how, its international  spread and its solid reputation at the service of industrial customers,  Veolia has established itself as the benchmark for multi-business  integrated offerings in industrial markets. Multi-business contracts Multi-business operations have a significant international dimension,  particularly when industrial customers invest in the construction of  new plants abroad (“greenfield” plants). Veolia has a unique position in the industrial outsourcing market and  a wide range of references: ■the design, build and operation of the first automobile plant with  zero carbon emissions and zero water discharges, for Renault in  Tangier, which mobilized the expertise and know-how of the  Group’s various business lines; ■the ability to assist leading pharmaceutical customers throughout  Europe applying the same standards, as demonstrated by contracts  with Pfizer and Novartis. 1.3.1.5  Other businesses Seureca hosts the Group’s engineering consulting and operational and  strategy assistance activities. It designs tailored solutions for  challenges surrounding accessing essential services, sustainable  resource management, environmental protection and performance  improvement for municipalities, industrial companies and the service  sector. Its teams are involved in the water, waste recovery and processing and  energy business, from the draft project phase through to operational  implementation and provide a wide range of services including audits  and studies, design and project management, strategic and  operational assistance, training and skills transfer. Active in over 70 countries across five continents, Seureca is supported  by local offices, business synergies and an operational talent pool of  over 300 engineers that can be mobilized to work on short-, medium-  or long-term projects around the world. Veolia also has a subsidiary specialized in the environmental and  health performance of buildings and expertise in monitoring and  improving air quality (OFIS). ABOUT THE GROUP Business lines VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 33  ===== PAGE 36 ===== 1.3.2  FACTORS THAT COULD INFLUENCE THE GROUP’S BUSINESS LINES The Group’s main business lines can be influenced by key factors, certain of which are set out in Chapter 2, Section 2.2, Risk factors, below. WATER WASTE ENERGY • changes to billed volumes (particularly  changes in domestic water consumption as  a result of weather variations); • the ability to achieve, within the planned  timeframe, rate increases in line with  Group targets; • the ability to implement cost-cutting  programs; • the pace of the projects of municipal  customers and some larger industrial  customers (for designing and building  installations); • the ability to meet service commitments  negotiated with customers or regulators; • continued technological leadership (for  designing and building installations); • a full grasp of the constraints and technical  solutions  in  relation  to  contract  performance; • thoroughness  in  negotiation  and  performance (particularly as regards the  ability to respect deadlines and cost  budgets  for  designing  and  building  installations); • operational resilience of sites due to  climate conditions (flood risk or water  stress). • presence at all points of the waste value  chain, from pre-collection through all  aspects of processing and recovery, in a  representative range of geographic zones,  in order to identify and manage innovative,  tailored solutions that set the Group apart  from its competitors in the market; • public policies supporting the circular  economy and ecological transition; • the quality of employee management in  sectors that are often labor-intensive  (limiting absenteeism and strikes, and  developing skills and training); • operating efficiency (procurement, sales,  logistics and maintenance management)  to optimize unit costs and the utilization  rate of equipment, while ensuring the high  level of quality required for the products  and services delivered; • management of economic and financial  risks: in particular, volume fluctuations,  reducing exposure to volatility in raw  material prices (fuel, and secondary raw  materials, such as paper and metals), see  below; • industrial  risk  management  (fire,  explosion, pollution, etc.), notably for the  hazardous waste activity. • public policies supporting energy transition  (energy efficiency, the development of  renewable energy sources, etc.) and the  reduction of pollutant emissions; • changes in the energy market, particularly  in terms of the selling price of electricity  and  heating,  the  accessibility  and  production  cost  of  fuels,  and  CO2  allowances (see below); • urbanization  dynamics  and  weather  variations from year to year, which can  affect sales of heating and cooling; • the  economic  environment  and  its  influence on the activity levels of industrial  sites. Factors common to the three business lines: • the ability to renew existing contracts under satisfactory conditions in a very competitive environment; • the ability to propose innovative models; • the ability to control costs and impose favorable conditions for sharing risks and profits; • the management of risks relating to environmental protection, and to the safety of individuals and facilities; • the ability to innovate using new technologies and innovative processes founded on an effective technology-, regulator- and competition- monitoring system; • investment management in certain capital-intensive businesses (selectivity, risk analysis and facility size); • the quality of contractual management for long-term contracts (major clauses, price review formula, guarantees and sureties, etc.); • the diversity of regulatory frameworks and changes therein, particularly concerning environmental issues. The Water and Energy business lines are subject to seasonal changes  and weather uncertainty (see Chapter 2, Section 2.2.2.1, below). Price variations in electricity and primary raw materials (particularly  fuel, coal and natural gas) on the one hand, and of secondary raw  materials (paper, cardboard, plastic, ferrous scrap and non-ferrous  metals) on the other hand, can have varying effects on Veolia’s  businesses (see Chapter 2, Section 2.2.2.3, below). Energy and raw material prices are heavily influenced by supply and  demand,  weather  conditions,  the  geopolitical  context  and  macroeconomic decisions. Raw material prices fell significantly on  2022 to close the year at levels observed prior to the Russian-Ukrainian  conflict. The drop in prices is due to a combination of factors impacting both  supply and demand: comfortable European gas stock levels (88% as of  December 20, 2023), better availability of the French nuclear park,  strong renewable production, mild winter temperatures and an  energy savings objective that has reduced demand. ■Natural gas:average prices for the main European interconnection  points (PEG, TTF and THE) are down significantly by -64% on 2022. Events in 2022 led Europe to diversify its gas supply strategy and  thereby reduce its dependence on Russian gas. In 2023, liquid natural  gas (LNG) supply increased significantly and a steady flow from  Norway accelerated the build-up of European stock, enabling the  90% security threshold set by the European Commission for the  winter to be reached.  ABOUT THE GROUP Business lines 34 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 37 ===== These factors reassured the European market and helped stabilize  natural gas prices despite strikes at LNG production sites in Australia  and the escalation of the conflict between Gaza and Israel. The price  of natural gas therefore closed the year at around €30/MWh (vs  €62/MWh on average in January 2023). ■Electricity: average prices in the German and French markets,  among the most liquid in Europe, declined significantly by around  -62% on 2022. The increased availability of the entire French nuclear park (+10 GW  compared to winter 2022-2023 thanks to maintenance operations  conducted in 2022), coupled with a robust renewables offer  occupying an increasing share of the European energy mix (67.5% in  the first-half of 2023 compared to 60.3% in 2022), helped reduce the  average daily spot rate to approximately €90/MWh, with negative  prices in the third quarter. ■CO2: average prices in the European CO2 allowance market  increased by around +3% on 2022. Emission allowance prices are highly volatile and driven by the  collapse of the energy market, which fell sharply throughout the  second half of the year to reach €66/metric ton mid-December.  The approaching December 2023 settlement date combined with the  closure of speculative positions propelled the spot rate to €77/metric  ton in the final two weeks of the year. ■Fuel:average fuel prices decreased around -24% in 2023 compared  to 2022. As a product derived from crude oil, fuel prices remain heavily  influenced by the price of Brent and OPEC decisions. The daily spot  rate increased in the third quarter, peaking in September at  US$1,040/metric ton (Ultra Low Sulphur Diesel 10 ppm) following the  announcement by OPEC of a reduction in production. Demand was  therefore redirected to the United States where stocks were reduced  to their lowest level. This fall in the average price in 2023 positively impacted the fuel  purchases account in the Waste business by around +€39.63 million. A portion of the revenue of the Waste business line is generated by its  sorting/recycling and trading businesses, which can be sensitive to  fluctuations in the price of recycled materials (paper, cardboard,  plastic, ferrous scrap and non-ferrous metals). ■Recycled cardboard and paper (NFSI OCC 1.04): 2023 was marked by  a progressive increase in prices, from €70/metric ton in January to  €102/metric ton in December 2023; ■Ferrous scrap (E40 price benchmark):  the 2023 annual average fell  -19% compared to 2022.  After a first quarter under pressure marked by rising prices, the trend  reversed in the second quarter with a gradual increase in mining  production, a drop in Chinese imports due to a slower than expected  recovery following the exit from the zero-covid policy, and the  slowdown in the global economy; ■Plastic: 2023 was marked by a fall in prices for the various resins  due to the economic crisis and lower “virgin” material prices: -40%  rPET (WE, Food Grade Pellets, WoodMackenzie), -24% HDPE  (Natural Pellets, ICIS Europe), -17% PP (Mixed-Colored Pellets, ICIS  Europe). Lower grade materials were most impacted by low  demand for recycled materials, while demand for premium or food  grade materials was the highest. It should also be noted that the  decline in recycled plastic prices (pellets) was accompanied by a  drop in plastic bales collected and sorted. Waste revenue fell significantly by -€415 million in 2023, in a context  of a slowdown in global activity, lower volumes collected and falling  prices for recycled raw materials.  1.3.3  CONTRACTS TAILORED TO THE MARKETS The variety of the business models implemented by the Group results  in diverse contract forms tailored to suit local legal systems, and the  type (public vs. private), requirements (in terms of financing and  performance) and size of customers. Veolia therefore strives to take its customers’ expectations into  account in its contract negotiations, building a partnership-based  relationship that is attentive to the customer’s concerns, and a shared  approach to improvement and productivity. It sets out clearly defined  commitments to performance and sharing the value created, while  meeting regulators’ transparency requirements, from the tendering  stage and throughout performance of the contract. 1.3.3.1  Contractual relationships with  public authorities Contractual relationships with public authorities for services to local  inhabitants (“public services” or “services of general economic  interest”, for which the municipality is responsible), vary with the level  of involvement of the public authority and the contractor. Most often, these public services fall under the responsibility of the  competent public authorities, which are directly involved in their  management in various ways. They may: ■operate the service themselves (direct or internal management by  a state-owned enterprise) using their own resources or resources  entrusted to a body that the public authority controls, similarly to  the way it controls its own departments (or “in-house” under EU  regulations); ■engage the services of a private, part-public or public company,  which operates all or part of the service on their behalf (in its  entirety, for support assignments related to the service, or within a  limited scope) and for which they form the customer base; ■transfer or delegate, to a private, part-public or public company,  responsibility for operating all or part of the service, allocating the  human, material and financial resources and, where applicable,  designing, building and financing the facilities needed to operate  the service. In certain cases, service users may directly form the customer base of  the Group’s entities. The variety of approaches to managing “public services” thus gives  rise to contractual mechanisms that Veolia adapts to suit each  customer, depending on whether or not the company is made fully  responsible for providing the service, how it is funded and the  relationship with end-users. ABOUT THE GROUP Business lines VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 35  ===== PAGE 38 ===== Contracts generally fall into one of three categories: ■public contracts: the public entity charges the contractor with  delivering supplies, work and/or services in exchange for payment  by the former as the services are performed. These contracts may  have a limited purpose (e.g. operating a heat production plant, a  waste processing facility, a wastewater treatment plant, etc.).  Increasingly,  however,  public  authorities  are  turning  to  comprehensive public procurement contracts, whereby the  Company is tasked with designing, building, operating and  maintaining  facilities;  these  may  include  remuneration  mechanisms (particularly Design, Build, Operate, Maintain (DBOM)  procurement contracts) or Design, Build, Operate (DBO) contracts  for international markets, including design but no financing; ■partnership contracts on the basis of Build, Operate, Transfer  (BOT), or Build, Own, Operate (BOO) contracts for international  markets with financing: contracts whereby the public entity  assigns the overall task of designing, building and/or operating  facilities, which may include partial or total financing and an end- of-operations asset transfer clause. These contracts may be  performed by Group companies acting alone or as part of a  consortium with third parties or, where facilities are subject to  financing, through ad hoc companies that enter into the contract  and take on the debt, without the lenders being able to launch  proceedings against the borrower’s shareholders. In this type of  contractual arrangement, it is also common to create an operating  company to operate and maintain the facility. Group companies  may, for a single project, invest to varying degrees in the  construction consortium, in the capital of the ad hoc company  awarded the main contract or in the capital of the operating  company; ■public service concession contract: the public entity grants the  contractor the concession to manage a public service, taking on all  or part of the operating risk. It is most common for this to result in  remuneration paid, in whole or in part, by the service user. Although some established models still dominate, depending on the  country and the operations carried out by the Group, contractual  models may evolve to address new priorities faced by public  authorities, providing them with innovative financing solutions and  remuneration mechanisms based on the savings achieved and/or the  performance of the service. The term of these contracts varies with the task assigned: they are  often medium or long-term contracts (average of eight to twenty  years, public contracts generally having a shorter term). Long-term  contracts may include a periodic review of financial terms and  conditions. 1.3.3.2  Partnerships with industrial and  service sector companies Partnerships with industrial and service sector businesses can also  take a variety of contractual forms; the minimum these include is a  service of limited scope, but they can also cover the design, financing,  construction and full operation of a facility. These contracts are  customized because they seek to address exactly the specific issues  facing each customer: ■outsourcing a group of services not included in its core business,  such as site management (steam, compressed air, electricity,  cooling towers, cooling unit, heating, ventilation, air-conditioning,  etc.), the water cycle (drinking water, process water and effluents)  and waste management. More broadly, the Group can manage the  full range of production support services at industrial sites:  building  maintenance,  lifting  equipment,  fire  detection,  mechanical  and  electrical  maintenance,  calibration,  instrumentation, etc. ■exploring and implementing innovative or hi-tech solutions to  address complex problems: e.g. in the fields of remediation,  hazardous waste recovery, greenhouse gas emission reductions  through projects with a significant environmental component  (biomass or solar facilities), purification of water used in the  customer’s industrial process, and the treatment or reuse of  industrial wastewater by zero wastewater discharge projects. In most cases, the contracts set performance targets, on which  Veolia’s remuneration is partly based. As with public authorities, the term of contracts with industrial  companies varies and is on average three to ten years. The Group is also very careful to strive for economic balance in its  contract portfolio, particularly when investments need to be financed.  The contracts managed are complex and long-term, so the Group is  skilled in analyzing and monitoring contracts. The content of tenders  is approved by Veolia Environnement’s Investment Committee (for the  most important ones), or by the regional or country Investment  Approval Committees. The Group’s central operational departments  are involved in the process of negotiating and drawing up tenders for major contracts, launched by the operational companies. Controls are  put in place covering the implementation of tenders and contracts.  Each year, the Veolia Environnement Internal Audit Department’s  schedule includes a review of the contractual and financial challenges  of the most significant new contracts. 1.3.4  MARKETS AND COMPETITION 1.3.4.1  Markets Environmental management services provided by Veolia include  drinking water treatment and distribution, wastewater and sanitation  services, and waste management and energy services: production  and/or distribution of heat, cold, gas or electricity; energy efficiency of  buildings and industrial sites. This market also encompasses the  design, construction and, where applicable, financing of necessary  facilities to supply such services. These services are intended for: ■public authorities and private individuals (municipal market); ■industrial or service companies and establishments (industrial  market). Environmental services are a growing market, driven by: ■population growth and increasing urbanization (70% of the world  population will live in cities by 2050)  6 ; ■still-significant requirements worldwide to access drinking water  and sanitation systems (some 700 million people still do not have  access to drinking water and over 2 billion have no access to  sanitation systems) 1 ■increased awareness of the need to take steps to protect the  environment, with a regulatory framework that is becoming more  stringent; ■cost  constraints  for  services  coupled  with  performance  requirements, which encourage the outsourcing of services to  specialists; ABOUT THE GROUP Business lines 36 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 (6) According to a United Nations report dated March 31, 2015.  ===== PAGE 39 ===== ■a change in consumer behavior: increasingly knowledgeable about  health, environmental protection and lifestyle changes aimed at a  higher standard of living; increasingly sensitive to the roles of  recycling and the collaborative economy; and wanting greater  transparency in service governance. 1.3.4.1.1  Municipal market For Veolia, the municipal market encompasses services aimed at users,  performed under contracts with local public authorities and groups of  local public authorities, or regional or national governments:  distribution of drinking water, collection and treatment of  wastewater, waste management, management of energy networks  (electricity, heating, cooling). Global warming, natural disasters, pollution, economic appeal, social  inequality, rocketing populations, increased mobility, accelerating  urbanization (particularly in coastal zones), stress on resources and  infrastructure, digitalization, and the vulnerability of information  systems are some of the challenges to which cities must respond. Cities’ planning policies have to take into account three factors: the  public (health, well-being and social justice), regional development  (creation of economic value) and the planet (environmental  protection). The cities are required to manage water, energy and waste  management services - as cheaply as possible, yet in a smart and  innovative way - with solutions adopted to whether they are located  in a developed or emerging country. Veolia deploys solutions meeting the various needs of cities: ■Resilient cities: cities more resistant to shocks and risks. In every city in the world, resilience is a key concern and is becoming a  major issue for a large number of stakeholders (institutions, public  authorities, non-profits, etc.). Hurricanes Harvey and Irma that hit the  United States and the West Indies in 2017, the drought and extreme  fires in Australia in 2019 and the floods that devastated the Roya  valley in France in October 2020, further strengthened the collective  awareness of the need for regional resilience. Veolia assists regional  public authorities with decision-making, adopting a long-term vision  to anticipate crisis situations, guarantee the performance of critical  equipment and accelerate the return to normal after a crisis. Together  with Swiss Re, the Group has implemented a unique risk assessment  system with preventive and strengthening measures to guarantee the  resilience of cities. New Orleans in the United States is the first city in  the world to benefit from this system. ■Attractive cities to live: improving quality of life to attract people  and companies. Veolia provides attractive cities to live with innovative solutions to  preserve the quality of life of their citizens, the environment and  urban infrastructures. To this end, the Group mobilizes its expertise in  waste collection and management, drinking water management,  wastewater treatment and the production and distribution of  renewable energies. Attractive cities to live are also particularly  attentive to biodiversity and reduce their environmental footprint by  using renewable energies (biomass, biogas, etc.). They are vigilant  about the cleanliness of areas, air and water quality and reducing  noise pollution. ■Smart cities: digital solutions are revolutionizing cities. More connected and better managed, smart cities optimize the  operation of their infrastructures, increasing their competitiveness,  appeal and sustainability. More efficient and transparent, they meet  the new expectations of citizens wishing to participate more in the  management of their cities. By combining new technology, its  business expertise and its relationship with innovative regional  companies, Veolia contributes to improving the level of service offered  by cities to their citizens with four maxims: speed of deployment, cost  control, cybersecurity and reliability. Examples include Veolia’s  Hubgrade hypervision centers that enable public authorities to  optimize the management of their water and energy networks, aim  for better environmental performance and improve the quality of life  of citizens. Nova Veolia’s subsidiary, Birdz (created by the merger of  Homerider and m2ocity, remote meter reading pioneers) is yet  another example. This specialist in the design of connected things and  the transmission, analysis and enhancement of data (water, energy,  waste, temperature, pollution, noise, public lighting) serves smart  cities and the urban environment. ■Inclusive cities: creating economic, social and regional cohesion. Inclusive cities are cities where no population category is excluded  from urban development. They promote access to essential services  for the greatest number and, in particular, the most vulnerable  populations. They also encourage the involvement of citizens and all  stakeholders in their operation. Through its presence and knowledge  of local players, Veolia accompanies economic and social initiatives  promoting access to essential services for the greatest number. In  Bangladesh, Veolia and Grameen Bank managed by Muhammad  Yunus set up a social business project in conjunction with the local  population and authorities, providing 6,000 inhabitants of the  Goalmari and Padua districts with access to drinking water. Veolia  deployed unprecedented social and financial engineering resources to  implement this initiative. In Lille, in addition to a strong community  involvement, Veolia has developed a personalized service tailored to  each type of user, with an environmentally responsible pricing policy  and a reduction in standing charges for domestic customers. ■Circular cities: creating local loops to generate regional value. Veolia implements operating solutions and new business models to  promote the development of the circular economy at a regional level.  This approach is at the heart of its strategic ambition and vision  “Resourcing the world”. Renewing resources is, for example, recycling  materials (plastic, paper, glass, precious metals), developing  renewable energies and energy recovery (biomass, biogas, waste  energy) and transforming waste into compost and energy. Preserving  resources is, for example, reducing consumption and developing  energy efficiency and holistic approaches (product-service system,  industrial ecology, eco-design). As a development model and growth  driver, the circular economy is a source of regional job creation. The deployment strategy for these solutions differs between  developed and emerging countries. Cities in developed countries Cities in developed countries are a mature market where customer  needs are now turning towards: ■more efficient services (lower costs, lower prices, improved service  quality) in the face of pressure on public finances and increased  public pressure; ■making cities more attractive and finding solutions that  differentiate them from other cities in the same region (e.g. “smart  cities”); ABOUT THE GROUP Business lines VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 37  ===== PAGE 40 ===== ■increased demand for transparency; ■social solutions for vulnerable groups; ■sustainable  development  environmental  solutions  (circular  economy, reducing the carbon footprint of cities, eliminating  pollution, biodiversity, etc.); ■improving resilience to combat the risk of natural disasters. In these countries, Veolia asserts its role as a catalyst for the appeal of  cities and their economic and social development, in particular by  reinforcing its unique factors and changing its contractual models.  Therefore, in addition to its traditional contractual models  (concessions, leases, etc.) Veolia proposes: ■contracts that include the sharing of the value created with the  customer, whether that is based on financial or environmental  performance (resource or energy savings, improved performance of  facilities, etc.), on the creation of new revenues (pooling of  facilities, resale of electricity to the grid for cogeneration, recovery  of byproducts, etc.) or on risk reduction (partnerships with  insurers). A proportion of Veolia’s remuneration is linked to  achieving the expected results. The contract can include operating  utilities (e.g. energy performance or resources contracts) or simply  consultancy and management services; ■financial partnerships (AssetCo/OpCo models): contracts that  include a third-party investor financing the investments necessary  for optimizing the public authority’s utilities, with Veolia  guaranteeing the performance of the facilities over the  amortization period; ■provision of specialist services: customers are offered the benefit of  Veolia’s expertise in targeted services (automatic meter reading,  organization of service calls, help with billing recovery, operating  data analysis and consultancy, etc.) traditionally incorporated into  comprehensive contracts. Cities in emerging countries Cities in emerging countries (particularly those in Central and Eastern  Europe, Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East) offer many  opportunities for growth. This is explained by, firstly, the rapid  population growth seen in such cities and, secondly, the toughening of  regulations designed to protect the environment. These countries  have a growing need for new infrastructure and require support with  operating and managing Water, Waste and Energy. As in developed  countries, municipalities are also keen to improve the resilience of  their area and in doing so combat the risks posed by natural disasters. In these countries, Veolia’s offerings seek to support the development  of cities by: ■adapting contractual models to take account of the risks posed by  different countries, with the aim of creating new models,  partnerships and alliances that enable Veolia to operate in these  countries without being exposed to risky concessionary models; ■developing Veolia’s positioning in environmental solutions for  sustainable development and making cities more resilient; ■capitalizing on the social dimension of Veolia’s business lines and  their role in supporting the economic and social development of  cities. 1.3.4.1.2  Industrial market For Veolia, the industrial market covers Water, Waste and Energy  management services, offered to industrial or service sector  customers. Industrial companies are faced with challenges that are critical to their  development: sustained growth objectives in an increasingly  competitive  context,  increasingly  stringent  environmental  regulations, carbon footprint reduction requirements, diminishing  resources (water stress) in the zones where their production sites are  located, the acceptability of their operations and social and media  pressure on the right to operate, the need to control production costs  (raw materials used in processes) and operating and reputation risks.  They are seeking partners able to take charge of all of these issues and  provide them with solutions for sustainable, profitable growth. In the service sector, energy efficiency regulations for buildings are  becoming tougher, for example Europe’s “Fit for 55” package, which  requires a strategy for mobilizing investment to renovate residential  and commercial buildings, China’s 12 th Five-Year Plan, or Canada’s  National Energy Code for Buildings. Increasingly, customers demand  sustainable initiatives. Through its offerings, Veolia helps industrial and service sector  customers anticipate and deal with these key issues of the right to  operate, the drive for efficiency and maximum yield, corporate social  and environmental responsibility, and risk reduction, by: ■providing industrial and service sector players with a global,  comprehensive and expert approach for all environmental issues; ■offering customers high impact offerings that help improve their  environmental performance and efficiency and get the most from  their assets: solutions for optimal management of the water cycle,  comprehensive waste management performance contracts based  on reducing the carbon footprint, the circular economy and  digitalization of services, low carbon energy solutions, energy  performance services, multi-technical management services for  industrial utilities; processing of difficult pollution and particularly  hazardous waste, performance and value sharing models, etc. Veolia therefore provides industrial and service customers with a full  range of construction and/or service offerings to improve their  competitiveness and their environmental and social impact, organized  around 5 value creation drivers: ■license to operate (e.g. reusing process water, zero liquid discharge  plants); ■operating efficiency, reducing the carbon footprint and cost  reduction (e.g. optimizing water and energy consumption,  recovering waste and by-products as alternative fuel, robotic tank  cleaning, competitive waste disposal networks); ■maximizing the yield of customer assets (e.g. increasing  equipment availability); ■financial engineering (e.g. investment planning and joint  financing, financial arrangements, search for external financing); ■brand image and social and environmental responsibility (e.g.  optimized management of water, energy and waste resources,  design, build and operation of carbon neutral plants or carbon  capture facilities, joint development of projects with the different  stakeholders). The Group has considerable strengths that enable it to provide unique  solutions to industrial customers: ■a combination of technical expertise and operating skills,  supported by an extensive technology portfolio and contractor  know-how; ■the ability to guarantee long-term results; ■a global network serving global customers with strong local roots,  primarily  through  municipal  activities,  offering  industrial  companies integrated solutions in the regions; ABOUT THE GROUP Business lines 38 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 41 ===== ■the ability to consider water, waste and energy cycles  simultaneously, enabling an integrated approach to industrial  processes and a circular economy approach. Veolia’s main industrial markets are as follows: Chemical, oil and gas industries The oil and gas market covers both upstream activities (exploration/ production) and downstream activities (refining, petrochemicals,  chemicals). In upstream exploration/production operations which are highly  dependent on oil prices, industrial companies continue to explore and  exploit new resources sustainably, seeking to extend the productive  lives of mature sites and limit their environmental impact. Oil and gas  production sometimes takes place in regions of water stress and  unconventional extraction techniques consume large amounts of  water. Downstream, refining, petrochemical and chemical industries have  growing needs for operational and environmental excellence and  compliance  with  increasingly  tough  regulation  of  pollutant  discharges. Thus, the needs of customers in these industries are focused on the  right to operate, reducing the carbon footprint, maximizing customer  asset availability and output, reducing costs and risk, resource and  water efficiency, and regulatory compliance. Veolia offers solutions  that respond to this industry’s major water, waste processing and  performance needs by positioning itself as a long-term partner able to  address all environmental and efficiency issues and proposing a range  of offerings adapted to the needs of both market segments: ■for  the  upstream  market  (exploration/production):  the  construction and operation of facilities for treating injection water  and  produced  water,  mobile  water  treatment  solutions,  management of waste, including hazardous waste, industrial  services, and the decommissioning of oil rigs; ■for the downstream market (refining, petrochemicals, chemicals):  the treatment of process water, wastewater and cooling water,  industrial services (surface treatments, robotic tank cleaning),  treatment of hazardous waste, energy optimization of facilities,  recovery of byproducts and hazardous waste (solvents, oily sludge,  KOH, sulfuric acid, sulfuric gases produced during the refining  process, etc.), the supply of decarbonized energy and financial  engineering (e.g. takeover of assets). The mining, metal and energy industries Mining is the sector with the second-highest water consumption  (equivalent each year to the domestic consumption of the United  States), and it needs to expand its fields of exploration in zones of  water stress (70% of the projects of the six largest mining companies)  to compensate for the depletion of the most easily accessible ores. The  tightening of environmental regulations and the desire to improve  efficiency generates development opportunities for Veolia, with these  industries now required to limit their environmental footprint and  costs to guarantee the sustainability of their production. In the power generation sector, investment criteria are dominated by  the “3Ds”: Decentralized production; Digitalization to optimize  production and costs; Decarbonization for energy transition towards  renewable energies. The needs of the mining, metals and power industries are therefore  focused on reducing costs (in particular, reducing energy bills, which  account for 10-15% of average operating costs for mining and 20-40%  for steel), increasing production yield, reducing their environmental  footprint, controlling emissions, cutting decommissioning costs, and  reducing environmental liability risk. Veolia offers industrial companies in these sectors a full range of  services: ■design, build and operation of water production plants (e.g.  desalination) and wastewater and cooling water treatment and  reclamation plants (zero liquid discharge plants), acid mine  drainage treatment, waste recovery, etc.; ■optimization of operational performance thanks to a range of  services for utility efficiency and waste recovery; ■soil recovery and remediation; site recovery; ■financial engineering. Veolia offers customers its portfolio of technologies, operational  experience and global network thanks to which it can deploy its best  services around the world, coupled with its ability to operate at  remote sites and to provide or propose funding: The food and beverage and pharmaceutical/cosmetics  industries The food and beverage industry, which is the world’s largest industrial  sector, needs to respond to population growth, especially in high  water stress regions, and the increasingly stringent demands of  consumers and industry stakeholders in terms of environmental and  societal responsibility. It is a highly fragmented industry with tens of  millions of producers worldwide. On May 20, 2020, the European  Commission published its “Farm to fork” strategy as part of the Green  Deal. This strategy defines a new approach aimed at making the  European food system more sustainable while delivering economic,  social and health benefits. It provides for the publication of  recommendations and legislative proposals in the coming years (by  2024) for the production of “green” food and to encourage the  consumption of more healthy food. It will also help promote energy  recovery from biowaste and the reuse of wastewater, facilitate  recycling of food packaging through requirements covering recycling  and the ability to recycle and support the development of innovative  solutions for sustainable farming. Growth in the pharmaceutical and cosmetics market is being driven, in  particular, by access to medicine in emerging countries (where the  main players in the sector are creating new production capabilities). In  mature countries, the companies in the sector are subject to efficiency  constraints and cost reductions because of the ramp-up of generic  drugs. The pharmaceutical sector is undergoing major transformation:  supply chain reorganization, moves to relocate production facilities in  Europe or the United States, growing demand for waste processing  and recycling, massive R&I expenditure on vaccines. For Veolia, these  changes offer new commercial opportunities tied, for example, to  higher waste volumes, the construction of new plants and the  transformation or outsourcing of industrial utilities. In mature countries, the needs of industrial food and beverage, and  pharmaceutical/cosmetics firms are focused on overhauling and  optimizing  existing  assets,  complying  with  environmental  requirements, improving the traceability and quality of products,  limiting operational risk, and brand recognition and image. In growing  markets, companies in these industries need support with their  development through the construction of the associated production  plants and treatment facilities, but also through the use of resources  that do not put them in competition with the community they serve  (right to operate), for example through minimal water usage  (particularly in the beverage sector), recycling of packaging and  organic waste-to-energy recovery. ABOUT THE GROUP Business lines VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 39  ===== PAGE 42 ===== Veolia enables industrial farming, food and beverage, and  pharmaceutical and cosmetics firms to reduce their environmental  impact by improving their operational performance for water and  energy cycle management, and by recovering the byproducts of their  operations. Veolia has a real competitive advantage in this market,  thanks to its comprehensive, integrated offerings (combining water,  waste and energy management and treatment solutions), and its  proprietary technologies (such as water reuse technologies or organic  waste anaerobic digestion enabling energy recovery). Veolia therefore  supports the growth of companies in these sectors by offering  solutions that enable them to use water, materials and energy more  efficiently. It brings together cross-functional solutions that safeguard  these companies’ right to operate, performance and brand image. As  with the other industries, Veolia’s strategy is to work with its  customers to co-develop innovative solutions that help create  economic, social and environmental value. The circular economy The circular economy aims primarily to implement solutions to extend  the life of resources (materials, water and energy). This is a key issue  for customers and a source of high expectations due to the pressure  on resources, increasingly favorable regulation (in Europe, with the  end of landfill and the enforcement of extended producer  responsibility; in the United States, where there is a noticeable  increase in uptake of new value creation models; and in China, a  country that is moving its regulation towards fostering a sustainable  economy), and the shift in society towards a circular, sharing and  functional economy. Veolia has set itself the aim of strengthening its  leadership in this area by deploying existing technologies, innovating  and positioning itself as a stakeholder that creates shared value. Cities and industrial firms are thus becoming producers of alternative  resources and local supply loops are emerging. Veolia helps its customers to create value by: ■supplying materials and manufactured goods produced from  waste, wastewater and waste energy: technical and special waste  (e.g. plastics, paper, cardboard, rare earth metals from electrical  and electronic equipment, solvents, etc.) organic matter (e.g.  compost, fertilizers, etc.), refuse-derived fuels (RDF), biogas,  biomass, etc.; ■offering bespoke solutions for preserving and renewing resources  in  a  circular  economy  model:  comprehensive  resource  management, pooling of multi-customer platforms (regional  ecology, green district heating, industrial wastewater reuse, etc.),  and energy and electricity efficiency for buildings and industrial  sites. In the plastics sector, where production and consumption are  increasing steadily, regulation is progressively moving towards  recycling and a ban on putting plastic in landfills. In Europe and Asia,  in particular, the recycled plastics market is expected to increase  around 6% annually to 2025. The Group aims to develop an industrial  plastic recycling and recovery activity to offer an alternative to virgin  materials. Veolia has therefore set-up a plastic recycling industrial  platform with European locations in France, the United Kingdom,  Germany, Benelux and Spain and Asian locations in China, South  Korea, Japan and Indonesia. Veolia is also working in partnership with  industrial companies on the implementation of solutions to develop  plastic recycling loops. For example, in 2019-2020 Veolia built a plastic  recycling plant in Indonesia, in partnership with Danone. Hazardous waste processing and recovery Some complex waste and effluent is hazardous to health and the  environment, so it requires high levels of expertise and non-standard  equipment. There is a general awareness of the risks (health,  ecological, environmental, etc.) of difficult-to-treat pollutants, which  are subject to increasingly restrictive regulation. A limited number of operators are currently capable of managing  hazardous waste and complex effluent (discharges and waste from  the chemical, oil, metals and nuclear industries; electrical/electronic  waste; hospital waste; soil remediation; etc.), and meeting customers’  needs: cost optimization, reducing environmental liability risk,  appropriate and complete processing facilities compliant with  regulations, and improved ecological footprint. The tightening of local regulations and the increase in the volumes of  waste being produced (particularly waste produced by the chemical,  oil, metallurgy and nuclear industries and electrical and electronic  equipment waste) both support Veolia’s decision to further develop its  position in processing difficult types of pollution and particularly  hazardous waste, a market with high growth potential. Veolia has a  worldwide network of experts and resources that have been  developed gradually over years and can be rapidly mobilized and a full  range of technologies and services for processing difficult-to-treat  effluents (Veolia Water Technologies) and hazardous waste, and for  soil remediation (SARPI ThinkTech). They meet the highest standards  and are supported by cutting-edge research. The Group develops new facilities in developing countries (in Africa,  the Middle East, Latin America and Asia) and consolidates its existing  facilities (in Europe, the United States and China) by expanding its  network of processing plants and saturating its assets. Management of end-of-life industrial facilities and  equipment The increase in the number of industrial facilities and obsolete  equipment that have either reached the end of their service life,  sustained damage as a result of natural disasters or industrial  accidents or pose a risk of contamination offers significant  opportunities for growth for Veolia. Management of the end-of-life of  these industrial assets (oil rigs, ships, trains, aircraft, power stations  and brownfield sites) must comply with various restrictions or goals:  preventing contamination risk (presence of asbestos, oil, chemicals,  etc.), optimizing materials recycling and equipment reuse, and  remediating polluted soil so the land can be put to new use. The Group offers a full range of services, comprising waste processing  (including hazardous waste), recycling to maximize asset value, soil  remediation, minimizing safety and environmental risk (back fitting  facilities), and turnkey management of projects to decommission  facilities throughout the value chain (inventory and characterization  of the elements to be decommissioned, demolition, and recovery or  disposal of waste, including its traceability). Industrial customers must prevent the risk of contamination, recycle  materials and reuse equipment as much as possible, locally and at low  cost and may even be required to decontaminate sites before new  business activities can be started. Veolia is expanding its operations in  this new area by focusing on key accounts and positioning itself  throughout the entire value chain, from dismantling services to  upgrading equipment to ensure that it complies with current  regulations and materials recovery. The Group is renowned for its  skills and cutting-edge technologies for soil decontamination,  recycling waste and processing hazardous pollution (such as nuclear  waste and asbestos), as well as for its ability to offer high-quality  project management throughout the entire value chain, thereby  guaranteeing, among other things, traceability and responsible waste  management. In this area, Veolia is active in the dismantling of  offshore oil platforms, trains and ships, as well as the characterization  of nuclear waste. ABOUT THE GROUP Business lines 40 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 43 ===== 1.3.4.2  Competition Most markets for environmental services are very competitive and are  characterized by increasing technological challenges due to changes in  regulation, as well as by the presence of experienced competitors. The  competitive landscape is very diverse, but there are few players that  are comparable to Veolia at global level. Veolia’s competitors can be broken down into four broadly  homogeneous categories, in terms of their geographic footprint and  extent of their range of services. 1.3.4.2.1  Global multi-service companies Global multi-service companies have both a global geographic  footprint and an extensive range of services in the Water, Waste and  Energy business lines. Veolia belongs to this category, as do Suez, FCC  and Remondis, although none of these three have a presence outside  Water and Waste. These different players share the same  springboards for growth: emerging economies, industrial markets, the  circular economy, new technologies and high value-added services.  New players, primarily Chinese, are developing global activities in  Water, Waste and Energy, through strategies founded on sustained  external growth (Beijing Group, China EverBright Group). What sets  Veolia apart are its larger geographic footprint; its more extensive  range of services, including Energy; the synergies between its Water,  Waste and Energy business lines; its portfolio of technologies enabling  it to tackle all water treatment problems; and its huge portfolio of  industrial customers. 1.3.4.2.2  Global specialists Global specialists are companies that specialize in one of Veolia’s  business lines and have a worldwide geographic presence. This  category includes, in particular, major players in the energy market,  such as Engie and E.on, global equipment manufacturers, such as  Doosan and Schneider Electric, oil and gas specialists, and specialists in  energy efficiency and facility management (Vinci FM, Sodexo): ■in a context of energy sector transformation, particularly in Europe,  energy companies have been repositioning themselves in the  renewable energy sector in recent years, as well as in energy  efficiency  services.  Moreover,  these  companies  are  professionalizing their approach through digital innovations  (control centers, network optimization, the Internet of Things, etc.); ■the major equipment manufacturers and suppliers of water  packaging products, such as Xylem, Ecolab, Kurita, Solenis, Itron  and Doosan, have a presence in both the municipal and industrial  markets. Their growth strategies are mainly based on developing  digital offerings, such as control centers and the Internet of Things.  In emerging countries, Veolia faces off against Spanish and  Brazilian civil-engineering firms (ACS, Sacyr, Acciona, Odebrecht),  particularly in seawater desalination projects, or Asian equipment  manufacturers, such as Hyflux (based in Singapore) and Wabag  (based in India), which are gradually moving into operations; ■in the field of oil and gas, the competition is relatively fragmented.  In addition to the large equipment manufacturers cited above, the  competition comprises engineering companies, service providers  and equipment manufacturers (Ecosphere Environmental Services),  as well as energy companies, especially in the United States, where  we find oil service operators (Schlumberger, Halliburton, Fractech  and Baker Hughes-GE) and engineering and construction  companies (WorleyParsons, KBR, Wood Group, Bechtel, Technip,  Aker Solutions); ■many companies operate in the decommissioning market, owing  to the variety of industrial infrastructure reaching the end of its  working life: oil rigs (Stork, Cape, Hertel and Bilfinger),  petrochemical plants (Amec, AF Group, Aker Stord, Able UK),  nuclear  reactors  (Framatome,  Onet,  Bouygues,  Vinci,  Westinghouse, Amec, Nukem, Iberdrola, Ansaldo, Tractebel), and  transportation, such as ships, trains and aircrafts (Tarmac  Aerosave); ■in the energy efficiency field for the services sector, competition  takes many forms, and comes from both specialized companies  (cleaning, food services, etc.) seeking to expand their offering into  energy, as well as technical maintenance companies focusing on  areas such as electrical facilities which are increasingly forming  partnerships with major construction and public works groups  (Vinci Energies, Bouygues-Equans, Spier) and groups specializing in  facility management (Sodexo, JLL.), or equipment manufacturers  diversifying in digital and services (Schneider Electric, Johnson  Controls, Honeywell). Veolia sets itself apart from all these companies through its very broad  positioning on the value chains of the Water, Waste and Energy  business lines, through synergies between these three, and through  its ability to guarantee its customers long-term reliability and  performance, thanks to its combined engineering/construction and  operational capabilities. 1.3.4.2.3  Local or regional specialists Unlike global specialists, local or regional specialists have a geographic  footprint limited to one country or region of the world. They set the  standard in their market, with a range of expert offerings positioned  in specific business lines. This category remains perhaps the largest in  the market. In fact, Veolia faces a multitude of local specialists in the  various countries of the world, such as: ■in the United States, Veolia’s main competitors in Waste are:  Waste Management and Republic Services, which are developing  circular economy offerings; Clean Harbors, which specializes in  services to industrial firms and processing hazardous waste;  Heritage, hazardous waste specialist; Stericycle, which specializes  in  hospital  waste  and  Enviri  which  specializes  in  soil  decontamination; ■in France, Idex and Dalkia (EDF group) are positioned in local  energy loops and energy efficiency services; Saur concentrates on  water activities; Paprec focuses on waste recycling and recovery; ■in the majority of countries, there are municipalities managing  water, waste or energy within well-defined geographic boundaries. An emerging category of new players is leveraging new digital  technologies to optimize services to the end customer: broking  platforms, advanced algorithm software solutions (e.g. Rubicon Global  (United States), BH Technologies, Trinov (France), Takadu (Israel). Veolia sets itself apart from these companies through the effects of  scale linked to its size, its ability to offer comprehensive services  (multi-site and multi-business), the synergies between its business  lines, and its ability to integrate construction and operation, thereby  guaranteeing long-term reliability. 1.3.4.2.4  Local/regional multi-service  companies In some developing countries, private or public/private companies  have a large local footprint and are the leading players in local  markets where Veolia also operates. Accordingly, the Singapore-based  Sembcorp Group is a competitor of Veolia in the Water and Energy  businesses and focuses on construction and operation in emerging  countries. Veolia sets itself apart from these companies through the effects of  scale linked to its size, its ability to offer comprehensive services  (multi-site and multi-business) and the synergies between its business  lines. ABOUT THE GROUP Business lines VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 41  ===== PAGE 44 ===== 1.4  Research and Innovation Driving ecological innovation, with and for all our stakeholders, is  Veolia’s pathway to addressing the challenges of ecological   transformation (climate change mitigation and adaptation, resource  scarcity and regeneration, multiple pollutions, threats to biodiversity)  and allowing everyone to meet their biological, human and social  needs with the aim of improving quality and sustainability of life on  our planet. Veolia develops innovations and solutions meeting three different  timescales: ■innovating to repair the consequences of ecological debt in the  short term, such as treating pollution, adopting a circular economy  approach to recycling waste and restoring biodiversity; ■innovating to adapt to extreme weather conditions in the medium  term, while anticipating the future imbalances and disruptions  that could potentially be caused by adaptation solutions, such as  the soaring growth of the electric vehicle market; ■innovating to transform the Group’s social and business models,  and guarantee their “net zero impact” in the long term, including  eco-design, bioconversion of waste, CO2 capture and storage, etc. Ecological innovation must be solutions-based in order to truly make a  difference and positively impact the climate and the environment.  Innovation relies on dialogue and consultation with all stakeholders,  including the Group’s customers, industry professionals and local  authorities, start-ups, scientific communities, partners and citizens, to  create active collaboration ecosystems. The innovation areas developed by Veolia comprise several  dimensions, such as scientific, technological, commercial, social and  societal (see Section 4.3 below) and the innovation of business model,  to create the new services and markets required to move the  ecological transformation forward. For Veolia, innovation is everyone’s concern. The Group counts on an  internal innovation ecosystem which is not limited to research and  development centers, but encompasses all Business Units. Veolia also  relies on start-up external ecosystems to accelerate the development  of innovative solutions meeting the challenges of ecological  transformation.  1.4.1  RESEARCH AND INNOVATION SUPPORTING THE GROUP’S ECOLOGICAL  TRANSFORMATION Veolia relies on the scientific and technological expertise and skills of  its Research and Innovation (R&I) teams to innovate in the following  areas: water resource and cycle management; improvement of water  treatment processes, wastewater treatment and recovery; detection  and treatment of new pollutants (in water, waste and air); waste  reduction, recycling and recovery; secondary raw materials; green  energy production from water and waste; energy optimization of  facilities; decarbonizing customer activities. Research actions are coordinated by Veolia Recherche et Innovation  (VERI), which is integrated into the Department of Scientific and  Technological Expertise (S&TE) part of the Business Support and  Performance Department (BS&P). The research teams support all the Group’s business lines, divided  between three major areas of activity: Water, Waste, Energy.  Through their internationally recognized scientific and technological  expertise, Veolia’s R&I activities serve the operational excellence of  both the Group and its customers, by offering innovative solutions  which address their challenges and needs, helping in particular to  improve economic and environmental performance. At the end of 2023, Veolia has 14 research and development centers  worldwide, with high-performance technical resources, to develop and  experiment on its innovations: ■in France, four sites are dedicated to research on wastewater,  drinking water, industrial water and pure water; on energy  production and efficiency; and on waste management, including  the sorting and characterization of secondary raw materials. These  sites include 30 laboratories which specialize in analyzing solid,  liquid and gas matrices; ■Veolia also has three centers in Spain (Barcelona, Andalusia and  Galicia) and one in Chile. The research activities conducted there  relate to: ecofactories, aimed at transforming wastewater  treatment plants into bio-plants to recover resources (carbon,  nutrients, by-products, precious metals, etc.) from wastewater;  management  of  critical  infrastructure  and  resilience;  environmental, economic and social sustainability; management of  water resources; water 4.0; ■finally, there are six additional research centers around the world  (Canada, United States and Switzerland). In addition, wide range of demonstration equipment make it possible  to validate the technologies and ensure their reliability. These pilots  are located at research sites and within Veolia operating sites. To develop and facilitate innovation, the Group has deployed an  operating model of Innovation Hubs led by the Strategy and  Innovation Department (SID) since 2022.  Each of the innovation themes identified in the Impact 2023 strategic  program (climate change adaptation, new energy services, new  material loops, food chain, health and new pollutants) are dealt with  by an Innovation Hub, involving a zone, and thereby capitalizing on  the knowledge of the Group’s local market.  The set-up of this community of Innovation Hubs enables the Group to  allocate its strategic innovation priorities, while continuing to develop  incremental innovation projects. This allocation of priorities and  efforts makes it possible to accelerate innovation by industrializing  innovative solutions, in close proximity to markets and customers. In 2023, Veolia’s R&I activities involved over 630 researchers and  developers, as well as experts present in all Group entities. The total budget for research and innovation was approximately €170  million in 2023.  ABOUT THE GROUP Research and Innovation 42 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 45 ===== 1.4.2  SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS - SUCCESS AND  PROGRESS The achievements presented below are concrete actions of Veolia  Research and Innovation serving customers and Group growth and  contributing to Veolia’s ecological innovation. 1.4.2.1  Climate change adaptation Reuse of treated wastewater: SmartFertiReuse  innovation In a context of increasingly scarce water resources and the search for  alternatives to synthetic fertilizers, Veolia is developing fertigation  solutions for agricultural crops using treated wastewater. Projects in  this area have demonstrated water and fertilizer savings for arable  crops. One of these projects, SmartFertiReuse, allowed to design a  digital irrigation management tool for agricultural fields, using  treated wastewater. It was developed and finalized by DEST teams,  following the success of the experimental project for irrigation of  agricultural fields using treated wastewater from the Aureilhan  station in the Hautes-Pyrénées (France). The project’s sponsor, Sede  Environnement, is preparing to deploy this innovation widely in  France. Reuse of treated wastewater: an ultrafiltration  pilot for the Jourdain program The Jourdain demonstrator (2018-2027) is a pioneering program led by  Vendée Eau (France) for the reuse of treated wastewater (REUT), to  secure the supply of drinking water in France and Europe. It has  received strong financial support from Vendée Eau partners: the Loire- Brittany Water Agency, the Pays-de-la-Loire Region, Europe through  the ERDF and the Vendée Department. One of the components of this  program – the refining unit, inaugurated on November 16, 2023, and  whose construction and operation was awarded to Veolia until 2027 –  will produce high-quality water from wastewater. The Jourdain  program also includes a research program focusing on different  indirect REUT solutions. It is in this context that the Design  Engineering team designed, assembled and commissioned an  ultrafiltration (UF) pilot to validate the UF membrane technology for  these solutions. Climate change adaptation: technological solutions WTS presented zeeDENSE, a municipal wastewater intensification  solution using WTS’s zeeLung MABR technology, enabling the load to  be increased by up to 50% and the hydraulic capacity of an existing  wastewater treatment plant to be improved.  WTS also launched zeeNAMMOX, a technology that treats high  ammonia wastewater produced by aerobic digestion of municipal  water, at an optimised energy cost. Climate change adaptation: nature-based solutions  (NbS) Veolia is involved in the resilient management of the large water cycle  and has developed over 25 nature-based solutions (NbS) around the  world in recent years, responding to the challenges of climate change  adaptation. These solutions cover storm water management, flood  prevention and protection, storage and treatment before reuse of  treated wastewater, and groundwater recharge. In 2023, Veolia was  involved in six European research and innovation projects in this area,  aiming in particular to standardize performance monitoring of nature- based solutions and test new uses. Veolia shared its experience in  nature-based solutions at a side event at the United Nations Water  Conference in March 2023 and at the Aquatech Amsterdam trade fair  in November 2023.  1.4.2.2  Decarbonization and new energy  services Heating and cooling networks of the future: so- called 5th generation networks Veolia is committed to developing next-generation networks that  meet the growing need for ambient heat loops and a decarbonized  energy mix. Veolia will support the development of the 5th generation exchange  grid at the Paris-Saclay urban campus by strengthening production  infrastructure and optimizing and diversifying its energy mix. Unique  in Europe, the facility will enable the development of an ambitious  energy mix combining deep geothermal energy, fatal heat recovered  from the CNRS supercomputer and heat recovered from the cooling  network. To promote these exchanges between cold and hot, the heat  and cold is produced at decentralized substations that are connected  to each other by an ambient heat loop. Energy transition: meeting the hydrogen needs of  territories In its search for decarbonized energy solutions to meet collective  urban mobility needs, Veolia maximizes the use of green hydrogen  from renewable sources, such as the Group’s waste-to-energy  facilities. Veolia has formed partnerships in Hong Kong around the  construction and operation of a biogas-to-hydrogen conversion  facility. This facility is expected to have a production capacity of 250kg  of green hydrogen per day. It will serve as a demonstrator to assess  the potential of deploying this technology on a large scale at the  Group’s other landfill sites. Electric vehicles: vehicle-to-grid In a context of increasing adoption of electric vehicles, lower battery  costs and the need to balance energy demand and production, Veolia  is looking to develop models around electricity flexibility and vehicle  batteries. In the United Kingdom, Veolia contributes to the resilience of the  electricity grid with the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, by feeding  energy stored by batteries installed in its waste collection vehicle fleet  back into the grid – a first in the UK. 1.4.2.3 New material loops Circularity in our societies To limit the impact of human activity on natural resources, Veolia is  paving the way for new materials loops, developing new circular  activities for materials crucial to everyday life: batteries, clothing,  packaging, electronic waste, etc. Veolia has also started work to develop the recycling channels for new  flows: electric vehicle batteries, wind turbine blade composites,  precious metals or specific solvents used in microelectronics. In close  connection with its industrial partners and public authorities, the  Group is addressing sovereignty issues, by limiting our dependence on  imports of virgin materials and strengthening the self-sufficiency of  territories. ABOUT THE GROUP Research and Innovation VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 43  ===== PAGE 46 ===== 1.4.2.4 Food chain Bioconversion by insects Veolia Bioconversion Malaysia has obtained TRACES approval to  export Entomeal TM insect meal and Entolipid insect oil to Europe for  use in animal feed. This recognition ensures the safety and traceability  of the production process with regard to European standards. At the  same time, Veolia has launched a pilot bioconversion project in New  Zealand to convert food industry by-products for animal and plant  nutrition. This project is being conducted in collaboration with the  New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research and Massey  University, and is supported by the Ministry for Primary Industries  through the Sustainable Food and Fibre Futures fund. 1.4.2.5 Health and new pollutants Assessing drinking water quality: an innovative  approach A  new  analysis  strategy  combining  chemical  analysis  of  micropollutants and measuring potential toxic effects has been  implemented and tested by S&TE. This strategy has been shown to be  useful for monitoring the quality of water during the drinking water  treatment process. With this expertise, S&TE is now able to offer this  approach to all Business Units as part of study programs for advanced  monitoring of water quality. Measuring E.coli bacteria in drinking water: results  in less than seven hours The collaboration between Veolia and the start-up Redberry has  demonstrated the performance of an innovative analytical method  that reduces the time to quantify Escherichia coli (E.coli) bacteria in  drinking water to less than seven hours, compared to traditional  methods that require eighteen to forty-eight hours. The North  America zone is assessing the potential of this technology through  additional testing, analyzing total flora and E.coli in treated  wastewater. Microplastics: presentation of MEDITPLAST  project results at Monaco Ocean Week 2023 In March 2023, at the request of the BeMed association (Beyond Plastic  Med), supported by the Veolia Foundation, S&TE participated in a  round table on microplastics in the ocean. The impact of microplastics  on wastewater treatment systems and the results of the MEDITPLAST  collaborative project conducted with Veolia Eau in the Mediterranean  Region and funded by the Rhone Mediterranean Corsica Water  Agency, were presented. This project aims to identify emission sources  and the occurrence of microplastics in the water cycle in the coastal  territory of the Toulon Provence Mediterranean Metropolitan area  (France). New wastewater solution: Veolia Foundation and  S&TE joint project From September to November 2023, the Limay (France) research  center welcomed Veoliaforce experts from the Veolia Foundation for a  series of tests designed to perfect a new wastewater solution  developed by the Veolia Foundation. The objective is to provide the  humanitarian sector with a reliable, low-energy solution, that is  adaptable and can be easily dismantled, deployed and operated by  local teams. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS):  ongoing research and innovation efforts PFAS are a major concern for Veolia in France and internationally.  Veolia is vigilant and monitors regulatory and scientific developments  to meet customer expectations and assist them where necessary. The  important point is that PFAS must be considered globally, from  production to possible degradation. The stakes are multiple. Veolia  actively monitors both the potential to propose solutions to customers  and the Group's own exposure to PFAS risk. The Group has mature  treatment solutions with varying levels of efficiency. It is continuing  its research and innovation efforts to strengthen the effectiveness of  treatment and prevent pollution transfer. Research is focusing, in  particular, on degradation conditions and the behavior of PFAS  subjected to different heat treatment regimes, to improve treatment  technology and the ability to detect and analyze these compounds.  The field of investigation is vast and R&D work is carried out with  public and private partners to monitor innovation. Treatment systems: new technological solutions WTS has launched a new generation of pressurized UF membranes for  the municipal drinking water and industrial process water market, as  well as two new nanofiltration membranes to address the global  challenge of micropollutants in municipal drinking water. WTS also presented EDI eCell ME-5 Pico, an electro-deionization  technology that removes ions from ultrapure water for the high-end  microelectronics industry which requires an ionic concentration of less  than 1 ppb (parts per billion). Project STOPP: making plastic food packaging use  more circular  Project STOPP (Strategies TO prevent and reduce Plastic Packaging  pollution from the food system) aims to develop strategies to make  the use of plastic food packaging more circular. Coordinated by the  Technical Research Center of Finland (VTT), it brings together 14  partners from seven European countries.  The project will rely on technological developments, business  strategies and consumer behavior studies. S&TE teams, in conjunction  with the National Institute of Chemistry in Slovenia and VTT, will focus  on analyzing potentially toxic pollutants in food plastics and will be  involved in the design of new value chains and associated business  models.  Indoor air quality: deployment of Hubgrade Air  solution  In 2023, Veolia deployed the innovative Hubgrade Air solution for  monitoring and optimizing indoor air quality. In three months, the  solution was deployed in 350 buildings across nine different countries.  This innovation has reached maturity and is being rolled out in the  Business Units.  1.4.2.6 Scientific outreach Scientific conferences organized by the  “Mathematical Modeling and Biodiversity” Chair  Partners since 2009, the École Polytechnique, the École Polytechnique  Foundation, the French National Museum of Natural History and  Veolia regularly organize scientific conferences. In February 2023,  some 60 participants gathered to discuss the development of  solutions to address the interrelated issues of climate change ecology  and health. ABOUT THE GROUP Research and Innovation 44 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 47 ===== Veolia participates in the “Tuesdays of Innovation”  conference cycle Veolia representatives spoke at a series of conferences: “Access to  drinking water, a constant public health challenge”, “Responsible  water management, a fundamental challenge for sustainable  development” and “Towards a circular water economy''.  Organized by  the Paris Club of Innovation Directors and the European Institute for  Creative Strategies and Innovation, these conferences present in- depth scientific analyzes and testimonies from committed actors on  the ground. They are aimed at professionals in innovation, sustainable  development and CSR. Patronage Veolia and the Foundation of the French  Academy of Medicine: presentation to the French  National Assembly  Closed in June 2023, this patronage, which began in 2020, allowed  Veolia and the Foundation of the French Academy of Medicine to  discuss environmental and health issues with a strong shared  ambition: raise awareness, inform and communicate with all  stakeholders (citizens, authorities, media, industry, scientists) on the  risks to human health of exposure to chemical pollutants in the  environment. A white paper, summarizing the closing session, and a  glossary, popularizing the main concepts associated with exposome  and chemical risks, were published. First edition of the Veolia Institute and S&TE  scientific talks  In November 2023, more than 300 participants attended this event  devoted to the fundamentals of health and of the environment. These  talks aim to make scientific knowledge accessible to as many  employees as possible, to inform the Group on the issues at stake and  to prepare for the future. After defining the concept of environmental  health, the assessment and consideration of the impact of chemical  pollutants on human health and the environment were discussed. Symposium of Veolia’s 300 analysis laboratories Neomab Symposium is an event open to all Veolia laboratories.

In a mature French waste market, legal and regulatory developments  offer a favorable framework for the transition to a circular economy. The circular economy roadmap and the law for energy transition and  green growth establish ambitious goals for reducing the tonnage of  waste taken to landfills (-50% between 2010 and 2050) and replacing  it with recycling and the use of waste as a resource and a source of  energy.  In addition, in France, the law on the new territorial organization of  the French Republic (the “NOTRe” law) led to the regrouping of public  authorities and the overhaul of the scope of waste collection and  processing (public administrative area groupings (EPIC), metropolitan  areas, urban communities, joint agencies, etc.). Law no. 2020-105 of  February 10, 2020 on fighting waste and the circular economy seeks to  accelerate the change in the production and consumption model in  order to limit waste and preserve natural resources, biodiversity and  the climate. Therefore, while looking for economically-efficient  collection and recovery services, market players (local authorities and  industrial companies) commit to production and consumption  methods using less non-renewable resources. The Waste Solutions business is implementing a new customer  strategy to give effect to ecological transformation. It is prioritizing  the development of recycling and the production of renewable energy,  by placing collection activities at their service. This approach focuses  on three defining objectives: ■Strengthening support to our customers to help them increase  recycling and recovery and thereby reduce landfill waste:  development of new eco-design services and full circular loops and  strengthening of industrial management of material flows to  improve traceability, produce higher quality recycled materials and  promote the reuse of these materials in production cycles; ■Developing the production of green energy from waste that cannot  be recycled, in particular through strengthening the industrial  performance of installations and developing new energy  production facilities powered by refuse-derived fuel with majority  biogenic content; ■Developing new waste collection systems for our customers. Rail or  water transport, or even more virtuous road transport could  therefore meet industrial and municipal customer requirements  depending on their region. New technologies, new performance- based contractual terms and innovative partnerships will renew  collection services.

ABOUT THE GROUP Organization of the Group and other information relating to its operations VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 55  ===== PAGE 58 ===== 1.5.2.3  Rest of the world The Rest of the world segment consists of four zones or delegated zones: North America, Latin America, Asia, Pacific, Africa/Middle East. As of December 31, 2023 Revenue (€ million) % Group revenue EBITDA (€ million) % Group EBITDA 11,907  26.3%  1,925  29.4%  North America Veolia is active in water, energy and waste management in North  America, serving agglomerations, cities, public authorities, hospitals,  university campuses and industry. In the North America Zone (United  States, Canada) the Group’s activity scope was extended in 2022  mainly to include Suez’s regulated and unregulated water activities in  the United States and hazardous and non-hazardous waste activities  in Canada (Alberta and Quebec), The Suez Advanced Solutions activity  was sold at the end of 2023. The Group is a leading provider of operations management and  maintenance services for drinking water and wastewater networks  and plants in the North American sector via public-private  partnerships with agglomerations, cities and public bodies. Capital  Project Management (CPM) activities are high-growth complementary  services proposed by Veolia North America to its municipal water  customers. For industrial customers, Veolia is primarily involved in the Water and  Waste business lines, in the oil and gas industry (primarily refineries:  regeneration services, processing of oil sludge, hazardous waste  processing,  etc.),  chemicals,  mining  and  metals  and  the  pharmaceutical  industry.  Veolia  turns  industrial  customers’  environmental challenges into circular economy solutions, by viewing  waste disposal as an opportunity to create an energy source or making  new products through industrial by-product reclamation processes  and beneficial reuse programs. These solutions, and particularly resource recovery and regeneration  activities, are some of Veolia’s primary areas of development in North  America following its recent success in potash recovery and the  treatment and recycling of wastewater. With the expansion of its  regeneration offerings, elemental sulfur, spent sulfuric acid and sulfur  gases are now used to produce clean fuming and non-fuming sulfuric  acids and other high-value sulfur derivative (HVSD) products for use in  a wide range of industrial activities across the United States. Veolia also has a strong presence in the hazardous waste market in  North America and notably accompanies pharmaceutical and  petrochemical companies, electronic companies for semi-conductors,  as well as companies in the defense and health sectors and  universities and public authorities. In particular, the Company  operates four incineration facilities at two sites in Texas and Illinois. In addition, Veolia took over Alcoa USA Corporation’s hazardous waste  processing site in 2020, located in Gum Springs, Arkansas. With this  acquisition, Veolia continues the global expansion of its hazardous  waste processing and recycling activity and adds a flagship site to its  existing portfolio. To boost its even further in the hazardous waste market, at the end of  2023 Veolia acquired United States Industrial Technologies based in  Michigan. Veolia offers operation and maintenance solutions in the energy  sector to service sector customers, as well as energy efficiency services  and consulting solutions. Latin America In Latin America, Veolia operates its Water, Waste (including  hazardous waste) and Energy business lines in Brazil, Argentina,  Uruguay, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Mexico, Ecuador and Panama.  Business in these countries was initially geared towards public  authorities. Since its total takeover of Proactiva in 2013, Veolia’s aim  has been to roll out high added-value solutions, such as hazardous  waste management in Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Chile. In  2019, Veolia acquired companies operating in the hazardous waste  sector, and particularly medical waste, in Ecuador and Chile. The delegated zone was strengthened by regulated water activities in  Chile (Aguas Andinas, the country’s leading water distribution and  wastewater treatment operator), as well as municipal water contracts  and services for the mining and petroleum industries in Columbia,  Mexico and Peru. The confirmed intent for “green” growth on the part of many  countries in the zone has meant a tightening of environmental  restrictions, leading industrial companies to implement recycling and  recovery solutions, control their environmental footprint more  effectively and use decarbonization solutions. In addition, Latin  American metropolitan authorities are working to support urban  growth by developing high-performing, efficient and sustainable  public services. The main focus areas for progress are: optimizing  public services, creating waste recovery solutions, rational water  resource management and protecting the natural environment. The current portfolio of activities provides an excellent basis for  development, to continue supplying the Group’s traditional offerings  to public authorities and industrial clients (particularly agro-food,  chemicals and oil) by providing offerings with significant added value.  Veolia is also rolling-out its energy efficiency offerings, particularly for  the industrial sector and buildings, such as hotels or hospitals. Asia Pacific Asia  In Asia, Veolia operates in its three major business lines. The main  drivers of development in Asia are the growth of urban populations  and support for traditional or emerging industrial channels in a long- term approach with regard to carbon and water footprints, the circular  economy and pollution treatment.  In Japan, Veolia is primarily focused on concession-model water  services and performance contracts, energy production from  renewable resources and the production of recycled plastic. Since 2021,  Veolia has also been a decisive player in hazardous waste, a very  fragmented sector in the country. In China, the Group holds traditional concession contracts through  joint ventures for drinking water production and wastewater services  (e.g. Shanghai Pudong, Kunming, Changzhou). In the Waste segment,  Veolia is one of the leading players in hazardous waste management  throughout the territory and has been developing emerging plastic,  electronic waste and battery recycling activities over the past few  years. The Group is also highly involved in the energy sector through  heating networks (Harbin, Jamusi) and industrial utilities contracts as  well as energy services for buildings. In Hong Kong, the Group is historically present in waste processing  (landfills, sludge, organic and hazardous waste treatment) and more  recently in optimizing energy services for buildings. ABOUT THE GROUP Organization of the Group and other information relating to its operations 56 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 59 ===== In Taiwan, Veolia operates in waste processing (incineration), soil  decontamination and more recently industrial services, particularly in  the pharmaceuticals sector via its joint venture Framosa with the  Taiwanese group SCI. In South Korea, Veolia is primarily focused on the industrial services  market, historically on water treatment and supply and more recently  on the processing of industrial waste (plastic, organic and hazardous  waste recycling). Veolia also performs services for buildings. In Singapore and South East Asia, Veolia mainly develops hazardous  and non-hazardous waste processing activities (incineration) and  industrial client services (process water and effluents, plastic  recycling). In India, Veolia is present in municipal water and industrial services,  and notably hazardous waste processing. Veolia’s markets in Asia are driven by the growth of advanced export  industries (microelectronics, pharmaceuticals, automobile) as well as  the greening of high water impact traditional industries that still  depend on a highly carbonized energy mix in a context threatened by  climate emergency and water stress. Australia and New Zealand In Australia and New Zealand, around 70% of Veolia’s activities are in  waste management, primarily for commercial and industrial  customers, with the remaining 30% split between municipal water  and industrial and energy services. The Suez merger contributed  additional waste collection, landfill and waste-to-energy activities,  through the recycling and recovery of municipal and industrial waste. In Australia, the adoption of ambitious targets for energy transition,  waste recovery and secure water supplies has created new  opportunities in our business lines. The main growth markets are  water and waste treatment and recovery, oil and gas industries,  mining, particularly lithium, and the emerging renewable energies  sector, including hydrogen. In New Zealand, Veolia is present in municipal water and is developing  industrial contracts with new services.  Veolia offers solutions meeting the growing needs of this region and  new policies and regulations by focusing, in particular, on waste-to- energy recovery to supply recycling channels and decarbonize the local  energy mix as well as the preservation of water resources mainly  through desalination to combat water stress. Africa/Middle East Africa and the Middle East are dynamic regions driven by very strong  demographic growth, rapid urbanization and growing environmental  awareness. Improving the coverage of essential services remains necessary to the  development of the African continent and therefore significantly  structures the municipal market. Veolia’s presence in Africa is focused  in Morocco and two regional clusters, one in Western Africa (Côte  d’Ivoire and Ghana), and the other in Southern Africa (South Africa,  Namibia and Botswana). In Morocco, Veolia provides electricity and  water distribution services and wastewater treatment services for the  agglomerations of Rabat, Tangier and Tetouan through three  concession contracts. It is also developing solutions for reusing treated  waste water. In Ghana, the mining company AngloGold Ashanti  renewed its confidence in Veolia to treat wastewater from its  activities in the Obuasi region. The mining industry offers potential for diversifying Veolia’s activities  in this region, where it intends to replicate its first references in Ghana  in on-site services. In Niger, political events in the summer of 2023 resulted in the  renationalization of the country’s drinking water services and  therefore Veolia’s lease contract was not renewed. Throughout this  crisis, Veolia managed to ensure service continuity and preserve the  health of Nigerians. In Namibia, Veolia supplies water to the city of  Windhoek from wastewater made fit for human consumption. In  South Africa, our activities include the supply of water to public  authorities and industrial clients, hazardous waste management and  on site services for industrial clients. The Group is also particularly attentive to the emergence on the  continent of new methods of accessing basic services, alongside  traditional centralized network solutions. In the Middle East, the Group is present in its three business lines in all  Gulf States, with municipalities, industrial companies and the service  sector. Following the Suez merger, the scope was strengthened by the  addition of activities in Saudi Arabia (hazardous waste processing), the  United Arab Emirates (commercial, industrial and medical waste  collection, urban cleaning services and industrial sites), Jordan  (drinking water conveyance and wastewater treatment in Amman),  Oman (construction/operation of landfills, seawater desalination),  Qatar (water and waste management), Lebanon (operation of  wastewater  treatment  plants)  and  Turkey  (municipal  waste  management). Pressure on water demand remains high in the region, where  desalination projects continue and are often for extremely high- capacity plants. The same is true for wastewater treatment plants.  Sustainable operation and maintenance contracts for waste and  wastewater services are also emerging. Veolia has a historical  presence in these market segments and recently strengthened its  position as co-leader, notably in the United Arab Emirates, with the  signature in 2022 of a historic agreement with ADNOC Refining, a  leading industrial group, for industrial hazardous waste processing  services as part of a consortium. At the same time, Veolia continues to penetrate the industrial market  targeting leading local petrochemical players, which call on the Group  for the treatment of their effluents and hazardous waste, as well as  the supply of process water. The service sector accounts for over half Veolia’s activities in the  Middle East through its subsidiary ENOVA, a joint venture with Majid- Al-Futtaim.

ABOUT THE GROUP Organization of the Group and other information relating to its operations 58 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 61 ===== 1.5.3  OTHER ACTIVITIES 1.5.3.1  Intellectual property The Group is committed to protecting its intellectual property rights -  particularly trademarks and patents - and its know-how, as they set it  apart from the competition and contribute to its ambition of making  Veolia a benchmark for ecological transformation. The Company owns a number of trademarks including the “Veolia”  brand, which is protected in France and internationally. The Group  applies a brand strategy that brings together the Water, Waste and  Energy businesses under a common brand name, “Veolia”. Innovation is a key factor in the growth and profitability of Veolia.  Veolia capitalizes on its know-how by developing innovative  technologies, processes and devices, as well as creating tools  combining the expertise of the Group’s businesses and new  technologies. Veolia seeks to protect these innovations by appropriate  means. Patented  inventions  demonstrate  the  Group’s  capacity  for  technological innovation and help differentiate its offerings. At the  end of 2023, the Group’s global portfolio comprised more than 5,000  patents and patent applications worldwide. In Veolia’s opinion, its business is not dependent on the existence or  validity of one or more of these patents, or on any contract covering  one or more intellectual property right(s). ABOUT THE GROUP Organization of the Group and other information relating to its operations VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 59  ===== PAGE 62 ===== 1.6  Environmental regulation The Group’s activities are subject to extensive, evolving and  increasingly stringent environmental regulations. These regulations  are generally technical and complex and impose significant  constraints, the most important of which are presented below. The majority of the Group’s activities require operating permits or  authorizations that define the rules governing the operation of  facilities. These operating permits are issued by public authorities  pursuant to authorization procedures encompassing the performance  of specific studies presenting, in particular, the environmental  footprint of the facilities. 1.6.1  INTERNATIONAL REGULATIONS At international level, there are no binding general environmental  regulations applicable to all countries, but rather a great many  international agreements that are often sector-based as well as  statements of principles. It was in this context that the draft Global  Pact for the environment was proposed in 2017, seeking to assemble  the principles of environmental law within a single regulation. World Health Organization Directives on health and water are issued  for countries to help them draft internal regulations governing water  quality. They set guidelines for the quality of drinking water and  emphasize the importance of the preventive management of health  risks. The fourth edition of the Guidelines for drinking-water quality  was published in March 2022. In September 2021, WHO published new  air quality guidelines.  The right of access to water is recognized by the majority of countries,  and access to clean water and sanitation was recognized by the United  Nations as a human right on July 28, 2010. 1.6.2  EUROPEAN REGULATIONS Environmental regulation in European Union (EU) countries is  primarily tied to European Directives and regulations. On December 11, 2019, the European Commission presented the  European Green Deal in its communication to the European  Parliament and the Council (ref. COM [2019] 640 final). This European  Green Deal represents the new sustainable growth strategy in all EU  areas of action, aimed at guaranteeing a fair and inclusive transition.  It provides a roadmap of actions aimed at promoting the efficient use  of resources notably by moving to a circular economy, and reducing  greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss and air, water and soil  pollution. It details the investment necessary and the financing  instruments available. The European Green Deal represents a new transversal framework for  the adoption of concrete measures in the short to medium term. It will  lead to the revision of numerous European directives and regulations. ABOUT THE GROUP Environmental regulation 60 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 63 ===== Regulations common to the three business lines        • biodiversity: the Rio Convention (1992) on Biological Diversity  sought to protect the diversity and wealth of ecosystems. In 2010,  the 10th Conference of Parties (COP) to this convention adopted the  Nagoya Protocol. This protocol provides for the adoption of a  strategic plan covering the 2011-2020 period and an agreement to  create the IPBES (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on  Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services). In order to guarantee the  application of this protocol at European level, Regulation 511/2014 of  April 16, 2014 established new rules governing compliance with  obligations concerning access to genetic resources and the sharing  of benefits arising from their utilization.; Hosted by Canada and  chaired by China at the end of 2022, COP15 saw the adoption of a  Global Biodiversity Framework for the period 2020-2030. This global  framework is based on four objectives (enhanced integrity of  ecosystems, species and genetic diversity; contribution by nature to  development goals; sharing of genetic resources; financial means)  accompanied by 23 targets to be achieved by 2030;   • major risks: Directive 2012/18/EU of July 4, 2012 on the control of  major accident hazards involving dangerous substances (Seveso 3).  This directive repeals the Seveso 2 Directive and establishes new  prevention rules primarily integrating the changes introduced by  the Classification, Labelling & Packaging (CLP) regulation; • fight against atmospheric pollution: Directive 2016/2284 of  December 14, 2016. The directive sets emission reduction  commitments for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, non-methane  volatile organic compounds, ammonia and fine particulate matter; • greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere: their increase has led  certain countries, as well as the international community, to  implement regulatory measures in order to limit this trend; • the Kyoto Protocol set a 2008-2012 greenhouse gas reduction  target of 8% for the European Union, based on 1990 emission  levels. Directive 2003/87/EC of October 13, 2003 created a  community-wide emissions trading system (EU ETS) that came  into force in 2005 and resulted in the creation of national  allowance allocation plans (NQAPs) for the period 2005-2007 and  then 2008-2012, corresponding to the commitment period of the  Kyoto Protocol. Directive 2009/29/EC of April 26, 2009 extended  the EU ETS to cover a third period (2013-2020), with a gradual  reduction in allowances allocated and new allocation procedures  in order to achieve a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions  by 2020 (compared with 1990 levels). The Kyoto Protocol was not  extended by recent COPs (Conference of the Parties), with only an  obligation to limit global warming to 2°C included in the 2015 Paris  Agreement, • Assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on  the environment: Directive 2011/92/EU of December 13, 2011 revised.  It introduced minimum requirements with regard to the type of  projects subject to assessment, the main obligations of developers,  the content of the assessment and the participation of the  competent authorities and the public; • reducing pollution: Directive 2010/75/EU of November 24, 2010 on  industrial emissions (known as the IED Directive). This directive  recast the 1996 integrated pollution prevention and control directive  (IPPC) and six sector-based directives. The scope of this directive was  extended to new activities, and administrative permits should be  issued  based  on  the  implementation  of  “best  available  techniques” (BAT) for reducing pollution and on an integrated  approach, taking into account emissions into air, water and soil,  waste management and energy efficiency. Obligations to monitor  emissions likely to contaminate soil and groundwater have been  introduced (new emission limit values). The IED Directive also  provides for the preparation of a “baseline report” on the state of  the site before the commissioning of the facilities or before a permit  for facilities is updated for the first time, and redefines the  requirements to restore the site once activities cease; • chemical products: Regulation (EC) 1907/2006 of December 18,  2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and  Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). This regulation seeks to reduce  the  health  and  environmental  risks  associated  with  the  manufacture and use of chemical substances and improve the  management of these risks throughout the life cycle of the  chemicals, in order to ensure better health, safety and  environmental protection. For the Group, as a user and producer of  such substances, this involves greater cooperation and a better  exchange of information with suppliers and customers. With the  same purpose as the REACH regulation, Regulation (EC) 1272/2008 of  December 16, 2008 on Classification, Labeling and Packaging (CLP),  harmonized the existing provisions and criteria concerning the  classification, packaging and labeling of hazardous substances  taking account of the adoption of the United Nations’ Globally  Harmonized System (GHS); The relevant legal entities are in  compliance with the schedule set by the REACH Regulation for  chemicals requiring registration within the Group. After the  systematic pre-registration of all substances that may be concerned,  various deadlines are being monitored along with changes to the  regulation and updates to its annexes. The regulations on persistent  organic pollutants (POPs) (Stockholm Convention and Regulation  (EU) 2019/1021 of June 20, 2019) also have an impact on the Group’s  activities; • biocides: Regulation (EU) 528/2012 of May 22, 2012 concerning the  making available on the market and use of biocidal products. This  regulation strengthened the control of biocides and harmonized  authorization procedures; ABOUT THE GROUP Environmental regulation VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 61  ===== PAGE 64 ===== • Directive 2018/410/EU of March 14, 2018 extends and redefines  European Union emission trading system rules for a fourth period  (2021-2030 - phase IV). Combustion facilities with a thermal  output greater than 20 MW and certain industrial companies  falling within the scope of the directive are subject to the  European Union emission trading system and registered in the  national allowance allocation plans introduced since 2005 in all EU  Member States. As from 2021, the allowances available in the  European Union emission trading system will be reduced on a  linear basis by 2.2% per year and Member States shall auction at  least 57% of allowances. The free allocations stipulated for the  heating sector will also be gradually reduced, except for district  heating networks which will still receive free allocations of 30% of  their allowances until 2030. The calculation and benchmark  methodologies for estimating required allowances based on past  pollution levels were also adjusted for phase IV. A cross-sector  correction factor may also be applied by the European Union to  adjust any over or under allocation of allowances, • to support a robust price signal, a stability reserve was  implemented in early January 2019 in accordance with decision  2015/1814 and the revision of phase IV. This withdrew the surplus  accumulated in previous periods that resulted in an excess supply  in the European Union emission trading system. Between 2014 and  2020, 900 million allowances were also withdrawn from the  market through a backloading scheme. The arrival of phase 4 and  the reserve had a major impact on the European Union emission  trading system, with early January 2020 prices of up to €25/t CO2  and the participation of new speculative players, • December 2020: the EU Member States agreed to a greenhouse  gas emissions reduction target of 55% by 2030 (compared with  1990 levels), as opposed to 40% previously (it is recalled that  Europe aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050). Following this  agreement, a consultation was launched by the European  Commission to revise the European CO2 allowance market with  the aim of attaining the new GHG emissions reduction target. The  market price for CO2 allowances increased significantly to €35/ metric ton in January 2021, • July 2021: the European Commission presented its plan to reduce  CO2 emissions by at least 55% by 2030 as compared to 1990 levels  (“Fit for 55 package”). This plan provides for the phasing-out of  free allowances by 2036, the implementation of a carbon tax at  the EU’s borders and the extension of ETS mechanisms to the land  transport and building sectors, • December 2022: the Council and European Parliament reached a  provisional political deal on ETS reform, agreeing: • to increase the overall ambition for emission reductions by 2030  to 62% compared to 2005 levels; • to increase the annual reduction rate of the emission cap by 4.3%  per year from 2024 to 2027 and 4.4% from 2028 to 2030 (''linear  reduction factor''); • and to strengthen the Market Stability Reserve (MSR) by setting  a threshold of 400 million allowances, with the surplus  eliminated With regard to the waste business, the Commission will assess the  possibility of including the municipal waste incinerator sector in the  ETS, with a view to including it from 2028 and the need for a possible  opt out until December 31, 2030. A report on this issue will be  presented no later than July 31, 2026. • following the repeal of Regulation (EC) 2037/2000, Regulation (EC)  1005/2009 of September 16, 2009 requires the strict management  of substances that destroy the ozone layer and, in particular, CFC  and HCFC refrigerating fluids used in cooling plants. It sets, inter  alia, rules for the recovery and destruction of fluids and a timetable  for the elimination of certain substances; • as a result of the Kyoto Protocol, Regulation 842/2006/EC of May  17, 2006 introduced strict management and traceability measures  for fluorinated greenhouse gases for both HFC refrigerating liquids  and SF6 electrical insulation. Regulation 517/2014 of April 16, 2014  reformed this provision by repealing Regulation 842/2006 with  effect from January 1, 2015. This regulation seeks to reduce  fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions by two-thirds by 2030, as  compared with current levels. Three regulations were issued on  November 17, 2015 in application of this regulation, setting new  labeling, training and certification requirements for these gases; • pressure equipment: Directive 97/23/EC of May 29, 1997 (DESP)  establishes design and manufacturing requirements for pressure  equipment and imposes an inspection of the compliance of this  equipment and their housing units; • European Climate law: Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of June 30, 2021  establishes the European Union framework for reducing GHG  emissions for the Union by 2050. It establishes two binding  objectives: climate neutrality in the Union by 2050, with a view to  achieving the long-term temperature objective set by the Paris  agreement and reducing net greenhouse gas emissions in the  Union by at least 55% by 2030 as compared to 1990; • Fit for 55 package: presented by the Commission on July 14, 2021, it  contains proposals aimed at attaining the objectives set in the  European Climate law. These proposals will lead to the  amendment of many directives and regulations; • in addition, the REpowerEu plan presented by the Commission on  May 18, 2022 aims to raise the targets proposed in the Fit for 55  package to increase Europe’s independence from Russian fossil  fuels. This plan aims to achieve energy savings, produce clean  energy and diversify energy supply sources. The accelerated roll- out of renewable energies is one of the pillars of this plan.  ABOUT THE GROUP Environmental regulation 62 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 65 ===== Regulations specific to each business line WATER  WASTE ENERGY The objective underlying regulation is the  availability of drinking water which complies  with directives, and a satisfactory chemical,  ecological  and  quantitative  status  for  groundwater and surface water, and a  wastewater treatment system that protects  the receiving environment. The objective of attaining a satisfactory  chemical state of water is the result of  several  European  legislative  texts,  particularly Directive 2000/60/EC of October  23, 2000, which establishes a framework for  community action in the field of water policy  (the “Water Framework Directive”) that  concerns the quality of water (surface and  groundwater)  more  generally.  Directive  2006/118/EC of December 12, 2006 on the  protection  of  groundwater  (daughter  directive of the framework directive) sets up  oversight  and  restrictions  on  chemical  substances in water by 2015. The framework directive set objectives for  2015 but the implementation timetable  covers the period to 2027. Directive 2008/105/EC of December 16, 2008,  amended by Directive 2013/39 of August 12,  2013,  sets  out  environmental  quality  standards  for  45  priority  substances,  including priority dangerous substances that  present a major risk to the environment or to  public health in the water sector. These texts  provide for the elimination of priority  dangerous substances in 2021 and other  dangerous  substances  in  2028  from  continental and coastal surface water. To protect the receiving environment, the  collection, treatment and discharge of urban,  industrial and commercial wastewater is  governed by Directive 91/271 of May 21, 1991,  as amended, concerning the treatment of  urban wastewater. The  objectives  of  this  directive  were  confirmed and extended by the Water  Framework Directive. The treatment of  wastewater is also directly affected by  Directive 2008/56/EC of June 17, 2008, which  establishes a framework for community  action in the field of marine environmental  policy and Directive 2006/7/EC of February 15,  2006 concerning “bathing water” which  imposes new restrictions on the monitoring  and management of bathing water and  information provided to the general public. Regarding flood risks, Directive 2007/60/EC  of October 23, 2007 on the assessment and  management of flood risks requires Member  States to identify and map high-risk river  basins and coastal areas and to produce  management plans. Directive 2008/98/EC of November 19, 2008  (the  “Waste  Framework  Directive”)  establishes a hierarchy of different waste  management measures and favors (i) the  prevention  of  production,  primarily  by  requiring Member States to draft national  programs, (ii) re-use, (iii) recycling, by  defining new objectives to be achieved by  Member States by 2020, (iv) other forms of  recovery and (v) safe disposal. It also clarifies the concepts of recovery,  elimination,  end-of-waste  status  and  byproducts. The aim of this directive is to  promote recycling, composting and waste-to- energy recovery of household waste. With respect to ship recycling, Regulation  (EU) 1257/2013 of November 20, 2013 seeks to  better monitor their recycling in accordance  with hazardous waste standards. With  respect  to  the  cross-border  transportation  of  waste,  Regulation  1013/2006 of June 14, 2006 sets out  conditions for monitoring and inspecting  waste  transfers  and  clarifies  current  procedures for monitoring the transfer of  non-hazardous waste for recycling. It was  amended by the Regulation of May 15, 2014,  which required Member States to implement  inspection plans by January 1, 2017 at the  latest, with a view to ensuring more effective  inspections. In December 2015, the European Commission  published the Circular Economy Package  comprising (i) an action plan of measures  aimed at “closing the loop” of product life  cycles, from production and consumption to  waste management and the development of  a market for secondary raw materials, and (ii)  proposed revisions to waste legislation. Four directives of May 30, 2018 (2018/851,  2018/850, 2018/852 and 2018/849) amended  the Waste Framework Directive, the Landfill  Directive, the Packaging and Packaging  Waste Directive, the End-Of-Life Vehicle  Directive,  the  Waste  Batteries  and  Accumulators  Directive  and  the  Waste  Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive.  The new regulations seek to prevent waste  production and its adverse impacts, promote  waste reuse, recycling and recovery and  gradually reduce landfill waste. In August 2018, the best available techniques  conclusions for the waste management  sector were published. These were obtained  following a review of the Best Available  Techniques reference documents on waste  processing. Large combustion plants (with a thermal  output of 50 MW or more) are governed since  January 1, 2016 by the IED Directive of  November 24, 2010 on industrial emissions,  which imposes, inter alia, the systematic  application of best available techniques.  Directive 2015/2193 of November 25, 2015  regulating medium combustion plants (i.e.  with a thermal output of between 1 and 50  MW)  set  emission  caps  for  certain  atmospheric pollutants. In December 2018, the European Commission  voted a Clean Energy Package revising  European regulations on renewable energy,  energy efficiency, the energy performance of  buildings, electricity markets and consumer  rights. It prioritizes energy efficiency and the  development of renewable energy and  promotes a fair deal for electricity consumers  and flexible conditions. With regard to energy efficiency, Directive  2012/27/EU of October 25, 2012 was recently  revised by Directive (EU) 2018/2002 of  December 11, 2018, which defines the EU  energy saving targets for 2030 (32.5%). With regard to renewable energy, a target of  32% renewable energy in the European  energy mix by 2030 was set (with a clause for  an upwards revision by 2023). Directive  2018/2001/EU of December 11, 2018 is the  primary legislative framework governing  heating networks and recognizing waste  heat. This review of renewable energy  regulations enabled the adoption of a  harmonized  framework  for  biomass  sustainability criteria. Likewise, Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the  Governance of the Energy Union of December  11, 2018 defines for member countries the  ways and means of achieving the targets set  for 2030 in the previous directives and  requires them to draw up National Energy  and Climate Plans (NECPs). These  developments  supplement  the  agreements reached in December 2017 which  resulted in the revision of the Building Energy  Efficiency  Directive  by  Directive  (EU)  2018/844 of May 30, 2018. In  December  2021,  the  best  available  techniques conclusions for large combustion  plants  were  published,  extending,  for  procedural reasons the conclusions of July 31,  2017. ABOUT THE GROUP Environmental regulation VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 63  ===== PAGE 66 ===== WATER (continued) WASTE (continued) ENERGY (continued) In the face of increasing pressure on water  resources  leading  to  scarcity  and  a  deterioration in quality, the reuse of treated  water is a solution consistent with circular  economy principles. Regulation (EU) 2020/741  of May 25, 2020 therefore seeks to promote  the reuse of treated urban wastewater for  agricultural irrigation. The 1998 Directive on the quality of water  intended for human consumption was  revised and replaced by Directive (EU)  2020/2181 of December 16, 2020. This  directive: • confirms the right to access drinking water  for all in all territories; • revises the parameters to be monitored in  water and includes new parameters, such  as perfluorinated compounds; • revises the quality requirements associated  with these parameters; • establishes  water  safety  management  plans, from abstraction to the consumer’s  tap, for all relevant stakeholders; • provides for better information on the  quality of drinking water for all users. 2018 was marked by discussions on plastic:  the Commission published its plastic strategy  in January 2018 and Directive 2019/904/EU of  June 5, 2019 on the reduction of the impact of  certain plastic products on the environment  imposed bans on the commercialization of  certain single use plastics. In December 2019, the decision establishing  best  available  techniques  for  waste  incineration was published. In  December  2021,  the  best  available  techniques conclusions for large combustion  plants  were  published,  extending,  for  procedural reasons the conclusions of July 31,  2017. In addition to the REpowerEU plan, the  Commission proposed and adopted an  emergency  regulation  establishing  a  framework to accelerate the deployment of  energy from renewable sources (Regulation  (EU) 2022/2577 of December 22, 2022). This  regulation is of temporary application for a  period of 18 months, from December 30,  2022, may be re-evaluated and contains  administrative simplification measures to  speed-up the deployment of renewable  energies.  In 2023, Directive (EU) 2023/2413 of the  European Parliament and of the Council of  October 18, 2023 amended Directive (EU)  2018/2001, Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 and  Directive 98/70/EC as regards the promotion  of energy from renewable sources. ABOUT THE GROUP Environmental regulation 64 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 67 ===== 1.6.3  FRENCH REGULATIONS European regulations significantly influence French law. They are  enacted into law through legislative texts and regulations, codified in  particular in the French Environmental Code, the French Public Health  Code, the French Energy Code and the French General Local  Authorities Code. French regulations are constantly being reformed due to the  enactment of European laws and the roll-out of national  environmental policy. In France, the administrative authorities (DREAL - Regional  Departments for the Environment, Planning and Housing) are  responsible for the monitoring and control of facilities. For all the areas presented below, violation of most of these laws is  punishable under both administrative and criminal law and a  company may even be found criminally liable. To strengthen the criminal justice response to environmental crimes,  Law no. 2020-1672 of December 24, 2020 on the European public  prosecutor’s office, environmental justice and specialized criminal  justice, set-up specialized environmental regional divisions, created an  environmental public interest judicial convention and strengthened  the powers of environmental inspectors. In 2021, the Council of State (July 1, 2021, “Grande-Synthe” case) and  the Paris Administrative Court (October 14, 2021, “Affaire du Siècle”)  issued major and unprecedented decisions ordering the French  government to reduce GHG emissions by two different deadlines  (March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2022, respectively). The “Climate and  Resilience” law of August 22, 2021 was notably presented as a response  to these injunctions. Regulations common to the three business lines        • new EMAPD, NLCS and national carbon budgets: adopted by two  decrees on April 21, 2020, these documents were revised with the  aim of achieving carbon neutrality in 2050; • Energy-Climate law of November 8, 2019: raises France’s  ambitions by including a carbon neutrality objective by 2050. (i)  target decrease of 30% to 40% in fossil energy consumption  compared with 2012 by 2030, (ii) ban on electricity production using  coal by 2022, (iii) framework more favorable to the development of  renewable energies and own use. In addition, it modifies the  system introduced by the law of 2015 by providing for the adoption  of a five-year law that will set the objectives and priority actions of  the national energy policy and with which the EMAPD and NLCS will  have to be compatible. Finally, the law institutionalizes the  existence of the High Council for the Climate, which has a  significant institutional role; • Biodiversity, Nature and Landscape law (August 8, 2016):  amendment of environmental law and biodiversity protection  principles (introducing principles of ecological solidarity and non- regression) and inclusion of compensation for ecological prejudice  into the French Civil Code. It introduced a mechanism governing  access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of  benefits (in accordance with the Nagoya protocol) and a new  compensation system for damage to biodiversity. The main change  at institutional level after the creation of the French Agency for  Biodiversity, was the merger of this agency with the National  Agency for Hunting and Wildlife to create the French Office for  Biodiversity on January 1, 2020. This agency contributes, in land,  aquatic and marine environments, to the oversight, protection,  management and restoration of biodiversity and to the balanced  and sustainable management of water in coordination with the  national policy to combat global warming; • national plan to reduce emissions of atmospheric pollutants  (PREPA) (Decree of May 10, 2017 and Order of December 8, 2022 for  the period 2022-2025): these texts set the national emission  reduction targets for 2020, 2025 and 2030 and the actions to be  taken; the majority of facilities operated by the Group fall under the  scope of the “ICPE” regime (Facilities Classified for Environmental  Protection). • Environment Charter: promulgated by Constitutional law 2005-205  of March 1, 2005, this charter has constitutional standing. It forms  part of the body of constitutional rules of French law,  acknowledging the fundamental rights and duties relating to the  protection of the environment; • Grenelle 1 law (August 3, 2009) and Grenelle 2 law (July 12, 2010):  the first is a planning law aimed at implementing the Grenelle de  l’environnement decisions, supplemented by the second law  comprising national environmental commitments. These laws seek  to implement six major projects, which have significant  implications for each of the Group’s business line (construction,  transport,  health,  waste,  water  and  biodiversity,  energy,  environmental governance and information transparency); • law of August 17, 2015 on energy transition for green growth:  significantly amends French environmental legislation and seeks to  enable France to contribute more efficiently to the fight against  climate change and to strengthen its energy independence through  a better balance between supply sources. The eight chapters cover  the main energy transition objectives: renovating buildings to save  energy, clean and sustainable transport to reduce air pollution,  waste recycling and the circular economy, renewable energies,  nuclear energy, simplifying and clarifying procedures and  empowering citizens, businesses, regions and the government; • in application of this law, the National Low-Carbon Strategy (NLCS)  contains guidelines for the implementation of the greenhouse gas  emissions reduction policy. These documents apply to the  government, local authorities and legal entities under public law  which must take account of the NLCS in their planning and  scheduling documents having a material impact on greenhouse gas  emissions. Carbon budgets are national greenhouse gas emission  caps set for the periods 2019-2023, 2024-2028 and 2029-2033. The  objectives of the NLCS are presented by major sector (transport,  construction, agriculture, industry, energy, waste); • Energy Multi-Annual Planning Document (EMAPD), another major  energy policy document: defines priority actions for public  authorities covering the management of different types of energy  and sets objectives for the period 2019-2028; ABOUT THE GROUP Environmental regulation VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 65  ===== PAGE 68 ===== This central regime for environmental law lists facilities that are  likely to present disadvantages or dangers to the environment as a  result of their activities or the substances handled and subjects them  to a range of different requirements (such as declarations,  registration and authorizations); • after environmental assessment reforms (impact study) and public  information and consultation initiatives (public inquiry) launched in  2016 and implemented in 2017, the single environmental permit  reform (Order no. 2017-80 and Decrees of January 26, 2017)  substantially changed ICPE legislation; it merged the different  environmental procedures and decisions concerning projects  requiring permits pursuant to ICPE regulations or the Water Act  (IOTA see below); the environmental assessment procedure is  regularly revised to comply with European law; • to learn the lessons of the Lubrizol fire in September 2019, a series  of two decrees and five orders were issued on September 24, 2020  strengthening the regulations applicable to Seveso sites, as well  those applicable to ICPE facilities with regards to the state of stored  materials, warehouses and the storage of combustible materials  and inflammable and combustible liquids. These measures were  supplemented and strengthened by three orders issued on  September 22, 2021; • ASAP law (Law 2020-1525 of December 7, 2020 on accelerating and  simplifying public action): polluted soil and cessation of activity  measures were overhauled by Decree 2021-1096 of August 19, 2021:  a certified research office will now be required to attest to the  implementation of safety control measures and the cessation of  activities is redefined. Decree 2021-1000 of July 30, 2021 reduces  environmental authorization procedures by making the public  inquiry procedure exceptional and public participation by electronic  vote the standard; • “Climate and Resilience” law no. 2021-1104 of August 22, 2021:  draws from the work of the Citizen Climate Convention and  supplements provisions already introduced by the 2019 “Energy  Climate” law and the 2020 “AGEC” law. It seeks to change lifestyles  through its titles (consumption, production and work, transport,  housing and food). It also introduces advances relating to the fight  against soil artificialization and numerous measures to promote  energy efficiency and creates new criminal offenses in the  environment code: environmental endangerment, violation of  natural environments and ecocide. The implementing texts for this  law were published in 2022 (fight against soil artificialization,  mining code reforms, regional development of areas exposed to  shoreline retreat, etc.). With regard to polluted sites and soils,  Decree 2022-1588 of December 19, 2022 defines types of use in the  management of polluted sites and soils and defines a change of  use, making it possible to qualify future use(s) when activity ceases; • the management of the risk of Legionnaires’ disease is governed at  global level by the WHO, as well as at European level and within  several countries. In France, for example, prevention primarily  involves the regulation of cooling towers; • “PACTE” law no. 2019-486 of May 22, 2019 on company growth and  transformation: this law modifies the French Civil Code by  establishing that “the company is managed in its corporate  interest, taking account of the social and environmental issues of  its business”; • it also introduces the ability for a company to adopt a purpose, with  the objective of rethinking the place of companies in society. The  Group has adopted a Purpose (see Chapter 1.1.2 above). • The production and sale of biogas are strictly regulated by  numerous texts. Law no. 2022-1158 of August 16, 2022 on  emergency measures for the protection of purchasing power  made changes enabling the development of the biogas sector. • law on accelerating the production of renewable energy (n °2023-175 of March 10, 2023): first legal text wholly dedicated to  renewable energies; • law on green industry (2021/973 of October 23, 2023): sets 3 major  objectives: finance green industry, facilitate and accelerate the  installation of industrial companies and strengthen the inclusion of  environmental issues in public procurement. ABOUT THE GROUP Environmental regulation 66 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 69 ===== Regulations specific to each business line: WATER  WASTE ENERGY Many laws and regulations govern the  production of drinking water, wastewater  treatment and water pollution. Certain discharges, disposals and other  actions with a potentially negative impact on  the quality of surface or groundwater sources  require  administrative  authorization  or  notification.  This  is  known  as  the  “IOTA” (facilities, structures, works and  activities) system and is subject to the water  policy. For instance, public authorities must  be notified of any facility that pumps  groundwater  in  amounts  that  exceed  specified volumes and of the release of  certain substances into water. Law no. 2006-1772 of December 30, 2006 on  water and aquatic environments (LEMA)  addressed EU requirements for high-quality  water and significantly amended French  water  legislation.  In  addition,  water  development  and  management  plans  (SDAGE) take specific account of this water  quality objective and the administrative  order of January 25, 2010, as amended, sets  out a water quality oversight program. The  Grenelle  2  law  confirmed  the  responsibilities of municipalities with regard  to the distribution of drinking water and  sought to improve knowledge of networks  and reduce network losses. The law on the  modernization of territorial public action and  affirmation of metropolitan areas of January  27, 2014 (known as the “MAPAM” law) gave  municipalities  and  EPCIs  (public  establishments for cooperation between  local authorities) new powers in relation to  the management of aquatic environments  and the prevention of flooding (known as  “GEMAPI”), while providing them with new  tools (taxes and easements). The law on the  new territorial organization of the French  Republic of August 7, 2015 (the “NOTRE” law)  extends  the  responsibilities  of  inter- communal associations: from January 1,  2020, water and wastewater treatment are a  mandatory responsibility of all EPCIs. The  GEMAPI law no. 2017-1838 of December 30,  2017 introduces a number of adjustments to  this obligation. Likewise, under law no.  2018-702 of August 3, 2018, this obligation  may be postponed from 2020 to 2026. The Law no. 2019-1461 of December 27, 2019  on commitment to local life and proximity to  public action, introduces social tariffs for  water,  relaxes  the  implementation  of  GEMAPI responsibilities and organizes the  transfer  of  water  and  wastewater  responsibilities to the EPCIs. The  majority  of  hazardous  and  non-  hazardous waste processing facilities are  subject to the regulations governing facilities  classified  for  the  protection  of  the  environment (ICPE). A number of decrees and  ministerial  and  administrative  orders  establish rules applicable to these sites  (design, construction, operation, etc.). Hazardous and non-hazardous waste is  subject  to  strict  monitoring  (waste  monitoring  slips,  BSD)  and  tracking  (chronological waste register). Waste-to-energy  plants  are  subject  to  numerous restrictions, including limits on  pollutant emission levels. Ministerial  orders  clarify  the  technical  requirements applicable to the various waste  processing facilities. The Grenelle 2 law strengthened and  widened  the  Extended  Producer  Responsibility (EPR) scheme and specific  recovery and associated processing sectors.  Finally, it provided for the planning of  construction  and  public  works  waste  management and the performance of a pre- demolition appraisal. The Waste Framework Directive of November  19, 2008 was enacted by Order 2010-1579 of  December 17, 2010. This enactment clarified  certain definitions, introduced a hierarchy of  waste processing methods (reuse, recycling,  recovery and disposal) and clarified the  responsibilities of producers and holders of  waste. Chapter 4 of the law of August 17, 2015 on  energy transition for green growth focuses  on combating wastage and promoting the  circular economy: it amends waste law  principles by introducing new objectives with  quantified targets into the national waste  policy and enshrines the definition of the  circular economy in the major principles of  environmental law. It amends the law governing environmental  bodies and creates new Extended Producer  Responsibility (ERP) sectors. The application  texts  for  these  new  provisions,  and  particularly those concerning the ERP sectors,  were subsequently published. The French Energy Code and the French  Environmental Code define the regulatory  framework governing energy policy. The majority of installations are subject to  the regulations governing facilities classified  for the protection of the environment (ICPE)  set out in the French Environment Code. The Grenelle 2 law boosted the development  of energy efficiency and renewable energies. This continued with the law of August 17,  2015 on energy transition for green growth  which seeks to balance the different energy  supply sources in France. Chapter 5 of this  law on renewable energies introduces a new  purchase contract regime for electricity  produced by facilities using renewable  energies, while slightly modifying the regime  governing anaerobic digestion plants and the  law governing hydroelectric concessions.  Chapter 8 introduces two major documents  for the energy policy: the National Low- Carbon Strategy and the energy multi-annual  planning document. It modifies the steering  and production of electricity and covers  energy transition in the territories. Numerous  application texts for these new measures  were subsequently published. Ministerial  orders  clarify  the  technical  requirements  applicable  to  combustion  facilities according to their size. Veolia also contributes to the French capacity  market via its electricity production facilities  in line with Decree 2012/1405 of December 14,  2012. Certain facilities are also impacted by  Decree 2016/682 on the power purchase  obligation and the market-based premium  for renewable energies. Similarly, the conditions for marketing, using,  recovering and destroying substances used  as refrigerating fluids in refrigerating and air- conditioning equipment are also regulated. The legal arsenal of French regulations is  completed  by  numerous  other  orders  clarifying the means of quantifying and  handling fluids and the set-up of training and  recovery sectors. ABOUT THE GROUP Environmental regulation VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 67  ===== PAGE 70 ===== WATER (continued) WASTE (continued) ENERGY (continued) Law no. 2022-217 of February 21, 2022, the so- called“3DS”,  on  differentiation,  decentralization,  deconcentration  and   various measures to simplify local public  action confirms the deadline of January 1,  2026 for the transfer of this responsibility to  communities of municipalities and facilitates  the financing thereof by the communes and  EPCIs with their own taxation, with the  possibility of some adjustments. Special attention is paid to protecting  catchment areas and regulation covers  pollutants such as nitrates, pesticides and  micro-pollutants. Autonomous  wastewater  treatment  is  subject to strict regulation to protect the  quality  of  the  receiving  environment,  sanitary conditions and public health. Depending on their size, treatment plants are  subject to increasing requirements and,  particularly for the largest plants, reporting  obligations such as an annual declaration of  polluting emissions and waste. The reuse of treated wastewater was  regulated to a limited extent and only with  respect to the irrigation of crops and green  areas (Order of August 2, 2010, as amended).  Decree no. 2022-336 of March 10, 2022  defines the rules regulating new uses of  treated wastewater and introduces an  authorization procedure for the use of this  wastewater (the information required in  authorization requests is specified in the  Order of July 28, 2022). To be used in agriculture, sludge produced at  wastewater treatment plants must comply  with strict traceability regulations in respect  of the organic materials and trace metals it is  likely to contain (heavy metals such as  cadmium, mercury or lead). To be recovered  as biogas that is likely to be injected into  natural gas networks, it must also comply  with a list of authorized inputs. Decree no. 2020-828 of June 30, 2020  introduced major reforms concerning IOTA  wastewater installations. The December 2020 European drinking water  directive was enacted by Order no. 2022-1611  of December 22, 2022, Decrees no. 2022-1720  and 2022-1721 of December 29, 2022 as well  as 13 orders issued on December 30, 2022 and  2 orders issued in January 2023. Law no. 2020-105 of February 10, 2020 on  fighting waste and the circular economy (the  “AGEC law”) seeks to accelerate the change  in production and consumption models in  order to limit waste and preserve natural  resources, biodiversity and the climate. The  AGEC law is a product of the circular  economy roadmap published on April 23,  2018 and is part of a European framework  strengthened by the adoption, on May 30,  2018, of Circular Economy Package directives. It focuses on several objectives: (i) reducing  waste and the end of disposable plastic, (ii)  better consumer information, (iii) fighting  waste and inclusive reuse, (iv) producer  responsibility and (v) fighting fly-tipping. Order no. 2020-920 of July 29, 2020 on waste  prevention and management further enacts  the Circular Economy Package in French law  and implements certain provisions of the  circular economy roadmap. The AGEC law focuses specifically on  strengthening the traceability of waste,  excavated soil and sediment. This gave rise to  changes set out in Decree no. 2021-321 of  March 25, 2021: dematerialization of waste  monitoring slips, extension of the obligation  to  keep  chronological  registers  and  obligation to communicate the content of  chronological registers. As the AGEC law significantly modified the  extended producer responsibility system and  waste  prevention  and  management  provisions,  numerous  implementation  decrees were published in 2020, 2021 and  2022. Order no. 2020-866 of July 15, 2020 together  with three decrees and six orders enact the  energy efficiency, renewable energy and  energy performance of buildings directives  and group together building and heating and  cooling network issues. Three orders issued on March 3, 2021 (no.  2021-235, no. 2021-236 and no. 2021-237)  enacted Directive 2018-2001 (known as “RED  II”) into French law by setting sustainability  and GHG emission reduction requirements  for  bioenergy  sectors  and  imposing  provisions relating to guarantees of origin  and self-consumption and setting new rules  for the domestic electricity market. The production and sale of biogas are strictly  regulated by numerous texts. Finally, with regard to the production of  domestic hot water, the Group is particularly  concerned by European Directive 2020/2181  of December 16, 2020 on the quality of water  intended for human consumption, which  now  includes  obligations  regarding  legionnaires’ disease. ABOUT THE GROUP Environmental regulation 68 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 71 ===== 1.6.4  AMERICAN, AUSTRALIAN AND CHINESE REGULATIONS Outside Europe, the United States, Australia and China report the  highest revenue. The relevant environmental regulations are therefore  presented below. United States With regard to water, the main federal laws concerning water and  wastewater quality are the Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, the  Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 and related rules and regulations  promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These  laws and regulations establish standards for drinking water and liquid  discharges. Most US states have the right to introduce criteria and  standards that are stricter than those set by the EPA, and a number of  them have done so. The majority of new major regulations in the  United States in recent years were adopted by States rather than by  the EPA, in particular the regulations on per- and polyfluoroalkylated  substances (PFAS), lead and copper, and minimal disinfectant residual.  In 2022, the EPA (i) prepared a proposal to regulate two of the most  widely-used PFAS, (ii) proceeded with additional revisions to the  federal Lead and Copper Rules Revisions (LCRR), and (iii) continued to  examen the rule on microbes, disinfection and disinfection by- products for potential future revisions. This dichotomy raises  conformity issues, since State environmental laws do not always align  with each other and probably will not align with future EPA  regulations. In recent years, contamination of drinking water by PFAS has become  a major concern for public health. The EPA has launched a  multifaceted approach to combat exposure to certain PFAS and will  regulate specific PFAS in consumer products, wastewater and drinking  water. This more global approach should reduce the likelihood of  these PFAS getting into drinking water, but it also creates the risk that  treatment residuals may end up being classified and regulated as  materials containing hazardous substances. In the meantime, many  States have adopted a different approach and regulate PFAS only in  drinking water. These States have adopted a stricter maximum  content of contaminants for specific PFAS, based mainly on the risk of  adverse effects on health, even though there are treatment feasibility  and profitability considerations. The main statutes governing waste management activities are the  1976 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act,  the Toxic Substances Control Act, the 1980 Comprehensive  Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended  (also known as CERCLA or Superfund law), and the Clean Air Act, all of  which are administered either by the EPA, or State agencies to which  the EPA delegates enforcement powers. Each State in which the Group  operates also has its own laws and regulations governing the  production, collection and processing of waste, including, in most  cases, the design, operation, maintenance, closure and post-closure  maintenance of landfill sites and other hazardous and non-hazardous  waste management facilities. In September 2022, the EPA proposed the designation of two types of  PFAS - perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid  (PFOS) - as ''hazardous substances'' under CERCLA. Under CERCLA, the  federal government has statutory authority to investigate, monitor  and respond to hazardous substances that have been released, or are  under threat of release,  into the environment. CERCLA also provides  an enforcement mechanism for the government and private entities  to hold parties responsible for clean-up costs if they are found to be  liable for the release of substances (i) specifically designated as  hazardous substances under CERCLA or (ii) determined to present an  “imminent and substantial danger to the public health or welfare.''  The EPA anticipates publishing a final designation in the summer of  2023. The EPA is also considering multiple disposal techniques,  including incineration, to effectively treat and dispose of PFAS waste.  The final designation will impact waste management activities in the  United States. With regard to energy, the federal government has jurisdiction over  inter-state commercial activities (involving parties from different  federal states), including in the electricity wholesale market.  Accordingly, as an owner of electricity production facilities, the Group  is subject to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulations  pursuant to the Federal Power Act, the Public Utility Regulatory  Policies Act of 1978 and the Public Utility Holding Company Act of  2005. With regard to its US thermal energy activities, the Group is  subject to the laws of the several states in which it operates, including  regulations issued by certain public service local commissions.  Applicable local law varies from State to State and may comprise no  specific regulations related to thermal energy or, conversely, set-out a  precise regime including the setting of rates. Finally, energy activities  involve atmospheric emissions and the consumption of water for  industrial purposes and as such require the Group to comply with the  majority of the above water and waste regulations. Australia Federal, State and local governments jointly administer environmental  protection laws through bilateral agreements. The 1999 Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC)  Act is the keystone of the Australian government’s environmental  legislation. It provides a legal framework protecting and controlling  plants, wildlife and the environment in the widest sense, at national  and international level. Nonetheless, the most critical environmental  regulations are administered at State level by the Environmental  Protection Authorities. State and Territory laws apply to specific  economic activities and are administered by the State and local  authorities through licenses and permits. Overall, Australia has more than 300 laws (and numerous associated  application  regulations)  governing  environmental  issues.  Environmental legislation regulates the way land may be acquired and  used. Federal and State legislation also requires the performance of an  environmental impact assessment for all major projects. The  construction of buildings, pollution, contamination and waste  production and tracking is also regulated. The authorities ensure  compliance with legislation by applying fines and penalties or by  imposing the strict liability of companies or management at a  personal level. Each State and territory has legislation establishing an Environmental  Protection Authority (EPA) which is the statutory decision-maker for  environmental regulations and policy issues. The EPA administers  legislation covering air and water quality, waste, contaminated land,  noise, pesticides and hazardous waste. The EPA and industrial  companies also play a role in the drafting of voluntary codes of  practice concerning the impact of industry on the environment. The 2007 Water Act, enacted at federal level, is the keystone of  legislation governing the treatment of water and wastewater.  However, in terms of controls on the quality of water, it is the EPA in  each State or territory that is responsible for enforcing water quality  regulations. In New South Wales, for example, the 1997 Protection of  the Environment Operations (POEO) Act defines the legal framework  for the management of water pollution and quality. It is  supplemented by the 2009 Protection of the Environment Operations  Regulation, which among other things, lays down certain points for  the definition of water pollution. ABOUT THE GROUP Environmental regulation VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 69  ===== PAGE 72 ===== The EPA of each State and territory is responsible for waste and landfill  regulations. In New South Wales, waste is regulated by the  Environment Protection Authority (NSW EPA) using tools and  programs to prevent pollution, reduce the use of resources, improve  material recovery from waste flows and ensure the appropriate  elimination of waste. The NSW EPA also controls the regulatory  framework which establishes a level playing field for waste and  recycling operators. This framework includes the obligation to hold an  environment protection license, if certain thresholds are reached and  the obligation to register and inform the EPA of the type and quantity  of waste that transits via the facilities. The National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (NGER)  established the legal framework of the NGER scheme, a national  framework for the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and projects  as well as energy consumption and production by Australian  companies. China China has passed several environmental protection texts and  particularly: ■the 1989 Environmental Protection law (EPL) (amended in 2014); ■the 1984 Water Pollution law (amended most recently in 2017); ■the 2002 Impact Study law (amended most recently in 2018); ■the 1987 Air Pollution law (amended most recently in 2018); ■the 2018 Soil Pollution Prevention and Control law; ■the 1995 Solid Waste law (amended most recently in 2020); ■and the 1996 Noise Prevention and Control law (amended most  recently in 2021). The Chinese Ministry for the Environment and its counterparts at  provincial and city level and the environmental protection offices are  responsible  for  applying  and  administering  environmental  regulations. In 2016, China implemented a pollution discharge permit system  which sets specific limits on the amount and the concentration of each  pollutant that may be emitted. In China, mitigation and adaptation are two major strategic measures  for tackling climate change. To implement mitigation strategies which  highlight cutting greenhouse gas emissions, China established local  carbon emission rights trading schemes starting with eight pilot  provinces and cities from 2013 to 2020. In 2021, China moved forward  in improving the national carbon emission rights trading scheme by (i)  opening a nation level trading market; ii) issuing an administrative  measure for carbon emission right trading, and (iii) adopting three  administrative rules to govern the registration of carbon emission  rights, the trading of carbon emission rights, and the settlement of  carbon emission rights respectively. While for adaptation strategies,  China released the National Strategy on Climate Adaptation 2035 in  2022. This new strategy specified  finance, energy, transport and other  sectors as susceptible industries to climate change, and set goals for  them to adapt to the new environmental circumstances. The Administrative Sanctions law amended in 2021 would have a great  impact on the penalty imposed on environmental violations. New  kinds of penalties such as qualification downgrade and shut down  have been added in the amendment.

The Group operates in constantly changing environments, potentially  generating exogenous risks with an impact on Veolia’s risk profile. The main risks presented below and developed in Section 2.2 are those  identified by Veolia, at the date of this Universal Registration  Document, as capable of materially impacting the Group’s business  activities, financial position or results or of generating a significant  drop in the Company’s share price. However, other risks not considered material or as yet unidentified  could also impact the Group, its financial position, reputation, outlook  or the Company’s share price. Investors are therefore invited to closely consider the risks presented  below before making their investment decision. Category Risk factors Sections Risks relating to the business  environment in which the Group  operates Geopolitical and political risks; risks relating to climate change and natural disasters; risks  relating to market changes; economic risks; seasonality risks. 2.2.2.1 Operational risks Risks relating to employee health and safety: environmental and industrial risks; risks related  to tangible and intangible property, and information systems; risks relating to changes in  business lines; risks of skills availability; purchasing, supply and logistics risks; personal  security risks; transformation risks related to multifaceted performance; risks relating to the  selection and integration of acquisitions. 2.2.2.2 Financial risks Risk of fluctuations in the price of energy, consumables and commodities; counterparty risks  relating to operating activities; liquidity risks; risks relating to tax developments; foreign  exchange risk. 2.2.2.3 Regulatory, ethical and legal risks Risks relating to regulatory changes, particularly in the areas of health or the environment;  corruption and business integrity risks; human rights risks. 2.2.2.4 These risks are managed within the Group in accordance with the three lines of defense model (see Section 2.1 below), through a coordinated risk  management (see Section 2.1.1 below) and internal control (see Section 2.1.2 below) process and internal audit (see Section 2.1.4 below). Special  attention is also given to compliance with ethical rules, which are constantly strengthened within the Group and the roll-out of compliance  programs (see Chapter 4, Section 4.6 below). In 2023, the Group identified six priority actions in line with its strategy: ■final year of implementation of the Impact 2023 strategic program; ■creation of the world champion in ecological transformation; ■transformation  of  the  Company  to  achieve  multifaceted  performance objectives; ■commercial performance efficiency; ■specific actions to strengthen information systems; ■updating and strengthening of compliance programs in view of  regulatory changes (see Chapter 4, Section 4.6 below).

The operating managers control activities and operations on a daily basis, by implementing the  most effective risk management practices at process level. 2 nd line of defense: risk  management and internal control Coordinated by the risk management and internal control system (see Sections 2.1.1. and 2.1.2 below) and the  functional departments (see Section 2.1.3 below), responsible for their areas of expertise. Its goal is to structure  and maintain the system controlling the organization’s activities, particularly by: • assisting operating staff in the identification and assessment of the main risks within their scope of  expertise; • proposing Group policies and procedures by area of activity; • contributing, with operating staff, to designing the most relevant controls; • developing exchanges on best practice, by observing and reporting on the effectiveness of processes. 3 rd line of defense: internal audit The independent internal audit function is certified since 2006 and reports to the General Counsel while having  access, as necessary, to the highest level of the organization. This third line of defense provides the Company’s  Board of Directors and Executive Management with reasonable assurance, through a risk-based approach (see  Section 2.1.4 below). 2.1.1  COORDINATED RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM Objectives The Group has established an integrated risk management policy  aimed at providing a comprehensive overview of the risk portfolio,  using the same tools and methodologies across all Business Units and  functional departments. Veolia also builds long-lasting relationships  with its customers based, in particular, on its ability to manage risks  delegated by them. The Group responds to this challenge, which is of  fundamental importance to its development, by setting up a  coordinated risk prevention and management system. The risk management system has the following objectives: ■identify and anticipate: ensure the constant oversight of the  Group’s major risks so that no risk is overlooked or underestimated,  understand and monitor the environments in which the Group  operates and anticipate changes in the nature or intensity of those  risks; ■organize: ensure that the main identified risks are effectively  addressed at the most appropriate level within the Group.  Numerous operational risks are managed at Business Unit level.  Others, which require specific expertise or are of a primarily  transversal or strategic nature, are handled directly at head office; ■process: ensure that the structure and resources employed are  effective so as to control as best as possible the identified risks, in  line with the Group’s values and strategy; ■raise awareness and inform: communicate on risks to the various  financial and non-financial stakeholders. Organization Within the Risk and Insurance Department that reports to the Group’s  General Counsel, the Risk Department coordinates and serves as the  entry point for the Group’s strategic risks and facilitates the risk  management system through its network of risk managers in the  zones and Business Units. Since 20220, the Risk Department has  organized monthly meetings with its network of risk managers in the  zones and Business Units. The aim of these meetings was to  communicate key Group information, share feedback and consider  issues in greater depth by setting up working groups on specific topics.  In 2023, the network of risk managers also met during the annual risk  seminar. The Risk Committee is responsible for validating and monitoring the  effectiveness of the action plans covering the major risks identified in  the risk mapping. It ensures and supports the proper functioning of  the risk management systems and may also decide on which risks are  unacceptable within the context of the business. The Risk Committee  brings together members of the Veolia Executive Committee,  establishing a direct link between the Group’s strategy and the risk  management process. It is facilitated by the Chief Risk and Insurance  Officer and chaired by the Group’s General Counsel. The Group Risk Committee meets to examine the Group’s risk  mapping and the management systems to mitigate these risks. Risk  Committees by zone and/or country meet to monitor and approve the  risk mappings for their scope of activities and the implementation of  the related action plans. The Risk Department works with all functional departments and more  particularly with: ■the Internal Control Department, to link up the identified risks and  Veolia’s organizational rules, processes and principles, and propose  changes where appropriate (see Section 2.1.2 below); RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL Risk management, internal control and internal audit 74 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 77 ===== ■the  Compliance  Department,  to  strengthen  the  Group’s  compliance programs (see Chapter 4, Section 4.6 below); ■the Internal Audit Department, to contribute to defining its annual  audit program. Audits carried out serve to enhance the risk  assessments already conducted within the Group. By verifying the  Company’s key processes, the Internal Audit Department provides  assurance that internal control and risk management procedures  have been implemented and are effective. These procedures are  regularly assessed within the Group to ensure that the Group has  the appropriate risk management tools and processes: risk  identification, implementation of action plans, updated risk  mapping and deployment of the risk management function  throughout the Group. Main programs Veolia’s Risk Department has implemented an integrated risk  management  system  covering  far-reaching  issues  regarding  (i) strategy, (ii) performance and (iii) compliance. It is supported by a  network of risk managers and deploys its risks management system in  the functional departments and special-purpose committees, as well  as in the zones and Business Units. In 2023, the Risk Department primarily worked on:  ■the ongoing roll-out of the common methodology to the network  and with the functional departments, and in particular: • integrating new entities and supporting new risk managers in  the mapping of local risks,  • continued awareness-raising and support for the network of risk  managers on the Group’s major risks, primarily during monthly  meetings, • enriching the list of Group risks (Veolia Risk Universe) which  enables the use of a common language for risks and their  description. The contract management, health and safety and  biodiversity sections of the Veolia Risk Universe were reviewed  in particular this year following the analysis by TNFD (Taskforce  on Nature-related Financial Disclosures); ■specific risk analyses for the Group, to support the completion of  the Impact 2023 strategic plan and the construction of the new  GreenUp plan;  ■assisting the network with updating analyses of corruption risks, in  conjunction with the Financial Internal Control Department and  the Compliance Department.  Finally, in 2023, the Risk Department also contributed to the work of  the Sustainable Finance and Sustainable Development Departments  and the Governance division on implementing the new European  sustainability reporting requirements set out in the Corporate  Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), applicable from 2024. The main activities of the Risk Department and its network are: Risk mapping Together with its network, the Risk Department has developed a  common process designed to identify and prioritize events that may  prevent the Group from reaching its objectives. It is founded on a  common methodology and a Governance Risk and Control (GRC)  digital tool, enabling the consolidation of major risks by zone and  Business Unit. After consolidating the risks, interviews are held with  head office functional departments to complete the identification and  assessment of Group risks. Members of the Board of Directors also  participate in the risk mapping, providing an external perspective of  Veolia’s risks. The Group’s risk mapping is updated each year in accordance with this  methodology. Zones and Business Units have a risk mapping, prepared in compliance  with the main market benchmarks (notably COSO - Committee of  Sponsorship Organizations of the Treadway Commission) and in  accordance with ISO 31000 on risk management. The identified risks  are assessed in terms of their impact and frequency, taking account of  risk control measures. The “risk owners” are in charge of designing  and implementing action plans in liaison with the risk managers for  their zone and/or country and/or head office, so as to limit and  manage risk exposure. The network of risk managers contributes to  defining the corresponding action plans and steering the overall  process. It also plays a role of warning and coordination for emerging  risks. Country risk and opportunities program Since 2012, the Risk Department has conducted specific analyses by  country, through its “country risk and opportunities” program (see  Section  2.2.2.1 below). This program assesses, in particular, political  risks, economic risks, the risk of institutional instability and corruption  risks and provides Commitment Committees with the information  necessary to assess external factors potentially impacting Group and  zone investment projects. In  2023, the program was updated to  include new topics and indicators. It is now hosted on a digital  platform around four pillars: environmental, social and societal,  economic and business, and political and geopolitical.  Corruption risk mapping The Group’s first corruption risk mapping in 2018 and its update in  2020, were presented by the Chief Risk Officer to the Executive  Committee (meeting as the Risk Committee), the Management  Committee and the Board of Directors’ Accounts and Audit  Committee. Since 2019, the roll-out of corruption risk mappings  continues in new entities and several Business Units (see Chapter 4,  Section 4.6.3 below). In 2022, the Risk Department was tasked by the  Compliance Department with updating Veolia’s corruption risk  mapping  methodology  using  a  scenario-based  analysis  and  considering the gross and net risk assessments. This new methodology  was then deployed across the entire new Veolia scope in 2023,  producing a consolidated overview of corruption risks for the Group  which was presented to and validated by the Group Executive  Committee at the beginning of 2024. Analysis of human rights risks Since 2013, the Risk Department conducts risk analyses focusing on  human rights issues. The conclusions of this work were used to adapt  the Human Rights management system to take account of risk factors,  with an approach founded on prevention and awareness-raising (see  Section 2.2.2.4 and Chapter 4, Section 4.6.4 below).  RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL Risk management, internal control and internal audit   VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 75  ===== PAGE 78 ===== 2.1.2  COORDINATED INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM Objectives Internal control provides reasonable assurance that a company’s  primary financial, compliance and operational risks are contained  within acceptable limits defined by general management and  governing bodies. It ensures that management acts fall within the  framework defined by applicable laws and regulations and the  Group’s values and rules, and that the accounting, financial and  management information communicated to the corporate decision- making bodies fairly reflects the activity and position of the Group. In addition, the internal control system implemented by the Group  seeks to contribute to the efficiency of processes and improve the  reliability  of  attaining  strategic  objectives  and  multifaceted  performance objectives. It also enables the Group to create and  protect value. Since end-2020, internal control is part of a wider  approach  encompassing  all  activities,  beyond  financial  and  transactional processes, and adopts an operational and continuous  improvement rationale. Organization In line with the internal control reference framework, the application  guidance recommendations published by the French Financial Markets  Authority (AMF), and the principles of the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations (COSO), the Group’s internal control organization  evolved in 2020 to strengthen its transversal positioning and the  consistency of the general process encompassing all Group functions  and activities. The Internal Control Department is organized as follows: Board of Directors Accounts and Audit Committee Executive Management Executive Committee General Counsel Internal Audit and Control Department Risk Department Compliance Department Internal Audit Department Internal Control Department Internal control is coordinated as follows: ■the Accounts and Audit Committee ensures that the structures and  processes are in place to provide reasonable assurance that the  Group’s objectives will be attained and risks controlled; ■the Executive Committee supervises the overall system. It reviews  and validates progress with the internal control systems; ■the Internal Control Department coordinates and supports all   functional departments in defining their control environment. It  ensures the comprehensive nature of rules and procedures with  regard to the main risks and the overall consistency of the system.  It communicates on this system and coordinates its assessment, in  particular through self-assessments conducted annually by the  Business Units. The Internal Control Department works closely with: ■the Risk Department, to ensure that control activities focus on  identified risks; ■the Internal Audit Department, to share with it the results of self- assessment campaigns and to take into consideration areas of  improvement identified by this department when verifying the  application of the control environment. To improve cooperation and consistency between the functional  departments contributing directly to risk management, a coordination  committee was set up at the end of 2020 by the Risk, Compliance,  Internal Control and Internal Audit Departments, and with the  Strategy Department in charge of multifaceted performance. The  Financial Internal Control Department has participated since the  outset in this committee and was joined, in 2022, by the internal  control correspondents from other functional departments. RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL Risk management, internal control and internal audit 76 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 79 ===== Main components of the internal control  systems The Internal Control Department organizes the control systems  implemented by the functional departments, the zones and the  Business Units, by ensuring their clarity, efficiency and consistency. It  therefore interacts with all the Group’s functions and Business Units. In 2023, the Internal Control Department was involved in the ongoing  integration of entities coming from the combination with Suez. The  operating principles and internal processes set out in Veolia’s  Essentials manual, encompassing the Group’s fundamental rules,  were implemented. These entities are now included in the internal  control self-assessment scope of the Business Units (WTS was  gradually included in 2023).  The Finance function has a strong internal control structure. It has  defined, standardized and rolled out the control framework covering  the preparation of financial information. Its scope encompasses the  parent company and the companies consolidated in the Group’s  consolidated financial statements. Financial Internal Control and its  network of internal controllers in the zones and Business Units ensure  in particular the standardization and roll-out of key controls covering  financial transaction processes and processes for the production of  financial and accounting information.  In 2023, Financial Internal Control in particular: ■continued to raise awareness of corruption risks in the internal  control network and finance functions and to support them  accordingly; ■performed specific support assignments when occasionally  requested by the entities; ■launched the roll-out of new accounting controls in the Business  Units to rely on ERP systems deployed in the Group for internal  control activities;  ■actively contributed to the integration of new local internal control  resources within the Group; ■continued to share best practices within its network of internal  controllers. Self-assessments are conducted annually by the Business Units to  measure the efficiency of the internal control systems they have  implemented. These self-assessments were deployed across a scope  covering around 87% of the Group’s revenue for the major cycles. This  work is performed in conjunction with managers in the relevant  functional departments and Business Units, who validate the results  and define measures to strengthen risk management. The Internal  Control Department presents a summary report to the Accounts and  Audit Committee and the Group Management Committee. In 2023, the operational processes covered by the internal control self- assessment campaign were further extended. Therefore, as well as  questionnaires on financial and transactional activities, self- assessments were carried out by all Business Units on cybersecurity (IT  and industrial), occupational health and safety, human resources, and  the inclusion of multifaceted performance considerations in our  activities. The industrial and environmental management system  completes the internal control systems on operational risks  (discharges and emissions, fire and explosion, etc.).  Based on the results of the self-assessment, Internal Control asks the  Business Units to draw-up action plans to improve their control of  processes and risks. In this way, Internal Control incorporates its  actions in a continuous improvement process.

It is certified by the French Audit and  Internal Control Institute (IFACI) since 2006. This certification - which  was formally renewed in November  2021 - is based on international  professional standards. The objectives of the Internal Audit Department are: ■to assess the Company’s risk management procedures, governance  and internal control processes; ■to help improve these procedures using a systematic and  methodical approach. This approach covers all aspects of internal control and in particular  the accuracy and integrity of financial information, the effectiveness  and efficiency of operations, the protection of assets and compliance  with laws, regulations and contracts. The Internal Audit Department implements an annual audit program  approved by the Accounts and Audit Committee. It uses dedicated  tools to prepare assignments upstream and to organize the  assignments themselves, as well as to monitor recommendations  after the audit. The department may also be tasked with occasional  assignments, primarily to investigate suspected or identified frauds  during the year. The Audit Department reports to the General Counsel. The Audit  Director: ■attends meetings of the Accounts and Audit Committee and  periodically presents an activity report summarizing audit  assignments performed, the follow-up of recommendations as well  as the annual audit program; ■has direct access as is needed to the Chief Executive Officer and  Chairman of the Audit and Accounts Committee.  The Internal Audit Department conducted 53 assignments in 2023. In  this context, these assignments covered, in more or less equal parts,  internal control efficiency, including with regard to cybersecurity, and  the assessment of other risks and primarily risks relating to  development and contractual models, strategy, governance and  operations. 2.1.5  PROCEDURES RELATING TO THE PREPARATION AND PROCESSING OF  FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING INFORMATION Organization The Group Finance Department is responsible for preparing the  Group’s forecast and actual consolidated financial statements and  financial documentation, and for defining and implementing its  accounting policies. To this end, the Finance Department is supported by: ■the Zone Financial Supervision, that serves as a link between Zone  Directors, the Group Finance Department, the Reporting, Analysis  and Financial Planning Department and the Chief Financial Officers  for each country (corresponding to the Business Units); ■the Reporting, Analysis and Financial Planning Department, that is  responsible for preparing the forecast and actual consolidated  financial statements, analyzing operating financial performance  and Group strategic financial planning; ■the Financial Internal Control and Finance Transformation  Departments,  that  assist  the  Business  Units  with  the  implementation of Group financial processes; ■the Standards and Balance Sheet Valuation Department, that  ensures the correct valuation in the Group’s balance sheet of all  transactions impacting the Company’s assets. In addition, the Group’s Tax Department contributes to the definition  of consistent procedures for the management of taxes within the  Group. Organized by zone, it is responsible for applying tax  procedures. The Financing and Treasury Department, which reports to the Group’s  Finance Operations Department, helps set up management rules and  procedures for arranging financing, managing cash surpluses and  managing interest and foreign exchange rates within the Group. The Development Department, which reports to the Group’s Finance  Operations Department, supervises mergers and acquisitions and  oversees investments and major projects. The Group’s control structures are deployed by Business Unit, country  and zone. Several Group procedures have been revised and  implemented at country level. Specific procedures may be implemented in each subsidiary,  particularly with respect to the activity or the breakdown of the  Company’s share ownership. Procedures In addition to the Group processes manual covering the preparation  and processing of Group financial information, an instruction  memorandum is sent by the Group’s Financial Reporting Department  to the Finance Departments of the Business Units, entities and zones,  prior to each accounts closing. It identifies all of the information  necessary for preparing the published financial documents. It also sets  out the new accounting regulations and texts and details their  application procedures. Upon receipt of the financial statements, review meetings are  organized  between  the  Group  and  Business  Unit  Finance  Departments. Their purpose is to verify that the financial statements  were prepared according to the rules, to understand changes in the  main aggregates and indicators in relation to the previous accounting  year and budget forecasts as well as to analyze the substantiation of  the main balance sheet components. The Statutory Auditors also have  access to the analyses performed by the Group Finance Department  through attendance at review meetings at Group and operational  level. In addition, entity CEOs and CFOs submit representation letters to  Veolia  Environnement’s  Executive  Management  attesting,  in  particular, to the accuracy of the financial and accounting information  communicated to the Company and to compliance with prevailing  laws and regulations. Furthermore, a finance manager Code of conduct was drawn-up by  the Chief Financial Officer in November 2011. Under this Code, finance  managers report to both functional and line management and the  responsibility and autonomy of finance managers in the effective  RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL Risk management, internal control and internal audit   VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 79  ===== PAGE 82 ===== performance of their operational control function is formally  reiterated. The Code was updated in 2018 to strengthen the detection  and prevention of corruption risk and signed again by all finance  managers. Each year, the Financial Internal Control Department  confirms the signatories of this Conduct of Conduct are updated. 2.1.6  INSURANCE 2.1.6.1  Organization The Insurance Department is responsible for protecting the Group’s  interests against insurable risks by: ■taking out common insurance policies to implement a consistent  risk transfer and coverage policy designed to maximize economies  of scale, while taking into account the specific characteristics of the  Group’s businesses and legal or contractual constraints; ■optimizing thresholds and the means of accessing the insurance or  reinsurance markets through the use of appropriate deductibles. The process of covering risks through insurance is implemented in  coordination with Veolia’s overall risk management policy. This takes  into account the insurability of risks associated with the Group’s  activities, the availability of insurance and reinsurance coverage on  the market and the premiums proposed compared with the level of  coverage, exclusions, limits, sub-limits and deductibles The Risk Department and the Insurance Department are supported by  a joint, international network of risk managers organized by country  to take into account changes in the Group’s organization. 2.1.6.2  Insurance policy The insurance policy continues to be updated in response to the  ongoing appraisal of risks, market conditions and available insurance  capacity. Veolia Environnement ensures that the main accidental and  operational risks brought to its attention are covered by the insurance  market, when insurance is available on the market and it is  economically feasible to do so. The Group’s insurance policy involves: ■defining the overall insurance coverage policy for the Group’s  business activities particularly based on the expression of needs of  Business Units; ■selecting and entering into contracts with outside service providers  (brokers, insurers, loss adjusters, etc.); ■managing the consolidated subsidiaries specializing in insurance or  reinsurance services; ■facilitating and coordinating the network of insurance managers  for the main Business Units. 2.1.6.3  Main insurance policies covering  all Business Units and Group  subsidiaries 2.1.6.3.1  Third-party liability The international general third-party liability insurance program was  renegotiated effective January 1, 2023. Initial coverage of up to  €75  million per claim was subscribed outside the United States and  Canada. In the United States and Canada, several contracts cover  third-party liability and environmental damage for Group subsidiaries,  up to a maximum of USD 50 million per claim and per year. The international general third-party liability insurance program  comprises a series of policies representing a total of €500 million,  with sub-limits depending on the policy and guarantees. This program encompasses liability resulting from environmental  damage sustained by third parties as a result of a sudden and  accidental event. Certain activities, such as maritime transport, automotive and  construction, have their own specific insurance policies. The Group  may also be required to take out “political risk” insurance coverage for  a project depending on its risk profile. 2.1.6.3.2  Property damage  All the Group’s subsidiaries are covered by an international property  damage insurance program, insuring the installations and equipment  that they own as well as those that they operate on behalf of  customers.  This program covers all Group businesses (Water, Energy, Waste).  However, some sites, such as WTS sites (performing Chemical-related  activities), acquired by the Group in the Suez scope are not covered by  the program. It must be used in priority to any other solution for  financing damage risk. The program adopts an “all risks except” approach and provides either  “business interruption” coverage or “additional operating cost”  coverage depending, in particular, on each subsidiary’s ability to  implement rapid substitution solutions to ensure service continuity  after an incident. The Group program comprises a “Master” policy and  local policies reinsured by this policy (Fronting policies), issued on a  “Good local standards” basis in accordance with obligations and  practices in the insurance markets of the countries where the Group  operates.  The Group’s property damage insurance program was renewed on  January 1, 2023 for two years with the same insurance provider as in  2022. The coverage terms and conditions (limits, sub-limits and deductibles),  and particularly the conditions governing the coverage of exceptional  or catastrophic events, such as natural disasters, as well as premium  levels, reflect the structure of the program negotiated with the  insurance and reinsurance market and the conditions proposed or  sometimes imposed by these markets. Group insurance coverage carries a limit per event of €430 million per  claim. Some of this coverage includes additional sub-limits per claim  and/or year. RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL Risk management, internal control and internal audit 80 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 83 ===== 2.1.6.3.3  Self-insurance and retained risks For any insured claim or loss, Group companies remain liable for the  deductible amount set out in the policy. This amount may range from  several thousand euros to more than one million euros. The Group’s  self-insurance system is based mainly on its reinsurance subsidiary,  Veolia Environnement Services-Ré, which retains a self-insured risk of  €1.5 million per claim and €20 million per year for third-party liability  and €85 million per year for property damage and resulting financial  losses. For both property damage and third-party liability, Veolia  Environnement Services-Ré has set up reinsurance contracts to  optimize the conditions under which insurable risks are transferred to  the insurance and reinsurance market. 2.1.7  DISCLOSURE COMMITTEE Created in 2002, the Disclosure Committee has the following main  duties: ■overseeing the implementation of internal procedures for  gathering and verifying information to be made public by the  Company; ■defining the procedures for preparing and drafting reports and  communications; ■reviewing recent regulatory developments that could impact  information intended for the market; ■reviewing information communicated and approving, in particular,  the content of the Universal Registration Document to be filed  with the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF). It is assisted by a Proofreading Committee responsible for validating  the draft Universal Registration Document. It is chaired by the Chief Executive Officer and comprises certain  members of the Company’s Executive Committee, including the  Deputy CEO Finance, Digital and Purchasing, as well as several of the  Group’s main functional or operational managers. The Committee meets once a year to launch the process of gathering  information and drafting the annual reports. RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL Risk management, internal control and internal audit   VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 81  ===== PAGE 84 ===== 2.2 Risk factors 2.2.1  SUMMARY AND METHODOLOGY 2.2.1.1  Main risk factors and  management measures The main risks that Veolia faces are mapped annually via a process  involving all of the Group’s subsidiaries and functions. In April 2023,  Veolia updated this risk map, which is transcribed and summarized in  the risk matrix presented below: risks are classified here according to  their potential impact and probability of occurrence, and ranked  within each unit. This risk matrix reflects the Group’s exposure to risks, integrating the  control actions in place to reduce their impact and probability.  Furthermore, the Group’s internal rules and procedures are  uncompromising with regard to the application of safety at work,  ethics and compliance internal rules and standards. These rules and  standards are qualified as “non-negotiable”. The related risk factors  are indicated in bold below. The Group strengthens its control system  over the long-term, as part of a preventive approach, to minimize the  probability of this type of risk occurring. Finally, the risk factors rated “CSR” have a dual materiality (see  Section 2.2.1.2 Methodology below). As defined at the head of this chapter, in each category, the risk  factors are presented in decreasing order of importance as determined  by the Company at the date of this Universal Registration Document.  Veolia may change its assessment of this order of importance at any  time, notably as a result of new external events or events specific to  the Company. Group risk matrix   IMPACT High • Corruption and business  integrity risks (CSR) •  Human rights risks (CSR) • Risks relating to employee health  and safety (CSR) • Environmental and industrial risks  (CSR) Moderate • Personal security risks • Transformation risks linked to  multifaceted performance (CSR) • Risks relating to changes in  business lines • Risks of skills availability (CSR) • Purchasing, supply and logistics  risks • Counterparty risks relating to  operating activities  • Geopolitical and political risks • Risks related to tangible and  intangible property, and information  systems • Risks relating to climate change and  natural disasters (CSR) • Risks inherent to fluctuations in the  price of energy, consumables and  commodities • Risks relating to market changes • Economic risks • Risks relating to regulatory changes,  particularly in the area of health or  the environment Low • Risks relating to the selection  and integration of acquisitions • Currency risk • Seasonality risks • Liquidity risks • Risks relating to tax  developments Low Moderate High PROBABILITY OF OCCURRENCE RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL Risk factors 82 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 85 ===== 2.2.1.2  Methodology Risk mapping process The Group’s risk mapping was updated using the methodology  described in Section 2.1.1 above. The risk mapping process changes each year, in order to constantly  improve the assessment and quantification of risks. In 2020, the risk assessment methodology was changed to optimize  the assessment of the level of risk control. Five criteria were defined  (governance,  organization,  processes  and  controls,  training,  assessment) in order to prepare a more detailed appraisal of the net  risk and strengthen the effectiveness of action plans. Dual materiality The dual materiality of risks defines, on the one hand, “risks which are  specific to the issuer […] and which are material for taking an informed  investment decision” (Article 16 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129, known as  Prospectus 3 of June 14, 2017), and, on the other hand, the main risks  related to the activity of the Company or of all companies, including  the risks created by its business relationships, products or services  (Article  R.225-105 of the French Commercial Code) identified in the  summary information for the Non-Financial Performance Statement  (see Chapter 4, Section 4.8 below). Veolia’s business model is built around this dual materiality, with the  Group’s performance linking the financial and economic dimension to  the issues of social, corporate and environmental responsibility  (detailed in Chapter 4 below) as an inseparable whole. Thus, the risk factors mentioned in this Chapter 2 may have a twofold  impact: ■a significant negative impact on the business, i.e. on the Group’s  financial situation and results, its image, its prospects or on the  Company’s share price; ■as part of the Group’s impacts on its ecosystem and stakeholders. Stakeholders  1. When defining its Impact 2023 strategic plan, Veolia Group  identified five categories of stakeholder: customers, employees,  shareholders, the planet and society. The Group’s commitments  with and to these stakeholders are expressed in Veolia’s  multifaceted performance as described in Section 4.1.3 below.  2. For each of the risk factors described below and in preparation of  sustainability  reporting  components  for  2024  (Corporate  Sustainability Reporting Directive), this chapter identifies the main  stakeholders that could be positively or negatively impacted by the  realization of a risk.  RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL Risk factors   VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 83  ===== PAGE 86 ===== 2.2.2  DESCRIPTION OF RISK FACTORS 2.2.2.1  Risks relating to the business environment in which the Group operates (EXT) Geopolitical and political risks (EXT-01) Risk identification Description of the risk Potential effects for the Group The Group operates in an uncertain geopolitical context where  international tension is growing.  Veolia generates a substantial part of its revenue outside France, with  activities located primarily in the United States, Europe, Asia and  Australia. Given the Group’s activities and the duration of its contracts, the  results may be partially dependent on external operating conditions  and changes therein. This may include the geopolitical, economic,  social and financial situation, but also the level of development and  labor and environmental conditions. The setting of public utility fees and their structure may depend on  political decisions that could impede increases in fees over several  years. These fees could therefore no longer cover service costs and  provide a return for the Company or its subsidiaries. Major changes to  regulations or inadequate regulatory enforcement, political opposition  to the conduct of the Group’s activities in public markets or local  authority challenges to the application of contractual provisions could  stop the Group from obtaining or renewing certain contracts.  The Group may find it is unable to defend its rights before a court of  law in certain countries should it come into conflict with their  governments or other local public entities. ■Challenge of contractual commitments ■Economic balance of contracts compromised ■Time needed to obtain operating permits or authorizations ■Difficulty in gaining new market share ■Decrease in existing market share ■Renewal of municipal contracts ■Decrease in sales volume Correlated risks ■Risks relating to tax developments ■Corruption and business integrity risks ■Risks inherent to fluctuations in the price of energy, consumables and  commodities ■Risks relating to regulatory changes, particularly in the area of health  or the environment Stakeholders ■Society ■Customers ■Employees ■Shareholders Risk management The Group’s business model is based on the diversification of its geographic footprint and contractual models and is supported by a  “country risk and opportunities” program, enabling it to proactively manage its exposure to geopolitical and political risks. The Group has a diversified portfolio and is present in all major  geographic areas. Potential operations in new countries are subject  to prior in-depth country risk analyses. Business models are also adopted based on exposure to geopolitical  and political risks. In recent years, the Group’s development has  accelerated in the industrial and service sector markets, which are  less exposed to the risks of political and regulatory instability. In its  municipal activities, the Group works with local partners to reduce  the risks associated with political instability. In addition, the Group limits the use of its equity in countries with  significant risks. The Group may also be required to take out  “political risk” insurance coverage depending on the risk profile of  the project. Political risk assessments (via the country risk program) are  conducted and memorandums are drafted by the Risk Management  Department for projects in new (or high-growth) countries and in  certain sensitive countries, in order to inform the Group or Zone  Commitment Committee in its decision-making process. The  network of international risk managers allows an assessment of  risks and their geopolitical management in the different regions. The Group pays close attention to the jurisdiction clauses of all its  major contracts. The purpose of these clauses is to designate the  competent jurisdiction to settle a dispute with a customer or  partner concerning the validity, performance or termination of a  contract.  Where possible and warranted by the issues, the Group strives to  use dispute resolution forums with strong guarantees of  independence and impartiality, such as arbitration. In particular,  these forums allow us to avoid the influence that a customer or  partner may exercise in a local jurisdiction. RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL Risk factors 84 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 87 ===== Risks relating to climate change and natural disasters (EXT-02) Risk identification Description of the risk Potential effects for the Group The Group’s activities and those of its customers, due to their nature and geographic locations, may be  exposed to risks related to climate change. These are likely to increase the frequency and magnitude of  natural disasters. Risks related to climate change, as defined by the TCFD (Task Force for Climate Financial Disclosures), fall  into two categories according to their source: ■risks related to the physical impacts of climate change (so-called “physical risks”); ■risks related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy (so-called “transition risks”). Physical risks Climate change results in two kinds of physical events: ■an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme (or “acute”) events such as floods, droughts,  heatwaves, etc. This implies an increase in the risks associated more traditionally with natural disasters; ■long-term shifts in average (or “chronic”) climate conditions, that may cause, for example, a rise in sea  levels, higher average temperatures, modified seasonal rain patterns or chronic water stress. The services and assets operated by the Group are exposed to these acute and chronic physical climate  risks, which may have operating consequences for all Veolia businesses (service interruption, material  damage to infrastructure and equipment, reduced service and treatment quality, higher operating costs,  etc.). The physical effects of climate change also alter the working conditions of Group employees involved  in outdoor activities, such as during heat waves. In addition to these operating and human impacts, some of the Group’s activities are more particularly  sensitive to physical risks. In the water business, in particular, droughts, chronic water stress or turbidity  can affect the availability and quality of the resource. They can also adversely affect water production and  treatment activities and relationships with local stakeholders. Similarly, the energy business is highly  sensitive to temperature and an increase in average temperatures could reduce the need for heat, leading  to a loss in revenue. Transition risks The fight against climate change requires the transition to a low-carbon economy. While generating  significant business opportunities for the Group, this transition may also give rise to a number of risks.  These transition risks can take many forms: regulatory, technological, market, reputation. As a combustion plant operator in the Energy business, the Group is particularly exposed to the risks  inherent to the Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) introduced by the European Union in 2005 (see  Chapter  1, Section  1.6.2 above). The quantity of free allowances granted and the cost of carbon on this  market could generate additional costs. ■Operating performance of  facilities ■Change in production volumes  (Water and Energy activities) ■Business continuity of facilities  and services ■Group’s image Correlated risks ■Seasonality risks ■Risks relating to regulatory  changes, particularly in the area  of health or the environment ■Environmental and industrial  risks  Stakeholders ■Planet ■Society ■Customers ■Employees ■Shareholders Risk management Identification and measurement of risks related to climate change In 2020, the Group studied the resilience of its business model and its related strategy. To target and characterize the climate change risks and  opportunities for the Group, a study was performed for two physical risk scenarios (RCP2.6 (2°C scenario) and RCP8.5 (over 4°C scenario)), and  two low-carbon transition scenarios (in particular the scenario voted by the European Union in 2020) over the periods to 2030 and 2050.  Physical risks were identified (e.g. higher average temperatures, heat waves, flooding, water stress.), as well as risks related to the transition to  a low-carbon economy (e.g. carbon markets, withdrawal from thermal coal, reduction in landfill, heat production, electrification, reduction in  certain activities). Based on this set of climate scenarios, annual financial impacts were estimated for the period to 2030 at several hundreds of  thousands of euros (e.g. withdrawal from certain high-carbon activities) for transition risks and several tens of millions of euros (e.g. direct  impact of higher temperatures) for physical risks. In 2022 and 2023, acute and chronic physical risks were assessed at the main operating sites to identify the best adaptation strategies at both  Group level and in each of the BUs. RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL Risk factors   VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 85  ===== PAGE 88 ===== Management of physical risks Veolia limits the impacts of the risk of natural disasters and  the physical impacts of climate change on its results through  its  climate  policy,  actions  taken  (see  Chapter  4,  Section  4.2.3.2.2 below) and the geographic spread of its  operations. Natural disasters The implementation of services essential to public authorities  and industrial companies requires constant vigilance and  anticipation: the management of risks delegated by  customers, particularly with regards to natural disasters, is at  the heart of Veolia’s expertise. Going beyond regulatory  requirements, Veolia proposes active management solutions  for risks relating to natural disasters through: ■the implementation of prevention and control measures  for its facilities;  ■the identification and assessment of the exposure of sites  exposed to natural disasters; ■the introduction of solutions to assist customers in  reducing their vulnerability. The risk relating to natural disasters is mitigated by: (i)  the  choice of a site’s location in order to limit exposure,  (ii)  analyses of the various scenarios to enable the  implementation of tailored prevention plans and (iii)  the  development of business continuity plans.  In addition, the residual risk of extreme weather events is  transferred to insurance companies via the damage program.  Under this program, some assets are visited by insurance  company prevention officers who assess their exposure, in  particular, to current natural and climatic risks. Physical climate risks In 2022, Veolia launched an assessment of the operational  consequences of acute and chronic physical risks to identify  the best adaptation strategies at both Group level and in  each of the BUs. At local level, the Group therefore conducted  pilot analyses of the exposure and vulnerability of its  activities based on a global warming scenario of 4°C by 2100  (RCP8.5). This work helped understand the consequences of  climate change on Veolia’s various activities and the impacts  on the infrastructures operated on behalf of its customers.  The teams can therefore integrate adaptation measures into  the services they offer, thereby guaranteeing continuity of  service and contributing to the resilience of both the Group  and its customers. Work was continued and extended in 2023  to provide Veolia with two additional tools enabling the  exposure and vulnerability of its activities to be assessed  globally, through: ■an analysis of the climate exposure of Veolia’s main  operating sites and contracts across the world based on a  SSP5-RCP8.5 scenario by 2030 and 2050. The physical  hazards  considered  cover  chronic  (rising  average  temperatures, rising sea levels, change in precipitation  regime) and extreme (drought, floods, heatwaves and cold  spells) phenomena. The Group is working on this basis  using a list of priority countries and sites with regard to  climate change adaptation. ■building benchmark vulnerability profiles per activity  based on pilot studies initiated in 2022. The business scope  of these studies is being extended to cover all Group  activities. Management of transition risks Veolia was very quick to adopt an active strategy to manage its  greenhouse gas emissions and allowances, by implementing an  appropriate structure and creating a special-purpose legal entity to  purchase, sell and price different types of greenhouse gas  allowances. As part of its Purpose and its Impact 2023 strategic program, Veolia  is committed to combating pollution and accelerating ecological  transition (see Chapter 4, Section 4.2.1 above). This commitment can  be broken down into several objectives, including combating  climate change. To illustrate this objective, the Group defined two  2023 targets, one to reduce GHG emissions, the other to increase  avoided GHG emissions thanks to its activities. Veolia also develops  resource use models that are more restrained and efficient and  primarily founded on the principles of the circular economy.  Through its Energy businesses, the Group allocates a significant  share of its investment each year to reducing greenhouse gas  emissions. In particular, these investments are designed to  modernize the Group’s plants, which today are mostly either gas- fired or coal-fired, by transitioning to facilities using biomass or  combining gas and biomass so as to increase energy recovery and  encourage reduced consumption. RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL Risk factors 86 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 89 ===== Risks relating to market changes (EXT-03) Risk identification Description of the risk Potential effects for the Group In a context of changing markets, the Group may face contract losses  and difficulties in renewing existing contracts, with a potential loss of  profitability. Declines in volume demand could reduce the size of the  traditional market with increased competition and lower prices. Thus, in  certain mature regions (in Europe for example), we are witnessing a  change in household consumption behavior and habits in a bid to reduce  energy consumption. The Group can also face competition risks embodied by large  international companies, “niche” companies and companies whose  overheads or profitability requirements are lower than those of Veolia  (see Chapter  1, Section  1.3.4.2 above). In addition, the desire of certain  public authorities to resume the direct management of water or waste  services (particularly under management contracts) may lead to the non- renewal of certain contracts. In this context, the Group may be unable to defend its current market  share and win new contracts. The Group may also encounter difficulties developing new services and  prices encouraging resource optimization. ■Decrease in existing market share ■Pressure on the selling price of services ■Difficulty in gaining new market share ■Loss of municipal contracts ■Decrease in sales volume Correlated risks ■Risks of skills availability ■Risks relating to the selection and integration of acquisitions ■Risks related to climate change and natural disasters Stakeholders  ■Employees ■Shareholders Risk management The Group has to carefully select its projects in its traditional markets, offer innovative business models and steer its activities  towards the most dynamic industrial markets and regions. Its development strategy is based on anticipating and listening to its  customers, concentrating on the best development opportunities in each region, innovation and the professionalization of its  commercial activities. The Group is continuing to transform its cost structure in  order  to  increase  its  competitiveness  compared  to  competitors, while limiting reorganization costs. The  transformation of its structure and commercial activities has  already enabled Veolia to leverage its competitive advantage  in growth markets where its expertise sets it apart from its  competitors and to become a growth partner for its  customers. Veolia capitalizes on its size and multiple global  references to provide customers with more innovative and  unique offerings. Its goal is to provide cutting-edge tailored solutions, through  offerings based on attractive business models (remuneration  based on the performance of its solutions, innovative  financing, etc.). Veolia’s sales and marketing approach is also  founded on the creation of industrial partnerships and a  network of key account managers, mass roll-out of high- potential offerings, and the development of innovative  business models, closely coordinated with the zones and  operational teams. The Strategy and Innovation Department has a development  plan to accelerate the Group’s growth. Veolia is therefore  strengthening and transforming its salesforce and has  implemented a strategic program, Impact 2023, organized  around priority markets identified by the Group and high  added value service offerings, supported by Group research  and innovation efforts (see Chapter 1, Section 1.2.2 above). RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL Risk factors   VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 87  ===== PAGE 90 ===== Economic risks (EXT-04) Risk identification Description of the risk Potential effects for the Group Current geopolitical tensions significantly impact the global economy. The economic situation generated by the war in Ukraine caused a  surge in raw material and energy prices and a rise in inflation. As long  as  the  Russian-Ukrainian  conflict  continues,  the  economic  consequences of this crisis are unlikely to dissipate. In this highly  uncertain context, global economic growth is expected to slow for the  third year in a row, falling from 2.6% in 2023 to 2.4% in 2024 according  to the World Bank. The growth outlook is also impacted by the overall slowdown in the  Chinese economy, where, according to Oxford Economics, growth is  expected to decline from 5.2% in 2023 to 4.4% forecast for 2024, due to  the real estate crisis and structural difficulties. Economic slowdowns in many countries affect global trade. The  impacts on production, investment, supply chains and consumer  expenditure therefore affect the activities of the Group, as well as  those of customers and counterparties. Certain Group businesses  (especially waste) are sensitive to this type of economic shock, which  could have consequences for the Group’s results. ■Decrease in investments by customers ■Business continuity of facilities and services placed in jeopardy ■Pressure on the selling price of services ■Decrease in sales volume ■Non-payment or late payment by customers ■Economic balance of contracts compromised Correlated risks ■Counterparty risks relating to operating activities ■Currency risk ■Risks inherent to fluctuations in the price of energy, consumables and  commodities ■Liquidity risks Stakeholders ■Society ■Customers ■Employees ■Shareholders Risk management The Group’s resilience to a global economic slowdown is managed through debt control actions, active management of efficiency  efforts, management of investments and Group performance.  Veolia operates in a varied portfolio of activities, business models  and regions, which supports its resilience to potential economic  shocks. In order to anticipate such economic conditions, initiatives  were taken in the context of favorable market conditions. Following the prudent management of its liquidity due to economic  uncertainties in 2020, the Group continued this policy in 2021 and  2022. The Group has a commercial paper program capped at €6  billion, and used in the amount of €4.7 billion at the end of 2023. It  also has undrawn credit lines totaling €6 billion. Its gross liquidity is  therefore €16.6  billion as of December 31, 2023 (compared with  €17.1  billion at end-2022), and its net liquidity is €8.5  billion  (compared with €9.9 billion).  The Group is also continuing its efficiency actions with a strong  commitment to savings in the strategic program. Synergies and  efficiency levers are anticipated in investment projects. Finally,  Capex management and the monitoring of financial performance  are ensured through monthly activity reviews between the Business  Units and head office. RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL Risk factors 88 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 91 ===== Seasonality risks (EXT-05) Risk identification Description of the risk Potential effects for the Group The Group's activities are by their nature subject to the seasonality of activities and  weather conditions. Accordingly, Energy Services are primarily focused in the first and  fourth quarters of the year, corresponding to heating periods in Europe. In Water,  domestic water consumption and wastewater treatment are higher between May and  September in the northern hemisphere, where the Group conducts most of its activity. ■Change in production volumes (Water and Energy  activities) Correlated risks ■Risks related to climate change and natural disasters Stakeholders ■Shareholders Risk management The Group limits its exposure to seasonality risk through the diversity of its locations and the implementation of contractual  models that include a sharing of value created for the customer. The Group offers contractual models that are independent of volumes, such as performance contracts that include a sharing of  value created for the customer, regardless of volume-related consumption. In addition, the Group provides cutting-edge solutions  to the most complex issues encountered by customers and offerings founded on attractive business models such as performance- based payment terms, to mitigate the risks relating to seasonal factors. 2.2.2.2  Operational risks (OPE) Risks relating to employee health and safety  (OPE-01) Risk identification Description of the risk Potential effects for the Group Employee health and safety is a priority for the Group. Constant vigilance, particularly with regards to health and safety, is essential, given  the range of business sectors, geographic zones and working environments in which  Veolia operates. The management of employee health and safety is particularly important, considering  the labor-intensive requirements of some of the Group’s businesses, their nature and  the wide geographic spread of Veolia’s employees in the field (in particular, on public  roads and at customer sites). Furthermore, due to our activities, the operating conditions in which our employees  work may be detrimental to their health (physical or mental), potentially making the  jobs less attractive. Despite the Group’s specific focus on these issues (see Chapter 4, Section 4.4.3 below),  there continues to be serious and fatal accidents and an increase in such accidents, as  well as in the injury frequency and severity rates and an upsurge in occupational  diseases remains a risk. ■Operating performance of facilities ■Difficulty in gaining new market share ■Business continuity of facilities and services ■Group’s image Correlated risks ■Personal security risks  ■Environmental and industrial risks ■Risks of skills availability Stakeholders ■Employees ■Society ■Customers ■Shareholders RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL Risk factors   VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 89  ===== PAGE 92 ===== Risk management The Group’s most valuable resource and consequently its primary asset is the employees working at Veolia. Sustainably protecting  the health and safety of employees, and all service providers, sub-contractors or third-parties present on its sites while protecting  customers and communities served by the Group is an absolute priority. Given the nature of its operations and aware that solid  performance in workplace health and safety is synonymous with  increased performance for the Company, the Veolia Group has  made prevention, health and safety a daily priority in all its  activities.  The occupational risk prevention approach is based on the  involvement of the entire managerial line and the diligence of  suppliers in applying the measures taken by the Group to their  employees, as well as on a system of continuous improvement that  makes it possible to meet the commitments made and achieve the  objectives set. Veolia’s health and safety management system is based on five  strategic pillars (see Chapter  4, Section  4.4.3.1 below). The  prevention, health and safety center of excellence brings together  more than 30 experts who, using performance indicators, develop  and coordinate policies to improve synergy between businesses and  disseminate the good practices identified to all Group entities (see  Chapter 4, Section 4.4.3.1 below). Management standards for high- risk activities and the life saving rules form part of these policies.  The life savings rules were reviewed and reassessed, and updated to  bring them into compliance.  The Group’s commitment is also reflected in the signature of  international agreements and joint commitment letters between  management and employee representatives. In setting up a solid,  continuous prevention system, the Group relies on numerous  awareness-raising and training tools for staff, and robust accident  prevention analyses (see Chapter  4, Section  4.4.3.1 below) and  analyses of near misses and particularly HiPo. The structural themes  include systematic accident analysis, with more in-depth feedback  for fatal accidents, strengthened prevention in occupational health  and improved communication with employees on health and safety  topics. In particular, since 2022, specific actions have been launched  to take greater account of employee wellbeing in the work  environment and to improve psychosocial risks.  At the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis, the Group introduced health  guidelines and procedures to support the Business Units roll out  their business continuity plans and it continues its monitoring  actions today.  Environmental and industrial risks (OPE-02) Description of the risk Potential effects for the Group The Group can face environmental and industrial risks when operating its  installations or those of its customers. The waste processing sector is particularly  exposed to these risks. Several Group sites in France are classified “Installations Classées pour la Protection  de l’Environnement” (ICPE, i.e. French regulation which applies to any industrial  operation likely to create risks, or cause pollution and / or health & safety impacts to  local stakeholders), or under its equivalent outside France) (e.g. IPPC /IED Directive in  Europe). Certain Group subsidiaries operate or conduct activities at sites subject to  tightened regulations, classified under upper-tier or lower-tier Seveso facilities in  Europe or under their foreign equivalent (e.g. Directive 2012/18/EU, known as “Seveso  III” in Europe, COMAH in the United Kingdom, OSHA 1910 in the United States, MHF  in Australia). These industrial sites are closely monitored by the Group and the  competent authorities.  In particular, when the Group provides services at a “Seveso” facility, or its  equivalent, it complies with the various health and safety and risk control measures  implemented at these sites. Employees must comply with the Major Accident  Prevention Policies (MAPP) implemented by industrial customers. In France, they  must notably undergo appropriate training that encompasses the recommendations  issued by the Health, Safety and Working Conditions Committees (CSSCT) of our  industrial customers. Seveso facilities are also subject to specific internal measures that seek to prevent  major environmental and industrial accidents and to protect employees, the public  and the environment. In addition to MAPPs, Internal Emergency Plans (IEP) also apply  to these facilities, as well as emergency response measures coordinated with public  authorities in the event of an incident (Emergency Response Plan, ERP).  The main environmental and industrial risks to which the Group may be exposed are  fire, explosion, machinery breakdown, or the discharge of toxic substances that could  impact the facility, employees, local residents and the environment, including  biodiversity. The Group may also be exposed to a risk of chronic pollution. In addition to the financial impacts of damages supported directly by the Group or  resulting from business interruption, the Group may be held liable for third-party  damages. The Group may be required to incur significant expenditure to increase the  safety and security of its sites. ■Group’s image ■Loss of municipal contracts ■Difficulty in gaining new market share ■Renewal of municipal or industrial contracts ■Business continuity of facilities and services Correlated risks ■Risks relating to employee health and safety ■Risks relating to regulatory changes, particularly in the  area of health or the environment ■Risks relating to changes in business lines Stakeholders ■Planet ■Society ■Customers ■Employees ■Shareholders RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL Risk factors 90 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 93 ===== Risk management Protecting the environment and the health and safety of internal and external stakeholders are central to Veolia’s Purpose. The  Group therefore ensures compliance across all its facilities with regulations and standards and particularly those relating to  managing environmental and industrial risks Faced with the risk of being held entirely or jointly liable with its  customers in the event of serious environmental or industrial  pollution or accidents, the Group strives to satisfy its own  obligations while helping to ensure that its customers do the same.   The Group’s environmental and industrial risk management policy  seeks to: 1. identify and analyze risks (i.e. annual risk mapping of  environmental and industrial risks, hazard studies, HAZOP  studies, feedback);  2. define for all high-risk processes tailored prevention and  protection measures using prevention guidelines, drafted by  internal technical experts in conjunction with insurance  company prevention experts. When designing new installations,  technical specifications are sometimes more demanding than  current design regulations and/or standards; 3. roll-out action plans at site, Business Unit or Group level. When a  major exposure has been identified, global investment plans  may be rolled-out directly by the Group or in conjunction with  the owners (where they retain investment responsibility for  installations operated by the Group). For example, a fire  prevention and protection plan has been implemented at sorting  centers since 2019 (sprinkler systems have been installed at 40  sorting centers since 2019 in France, for a total investment in  excess of €25 million). Additional action plans are currently in  progress throughout the world to reduce the Group’s exposure  to the environmental and industrial risks generated by its liquid  and hazardous waste processing facilities, its solid fuel facilities,  its waste-to-energy facilities and all Group facilities that receive,  store or handle hazardous chemical materials or products (e.g.  installation and maintenance of pollution prevention systems at  these facilities); 4. control and audit residual exposure to these risks, particularly  through  prevention  visits  (fire,  machinery  breakdown)  conducted by Group and insurance company experts (around  one hundred sites audited on average each year, reflecting a  representative sample of the Group’s different activities). The Group has implemented an Environmental & Industrial  Management system in all Business Units to manage its  environmental performance (see Chapter 4,  Section 4.2.1.2 below),  with the dual aim of measuring the achievement of their  environmental objectives and their exposure to environmental and  industrial risks generated by their activities. This framework  common to all Group BUs is strengthened locally by environmental  and industrial management systems recognized externally: for  example ISO  140001 and ISO  50001 certification, Process Safety  Management, labels, compliance with contractual commitments. All environmental and industrial risk prevention actions resulting  from the Group policy are deployed in the Group Business Units and  coordinated with the various functional departments (Legal,  Business Support and Performance, Sustainable Development, Risk  and Insurance).  Under the Group Asset Management policy, these action plans also  include an asset management component for priority sites and  operations since 2020. This policy states that priority sites and  operations must have an asset management program clearly  aligned with the Group framework, particularly with regard to  updating the asset register, work preparation and performance  procedures, documentary management processes and spare parts  management. The objectives identified for each of these categories  become integral components of the site asset management plan.  Any deviations identified in these areas from the objectives set by  the Group are monitored in corrective action plans. Priority sites and  operations are systematically audited by the Group’s AM experts.  In conjunction with these audits, reliability centered maintenance  plans are deployed for critical equipment, specifically to prevent  machine breakdowns and ensure business continuity. Internal  training sessions are available to help the Group Business Units take  ownership of these methods. They allow prevention measures to be  defined, from on-site management of spare parts inventory to back- up stock (to limit periods of immobilization), or the installation of  redundancy or back-up equipment (to ensure the operation of the  most critical systems even in the event of equipment breakdown). The activities also benefit from the support of the Strategy and  Innovation Department and Veolia Environnement’s office in  Brussels, which monitors changes in regulation. When the Group  provides services at a “Seveso” facility or its foreign equivalent, it  complies with the different health and safety measures  implemented at these sites. Group employees are required to undergo mandatory training and  participate in Health, Safety and Working Conditions Committee  meetings at industrial customers’ sites and comply with the Major  Accident Prevention Policies (MAPP) implemented by its customers.  Seveso facilities are also subject to specific internal measures that  seek to prevent accidents and protect employees, the public and the  environment. In addition to MAPPs, Internal Operational Plans (IOP)  also apply to these facilities, as well as crisis intervention measures  coordinated with public authorities in the event of an incident  (Emergency Response Plans, ERP). Finally, the Group transfers the residual risk to insurance companies  by taking out insurance policies covering these risks (Property  damage and business continuity policy, Third-party liability policy  (see Section 2.1.6 above)). A steering committee (Prevention Committee) comprising members  of the Group Executive Committee is responsible for periodically  monitoring these plans, facilitates their implementation and  updates the Group’s residual exposure to these risks as the plans  advance. RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL Risk factors   VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 91  ===== PAGE 94 ===== Risks related to tangible and intangible property, and information systems (OPE-03) Risk identification Description of the risk Potential effects for the Group The protection of the Group’s tangible and intangible property and information systems is  subject to extremely strict constraints and particularly regulatory constraints, which could  expose a Group company to liability. The Group may be the target of malicious or terrorist acts  targeting tangible and intangible property and information systems, due to the nature of its  activities (Water, Waste and Energy) and its geographic locations. These risks may have a decisive impact on the continuity of its activities and for several  stakeholders. In particular, the drinking water sector is an activity of vital importance due to  the related public health considerations. Information systems are indispensable tools for carrying out the Group’s operational activities  and managing its functional departments (Finance, Human Resources, etc.). Information  system downtime resulting from a disaster or a malicious act involving one or more of its  information systems could have major consequences for the quality or even the continuity of  the service delivered and for the availability, integrity and confidential and strategic nature of  the data hosted by the Group, and could thus potentially have an impact on the activity of its  customers. The deterioration in international security and the multiplication of information and media- based attacks (facilitated by new information and communication technologies such as social  networking) compound the risks relating to the security of tangible and intangible property  and information systems. ■Operating performance of facilities ■Business continuity of facilities and services ■Data leakage, loss, theft ■Group’s image Correlated risks ■Environmental and industrial risks ■Geopolitical and political risks Stakeholders  ■Society ■Customers ■Employees ■Shareholders RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL Risk factors 92 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 95 ===== Risk management Due to the nature of its businesses and the scope and diversity of its sites, the Group pays close attention to the security of its  tangible and intangible property and information systems. The primary roles of the Security Department are to avert security  threats potentially affecting the Group and its employees and to  manage violations possibly impacting employees, tangible and  intangible property (including information systems) and securities  of the Group in France and abroad. The Security Department is also  responsible for coordinating warning and crisis management  systems. A network of security officers has been set-up in all  countries where the Group operates, in order to tailor the  management of these risks to specific local conditions. It provides  advice and assistance to country managers on security-related  issues within the framework of current laws and regulations. The  organization of crisis management at Veolia revolves around two  separate but complementary arrangements that come together to  deal rapidly and efficiently with any deteriorated or critical  situation that the Company or its entities may encounter.  A warning system that operates 24 hours a day and is deployed  across all the Group’s locations, escalates information quickly up  the line to the Company’s Executive Management on any critical or  sensitive situation. This process is updated regularly, primarily to  take account of changes in the Group’s organizational structure. It  then moves into crisis management mode and, if the situation is  critical enough, operational cells can be quickly mobilized bringing  together all the necessary functional skills and the departments  concerned. Predetermined objective criteria are used to assess the  seriousness of the situation. This process is constantly refined on  the basis of feedback and post-crisis evaluations of each of the  situations that have been managed.  An information systems security organization (ISS, cybersecurity)  was set up in 2013. Managed by the Cybersecurity Officer, a member  of the Group Security Department and in conjunction with head  office and local Group departments, the ISS is also supported by a  network of local officers spanning all countries where the Group  operates. In 2020, the Group’s cybersecurity strategy was based on  a normative framework with risk reduction and Group business  resilience objectives. At Group level, the Cybersecurity Steering  Committee validates and monitors the implementation of the  general cybersecurity policy. It meets once a month, chaired by the  Group’s General Counsel and brings together the central  departments (finance, risk and insurance, internal control, technical,  safety, information systems) and the Cybersecurity Officer. The  General Counsel and the Cybersecurity Officer report at least once  annually to the Group Executive Committee and the Accounts and  Audit Committee to present the Group’s approach to risks and the  cybersecurity strategy and provide an update on measures taken.  In order to integrate the emergence of risks relating to increasingly  connected industrial environments, the Cybersecurity Officer  facilitates, together with the Business Support and Performance  Director and the Information Systems Director, the Industrial  Cybersecurity Steering Committee implemented in 2021. The  program to secure the 25 most critical plants continued in order to  protect these plants to the maximum extent, through support and  tools. This program can also respond to geopolitical threats and  regulatory changes, such as the NIS2 Directive. The Information Systems Security Policies (ISSP), including for the  industrial sector (ISSP-I) are implemented in all Veolia entities under  the oversight of the Cybersecurity Officer and local security officers. To control the application of these policies, annual self-assessments  are carried out based on a questionnaire called “Fix the basics” at all  entities. In addition, audit and assistance assignments are carried  out by specialist external partners using international standards  (e.g. NIST) in entities presenting the highest risk and on the most  exposed systems. Action plans approved and validated by the  Information Systems Department and the BU director are then  defined and implemented. Monitoring & Assistance assignments  are organized annually to help BUs with low maturity and facilitate  the roll-out of good cybersecurity practices. The resulting action  plans are presented to and monitored by the cybersecurity steering  committee. In addition, several Group entities are certified ISO  27001, or equivalent.  The cybersecurity roadmap is supplemented by cyber awareness- raising and training actions, to support users and IT and OT experts  with the implementation of IT hygiene and cybersecurity rues. An  awareness-raising program for all employees and a training  program for certain specific functions have been defined. These  actions are carried out by means of IT charters, distributing  information on best cybersecurity practices and specific actions,  such as special events during the European cybersecurity month  created by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (AESRI) (in  October each year). Awareness-raising and training e-learning  courses are regularly conducted and updated. Finally, phishing  campaigns are conducted frequently to test employee cybersecurity  reflexes in a fun way.  In 2022, to respond to the geopolitical situation and related cyber  threats, an operational crisis unit dedicated to cybersecurity risk  was set up. The unit’s objective is to assess the Group’s exposure to  a certain number of identified cyber attack scenarios, and to  strengthen the resilience of entities. In 2023, to take account of the rise in the likelihood of cyberattacks,  including ransomware attacks, information system detection and  protection measures were supported by EDR (Endpoint Detection  and Response) tools and the roll-out of a Global SoC (Security  Operation Center), enabling threats and cyberattack attempts to be  identified more widely and faster and resolved. Information system technical assessment campaigns are organized  locally by BU and supplemented by the Group cybersecurity  department: cyber technical audits, pentest intrusion tests and bug  bounty campaigns. RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL Risk factors   VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 93  ===== PAGE 96 ===== Risks relating to changes in business lines (OPE-04) Risk identification Description of the risk Potential effects for the Group The Group’s Impact 2023 strategic program identifies fundamental challenges for  the world, in relation to which the Group proposes to set up new service offerings:  health and new pollutants, new material loops, the food chain, etc. (see Chapter 1,  Section 1.2.2 above). Due to their strong potential for innovation, these fields are  particularly subject to automation, digitization, the use of artificial intelligence,  but also to the adaptation of certain skills. In its objective to position itself in an  efficient and unique way on these challenges, Veolia is subject to changes in  certain labor markets and must therefore adapt the compensation models of  certain Business Units, while keeping a forward-looking watch on the  development of service offerings and skills in all these sectors. ■Difficulty in gaining new market share ■Competitive pressure from certain sectors ■Operating performance of facilities ■Group’s image Correlated risks ■Risks of skills availability Stakeholders ■Planet ■Society ■Customers ■Employees ■Shareholders Risk management The Group has set up a strategic program, Impact 2023, in connection with the definition of new expertise and skills requirements  for its new development challenges. In a context of rapid change in business lines and subsequent  working methods, Veolia has strengthened its ability to anticipate  emerging markets and business lines, particularly in the context of  its Impact 2023 strategic program.  In addition to this analytical work, the Group is strengthening its  network of partnerships with companies in the industrial and  service sectors, to identify innovative solutions to accompany the  development of certain business lines.  RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL Risk factors 94 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 97 ===== Risks of skills availability (OPE-05)  Risk identification Description of the risk Potential effects for the Group The Group conducts a range of businesses, requiring a variety of constantly  changing skills. To accompany this evolution and the deployment of service offerings in new  markets, the Group must acquire new expertise and encourage employee mobility.  Also, the shortage of skilled labor in certain countries may have an impact on the  Group’s operating conditions. Accordingly, the need to constantly identify new profiles and be attractive, but also  to continuously train existing staff, exposes the Group to risk if it is unable to  harness in a timely manner the skills required at its locations. ■Difficulty in gaining new market share ■Competitive pressure from certain sectors ■Operating performance of facilities ■Continuity of services Correlated risks ■Risks relating to the selection and integration of  acquisitions ■Risks relating to changes in business lines Stakeholders ■Employees ■Customers ■Shareholders Risk management The role of the Human Resources Development Department is to define and promote the Group’s policies relating to mobility,  career management, and talent identification and management at all of the Group’s establishments. Veolia strives to attract, train, develop and retain its staff at all  levels of qualification and in all areas of employment in which it  operates. Through training, Veolia ensures that its employees, the vast  majority of whom are manual workers and technicians, develop  their skills. Veolia believes in the responsibility and autonomy of its  employees at all levels of the organization and in all countries. The  Group has therefore placed training and development at the center  of  its  multifaceted  performance  and  indicators,  with  a  commitment to increase its training efforts with a target of 23  hours training on average per employee. In a context of rapid changes in work techniques and organizations,  Veolia ensures that there is a balance between the skills and  expertise available and those needed in new business lines. This  forms part of the provisional management of jobs and careers  policy, in particular for the industrial market.  An agreement was therefore signed in the form of a letter of  commitment with the European Works Council in 2018 (with an  amendment signed in 2021), on changes in the businesses and  skills, notably with regard to the Company’s strategic direction.  Through this agreement, Veolia focuses on anticipating changes in  its businesses in line with the Group’s transformation, supporting  and encouraging career development and offering the right  training solutions In addition, the work achieved by the Group’s new Learning  Department enables it to propose a new training offering (see  Chapter 4, Section 4.4.4 below):  ■supporting ecological transformation (particularly through the  ecological transformation fresk, the 2 tonnes Workshop, the e- learning module on planetary limits and more than 20 e- learning pathways in partnership with Climate School);  ■accompanying changes in the business: energy solutions in the  water and waste businesses, bioconversion, sustainable  purchasing, green finance, etc.; ■developing strategic skills for the Group through the Academies  (Digital, OHS, Innovation, Sales, Finance). The Group’s considerable efforts in the area of talent management  (identification, dedicated training programs, roll-out of the  ManagementBehaviors@Veolia guidlines, manager commitment  survey), and commitments to diversity and internationalization  serve to strengthen the loyalty and professionalism of Group  talents (see Chapter 4, Section 4.4.4 below).  RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL Risk factors   VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 95  ===== PAGE 98 ===== Purchasing, supply and logistics risks (OPE-06) Description of the risk Potential effects for the Group Given the extensive coverage of its activities and its necessarily global supply chain,  the Group may encounter difficulties in obtaining the energy, equipment,  consumables, commodities or services necessary to ensure the continuity of its  activities. The Group can be faced with a shortage of critical products and materials for  purchasing categories under pressure.  Certain purchase categories may be considered critical due to the limited number of  suppliers available, which can affect the prices and/or availability of these products.  The supply chain is also subject to many external hazards (geopolitical, political,  climate, etc.) that could result in a service interruption in our businesses and/or  delays. ■Difficulty in ensuring business continuity ■Group’s image ■Deterioration in relationships with suppliers and the  Group’s supply chain Correlated risks ■Economic risks ■Geopolitical and political risks  ■Risks inherent to fluctuations in the price of energy,  consumables and commodities Stakeholders ■Society ■Planet ■Customers ■Shareholders Risk management The purchasing sector has sourcing, procurement and risk management procedures that allow, among other things, high-risk purchasing  categories to be identified. The processes defined therein, in particular Category Management, allow the Group’s exposure to business  interruption risks to be limited. To limit dependency on critical suppliers and ensure continuity of supply, each purchasing structure (local or global) implements purchasing  strategies for the categories for which it is responsible. These strategies are based on the Group Category Management policy and are adapted  to the specific characteristics of each of the purchasing categories (identification of needs, supplier market, geopolitical context, etc.). To  ensure continuity of service, the entities implement locally appropriate inventory policies for the product categories that require it. Furthermore, during the tender phase, the main critical risks to which the Group is exposed are analyzed. These are (1) financial risks  (creditworthiness, dependency, etc.), (2) operational risks (quality, deadlines, market conditions, etc.), (3) compliance and integrity risks (ethics,  conflicts of interest, competition, sanctions, legal constraints, etc.) and (4) corporate social responsibility risks (human rights, environment and  social issues). RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL Risk factors 96 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 99 ===== Personal security risks (OPE-07) Risk identification Description of the risk Potential effects for the Group The protection of the Group’s employees is subject to extremely strict constraints  and particularly regulatory constraints, which could expose a Group company to  liability. Given the nature of the Group’s activities and its geographic spread, its  employees could be the target of malicious acts. Veolia employees work or travel in countries where the political, geopolitical or  social climate can expose them to criminal, malicious or terrorist acts or violent  situations. The deterioration in international security and the multiplication of information  and media-based attacks (facilitated by new information and communication  technologies such as social networking) compound the risks relating to the security  of persons. ■Group’s image Correlated risks ■Geopolitical and political risks ■Risks relating to employee health and safety  ■Environmental and industrial risks  Stakeholders ■Employees ■Society ■Shareholders Risk management In order to anticipate and guard against international security risks, the Security Department constantly monitors and analyses the  international security context in each of the high-risk countries where the Group operates. A classification of high-risk areas is updated each month and  distributed throughout the Group. A travel procedure has also been  implemented for high-risk countries. In this context, the Security  Department conducts a case-by-case examination of all travel  requests to those countries considered to present the highest levels  of risk. Each travel request is accompanied by specific security  guidelines tailored to the risks associated with the country or  countries in question and the traveler’s profile. In 2023, 2,036 travel  requests for high-risk countries were processed by the Security  Department.  To train and inform employees on the prevention and protection  rules and behavior to adopt when traveling in high-risk countries,  an e-learning course has been implemented. It is mandatory for all  travel to high-risk countries and optional for other countries. Face to face training sessions can also be provided depending on  the specific needs of the teams and the duration of the  assignments in the destination country. Security plans are drawn-up for the most sensitive countries where  the Group operates, to facilitate the reactivity of the Group and in  particular local staff in the event of a crisis. A safety correspondent  has also been identified in each of these countries. This individual  acts as the Security Department’s representative and is the  preferred point of contact in his or her scope. In addition, the Security Department intervenes upstream of  projects in the countries most at risk to perform a technical and  budgetary assessment of security measures to be planned and  implemented.. RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL Risk factors   VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 97  ===== PAGE 100 ===== Transformation risks related to multifaceted performance (OPE-08) Risk identification Description of the risk Potential effects for the Group As part of the implementation of its Impact 2023 strategic program, the Group adopted  an ambitious multifaceted performance plan aligned with its Purpose. This  multifaceted performance is founded on five performance pillars: human resources  performance, corporate social performance, environmental performance, commercial  performance and economic and financial performance.  A commitment is associated with each performance and broken down into objectives,  with quantified indicators for 2023. In total, there are 18 objectives, 19 indicators and 19  targets that the Group must reach by 2023. The attainment of these targets is subject  to the Group’s ability to transform its organization and internal operating methods and  processes. Applying the same level of requirement to the five performance pillars by  2023 is challenging for the Group. In addition, constant dialogue with stakeholders is a  major factor in helping them appropriate these multifaceted performance principles.  Failure to achieve the multifaceted performance targets could negatively affect the  Group’s credibility in deploying its Purpose, damaging its image with stakeholders and  weakening employee commitment.  ■Group’s image Correlated risks ■Risks relating to the selection and integration of  acquisitions ■Risks relating to changes in business lines ■Risks related to climate change and natural disasters  Stakeholders ■Planet ■Society ■Customers ■Employees ■Shareholders Risk management To address its 2023 strategic challenges and, in particular, its multifaceted performance commitments, the Group implemented a  management system at the highest level of the organization and launched a campaign for the appropriation of its Purpose and  multifaceted performance challenges by all Group employees from 2020. This system is supported by: ■the Board of Directors, which controls the proper  implementation of the Impact 2023 strategic program;  ■a “Purpose” Committee, created in 2021; ■the Group’s Executive Committee, which is responsible for  its monitoring; ■a Purpose steering committee, in charge of coordination  and comprising members of the Executive Committee and  operating departments, which meets regularly; ■the Strategy and Innovation Department, which steers Veolia’s  strategy with a multifaceted performance perspective, aligned  with the Group’s Purpose; ■a two-person team comprising an Executive Committee sponsor  and a Group “Objective Officer”, responsible for steering each  multifaceted performance objective; ■a network of Purpose Officers in the BUs, supporting managers  and accelerating the roll-out of Veolia’s Purpose and  multifaceted performance in their entities.  RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL Risk factors 98 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 101 ===== Risks relating to the selection and integration of acquisitions (OPE-09) Risk identification Description of the risk Potential effects for the Group The Group develops though both organic growth and external growth through  acquisitions. In this context, it may acquire companies that are over valued that could  subsequently generate asset impairment.  Furthermore, the operating performance of companies acquired could also deviate  from forecasts.  Finally, these acquisitions could encounter some difficulties in implementing expected  synergies, in particular during the employee integration phase, the realization of  savings from the pooling of purchases or the implementation of common information  systems. ■Asset impairment ■Difficulty in gaining new market share ■Competitive pressure from certain sectors ■Operating performance of facilities Correlated risks ■Risks of skills availability ■Risks related to tangible and intangible property, and  information systems ■Risks relating to market changes Stakeholders ■Society ■Customers ■Employees ■Shareholders Risk management The Group is implementing an integrated acquisition strategy and is strengthening its system for selecting and integrating  acquisitions (procedures, training, etc.). The merger and acquisition process is part of the Group strategic  approach. The relevant BU performs a detailed analysis of each  acquisition project from both a strategic, commercial and financial  point of view. Acquisition projects are reviewed and approved by  the Country, Zone and Group Commitment Committees according  to financial thresholds and particularly investment thresholds.  These projects are subject to systematic, comprehensive review  (strategic, technical, operational, financial, legal, human resources,  compliance, etc.) in which all risks and opportunities are analyzed  and assessed. Business development procedures have been  strengthened to detail acquisition procedures, both upstream and  downstream.  In addition, a procedure for integrating acquisitions and post- acquisition follow-up has been established and published on the  Group’s Intranet and is included in the Group’s Essential guidelines.  Post-acquisition audits are carried out to enable better monitoring  of projects approved by the Commitment Committees and to  encourage the sharing of experience within the Group. For projects that do not meet the objectives of the initial business  plan, action plans are drawn up and new investments are deferred  in the Business Unit concerned. The sharing of these practices  within the community of development directors contributes to the  appropriation of acquisition-related issues by operational teams in  the upstream and downstream phases of acquisitions. Veolia Suez merger The Veolia and Suez merger completed in 2022 was a success, with  synergies realized in many areas. The excellent implementation of  the Suez merger demonstrates Veolia's ability to integrate  acquisitions and even very large acquisitions. In particular, the 2023  Voice of Ressourcers barometer showed a high level of  commitment among employees from all origins, and subscription  rates to employee share ownership transactions are also a sign of  confidence in the Group’s future. Over the period of the Impact  2023 program, employee share ownership increased from 2% at the  end of 2019 to 7.5% at the end of 2023.

Although prices have fallen overall compared to 2022, geopolitical tension in  certain geographical areas or countries are placing pressure on some of the  Group’s supply sources.  Group contracts generally contain indexing mechanisms. However, these  mechanisms do not always enable these costs to be covered (existence of time  lags between price increases and the moment the Group is authorized to increase  its prices to cover its additional costs or an inappropriate update formula given  the cost structure, including taxes). Any steady increase in purchase prices and/or  taxes could, by increasing costs and reducing profitability, undermine the Group  operations, insofar as it would be unable to increase its prices sufficiently to cover  such additional costs.  The sorting, recycling and trading activities are particularly exposed to changes in  the price of secondary raw materials (paper, plastic, scrap and non-ferrous  metals). A significant and long-term drop in the price of recycled materials,  potentially combined with the impact of the economic environment on volumes,  could affect the Group’s operating results. Group activities also include the  production of electricity in Central Europe, Asia, Germany, the United Kingdom  and France. A significant portion of these sales concerns “waste” energy  production, co-generated with heat. The Group is also exposed to price volatility  in the electricity market and price changes imposed by the regulator, in countries  where the price of electricity is regulated. A significant long-term decline in the  market price of electricity in these countries could therefore impact the Group’s  operating performance.  For further information, please refer to Chapter 6.1, Note 8.3.1.3 to the  consolidated financial statements below.  ■Economic balance of contracts compromised ■Change in consumption volumes (Water and Energy  activities) Correlated risks ■Economic risks ■Risks relating to market changes ■Geopolitical and political risks ■Risk relating to tax developments  ■Purchasing, supply and logistics risks Stakeholders ■Society ■Customers ■Shareholders Risk management Most contracts have clauses, including indexation formulas, that allow any changes in the price of energy, commodities and raw  materials to be passed on. The Group has a raw materials risk management policy, which  seeks to establish a progressive hedge over three years (where  possible) in order to limit results volatility. For global purchasing  contracts most exposed to fluctuations in energy, commodity and  raw material prices, the purchasing department negotiates update  formula with suppliers, enabling a rational adjustment of prices  and the sharing of risks. Most of the contracts entered into by the Group include clauses  aimed at passing on any fluctuations in energy, commodity and  raw material prices to the Group’s revenue sources, particularly by  means of indexation formulas. Furthermore, in certain countries  and for certain energy sources, the supply of energy may be  covered by long-term supply contracts. RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL Risk factors 100 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 103 ===== Counterparty risks relating to operating activities (FIN-02) Risk identification Description of the risk Potential effects for the Group The Group’s financial and operating activities expose it to the risks of failure of its  counterparties (customers, suppliers, partners, intermediaries, banks).  Counterparty risk can arise at the time of payment or delivery of the services and  supplies purchased. It can also concern losses on assets, such as financial  investments or the bankruptcy of a customer or supplier.  Finally, counterparty risk is the risk that an entity is unable to respect its financial  commitments (debt repayment, breach of guarantees, offset under a derivative  transaction, etc.). See Chapter 5.3, Financing, below The economic and geopolitical environment in which the Group is currently  operating is a major risk factor. ■Non-payment or late payment by customers ■Economic balance of contracts compromised ■Decrease in investments by customers Correlated risks ■Economic risks ■Geopolitical and political risks Stakeholders ■Society ■Customers ■Shareholders Risk management The Group anticipates the occurrence of counterparty risks related to its operating activities by assessing potential volumes of  receivables. The Group carries out an upstream analysis of the creditworthiness  of its customers in order to assess potential volumes of receivables  and anticipate the occurrence of risks. Credit risk on operating  financial assets is appraised via the rating of primarily public  customers. The risk on other operating receivables is assessed  through the analysis of customer late payments/failures, taking  into account their nature (public/private). In addition, the Group limits its exposure to the risk of default by its  counterparties through the diversity and number of its customers. RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL Risk factors   VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 101  ===== PAGE 104 ===== Liquidity risks (FIN-03) Risk identification Description of the risk Potential effects for the Group The Company’s gross liquidity is defined as all available cash and confirmed bank  lines. Net liquidity corresponds to gross liquidity less current financing  requirements. The Group could be exposed to liquidity risk and not have sufficient  financial resources to meet its contractual commitments. ■Difficulty repaying debt ■Difficulty in gaining new market share Correlated risks ■No correlated risks Stakeholders ■Society ■Customers ■Shareholders Risk management The operational management of liquidity and financing is managed by the Financing and Treasury Department. This management involves the centralization of major financing  and material excess cash balances to optimize liquidity and cash.  The Group has a commercial paper program for short-term  financing, with a ceiling of €6 billion; the spreading of payments  over 12  months helps reduce short-term liquidity risk. The Group  has a multi-currency syndicated credit facility for a total undrawn  amount of €4.5 billion as of December 31, 2023 and bilateral credit  facilities for a total undrawn amount of €1.5 billion as of December  31, 2023. These credit lines enable the Group to reduce liquidity risk. The Group generally refinances in advance its major bond  maturities to reduce liquidity risk, however due to its strong  liquidity position, the Group did not need to issue bonds in 2023. In  2023, the Group repaid four bond lines at maturity for a total of  €1.4 billion and partially repaid a €600 million hybrid bond line  inherited from Suez with an initial call date of April 19, 2024 in the  amount of €397.2 million on November 23, 2023.  On November 22, 2023, the Group performed a new €600 million  hybrid bond issue. Gross liquidity is therefore €16.6  billion as of December 31, 2023  (compared with €17.1  billion at end-2022), and net liquidity is  €8.5 billion (compared with €9.9 billion at end-2022).  For further information, please refer to Chapter 6.1, Note 8.3.2.2 to  the consolidated financial statements below. RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL Risk factors 102 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 105 ===== Risks relating to tax developments (FIN-04) Risk identification Description of the risk Potential effects for the Group Veolia operates throughout the world in numerous countries with different tax  regimes. Tax risk is the risk associated with changes in laws and regulations  (potentially with retroactive effect), the interpretation of those laws and  regulations and changes in case law concerning the application of tax rules. These rules in the different countries where the Group operates are constantly  changing and the tax regimes and tax rates applicable may be subject to  interpretation and/or amendment. The Group cannot provide an absolute  guarantee that its interpretations will not be challenged, with negative  consequences for its financial situation or results. Furthermore, the Group is  involved in standard tax audits and appeals. The main current tax audits and disputes are disclosed in Chapter 6.1, Note 11.3 to  the consolidated financial statements below. ■Economic balance of contracts compromised ■Pressure on the selling price of services Correlated risks ■Risks inherent to fluctuations in the price of energy and  commodities ■Risks relating to regulatory changes, particularly in the  area of health or the environment  ■Geopolitical and political risks Stakeholders ■Society ■Customers ■Shareholders Risk management In order to comply with local tax laws and regulations, Veolia calls on the Tax Department and a network of tax professionals to  ensure compliance with tax obligations and thereby reduce the tax risk to a reasonable and normal level. The tax authorities have carried out various tax audits in Group  companies that are both consolidated and not consolidated for tax  purposes. To date, none of these reviews have led to liabilities to  the tax authorities materially in excess of amounts estimated  during the review of tax risks. In estimating the risk as of December  31, 2023, the Group took account of the expenses that could arise as  a consequence of these audits, based on a technical analysis of the  positions defended by the Group before the tax authorities. The Group periodically reviews the risk estimate in view of  developments in the audits and legal proceedings. Currency risk (FIN-05) Risk identification Description of the risk Potential effects for the Group The Group presents its financial statements in euros and must translate certain of  its assets, liabilities, income and expense items into euros at the applicable  exchange rates. Consequently, fluctuations in the exchange rate of other currencies  against the euro can affect the value of these items in the financial statements,  even if their intrinsic value is unchanged in the original currency.  An increase in the value of the euro may therefore result in a decrease in the  reported value, in euros, of the Company’s investments held in foreign currencies.  Currency risk is linked to the Group’s international business conducted outside the  euro area, which generates cash flows in numerous currencies. A 10% appreciation  in the main currencies of the countries used by the Group against the euro would  increase net assets by €1,542 million, while a 10% depreciation in these currencies  would reduce net assets by €1,261 million. ■Group’s results and equity Correlated risks ■No correlated risks Stakeholders ■Society ■Customers ■Shareholders Risk management The Group Financing and Treasury Department manages currency risk centrally Residual transaction exchange risk can be hedged using derivatives  (forward purchases or sales, swaps). For the risk arising on the  accounting translation of net assets (also known as asset exchange  risk) the Group favors the implementation of foreign currency  financing or derivatives for the most material assets.  For further information, please refer to Chapter 6.1, Note 8.3.1.2 to  the consolidated financial statements below. RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL Risk factors   VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 103  ===== PAGE 106 ===== 2.2.2.4  Regulatory, ethical and legal risks (REG) Risks relating to regulatory changes, particularly in the area of health or the environment (REG-01) Risk identification Description of the risk Potential effects for the Group The Group’s activities are subject to extensive, evolving and increasingly stringent  environmental regulations. These regulations sometimes impose significant  constraints. Most Group activities require operating permits or authorizations that define the  rules governing the operation of facilities. These operating permits are issued by  public authorities pursuant to authorization procedures encompassing the  performance of specific studies presenting, in particular, the environmental  footprint of the facilities. In particular, these regulatory compliance obligations  concern water discharges, drinking water quality, waste processing, soil and ground  water pollution and the characteristics of atmospheric emissions. Failure to meet these compliance obligations could be prejudicial to the Group and  damage its reputation. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are constantly changing. These  amendments can generate significant compliance expenditure or investment for  our facilities.  While regulatory changes offer new market opportunities for the Group’s  businesses, they also generate a number of risks. Veolia Group is constantly  required to invest to ensure the continued compliance of facilities under its  responsibility. If it has no investment responsibility, Veolia advises its customers to  ensure they undertake the necessary compliance work themselves. In contrast, public authorities have the power to launch proceedings which could  lead to the suspension or cancellation of permits or authorizations held by the  Group or injunctions to suspend or cease certain activities, if they identify the  slightest instance of non-compliance. These measures may be accompanied by  fines and administrative or criminal sanctions which could have a significant  negative impact on the Group’s reputation, activities, financial position, results or  outlook. Finally, the field of finance is also impacted by regulations related to the  environment. Indeed, the European regulation EU/2020/852 of June 18, 2020  ''Taxonomy regulation'' is part of the sustainable finance policy deployed by the  European Union (EU). It defines a framework intended to promote sustainable  investments through improved information for financial market players. The Group  has therefore organized itself to qualify its activities. ■Difficulty in gaining new market share ■Time needed to obtain operating permits or  authorizations ■Non-renewal of municipal contracts ■Difficulty of obtaining ''sustainable'' investments Correlated risks ■Environmental and industrial risks ■Risks relating to market changes ■Risks relating to climate change and natural disasters Stakeholders ■Planet ■Society ■Customers ■Employees ■Shareholders Risk management In accordance with legal, regulatory and administrative requirements (see Chapter 1, Section 1.6 above) or for specific preventive or  protection measures, Veolia is constantly required to incur expenditure or invest in facilities under the Group’s responsibility to  ensure their continued compliance. Veolia continues to commit the necessary means to comply with its  environmental, health and safety obligations and to manage  sanitary risks. When the Group has no investment responsibility,  Veolia advises its customers to ensure they undertake the  necessary regulatory compliance work themselves. Believing that mere compliance with regulatory requirements is  not sufficient to ensure adequate control of health and  environmental risks, Veolia has also voluntarily implemented a  number of measures based on strict prevention and control  procedures as part of a global approach, particularly with respect to  its multi-service contracts (for example, hazard studies, impact  assessments and checkpoint controls and inspections). The Group also carries out active research monitoring on topics  such as emerging biological parameters and the toxicity of  mixtures. It develops research projects, alone or in partnership with  research centers or French or foreign specialized bodies, on certain  subjects that are deemed a priority. To implement the taxonomy, Veolia took action from the end of  2020, under the impetus of the Executive Committee, so as to be  able to provide all the required information. The technical and  financial teams (at head office and in the Business Units, close to  the installations) implemented a protocol aimed at defining the  means of applying the Delegated Regulations to Veolia’s activities  (see Chapter 4, Section 4.5 below). RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL Risk factors 104 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 107 ===== Corruption and business integrity risks (REG-02) Risk identification Description of the risk Potential effects for the Group Actions by employees, corporate officers or external stakeholders which contravene  the principles set out by the Group in its compliance programs could expose Group  companies to criminal and/or civil penalties as well as harm to its reputation. Preventing corruption and other unethical business practices is a major issue for the  Group and all its employees. The Group must be particularly vigilant regarding  these risks, particularly due to the nature of its contracts, the investments made  and the difficulties unique to certain countries where it operates. ■Group’s image ■Difficulty in gaining new market share ■Loss of public and industrial contracts ■Renewal of public and industrial contracts Correlated risks ■Geopolitical and political risks ■Risks relating to the selection and integration of  acquisitions Stakeholders ■Society ■Customers ■Employees ■Shareholders ■Planet Risk management The Compliance Department is responsible for strengthening the compliance culture within the Group and in its relations with  third parties and detecting any non-compliance and dealing with it appropriately, so as to protect the Group against ethical and  non-compliance risks. The Group therefore implements compliance programs notably  comprising norms, procedures, a whistleblowing system and  training, as well as assessment and control measures. Managing third parties (customers, suppliers, partners, etc.) represents  a key compliance challenge, as they constitute a non-negligible  potential source of exposure to compliance risks for the Group. Veolia deals with this issue through a third-party comprehensive  assessment process, implemented by key functions, such as the  Security, Purchasing and Compliance Departments. The system for managing these corruption and business integrity  risks is described in detail in Chapter 4,, Section 4.6.3 below. Human rights risks (REG-03) Risk identification Description of the risk Potential effects for the Group Due to the geographic spread of its activities, the Group is exposed to non- compliance by stakeholders with the principles set out in the Group’s human rights  policy, notably external stakeholders (subcontractors, suppliers, partners). ■Group’s image ■Difficulty in gaining new market share ■Loss of public and industrial contracts ■Renewal of public and industrial contracts Correlated risks ■Risks relating to employee health and safety Stakeholders ■Society ■Customers ■Employees ■Shareholders ■Planet Risk management The Group has been working hard for years to uphold the human rights not only of its employees, subcontractors and suppliers,  but also of the communities living in the areas where it operates. The Veolia Human Rights program seeks, within the strict  application of the Group’s values, to retain the trust of internal and  external  stakeholders,  reinforce  appeal  and  commercial  differentiation and protect the Group’s reputation. This program is  fully in line with Veolia’s Purpose.  This dedication to human rights is reflected in its sustainable  development commitments (see Section  4.1.1 below) and its  fundamental values and principles set out in its Ethics Guide (see  Section 4.6.1.1 below). The system for managing Human Rights risks is described in detail  in Chapter 4, Section 4.6.4 below.

This award recognizes the work  of all the teams that contribute to preparing the regulated  information and acknowledges the transparency efforts over  several years. For the last fourteen years, the Transparency Awards have  measured and rewarded the information quality of French listed  companies. The aim is to enable issuers to measure their  performance annually and identify best market practices and  establish them as true standards. An annual transparency study,  certified by Bureau Veritas Certification, is conducted each year  for all SBF 120 French companies. For each company, four  financial and non-financial public information documents are  audited according to 289 objective and public criteria: the  universal registration document, the notice of general meeting,  the ethics guide and the website. A scientific committee,  comprising ten independent members from institutions  representing information users, guarantees the neutrality of  the study and the fairness of the ranking. This committee meets  several times a year to define the new transparency criteria and  validate the results according to a methodology based on four  pillars: information accessibility, accuracy, comparability and  availability.

Training and integration of directors At the request of the Board of Directors, the Company organizes  training for new directors on the specific aspects of the Group’s  businesses to facilitate their integration, particularly through site  visits. Moreover, to facilitate their integration, new Board members  may meet the Group’s key executive officers. Thus, in the context of the integration of two Directors representing  employees at the end of 2014, the Company organized in 2014 and  2015 an internal training session for them and enrolled them in an  outside training program designed by the French Institute of Directors  (IFA) and Sciences Po which led to the issue of a Corporate Director’s  Certificate. This training program was repeated in 2019 for Mr. Franck  Le Roux. Following her appointment as a director representing  employee shareholders on June 15, 2022, Mrs. Agata Mazurek-Bąk  commenced a training program with the IFA. In addition, since 2015, the Company has organized meetings between  directors and economic and political leaders and director visits to  Group operating sites, including exchanges with Group operating  teams, notably in the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom, China,  Hungary and the United States. These annual visits, which were  interrupted during the health crisis, contribute to a better  understanding of Veolia’s businesses and their many challenges and  particularly environmental and social (CSR) issues, in the different  geographies. The Company also regularly devotes an agenda item at Board of  Directors’ Meetings to the detailed presentation of one of its  businesses and its environmental and social (CSR) challenges. Also  interrupted during the health crisis, these presentations restarted in  2021, with in particular presentations on building energy efficiency,  waste recycling and recovery and the climate through the work of the  Research, Innovation and Sustainable Development Committee.  Finally, in June 2023, the Company created a media for a three-year  sustainable development training program for directors, entitled ''The  sustainable company''.  Comprising a 6 to 8-page document, the first  edition of the Sustainable company focused on non-financial  reporting, while the second edition, issued in October 2023,  covered  carbon neutrality.

The internal regulations adopt the Independent Director criteria set-out in the AFEP-MEDEF Code: Criterion 1 Employee or Executive Officer during the course of the previous five years Not to be and not to have been during the course of the previous five years: • an employee or executive corporate officer of the Company; • an employee, executive corporate officer or director of a company consolidated by the Company; • an employee, executive corporate officer or director of the Company’s parent company or a company consolidated by this parent  company. Criterion 2 Cross directorships Not to be an executive corporate officer of any company in which the Company directly or indirectly holds a directorship, or in which  an employee appointed as such or an executive corporate officer of the Company (current or within the past five years) is a director. Criterion  3 Significant business relationships Not to be a customer, supplier, investment banker, commercial banker or consultant: • that is significant to the Company or its Group; • or for which the Company or its Group represents a significant portion of its business. The evaluation of the significance or otherwise of the relationship with the Company or its Group is debated by the Board, and the  quantitative and qualitative criteria that led to this evaluation (continuity, economic dependence, exclusivity, etc.) explicitly stated in  the annual report. Criterion  4 Family ties Not have any close family ties with a director or corporate officer. Criterion  5 Statutory Auditor Not have been a Statutory Auditor of the Company within the past five years. Criterion  6 Directorship of more than 12 years Not have been a director of the Company for more than twelve years. Loss of the status of Independent Director occurs on the date  when this period of twelve years is reached. Criterion  7 Status of non-executive corporate officer A non-executive officer cannot be considered independent if he or she receives variable compensation in cash or in the form of shares  or any compensation linked to the performance of the Company or the Group. Criterion  8 Status of major shareholder Directors representing major shareholders of the Company or its parent company may be considered independent, provided these  shareholders do not take part in the control of the Company. In the case of directors holding 10% or more of the Company’s share  capital or voting rights, the Board, based on a report from the Nominations Committee, shall systematically consider whether or not  they are independent, taking into account the composition of the Company’s share capital and the existence of any potential  conflicts of interest. The criteria are assessed and weighted by the Board of Directors,  which may decide that a director who does not meet the criteria  defined in the internal regulations may nevertheless be described as  independent in light of his/her particular situation or that of the  Company, given its shareholding structure or any other reason, or vice  versa. The internal regulations also stipulate that each year, before  publishing the Universal Registration Document, the Board of  Directors must assess the independence of each of its members based  on the criteria set out in the aforementioned regulations, any special  circumstances, the situation of the person in question, of the  Company and of the Group and the opinion of the Nominations  Committee. Assessment of the independence of directors The Board of Directors’ Meeting of March 12, 2024 carried out its  annual review of the independence of directors after hearing the  opinion of the Nominations Committee. The Board strictly applies the  independence criteria set out in the AFEP-MEDEF Code and particularly  the criterion concerning the length of time a director has been on the  Board. After conducting a quantitative and qualitative analysis of criterion  3  relating to significant business relationships, the Board concluded  that there were no significant business relationships and classified the  following 9  directors as independent (out of a total of 11  directors  excluding the 2  Directors representing employees and the Director  representing employee shareholders): Maryse Aulagnon, Olivier  Andriès, Véronique Bédague, Pierre-André de Chalendar, Isabelle  Courville, Marion Guillou, Nathalie Rachou, Francisco Reynés and  Guillaume Texier. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Activities of the Board of Directors and its Committees VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 129  ===== PAGE 132 ===== Accordingly, as of the date of filing of this Universal Registration  Document, the Company’s Board of Directors therefore has  9  independent members out of a total of 11  Directors (the Directors  representing employees and the Director representing employee  shareholders are not taken into account when determining these  percentages), representing a rate of 82%, above the AFEP-MEDEF Code  recommendation (4).

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Activities of the Board of Directors and its Committees 132 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 135 ===== In 2023, the Board of Directors was regularly informed of key  commercial developments and the initiatives planned by Executive  Management. The Board of Directors, mainly through the reports of  the Accounts and Audit Committee, was periodically informed of  changes in the Group’s financial and cash position and off-balance  sheet commitments, as well as changes in significant litigation. The  Deputy Chief Executive Officer Finance, Digital and Purchasing, the  Deputy Chief Executive Officer in charge of Stakeholders and  Communication and Advisor to the Chairman and the General Counsel  regularly attended Board meetings in 2023. The directors receive a  monthly report on the Company’s share price and a review of analysts’  recommendations. Every six months, Executive Management provides  the directors with detailed documentation regarding the Group’s  business activities, research and innovation initiatives, internal  matters (appointments and social policy), corporate activities  (initiatives with various institutions in France, Europe and abroad, and  updates on regulatory changes) and CSR and sustainable development  actions. In line with the expectations expressed during the 2017 annual  assessment of the Board’s activities, the directors have met, since their  May 3, 2017 meeting, in an executive session without the attendance  of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer up to June 30, 2022  inclusive and without the attendance of the Chief Executive Officer  since July 1, 2022. During these sessions, the directors hold informal  discussions on specific topics and current affairs. A digital platform is available to directors for the performance of their  duties since 2014. This “BoardVantage” platform can be accessed via  an application on tablets provided by the Company to all Board  members. The platform provides secure access to documents for Board  of Directors’ and Committee meetings. Assessment of the Board of Directors and  Executive Management actions Once a year, the Board devotes one point on its agenda to an  assessment of how it operates, to be prepared by the Nominations  Committee, and arranges a discussion about the way in which it  operates in order to: ■improve its effectiveness; ■check that major issues are suitably prepared and discussed by the  Board; and ■measure the effective contribution of each member to the Board’s  work. Furthermore, the Board’s internal regulations provide that a formal  assessment be performed every three years by an external  organization under the supervision of the Nominations Committee,  with the aim of checking that the operating principles of the Board  have been complied with and identifying possible improvements in its  operation and effectiveness. Each year, the Nominations Committee  produces an annual report for the Board of Directors, which the  directors discuss, assessing how the Chairman and directors have  performed, as well as the actions taken by Executive Management  (6). Each year, the Chairman of the Nominations Committee reports to the  Board of Directors’ Meeting on the results of the assessment of the  Board's activities, its Committees and Executive Management action,  conducted, every three years, with the assistance of an independent  external firm and using a questionnaire sent to each director,  completed by individual interviews. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Activities of the Board of Directors and its Committees VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 133 (6) In accordance with Article 10.3 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, “a formal assessment must be performed at least every three years. It may be conducted under the leadership of the  appointments or nominations committee or an independent director, with the assistance of an external consultant.”  ===== PAGE 136 ===== Main conclusions of the assessments presented during Board Meetings between 2022 and 2024 It was generally considered each year that the conditions surrounding the Board’s work clearly support the finalization of its operating conclusions.

Role of the non-voting member (censeur) The duties of non-voting members (censeurs) in public limited  companies are not recognized by law. Within Veolia Environnement,  the Board of Directors may appoint one or more non-voting members  (censeurs) pursuant to Article 18 of the Articles of Association.  Pursuant to the Articles of Association, the Board of Directors sets the  duration of their term of office, which they may terminate at any time. The role of a non-voting member (censeur) is to attend the Board of  Directors’ Meetings in an advisory capacity, and the Board may freely  ask their opinion. In addition, this position also offers a way to  integrate one or more director candidates before proposing their  appointment to a General Shareholders’ Meeting. This technique was  adopted with Mrs. Isabelle Courville, who performed these duties prior  to her appointment as a director by the General Shareholders’ Meeting  of April 21, 2016. At the recommendation of the Nominations Committee, the Board of  Directors’ Meeting of April 5, 2022 decided to appoint Mr. Enric  Amiguet i Rovira, a former director representing employees on the  Suez Board of Directors, as a non-voting member (censeur). This  appointment is for a period of three and a half years.

More generally, the Chairman of the Board of Directors ensures the  proper operation of the Company’s corporate bodies and compliance  with good governance principles and practices, in particular regarding  the Board Committees. He ensures that the directors are capable of  performing their duties and that they are adequately informed. He  devotes the time necessary to questions concerning the Group’s  future and, in particular, those relating to the Group’s strategy. The Chairman of the Board chairs Board meetings and prepares and  coordinates the Board’s work. In this regard, in particular, he: ■convenes Board meetings in accordance with the timetable of  meetings agreed upon with the directors and decides if it is  necessary to convene Board meetings at any other time; ■prepares the agenda for meetings, supervises the preparation of  documentation to be provided to the directors and ensures that  the information contained in them is complete; ■ensures that certain subjects are discussed by the Committees in  preparation for Board meetings and ensures that the Committees  perform their duty of making recommendations to the Board; ■leads and directs the Board’s discussions; ■ensures that directors comply with the provisions of the internal  regulations of the Board and of the Committees; ■monitors the implementation of the Board’s decisions; ■prepares and organizes the periodic assessment of the Board’s  activities in conjunction with the Nominations and Compensation  Committees; ■chairs, since July 1, 2022, the sessions bringing together members  of the Board without the attendance of the Chief Executive Officer  (executive sessions), as well as discussions assessing the  performance and setting the objectives and compensation of the  Chief Executive Officer and potentially renewing her appointment;  In 2023, the Chairman chaired, at the end of most Board meetings,  six executive sessions attended by the Chief Executive Officer and  six executive sessions not attended by the Chief Executive Officer  (out of a total of nine Board meetings); ■may attend or be a member of any Board Committee.

The Vice-Chairman of the Board or the Senior Independent Director  chairs all executive sessions, including the annual executive session,  bringing together members of the Board without the attendance of  the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer to assess the operation  of the governance method segregating these duties.  In addition to one executive session mainly focusing on the  Company’s governance and potential changes in the Board’s  composition, these executive sessions notably allow the directors to  express their comments and wishes and discuss improvements to the  Board’s activities. During the annual assessment of the activities of  the Board and its Committees, directors considered these executive  sessions to be essential to the proper functioning of the Board. As Mr. Louis Schweitzer did not request the renewal of his term of  office as director, his duties as Vice-Chairman, consisting in particular  of chairing the Board if the Chairman in unable to do so, ended as of  the General Shareholders’ Meeting of April 27, 2023, and were  assumed by the Senior Independent Director, Mrs. Maryse Aulagnon,  until the General Shareholders’ Meeting of April 24, 2024, when her  status as an independent director will end.

These meetings  enabled the Senior Independent Director to identify the expectations  of these advisors and investors, to discuss with them a range of issues  concerning governance and the compensation policy and report back  to the Board of Directors’ Meeting of March 12, 2024. At the recommendation of the Nominations Committee, the Board of  Directors’ meeting of March 12, 2024 decided to appoint, at the end of  the General Shareholders’ Meeting of April 25, 2024, Mr. Pierre-André  de Chalendar as the Senior Independent Director to replace Mrs.  Maryse Aulagnon, who, while remaining a director, will no longer be  considered independent.

This policy is constant and intended to be applied  unchanged to the proposed 2024 performance share plan (subject to  the approval of the 25 th resolution by the General Shareholders’  Meeting of April 25, 2024). It is recalled that the shareholding  obligations applicable to performance share plans are as follows: ■for the executive corporate officer, obligation to hold, until the end  of her duties, 40% of total performance shares granted under this  plan, net of applicable taxes and social security contributions, until  an overall shareholding corresponding to 200% of her gross fixed  compensation is ultimately reached, ■for members of the Company’s Executive Committee, obligation to  hold, until the end of their duties on the Executive Committee, 25%  of total performance shares granted under this plan, net of  applicable taxes and social security contributions, until an overall  shareholding corresponding to 100% of their gross fixed annual  compensation is ultimately reached.  In accordance notably with the AFEP-MEDEF Code to which the  Company refers, the executive corporate officer and Executive  Committee members receiving shares may not enter into risk hedging  transactions until the end of the share retention period set by the  Board of Directors.

Accordingly, it decided to appoint Mr. Guillaume Texier to  replace Mrs. Nathalie Rachou, given his appointment as Chairman of  the Audit and Accounts Committee, subject to the renewal of his term  of office as director by the General Shareholders’ Meeting of April 25,  2024. No other changes are currently envisaged, subject to the renewal of  the term of office as director of Mrs. Isabelle Courville by the General  Shareholders’ Meeting of April 25, 2024. Duties of the Committee The role of this Committee is to place the Board in the best possible  conditions to assess the dissemination of Veolia’s Purpose to all its  stakeholders – employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders,  partners and regions where the Group operates – so that they know  what it means and can contribute to its practical application. In this context, the Committee: ■reviews the dissemination of Veolia’s Purpose to stakeholders and,  more broadly, studies the measures for appropriating the  multifaceted performance approach implemented to enable its  roll-out; ■studies progress monitoring by the Group and advises the Board of  its opinion on measures taken with regard to the Purpose and  multifaceted performance; ■conducts an annual assessment of financial and non-financial  indicators monitoring the implementation of Veolia’s purpose  (indicators of the multifaceted performance); ■gives its opinion and issues proposals to the Board regarding,  where applicable, any adjustments to the Group’s Purpose; ■examines any questions submitted by the Chairman regarding the  above points.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Activities of the Board of Directors and its Committees VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 145  ===== PAGE 148 ===== 3.3  Executive Management  and the Executive Committee 3.3.1  ORGANIZATION OF EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT’S POWERS:  SEPARATION OF THE FUNCTIONS The law provides that the Board of Directors elects a Chairman from  among its members, who must be a natural person. The duties of the  Chairman are presented in Section 3.2.1.5 above. The Board of Directors  entrusts the Executive Management of the Company to either the  Chairman of the Board of Directors (referred to as the Chairman and  Chief Executive Officer), or to another natural person, who may or may  not be a director, referred to as the Chief Executive Officer. As mentioned in the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the law states no preference  between those two options. Accordingly, the Board of Directors may  choose between these combined or separate forms of Executive  Management in accordance with its specific requirements. In December 2010, following the departure of Henri Proglio, Chairman  of the Board of Directors and at the recommendation of the  Nominations and Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors  decided to combine the duties of Chairman of the Board with those of  Chief Executive Officer, by appointing Antoine Frérot, Chief Executive  Officer since November 27, 2009, Chairman of the Board. At the  recommendation of the Nominations Committee, this choice was  reasserted twice by the Board of Directors, at the time of the proposed  renewal of Mr. Antoine Frérot’s term of office at the General  Shareholders’ Meetings of April 24, 2014 and April 19, 2018. At the recommendation of the Nominations Committee, the Board of  Directors’ Meeting of January 10, 2022 decided to separate the duties  of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer from  July 1, 2022. Mr. Antoine Frérot had expressed the wish to cease his duties as Chief  Executive Officer, which he had exercised since 2009, on the expiry of  his term of office. He therefore asked the Board of Directors to task the  Nominations Committee with conducting, with the assistance of a  recruitment firm, an in-depth review of the most appropriate  governance structure to lead the company, which has changed scale  and is continuing to expand internationally. For Executive Management positions, the Nominations Committee  collected internal applications and had them assessed by the  recruitment firm. It then assessed them against a list of potential  external candidates pinpointed by the specialist recruitment firm. The Directors informed Mr. Antoine Frérot of their unanimous wish  that he remain Chairman of the Veolia Environnement Board of  Directors, to continue benefiting from his successful experience at the  head of the Group and his commitment to Veolia’s values. To this end,  shareholders were asked to renew his term of office as a Director at  the General Shareholders Meeting of June 15, 2022. At the recommendation of the Nominations Committee, the Board of  Directors also decided that Mrs. Estelle Brachlianoff, Chief Operating  Officer up to June 30, 2022 inclusive, would succeed Mr. Antoine Frérot  as the Chief Executive Officer of Veolia from July  1, 2022. As Chief  Executive Officer, Mrs. Estelle Brachlianoff has the widest powers to  act in all circumstances in the Company’s name, under the conditions  described in Section 3.3.2 below. In addition, shareholders were asked  to appoint her to the Board of Directors as it is essential that the Chief  Executive Officer takes part in the discussions and deliberations of the  Board of Directors, which is responsible for defining the Company’s  strategic direction. Mrs. Estelle Brachlianoff joined the Executive Committee of the Group  in 2013 and was appointed Chief Operating Officer by Mr. Antoine  Frérot in 2018. Since July 1, 2022 she is responsible for managing and  leading Veolia which, in 10 years, has become the world champion of  ecological transformation. In the conduct of her duties, she can count  on the support of an Executive Committee and a renewed  Management Committee, comprising some of the world’s top experts  in the water, waste and energy businesses. The substantial counter-balances within the Board of Directors that  existed prior to the change in the governance method remain  unchanged: ■the existence of a Vice-Chairwoman and a Senior Independent  Director, whose duties, means and prerogatives are presented in  Section 3.2.1.7 above; ■the presence of a significant majority of Independent Directors,  two  Directors  representing  employees  and  one  Director  representing employee shareholders  on the Board of Directors; ■the appointment of Independent Directors to chair the majority of  Board Committees; ■the organization of an executive session at the end of each Board  meeting, without the attendance of the Chief Executive Officer, led  by the Chairman; ■the organization of governance roadshows by the Vice- Chairwoman and Senior Independent Director; ■in-depth assessments of the activities of the Board; ■limits on powers set-out in the internal regulations of the Board of  Directors providing for approval by the Board of Directors of major  decisions of a strategic nature or likely to have a material impact  on the Company (see Section 3.3.2 below). In addition, given this separation of duties, the Board of Directors’  Meeting of April 5, 2022 decided to adjust its internal regulations with  regards to the duties of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and  the Vice-Chairman, which came into effect from July 1, 2022 (see  Sections  3.2.1.5 and 3.2.1.6 above). No substantial changes in  governance are planned in the short-term, other than the transfer to  the Chairman of the Board of Directors of some of the duties of the  Vice-Chairman. The separation of the duties of the Chairman and the Chief Executive  Officer was largely motivated by the desire to retain the expertise and  experience of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at a decisive  moment in the Company’s history. Notwithstanding the fact that this  corporate governance approach is recognized by investors and proxy  advisors as the best governance approach for listed companies to  ensure transition during the necessary period in the context of the  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer’s succession, the Board of  Directors will examine the operation of this separated governance  method each year and propose, where appropriate, any useful  changes to shareholders. During an executive session on March 12,  2024 focused on reviewing the operation of the separated governance  structuring, the Board of Directors once again unanimously  congratulated the excellent working of the non-executive Chairman -  Chief Executive Officer duo.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Executive Management and the Executive Committee 146 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 149 ===== 3.3.2  LIMITS ON THE POWERS OF THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE  OFFICER In accordance with the law, the Chief Executive Officer has the widest  powers to act in the name of the Company in all circumstances. She  acts within the limits of the corporate purpose. However, the powers exercised by the Chief Executive Officer are  limited by the internal regulations of the Board of Directors. The  following decisions of the Chief Executive Officer are therefore subject  to the prior authorization of the Board of Directors: ■determining the Group’s strategic direction; ■Group transactions of an individual amount in excess of €300  million, with the exception of financing transactions; ■Group investment or divestment transactions including a  commitment of between €150 million and €300 million per  transaction, with the exception of financing transactions, after  consultation with and the recommendation of the Accounts and  Audit Committee; ■financing transactions, whatever their terms, (including the early  redemption or repurchase of debt) amounting to more than €1.5  billion per transaction if carried out in a single tranche and €2.5  billion if the transaction is carried out in several tranches; ■transactions in the Company’s shares involving an overall amount  in excess of 1% of the Company’s total shares. 3.3.3  EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE The Chief Executive Officer is assisted in the performance of her duties  by an Executive Committee, a discussion, consultation and general  policy decision-making body which seeks to implement the Group’s  strategic direction. The Committee is also consulted on major issues  concerning the Group’s corporate life. The Executive Committee meets monthly.

This Universal Registration Document and, in particular, the tables in  Sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.3 below (share subscription and/or purchase  options, free shares, performance shares) have been prepared in  accordance with the format recommended by the AFEP-MEDEF Code  and the AMF recommendation no. 2012-02. 3.4.1.1  Executive corporate officer  compensation 3.4.1.1.1  Recap of 2023 executive corporate  officer compensation policy The principles and criteria for determining, allocating and awarding  the fixed, variable and exceptional components of total compensation  and benefits of all kinds that may be awarded to executive corporate  officers in respect of their duties, representing the compensation  policy for these individuals, are decided by the Board of Directors at  the recommendation of the Compensation Committee and presented  for shareholder approval at General Shareholders’ Meetings (“ex ante  vote on the compensation policy”) in accordance with Article L. 22-10-8  of the French Commercial Code. In addition, pursuant to Article L. 22-10-34 of the French Commercial  Code, the General Shareholders’ Meeting votes on: (i) the fixed,  variable and exceptional components of total compensation and (ii)  benefits of all kinds paid during the fiscal year or awarded in respect of  the same fiscal year to executive corporate officers (“ex post vote on  compensation of the prior fiscal year”). Accordingly, the payment of  variable or exceptional compensation components in respect of a  period is contingent on their approval by the General Shareholders’  Meeting called to approve the financial statements for this period. The  resolutions on executive corporate officers compensation components  for fiscal year 2023 submitted to shareholders’ vote at the General  Shareholders’ Meeting of April 25, 2024 are presented in Section 3.4.4  below. In 2023, Veolia Environnement executive corporate officers were: Mr.  Antoine Frérot, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Mrs. Estelle  Brachlianoff, Chief Executive Officer. General principles applicable to executive corporate  officer compensation In accordance with the provisions of the AFEP-MEDEF Code and at the  recommendation of its Compensation Committee, the Board of  Directors conducts an annual review of all the compensation  components of the executive corporate officers.  It ensures in particular that the compensation policy is aligned with  the Group’s strategy and considers the appropriate balance between  the different compensation components (fixed and variable annual  compensation, long-term compensation plan and other benefits and  additional compensation components). Furthermore, the review of the  compensation components of the Chairman and Chief Executive  Officer, the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive  Officer also takes account of compensation studies and benchmarks  covering companies comparable to Veolia Environnement and CAC 40  companies. Shareholder dialogue For a number of years, Veolia Environnement has organized annual  discussion sessions between the Senior Independent Director and the  main investors in its share capital as well as proxy advisors. The main  questions and comments raised during these meetings are  communicated to the relevant Board Committees, which analyze  them with regard to market practice and taking account of the  Group’s governance principles. The committees then report to the  Board of Directors. In 2023, the proposed compensation policies were finalized and  approved after a process taking into consideration the opinion of  shareholders and proxy agencies. In this respect, the Board of Directors  wished to modify the compensation structure of the Chief Executive  Officer, to strengthen the long-term compensation component in  response to the expectations expressed by many investors. The Chief  Executive Officer’s compensation was approximately 90% approved  by the General Shareholders’ Meeting of April 27, 2023. Similarly, at the recommendation of the Compensation Committee,  the Board of Directors decided to reduce the number of quantitative  variable compensation criteria from 10 to 9 for 2024. Chairman of the Board of Directors’ compensation policy  for 2023 The Chairman of the Board of Directors’ compensation policy was  adopted by the Board of Directors’ Meeting of March 14, 2023 at the  recommendation of the Compensation Committee and approved by  the Shareholders’ Meeting of April 27, 2023. It consists solely of fixed  compensation and benefits in kind, excluding all variable or  exceptional compensation, grants of share subscription options or  performance shares and compensation for his duties as a director.

As a reminder, this compensation was set following the Board of  Directors’ decision of April 5, 2022 based on a study conducted by the  firm Boracay and including (i) five comparable companies (ABB,  Centrica, EDP, Enel, ENI) and (ii) CAC 40 companies that have  separated the duties of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief  Executive Officer, details of which are presented in Section 3.4 of the  2021 Universal Registration Document.  Annual variable compensation None. 2023 long-term compensation None. Severance payments None. Compensation awarded as a director Since 2012, Mr. Antoine Frérot has decided to waive the compensation  awarded for his duties as a director paid by the Company and Group- controlled companies. This waiver remains applicable to his duties as  Chairman of the Board of Directors. Pension plan Mr.  Antoine Frérot benefits from a supplementary defined  contribution group pension plan applicable since July  1, 2014 and  presented in Section 3.4.2 below. He is eligible for the defined benefit pension plan presented in  Section 3.4.2 below, with a theoretical annuity of nil. Other benefits Mr.  Antoine Frérot benefits from the collective healthcare and  insurance plan in force within the Company under the same  conditions as those applicable for the category of employees with  which he is assimilated for the setting of social benefits and other  ancillary components of his compensation. Mr. Antoine Frérot enjoys the use of a company car. Chief Executive Officer compensation policy for 2023 As a reminder, this compensation policy, approved by the  Shareholders’ Meeting was set taking account of (i) Mrs.  Estelle  Brachlianoff’s experience and expertise, (ii) the change in the Group’s  size and the extension of its activities following the acquisition of  Suez, and (iii) the compensation amount but also the positioning of  these components compared with executive corporate officers with a  comparable profile and in CAC  40 companies, while ensuring the  consistency of the Chief Executive Officer’s compensation with that of  Executive Committee members and compensation practices within  the Company. Fixed compensation At the recommendation of the Compensation Committee and in  accordance with the compensation policy, the Board of Directors’  Meeting of March 14, 2023 decided to retain the gross annual fixed  compensation of the Chief Executive Officer unchanged at  €1,030,000. As a reminder, this compensation was set following the Board of  Directors’ decision of April 5, 2022 based on the results of a study  conducted by the firm Boracay on a group of comparable and rival  companies comprising 13 listed European companies such as Centrica,  EDP, Enel, Engie, ENI, EON, Iberdrola, Schneider Electric, Vinci, ABB,  ACS, Air Liquide and Bouygues. The companies in the peer group: ■share a common mission: employee and environmental quality  with local public authorities; ■conduct several businesses globally and are present on at least four  continents; ■report revenue equal to between 50% and 200% of Veolia’s  revenue. In addition to the peer group, the Compensation Committee also  assessed the executive corporate officer compensation in comparison  with CAC 40 companies. Details of this study are presented in Section 3.4 of the 2021 Universal  Registration Documentation. Annual variable compensation The quantitative objectives for 2023 were determined in the context of  the 2023 financial outlook announced to the market on March 2, 2023,  and the 2020-2023 strategic plan relative to the implementation of  the Company’s Purpose and all its performance indicators for  stakeholders. In order to integrate the multifaceted performance indicators relating  to the Company’s Purpose, the Board of Directors’ Meeting of March  14, 2023, at the recommendation of the Compensation Committee,  determined the calculation method for variable compensation as  follows: ■weight of the auditable quantitative portion (80%) and weight of  the qualitative portion (20%) unchanged; ■split of the weight of the auditable quantitative portion (80%)  between financial quantitative objectives (50%) and non-financial  quantitative objectives (30%) unchanged; ■2023 target variable compensation (in the event of attainment of  the objectives set by the Board of Directors) set at 100% of the  annual fixed compensation (“Target bonus base”); ■variable compensation capped (in the event objectives are  exceeded) at 160% of annual fixed compensation, or €1,648,000. In addition, the criteria for the 2023 variable compensation were set as  follows: ■with respect to the quantitative criteria: in line with the outlook  and objectives published on March 2, 2023, the criteria for the  quantitative portion of variable compensation break down as  follows. The quantitative portion is equal to the total of the  components resulting from application of each of these criteria  separately: • For the 50% financial quantitative portion: – 15% based on the Profitability indicator (CNIGS): Current Net  Income, Group Share, – 10% based on the Investment Capacity indicator (free cash  flow) (1)  : before financial acquisitions/divestments and  dividends but after financial expenses and taxes, – 15% based on the Group Growth indicator (revenue) (2):  organic Group revenue excluding acquisitions and divestitures  of more than €100 million but including acquisitions of  privatized public services, CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Compensation and benefits VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 149 (1) Target free cash-flow used to determine the bonus excludes discretionary investment. (2) Target revenue used to determine the bonus is calculated at constant exchange rates.  ===== PAGE 152 ===== – 10% based on the Capital Return indicator (ROCE): Group  ROCE after tax, including the return on capital employed of  joint ventures and companies, after IFRS 16 lease adjustments. The financial quantitative variable compensation portion will be  determined based on the attainment of the 2023 budget objectives,  which are consistent with the outlook announced to the market on  March 2, 2023; • for the 30% non-financial quantitative portion: – 5% based on the Health and Safety indicator: improvement  and reduction in the injury frequency rate, – 5% based on the Ethics and Compliance indicator: % of  positive answers to the engagement survey question “Are  Veolia’s values applied in my entity” across all respondents, – 5% based on the Climate indicator (invest in the transition to  carbon neutrality to achieve zero facilities powered by coal in  Europe by 2030, for facilities where the Group controls  investment): completion rate for scheduled investment to  reduce greenhouse gas emissions; – 5% based on the Hazardous waste treatment and recovery  indicator: consolidated revenue growth of the “Liquid and  hazardous waste treatment and recovery” segment, – 5% based on the Employee commitment indicator:  commitment  rate  of  employees  measured  by  an  engagement survey conducted by an external body (clear  objectives, meaning and usefulness, work atmosphere, pride  in the Group, willingness to recommend Veolia), – 5% based on the Training indicator: average number of  training hours per employee per year (upskilling training  actions). The non-financial quantitative variable compensation portion will be  determined based on the attainment of the 2023 objectives, that will  be audited by an independent third party; To take into account the  requests of certain investors and proxy agencies, at the governance  roadshow, the number of quantitative criteria will be reduced for  2024; ■with respect to the qualitative criteria: the qualitative portion (20%  of the target bonus) will be based on an overall assessment by the  Board of Directors, at the recommendation of the Compensation  Committee, based notably on the following individual objectives: • strategic aspects, • managerial performance. In addition, the Board of Directors reserves the right to exercise its  power of discretion regarding the determination of the Chief  Executive Officer’s compensation, in application of legal provisions  and in accordance with Articles L. 22-10-8 and L. 22-10-34 of the French  Commercial Code. It may do so in the event of special and  unforeseeable circumstances (such as the Covid-19 pandemic and its  uncertainties) that could justify an exceptional adjustment, upwards  or downwards, without exceeding the ceiling set in the compensation  policy (i.e. 160% of fixed annual compensation), to one or more criteria  comprising the Chief Executive Officer’s annual variable compensation  to ensure that application of the criteria described above produces  results reflecting the performance of both the Chief Executive Officer  and the Group, as well the alignment of the interests of the Company  and its shareholders with those of the Chief Executive Officer. This adjustment may be made to the Chief Executive Officer’s annual  variable  compensation  by  the  Board  of  Directors  at  the  recommendation of the Compensation Committee, after the Board of  Directors has provided adequate reasoning for its decision. Any  exercise of this discretion will be made public. Long-term compensation During discussions with investors and proxy advisors (governance  roadshow), there was an expectation for overweighting to be applied  to the Chief Executive Officer’s long-term compensation. The Board of  Directors was eager to achieve balance between the three  components (fixed, variable and long-term) of this Chief Executive  Officer’s compensation.  At the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board  of Directors decided that the Chief Executive Officer would receive a  performance share grant equal to and capped at 133% of her fixed  compensation. Before this change, the Chief Executive Officer’s composition  comprised the following components: ■annual fixed compensation (€1,030,000) for 33.3%; ■annual variable compensation (€1,030,000 if objectives are  attained) for 33.3%; ■long-term compensation (€1,030,000 if objectives are attained) for  33.3%. After this change, her compensation breaks down as follows: ■annual fixed compensation (€1,030,000) for 30%; ■annual variable compensation (€1,030,000 if objectives are  attained) for 30%; ■long-term variable compensation (€1,373,000, or 133% of fixed  compensation if objectives are attained) for 40%. In the event of outperformance leading to payment of the maximum  amount of variable compensation (equal to the cap of 160% of annual  fixed compensation), the breakdown is as follows: Before this change: ■annual fixed compensation (€1,030,000) for 28%; ■annual variable compensation (€1,648,000 if objectives are  exceeded) for 44%; ■long-term variable compensation (€1,030,000 if objectives are  attained) for 28%. After this change: ■annual fixed compensation (€1,030,000) for 25%; ■annual variable compensation (€1,648,000 if objectives are  exceeded) for 41%; ■long-term variable compensation (€1,373,000 if objectives are  exceeded) for 34%. This adjustment also enables a better alignment with market practices  (see the results of the study conducted by Boracay set out in Section  3.4.1.1.4  of  the  2021  Universal  Registration  Documentation,  highlighting  long-term  benefits  representing  130%  of  fixed  compensation as the median for the peer group). Compensation awarded as a director Mrs. Estelle Brachlianoff waived the compensation awarded for her  duties as a director by the Company and Group-controlled companies.

A breakdown of the attainment and payment rates for each  of the indicators is presented in the summary table below. These  financial indicators are defined in Chapter 5, Section 5.6 of the  Universal Registration Document; ■the non-financial quantitative variable portion (30% of the target  bonus) equals €421,013 representing an overall payment rate of  136.3%. A breakdown of the attainment and payment rates for each  of the indicators is presented in the summary table below. The  non-financial quantitative variable compensation portion was  determined based on the attainment of the 2023 objectives for the  indicators concerned as detailed below: ii) with respect to the qualitative criteria: the Board of Directors’  Meeting of March 12, 2024 decided to allocate €329,600 to  Mrs.  Estelle Brachlianoff in respect of the qualitative variable  portion (20% of the target bonus) of her 2023 compensation,  representing a payment rate of 160% of the qualitative portion  based on an overall assessment founded on the attainment of the  following criteria: ■strategic aspects, with a payment rate of 160%; ■managerial performance, with a payment rate of 160%. The qualitative portion takes account of the following items: ■numerous business wins and in particular: • Veolia won a contract for integrated waste management in  Gold Coast, the second largest regional public authority and  sixth largest city in Australia. With an initial term of 7 years, the  contract contains options for an extension to 18 years, which  would represent around €500 million over the entire contract  term. A first for the country, this new contract combines the  management of recovery and collection facilities and will  optimize design and implementation of existing infrastructures  across the entire waste treatment value chain. • Veolia will lead a consortium through its subsidiary SIDEM  responsible for the engineering, supply and construction of the  Mirfa 2 desalination project entrusted to it by Abu Dhabi  National Energy Company PJSC (TAQA) and Engie. Located in  Abu Dhabi, this reverse osmosis seawater desalination plant  will be the third largest in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). With  a daily capacity of around 550,000 cubic meters of drinking  water, it will provide around 210,000 households with drinking  water  while  improving  efficiency  and  reducing  the  environmental  footprint  thanks  to  state-of-the-art  technologies. The contract represents revenue of around €300  million for Veolia. The project’s construction began in 2023 with  commissioning scheduled for 2025, • Veolia signed two major energy efficiency contracts in Italy: a  twelve-year contract covering health care buildings in Cosenza  worth €153 million, and a fifteen-year contract with the  Municipality of Trieste worth €130 million. Through these  contracts, Veolia will help its customers reduce their carbon  footprint by implementing alternative energy sources. • In Perpignan, Veolia was awarded the public service delegation  contract  for  water  services  by  Perpignan  Métropole  Méditerranée, representing revenue of €650 million over  twelve years. This contract provides for investment to preserve  water resources with a target reduction in leaks from 20% to  12%. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Compensation and benefits 152 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 155 ===== • Veolia signed a €2 billion waste management contract to  support decarbonization and resource regeneration in Hong  Kong. The Group will build a state-of-the-art storage site of  non-recyclable waste to optimize methane capture and thus  avoid the emission of 10 million metric tons of CO2 emissions  over twenty years. It is a virtuous circular economy project with  the green electricity produced from the captured methane  covering 100% of the plant's energy needs. It is also a project  that will generate local resources: the stone from the site will  be used by the Hong Kong construction industry, avoiding  imports; ■Major commissionings and deployments: • Veolia inaugurated the largest solar power plant on a  desalination plant in the Middle East. Veolia is working  alongside the Sultanate of Oman and its partner TotalEnergies  to promote the transition to clean and renewable energy. This  initiative is part of the Group's ongoing drive to decarbonize its  activities and support its customers in their carbon neutrality  objectives. • Veolia completed the conversion of a former landfill into the  third largest solar park in the United Kingdom. The Essex site  will provide renewable electricity to more than 15,000  households and represents the largest solar farm in the United  Kingdom installed on a restored landfill. The site uses 107,000  bifacial solar modules that can absorb light on both sides,  maximizing the power density while converting direct current  into alternative current that is better suited to domestic usage.  Its output is fed to the grid via an on-site 132,000-V transformer  that is connected to the nearby Warley substation. This new  solar farm will provide an additional 59 MW of renewable  energy to the national grid, thereby supporting the UK  government’s net zero emissions targets, • In France, one year after the launch of its program to deploy  reused wastewater at wastewater treatment plants, Veolia  deployed over 50 water recycling systems designed to save  around 1,250,000 m 3 of water per year. The recycled water  therefore replaces the drinking water required to operate and  maintain the treatment plants, • As part of its plan to phase out the use of coal in Europe, the  Group commissioned a cogeneration plant in Prerov, Czech  Republic, representing an investment of €65 million. This plant  replaces coal with biomass and RDF (Refuse Derived Fuel) to  produce heat for the city of Prerov's district heating distribution  network, as well as cogeneration electricity. It will also reduce  CO2 emissions by around 111,000 metric tons per year; ■a certain number of initiatives, projects and results: • Veolia launched “GreenPath Zero Carbon” offer to help its  clients accelerate their decarbonization. This unique global offer  is deployed to help municipal, service sector and industrial  customers to build and implement their decarbonization  roadmaps and adapt their models to current and future climate  challenges. The offer also provides solutions to directly  contribute to the achievement of the European Union’s climate  targets of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030  and becoming carbon neutral by 2050. • Driven by Estelle Brachlianoff, the deployment of the Veolia  Cares program guarantees a common core of employee benefits  for the Group’s 213,000 employees regardless of geographies  where nothing is required by law. Unprecedented in its scope,  the program offers every employee parental leave, health and  death cover, support for caregivers and a paid day off every year  to volunteer with a charity or with an environmental protection  organization. • On March 2, 2023, the Veolia Capital Market Day brought  together financiers, analysts and journalists. On the agenda: the  presentation of financial results and the Group’s specific  position on ESG and the positive impact of its activities on all  stakeholders regarding environmental, social and governance  criteria, • At the COP 28 organized in Dubai (UAE), Estelle Brachlianoff  reaffirmed its commitment to invest €1.6 billion by 2030 to  phase out coal in Europe. At the opening of the COP28, Estelle  Brachlianoff also called for a common “Net Zero Water”  objective to accelerate the roll-out of existing solutions for  ecological transformation, • Veolia launched Verso, the first ever popular science YouTube  channel  on  the  environment  to  introduce  ecological  transformation solutions to as many people as possible. In a  fully electric truck, three influencers and experts in popular  science travel across France and Europe to meet Veolia experts,  clients and partners who work daily in the field to make  tomorrow’s world more sustainable and attractive, • The commitment of Veolia’s employees remained very high: the  Voice of Resourcers survey conducted at the end of 2023 among  160,000 Group employees in 55 countries again highlighted an  engagement rate of 89%, • At the 2023 United Nations Water Conference in New York City  (March 23, 2023), Veolia, the global leader in ecological  transformation, committed $1.5 billion yearly investment in  infrastructure, technologies and research &  innovation  initiatives for water and sanitation to advancing thirteen UN  Sustainable Development Goals related to water and sanitation  in 52 countries around the world. • Following the Sequoia 2023 employee share ownership plan,  the sixth annual consecutive plan, with a record-breaking  subscription rate (41.5%), employees strengthened their  position as leading shareholder of the Group and now hold 7.5%  of share capital at the end of 2023. The success of Sequoia 2023  confirms Veolia’s willingness to make employee shareholding  one of its primary social indicators; ■finally, regarding the contribution to Veolia’s exposure, Mrs. Estelle  Brachlianoff has fully embraced her position as Veolia Chief  Executive Officer since her appointment in July 2022, mainly by  promoting the Group’s businesses, know-how and exemplarity  among all stakeholders. After applying all these criteria, Mrs. Estelle Brachlianoff’s total  variable compensation (quantitative and qualitative) for fiscal year  2023 is therefore €1,462,343, or 142.0% of her Target bonus base.

As a reminder, this compensation was set following the Board of  Directors’ decision of April 5, 2022 based on the results of a study  conducted by the firm Boracay on a group of comparable and rival  companies comprising 13 listed European companies such as Centrica,  EDP, Enel, Engie, ENI, EON, Iberdrola, Schneider Electric, Vinci, ABB,  ACS, Air Liquide and Bouygues. The companies in the peer group: ■share a common mission: employee and environmental quality  with local public authorities; ■conduct several businesses globally and are present on at least four  continents; ■report revenue equal to between 50% and 200% of Veolia’s  revenue. In addition to the peer group, the Compensation Committee also  assessed the executive corporate officer compensation in comparison  with CAC 40 companies. Details of this study are presented in Section 3.4 of the 2021 Universal  Registration Documentation. Annual variable compensation The 2024 quantitative objectives are in keeping with the 2024  financial outlook announced to the market on February 29, 2024 and  the GreenUp 2024-2027 strategic program. In order to integrate the multifaceted performance indicators relating  to the Company’s Purpose, the Board of Directors’ Meeting of March  12, 2024, at the recommendation of the Compensation Committee,  determined the calculation method for variable compensation as  follows: ■weight of the auditable quantitative portion (80%) and weight of  the qualitative portion (20%) unchanged; ■split of the weight of the auditable quantitative portion (80%)  between financial quantitative objectives (50%) and non-financial  quantitative objectives (30%) unchanged; ■2024 target variable compensation (in the event of attainment of  the objectives set by the Board of Directors) set at 100% of the  annual fixed compensation (“Target bonus base”); ■variable compensation capped (in the event objectives are  exceeded) at 160% of annual fixed compensation, or €1,648,000. To take into account the requests of certain investors and proxy  agencies, at the governance roadshow, the Board of Directors, at the  recommendation of the Compensation Committee, decided to reduce  the number of quantitative criteria for 2024 by removing the criteria  relating to the increase in revenue. In addition, the criteria for the 2024 variable compensation were set as  follows: ■with respect to the quantitative criteria: in line with the outlook  and objectives published on February 29, 2024, the criteria for the  quantitative portion of variable compensation break down as  follows. The quantitative portion is equal to the total of the  components resulting from application of each of these criteria  separately: • For the 50% financial quantitative portion: – 20% based on the Profitability indicator (CNIGS): Current  Net Income, Group Share, – 15% based on the Investment Capacity indicator (free cash  flow) (3): before financial acquisitions/divestments and  dividends but after financial expenses and taxes, – 15% based on the Capital Return indicator (ROCE): Group  ROCE after tax, including the return on capital employed of  joint ventures and companies, after IFRS  16 lease  adjustments. The financial quantitative variable compensation portion will be  determined based on the attainment of the 2024 budget objectives  which are consistent with the outlook announced to the market on  February 29, 2024: • For the 30% non-financial quantitative portion: – 5% based on the Health and Safety and Well-Being indicator:  improvement and reduction in the injury frequency rate, – 5% based on the Ethics and Integrity indicator: % of positive  answers to the engagement survey question “Are Veolia’s  values applied in my entity” across all respondents, – 5% based on the Decarbonization of our assets indicator:  decarbonization investments, including the phase-out of  coal and methane capture, – 5% based on the Growth and innovation drivers indicator:  revenue growth in priority business segments (energy, water  technologies, hazardous waste), – 5% based on the Employee commitment indicator:  commitment  rate  of  employees  measured  by  an  engagement survey conducted by an external body (clear  objectives, meaning and usefulness, work atmosphere, pride  in the Group, willingness to recommend Veolia), CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Compensation and benefits VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 159 (3) Target free cash-flow used to determine the bonus excludes discretionary investment.  ===== PAGE 162 ===== – 5% based on the Depollution - biodiversity indicator:  progress rate of action plans improving the footprint of  environments and biodiversity at sensitive sites. The non-financial quantitative variable compensation portion will be  determined based on the attainment of the 2024 objectives, that will  be audited by an independent third party;  ■with respect to the qualitative criteria: the qualitative portion (20%  of the target bonus) will be based on an overall assessment by the  Board of Directors, at the recommendation of the Compensation  Committee, based notably on the following individual objectives: • strategic aspects, • managerial performance, • equity story. In addition, the Board of Directors reserves the right to exercise its  power of discretion regarding the determination of the Chief  Executive Officer’s compensation, in application of legal provisions  and in accordance with Articles L. 22-10-8 and L. 22-10-34 of the French  Commercial Code. It may do so in the event of special and  unforeseeable circumstances (such as the Covid-19 pandemic and its  uncertainties) that could justify an exceptional adjustment, upwards  or downwards, without exceeding the ceiling set in the compensation  policy (i.e. 160% of fixed annual compensation), to one or more criteria  comprising the Chief Executive Officer’s annual variable compensation  to ensure that application of the criteria described above produces  results reflecting the performance of both the Chief Executive Officer  and the Group, as well the alignment of the interests of the Company  and its shareholders with those of the Chief Executive Officer. This adjustment may be made to the Chief Executive Officer’s annual  variable  compensation  by  the  Board  of  Directors  at  the  recommendation of the Compensation Committee, after the Board of  Directors has provided adequate reasoning for its decision. Any  exercise of this discretion will be made public. 2024 Long-term compensation Based on the principles and recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF  Code and at the recommendation of the Compensation Committee,  the Board seeks to implement long-term compensation in addition to  annual variable compensation, proportionate to annual fixed and  variable components and subject to demanding performance  conditions to be satisfied over several consecutive years. When  drafting a new plan, the performance conditions reflect Veolia’s long- term strategic priorities and can include performance conditions that  are internal and/or external to the Group. This long-term  compensation is not intended to concern only the executive corporate  officer, but also senior executives and other employee categories of  the Group (e.g. high potential employees and key contributors). The  scope of beneficiaries is determined on the implementation of each  long-term compensation plan. Should the executive corporate officer  leave the Group before expiry of the performance criteria assessment  period, the multi-year compensation will not be paid, in the absence of  exceptional circumstances justified by the Board. In any case, the  performance  and acquisition conditions will remain unchanged. In 2023, during discussions with investors and proxy advisors  (governance roadshow), there was an expectation for overweighting  to be applied to the Chief Executive Officer’s long-term compensation.  The Board of Directors was eager to achieve a balance between the  three  components  (fixed,  variable  and  long-term)  of  this  compensation. At the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board  of Directors decided that the Chief Executive Officer would receive a  performance share grant equal to and capped at 133% of her fixed  compensation. The Chief Executive Officer’s compensation breaks down as follows: ■annual fixed compensation (€1,030,000) for 30%; ■annual variable compensation (€1,030,000 if objectives are  attained) for 30%; ■long-term variable compensation (€1,373,000 or 133% of fixed  compensation if objectives are attained) for 40%. In the event of outperformance leading to payment of the maximum  amount of variable compensation (equal to the cap of 160% of annual  fixed compensation), the breakdown is as follows: ■annual fixed compensation (€1,030,000) for 25%; ■annual variable compensation (€1,648,000 if objectives are  exceeded) for 41%; ■long-term variable compensation (€1,373,000 if objectives are  exceeded) for 34%. In this context, the last three long-term compensation plans and the  share holding obligations are presented in Section 3.4.3 below. Proposed Performance Share Grant At the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board  of Directors asks shareholders in the 25 th resolution presented to the  General Shareholders’ Meeting of April 25, 2024 to approve an  authorization, for a period of 26 months, to grant performance shares  to a group of around 550 beneficiaries and comprising top executives,  high potential employees and key contributors of the Group, including  the Chief Executive Officer. This plan, which is intended to be  launched in 2024 with an expiry date in 2027 following the publication  of the 2026 financial statements, would succeed the plan granted in  2023. The Board of Directors, when implementing this performance share  plan, will set the number of performance shares that would be  granted to the Chief Executive Officer.  The detailed features and performance conditions of this proposed  performance share plan are presented in Section 3.4.3 below. Obligation to hold the performance shares granted  and vested At the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board  of Directors decided, in the context of implementing this performance  share plan, to maintain as follows the holding obligations applicable  to performance share plans of the Chief Executive Officer: obligation  to hold until the end of her duties, 40% of total performance shares  granted under this plan, net of applicable social security contributions  and taxes, until she has ultimately reached a total shareholding equal  to 200% of her gross annual fixed compensation. Compensation awarded as a director Mrs. Estelle Brachlianoff waived the compensation awarded for her  duties as a director by the Company and Group-controlled companies.

Based on the estimated capital at the end of 2023, Mrs.  Estelle  Brachlianoff’s defined contribution annual annuity payable when she  reaches 64  years old and calculated without payment of survivor  benefits, is estimated at approximately €3,000 per year. 3.4.2.2  Other benefits Mr.  Antoine Frérot is also entitled to a company car and welfare  benefits equivalent to those of employees (healthcare and insurance). Mrs. Estelle Brachlianoff is entitled to  welfare benefits equivalent to  those of employees (healthcare and insurance). 3.4.2.3  Severance payments in the event  of termination of the office of  executive corporate officers Severance payments in the event of termination  of the office of the Chief Executive Officer  In accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code recommendation,  Mrs.  Estelle Brachlianoff resigned her employment contract on her  appointment as Chief Executive Officer on July 1, 2022. The Board of Directors’ Meeting of April  5, 2022, recording the  termination of Mrs.  Estelle Brachlianoff’s employment contract and,  accordingly, the loss of legal provisions and rights under the collective  bargaining agreement applicable in the event of dismissal and at the  recommendation of the Compensation Committee, decided to grant a  severance payment to Mrs. Estelle Brachlianoff in the event of forced  departure from the office of Chief Executive Officer (notably in the  event of resignation following a change in control or strategy of the  Company or a dismissal not resulting from serious or severe  misconduct). In accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the maximum amount of  this severance payment is capped at twice the total gross annual  compensation, including the sum of the fixed portion of her  compensation for the previous fiscal year (“Fixed Portion”) and the  average of the variable portions (“Variable Portion”) paid or payable in  respect of the last three fiscal years ending before the termination of  her duties as Chief Executive Officer (“Reference Compensation”). The amount of this severance payment is based on the attainment of  performance conditions, via the application of a performance rate  corresponding to the objective attainment rate for the last two  variable compensation portions paid (with a weighting of 60% for the  objective attainment rate for the last variable portion paid and 40%  for the objective attainment rate for the previous variable portion  paid), it being stipulated that no payment will be made if the  performance rate is below 75%. Non-compete compensation of the Chief Executive  Officer The Board of Directors’ Meeting of April 5, 2022, in consideration for  Mrs.  Estelle Brachlianoff undertaking, during a period of two years  from the end of her duties as Chief Executive Officer, not to exercise,  directly or indirectly, a competing activity to that of the Company and  Veolia group companies, decided to grant her compensation equal to  one year’s compensation (fixed and variable components, the variable  portion to be taken into account in calculating this compensation  being the average annual variable compensation paid for the last two  years), paid in 24 equal and successive monthly installments. In accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the total of severance  payments plus non-compete compensation cannot exceed two year’s  compensation (fixed and variable, with variable compensation for the  purpose of calculating these payments equal to the average annual  variable compensation paid for the last two years). Accordingly, in the  event the Board should decide to implement the non-compete clause,  severance payments would be capped at one year’s compensation. The Board of Directors may, on the departure of the Chief Executive  Officer, waive application of this clause, in which case no  compensation would be due.

The grant policy, including holding obligations,  the main features of current plans as of December 31, 2023 and  adjustments to these plans are presented below. When the plans concern performance shares, free shares or  subscription options, grants are decided by the Board of Directors  pursuant to resolutions voted by General Shareholders’ Meeting. Adjustment to the 2019, 2020 and 2021  performance share plans following the share  capital increase with preferential subsription  rights (PSR) of October 8, 2021 On October 8, 2021, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,  pursuant to the delegation of authority granted by the Board of  Directors on September  14, 2021 and after consulting the  Compensation Committee, adjusted the rights under the 2019, 2020  and 2021 performance share plans following the share capital increase  performed the same date, in order to preserve the rights of  beneficiaries. Accordingly, the number of share rights vesting under the 2019, 2020  and 2021 performance share plans was adjusted on the following  basis: ■share value before detachment of PSR: €29.25; ■share value after detachment of PSR: €28.23; ■adjustment ratio: 29.25/28.23 = 1,036. For example, 1,000 performance share rights are now, after  adjustment, 1,036 performance share rights, with the number of share  rights rounded down to the nearest whole number. Company policy with regard to holding obligations  applicable to performance shares granted and  vested From the implementation of the 2018 performance share plans, the  Board of Directors, at the recommendation of the Compensation  Committee, decided to apply a policy requiring executive corporate  officers and members of the Company’s Executive Committee to hold  performance shares granted and vested. This policy is constant and  intended to be applied unchanged to the proposed 2024 performance  share plan (subject to the approval by the General Shareholders’  Meeting of April 25, 2024 of the 25 th resolution). It is recalled that the  shareholding obligations applicable to the performance share plans  are as follows: ■for executive corporate officers, obligation to hold, until the end of  their duties, 40% of total performance shares granted under this  plan, net of applicable taxes and social security contributions, until  an overall shareholding corresponding to 200% of their gross fixed  compensation is ultimately reached; ■for members of the Company’s Executive Committee, obligation to  hold, until the end of their duties on the Executive Committee, 25%  of total performance shares granted under this plan, net of  applicable taxes and social security contributions, until an overall  shareholding corresponding to 100% of their gross fixed annual  compensation is ultimately reached.

To recap, at the recommendation of the Compensation Committee,  the Board of Directors’ Meeting of April 5, 2022 decided that share  rights under the 2020 and 2021 performance share plans that vested in  2023 for the 2020 plan and will vest in 2024 for the 2021 plan, subject  to performance conditions, will be retained in the context of the  change in the Company’s governance from July  1, 2022. These  provisions were approved by the General Shareholders’ Meeting. The Board of Directors made this choice in light of Mr. Antoine Frérot’s  essential contribution to Veolia’s transformation to a world champion  of ecological transformation. Mr. Antoine Frérot left his executive functions immediately following  the successful completion of the largest transformational acquisition  in Veolia’s history, which has already created significant value for its  shareholders and will continue to do so as the projected synergies are  realized. In accordance with AFEP-MEDEF recommendations, he will no longer  receive performance share grants (or annual variable compensation)  and will therefore no longer be associated with value creation despite  being its instigator. The Compensation Committee considered that it would be fair to  leave him the benefit of all performance shares granted in prior years  but not yet delivered. These shares remain subject to the planned performance conditions  and will only be paid after the attainment of the performance criteria.  The presence condition will be considered to be met by Mr. Antoine  Frérot’s continued membership of the Board of Directors.

The quantitative objectives for 2023 were  determined in the context of the 2020-2023 strategic plan and notably the implementation of the Company’s  Purpose and all its performance indicators for stakeholders (multifaceted performance). In order to integrate the multifaceted performance indicators relating to the Company’s Purpose, the Board  of Directors’ Meeting of March 14, 2023, at the recommendation of the Compensation Committee,  determined the calculation method for variable compensation as follows: • weight of the auditable quantitative portion (80%) and weight of the qualitative portion (20%)  unchanged; • split of the weight of the auditable quantitative portion (80%) between financial quantitative objectives  (50%) and non-financial quantitative objectives (30%) unchanged; • target variable compensation (in the event of attainment of the objectives set by the Board of Directors)  set at 100% of the annual fixed compensation (“Target bonus base”); • variable compensation is capped (in the event objectives are exceeded) at 160% of annual fixed  compensation for 2023, or €1,648,000. Using this method and based on the attainment of the criteria determining the calculation of the variable  portion, the amount of this variable portion for fiscal year 2023 was determined as follows: i) with respect to the quantitative criteria: in line with the outlook and objectives published on March 2,  2023, equal to the total of the components resulting from application of each of these criteria separately: For the 50% financial quantitative portion: • 15% based on the Profitability indicator (CNIGS): Current Net Income, Group Share; €1,335 million as of  December 31, 2023, representing an attainment rate of 104.4% (objective of €1,279 million) and a payment  rate of 126.3%; • 10% based on the Investment Capacity indicator (free cash flow): before financial acquisitions/ divestments and dividends but after financial expenses and taxes; €1,683 million as of December 31,  2023(1), representing an attainment rate of 136.5% (objective of €1,235  million) and a payment rate of  160%; • 15% based on the Group Growth indicator (revenue): Group organic revenue excluding acquisitions and  divestitures of more than €100  million but including acquisitions of privatized public services;  €46,149  million as of December 31, 2023(2), representing an attainment rate of 103.2% (objective of  €44,705 million) and a payment rate of 142.3%; • 10% based on the Capital Return indicator (ROCE): Group ROCE after tax and including the return on  capital employed of joint ventures and companies and after IFRS  16 lease adjustments; 8.3% as of  December 31, 2023, representing an attainment rate of 103.8% (objective of 8.0%) and a payment rate of  128.1%. These financial indicators are defined in Chapter 5, Section 5.5 of the Universal Registration Document. The attainment level for each indicator of the financial and non-financial quantitative variable compensation  portion was determined based on the attainment of the 2023 budget objectives which are consistent with  the outlook announced to the market on March 2, 2023. The payment rate follows the payout rule  established for each indicator based on the requirements defined in the 2020-2023 strategic plan.

In this context, 47,450 performance shares were granted to Mrs.  Estelle Brachlianoff as Chief Executive  Officer (i.e. approximately 0.007% of the share capital compared with 0.02% authorized by the General  Shareholders’ Meeting). This allocation was capped at 133% of her fixed compensation in accordance with  the compensation policy approved by the General Shareholders’ Meeting of April 27, 2023. These performance shares will vest subject to the following conditions: • beneficiaries must remain with the Group until the end of the three-year vesting period i.e. until expiry of  the plan scheduled for 2026; and • a performance condition tied to the attainment of the following internal and external criteria assessed  over fiscal years 2023, 2024 and 2025: • financial criteria in the amount of 50%, • non-financial quantitative criteria in the amount of 50% linked to the Company’s Purpose. The performance and presence conditions governing the vesting of the performance shares are presented in  Chapter 3, Section 3.4.3 of the 2023 Universal Registration Documentation. Obligation to  hold the  performance  shares granted  and vested At the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors’ Meeting of May 3, 2023  decided, in the context of the implementation of this performance share plan, to renew the following  holding obligations: • for the Chief Executive Officer, obligation to hold, until the end of her duties, 40% of total performance  shares granted under this plan, net of applicable taxes and social security contributions, until an overall  shareholding corresponding to 200% of her gross fixed compensation is ultimately reached; • for members of the Company’s Executive Committee, obligation to hold, until the end of their duties on  the Executive Committee, 25% of total performance shares granted under this plan, net of applicable  taxes and social security contributions, until an overall shareholding corresponding to 100% of their gross  fixed annual compensation is ultimately reached. Termination  benefits on forced  departure Mrs. Estelle Brachlianoff is entitled to a severance payment in the event of termination of her duties as Chief  Executive Officer, applicable solely in the event of “forced departure”. In accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF  Corporate Governance Code, the maximum amount of this severance payment is capped at twice the total  gross annual compensation (excluding compensation awarded as a director (it being stipulated that she has  waived all compensation of this nature) and benefits in kind), including the sum of the fixed portion of her  compensation for the previous fiscal year (“Fixed Portion”) and the average of the variable portions  (“Variable Portion”) paid or payable in respect of the last two fiscal years ending before the termination of  her duties as Chief Executive Officer (“Reference Compensation”). The amount of this severance payment  and its fixed and variable portions depends in both cases on the extent to which performance conditions  were attained. The reference compensation is equal to the fixed compensation paid in respect of the last  fiscal year plus the average of the variable compensation paid or payable in respect of the last two fiscal  years; no payment will be made if the performance rate is below 75%. The severance payment is equal to the  maximum amount multiplied by the performance rate, the performance rate being equal to 60% of the  objective attainment rate for the last variable portion, plus 40% of the objective attainment rate for the  previous variable portion. Mrs.  Estelle Brachlianoff resigned from her employment contract on her appointment as Chief Executive  Officer on July 1, 2022.

In accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the total of severance payments plus non-compete compensation  cannot exceed two year’s compensation (fixed and variable, with variable compensation for the purpose of  calculating these payments equal to the average annual variable compensation paid for the last two years).  Accordingly, in the event the Board should decide to implement the non-compete clause, severance  payments would be capped at one year’s compensation. The Board of Directors may, on the departure of the Chief Executive Officer, waive application of this clause,  in which case no compensation would be due.

Note that  all these components are presented in Chapter  3, Section  3.4 of the  Company’s 2023 Universal Registration Document and summarized in  the table below. In addition to fixed, variable and exceptional compensation  components, the Chief Executive Officer would be entitled to a  supplementary defined contribution pension plan, a supplementary  defined contribution pension plan governed by Article 82 of the French  General Tax Code and a collective healthcare and insurance plan. In  addition, she would be entitled to a severance payment and  compensation under a non-compete clause as approved by the Board  of Directors’ Meeting of April 5, 2022 and detailed in Chapter 3.4.2.3 of  the 2023 Universal Registration Document. Finally, she could receive  performance share grants. She waived the right to receive  compensation for her duties as a director, and does not benefit from  multi-year cash compensation or have an employment contract within  the Group. The payment of the her variable compensation for fiscal year 2024 is  subject to the approval of said compensation’s components by an  Ordinary General Meeting held after December 31, 2024, under the  terms of Article L. 22-10-34, II of the French Commercial Code (Ex post  vote). In addition, the Board of Directors reserves the right to exercise its  power of discretion regarding the determination of the Chief  Executive Officer’s compensation, in application of legal provisions  and in accordance with Articles L. 22-10-8 and L. 22-10-34 of the French  Commercial Code. It may do so in the event of special and  unforeseeable circumstances (such as the Covid-19 pandemic and its  uncertainties) that could justify an exceptional adjustment, upwards  or downwards, without exceeding the ceiling set in the compensation  policy (i.e. 160% of fixed annual compensation), to one or more criteria  comprising the Chief Executive Officer’s annual variable compensation  to ensure that application of the criteria described above produces  results reflecting the performance of both the Chief Executive Officer  and the Group, as well the alignment of the interests of the Company  and its shareholders with those of the Chief Executive Officer. This adjustment may be made to the Chief Executive Officer’s annual  variable  compensation  by  the  Board  of  Directors  at  the  recommendation of the Compensation Committee, after the Board of  Directors has provided adequate reasoning for its decision. Any  exercise of this discretion will be made public. For 2024, the Board of Directors, at the recommendation of the  Compensation Committee, decides to maintain the components of the  Chief Executive Officer’s compensation policy. This compensation  policy was set taking account of (i) Mrs.  Estelle Brachlianoff’s  experience and expertise, (ii) the change in the Group’s size and the  extension of its activities following the acquisition of Suez, and (iii) the  compensation amount but also the positioning of these components  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Compensation and benefits 182 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 185 ===== compared with executive corporate officers with a comparable profile  and in CAC 40 companies, while ensuring the consistency of the Chief  Executive Officer’s compensation with that of Executive Committee  members and compensation practices within the Company. At the recommendation of the Compensation Committee and in  accordance with the compensation policy, the Board of Directors’  Meeting of March 12, 2024 decided to retain the gross annual fixed  compensation of the Chief Executive Officer unchanged at  €1,030,000. As a reminder, this compensation was set following the Board of  Directors’ decision of April 5, 2022 based on the results of a study  conducted by the firm Boracay on a group of comparable and rival  companies comprising 13 listed European companies such as Centrica,  EDP, Enel, Engie, ENI, EON, Iberdrola, Schneider Electric, Vinci, ABB,  ACS, Air Liquide and Bouygues. The companies in the peer group: ■share a common mission: employee and environmental quality  with local public authorities; ■conduct several businesses globally and are present on at least four  continents; ■report revenue equal to between 50% and 200% of Veolia ’s  revenue. Details of this study are presented in Section 3.4 of the 2021 Universal  Registration Documentation. In 2023, during discussions with investors and proxy advisors  (governance roadshow), there was an expectation for overweighting  to be applied to the Chief Executive Officer’s long-term compensation.  The Board of Directors was eager to achieve a balance between the  three  components  (fixed,  variable  and  long-term)  of  this  compensation. At the recommendation of the Compensation  Committee, the Board of Directors decided that the Chief Executive  Officer would receive a performance share grant equal to and capped  at 133% of her fixed compensation. The Chief Executive Officer’s compensation breaks down as follows: ■annual fixed compensation (€1,030,000) for 30%; ■annual variable compensation (€1,030,000 if objectives are  attained) for 30%; ■long-term variable compensation (€1,373,000 or 133% of fixed  compensation if objectives are attained) for 40%. In the event of outperformance leading to payment of the maximum  amount of variable compensation (equal to the cap of 160% of annual  fixed compensation), the breakdown is as follows: ■annual fixed compensation (€1,030,000) for 25%; ■annual variable compensation (€1,648,000 if objectives are  exceeded) for 41%; ■long-term compensation (€1,373,000 if objectives are exceeded) for  34%.

The financial quantitative variable compensation portion will be determined based on the attainment of the  2024 budget objectives, which are consistent with the outlook announced to the market on February 29, 2024.  For the 30% non-financial quantitative portion:  • 5% based on the Health and Safety and Well-Being indicator: improvement and reduction in the injury  frequency; • 5% based on the Ethics and Compliance indicator: % of positive answers to the engagement survey  question “Are Veolia’s values applied in my entity” across all respondents; • 5% based on the Decarbonization of our assets indicator: decarbonization investments, including the  phase-out of coal and methane capture; • 5% based on the Growth and innovation drivers indicator: revenue growth in priority business segments  (energy, water technologies, hazardous waste); • 5% based on the Employee commitment indicator: commitment rate of employees measured by an  engagement survey conducted by an external body (clear objectives, meaning and usefulness, work  atmosphere, pride in the Group, willingness to recommend Veolia), • 5% based on the Depollution - Biodiversity indicator: progress rate of action plans improving the footprint  of environments and the biodiversity of sites; The non-financial quantitative variable compensation portion will be determined based on the attainment of  the 2024 objectives for the indicators concerned as detailed in Chapter 3, Section 3.4 of the 2023 Universal  Registration Document and recalled in the Notice and information brochure for the General Shareholders’  Meeting of April 25, 2024:  ii) with respect to the qualitative criteria: the qualitative portion (20% of the target bonus) will be based on  an overall assessment by the Board of Directors, at the recommendation of the Compensation Committee,  based notably on the following individual objectives:  • strategic aspects;  • managerial performance;  • equity story.

These performance shares would vest subject to the following conditions: • beneficiaries must remain with the Group until the end of the three-year vesting period i.e. until expiry of  the plan scheduled for 2027; and • a performance condition tied to the attainment of the following internal and external criteria assessed  over fiscal years 2024, 2025 and 2026 (the “Reference Period”): • financial criteria in the amount of 50%, • non-financial quantitative criteria in the amount of 50% linked to the Company’s Purpose. The number of performance shares that vest under this plan will depend on the attainment of criteria as  detailed in Section 3.4.3.1 of the 2023 Universal Registration Documentation. Obligation  to hold  performance  shares granted  and vested At the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors’ Meeting of March 12, 2024  decided, in the context of the implementation of this performance share plan (subject to the approval by  today’s General Shareholders’ Meeting of the 25th resolution), to maintain the holding obligations applicable  to the previous performance share plans: for the Chief Executive Officer, obligation to hold, until the end of  her duties, 40% of total performance shares granted under this plan, net of applicable taxes and social  security contributions, until an overall shareholding corresponding to 200% of her gross fixed compensation is  ultimately reached; for members of the Company’s Executive Committee, obligation to hold, until the end of  their duties on the Executive Committee, 25% of total performance shares granted under this plan, net of  applicable taxes and social security contributions, until an overall shareholding corresponding to 100% of their  gross fixed annual compensation is ultimately reached. In accordance with the provisions of the AFEP-MEDEF  Code, the Board of Directors, when implementing this performance share plan expected in 2024, will set the  percentage of compensation corresponding to the performance shares that would be granted, in particular, to  the Chief Executive Officer. At the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, taking into account the  expectations expressed by certain investors and proxy agencies (see Section 3.4.1.1.5 of the 2023 Universal  Registration Document), the Board of Directors stipulated that the Chief Executive Officer would receive a  performance share grant capped at 133% of her annual fixed compensation (if all performance conditions are  met). Termination  benefits on forced  departure Mrs. Estelle Brachlianoff is entitled to a severance payment in the event of termination of her duties as Chief  Executive Officer, applicable solely in the event of “forced departure”. In accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF  Corporate Governance Code, the maximum amount of this severance payment is capped at twice the total  gross annual compensation (excluding compensation awarded as a director (it being stipulated that she has  waived all compensation of this nature) and benefits in kind), including the sum of the fixed portion of her  compensation for the previous fiscal year (“Fixed Portion”) and the average of the variable portions (“Variable  Portion”) paid or payable in respect of the last two fiscal years ending before the termination of her duties as  Chief Executive Officer (“Reference Compensation”). The amount of this severance payment and its fixed and  variable portions depends in both cases on the extent to which performance conditions were attained. The  reference compensation is equal to the fixed compensation paid in respect of the last fiscal year plus the  average of the variable compensation paid or payable in respect of the last two fiscal years; no payment will  be made if the performance rate is below 75%. The severance payment is equal to the maximum amount  multiplied by the performance rate, the performance rate being equal to 60% of the objective attainment rate  for the last variable portion, plus 40% of the objective attainment rate for the previous variable portion.

In accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the total of severance payments plus non-compete compensation  cannot exceed two year’s compensation (fixed and variable, with variable compensation for the purpose of  calculating these payments equal to the average annual variable compensation paid for the last two years).  Accordingly, in the event the Board should decide to implement the non-compete clause, severance payments  would be capped at one year’s compensation. The Board of Directors may, on the departure of the Chief Executive Officer, waive application of this clause, in  which case no compensation would be due. Pension plan Mrs. Estelle Brachlianoff is eligible to participate in the supplementary defined contribution group pension  plan applicable since July 1, 2014, presented in Section 3.4.2 of this Universal Registration Document. She is also  eligible under the defined benefit pension plan described in Section 3.4.2 of this Universal Registration  Document, with a theoretical annuity of nil.

In addition, directors and executives are also subject to French  regulations on breach of duty and insider trading, which penalize the  use or disclosure of inside information. Finally, directors and executives are required to comply with the  Company’s Code of conduct governing trading in its securities (see  Chapter 4, Section 4.6.5.4 below and Chapter 3, Section 3.2.1.8 above).  This Code was updated for the provisions of Regulation (EU)  no.  596/2014 of April  16, 2014 on market abuse and the positions- recommendations issued by the AMF and set out in its guidance on  permanent reporting and the management of inside information and  its guidance on periodic reporting. In this context, the Inside  Information Committee created in November  2016 (see Chapter  4,  Section  4.6.2.2 below), classified the members of the Company’s  Executive Committee as permanent insiders. They can therefore only  purchase or sell Company securities, directly or through an  intermediary, under certain conditions (notably after consulting the  Inside Information Committee) and during specific, time-limited  periods, in particular after the publication of the Company’s annual,  half-yearly and quarterly results. 3.5.1  TRANSACTIONS IN VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT SECURITIES  BY DIRECTORS To the Company’s knowledge, on December 31, 2023, members of the  Board of Directors held a total of 224,789 Veolia Environnement  shares, representing 0.03% of the Company’s share capital as of that  date.

Its CSR policy is therefore enshrined in its business model as  demonstrated by the Purpose (see Chapter 1, Section 1.1.2 above) and  the related multifaceted performance commitments, objectives and  targets (see Profile Section above and Section 4.1 below). This chapter describes their environmental performance (see  Section  4.2 below), human resources performance (see Section  4.4  below) and social performance (see Section 4.3 below) components as  well as the compliance approach (see Section 4.6 below). As part of the multifaceted performance of the GreenUp 2024-2027  strategic program (see. Profile Section, p.18-19), 10 of the 15 objectives  are presented in this chapter dedicated to environmental, social and  societal responsibility (vs. 12 out of 18 objectives in the previous Impact  2023 program), each with an Executive Committee member sponsor: Multifaceted performance  objectives Executive Committee  Sponsor Decarbonization of our  customers - Scope 4 Christophe Maquet Decarbonization – scopes 1 and 2 reduction Claude Laruelle Decarbonization –  transformation of our assets  (including phase-out of coal and  methane capture) Philippe Guitard Freshwater savings and  resource regeneration Gustavo Migues Depollution - Biodiversity Sébastien Daziano Health, safety and well-being Estelle Brachlianoff Employee commitment Laurent Obadia Diversity and inclusion Helman le Pas de Sécheval Ethics and compliance Eric Haza Support to local communities Isabelle Calvez This year, Veolia has published for the third time the information  required under European Green Taxonomy principles (see Section 4.5  below), as part of the sustainable finance policy rolled out by the  European Union. French regulations on the Vigilance plan (see Section 4.7 below) and  the Non-Financial Performance Statement (see Section 4.8 below) also  offer a framework for these initiatives. Except for Section 4.5 relating to the taxonomy, all information linked  to the Non-Financial Performance Statement is verified by an  independent third party body (see Section 4.10 below). For fiscal year  2023, the indicators noted by the symbol (√) were checked with a  reasonable level of assurance. Veolia is actively preparing the move to the CSRD in  2024 The current non-financial reporting NFPS (Non-Financial  Performance Statement) will be replaced in early 2025 for the  2024 fiscal year by a so-called “sustainability” report as part of  the new CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive),  combining Environmental, Social and Governance aspects with  the financial vision. Veolia considers this new reporting chapter  to be an opportunity to better put into perspective its various  businesses, in a dual materiality approach: the materiality of the  positive and negative impacts the Company has on the outside  world and the materiality of the financial risks and financial  opportunities induced on Veolia by external factors. This  approach should enable us to better inform all our stakeholders  about the added value we create for the environment through all  our policies and action plans. The start of this new regulation  coincides perfectly with Veolia’s strategic agenda and its new  GreenUp plan. The material challenges, grouped into six themes  (decarbonizing, depolluting, saving and regenerating resources,  providing essential services, attracting and retaining talent,  engaging stakeholders in ecological transformation) and  impacts, risks and opportunities (IRO) have already been defined.  The corresponding reporting tools are under development.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Environmental, social and human resources performance commitments 198 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 201 ===== As part of its GreenUp 2024-2027 strategic program, its multifaceted  performance commitments were renewed, and new objectives and  targets were defined (see Profile section, p.18-19, above). These commitments to sustainable development supplement the  Group’s voluntary adherence to the United Nations Global Compact,  which it signed in June  2003. In so doing, it has committed to  supporting and promoting the Global Compact’s 10 principles on  human rights, labor law, the environment and the fight against  corruption. The practical principles adopted by Veolia are also  consistent with various international reference texts, such as the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its additional covenants  and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s  guidelines for multinational enterprises. Veolia’s commitments to a multifaceted performance apply to all of its  activities and all of its employees, in all of the countries where it  operates. They are upheld and managed at the highest corporate level  (see the Profile, page 9 above). 4.1.2  CONTRIBUTION TO THE UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE  DEVELOPMENT GOALS Between 2000 and 2015, Veolia was a major contributor to the United  Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for access to water and  wastewater services (see Section  4.3.4.3.1 below). It remains an active  player in ensuring that the United Nations Sustainable Development  Goals (SDGs) adopted in 2015 are attained. An initial study consulting internal and external stakeholders was  conducted in 2017. This aimed to provide an initial overview of the way  Veolia’s businesses can help attain the SDGs. It concluded that Veolia  contributes to a greater or lesser extent to implementing each of the  17 SDGs and has a direct or indirect impact on 65 of the 169 SDG  targets, representing a contribution to 40% of targets. Supporting promotion of the SDGs and reinforcing a common understanding In order to help promote understanding and adoption of the SDGs, the Veolia Foundation supported the creation of a Massive Open Online  Course (MOOC) dedicated to the SDGs. Launched in 2018 by the Virtual Environment and Development University (UVED), it presents the 17  SDGs and how they interact with each other. It provides tools to better take the SDGs into account on a daily basis, offers ideas to implement  positive actions and promotes initiatives and experiences already in place. Veolia shared its feedback regarding adoption of the SDGs by a  company. The MOOC was updated in 2019 and a second session was launched in September. Overall, nearly 25,000 people have familiarized  themselves with these global requirements that are essential to developing world peace, protecting the planet, bringing an end to poverty and  reducing inequality. The SDG MOOC has been translated into five languages and won the “Best MOOC developed by a university or school”  prize at the MOOC of the Year awards. Veolia’s Purpose fits directly into the SDG framework: “Veolia’s  Purpose is to contribute to human progress by firmly committing to  the Sustainable Development Goals set by the UN to achieve a better  and more sustainable future for all. It is with this aim in mind that  Veolia sets itself the task of ’Resourcing the world’ through its  environmental services business.” The SGDs provided input for the drafting of this text, by setting  objectives and aligning the Purpose with international challenges. The  multifaceted performance indicators were drawn up to help provide a  better response to these issues. Finally, the SGDs also challenge the ability to forge new more  innovative relationships to collectively invent new solutions to take up  the challenges relating to the preservation of resources and  population issues. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Environmental, social and human resources performance commitments VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 199  ===== PAGE 202 ===== Veolia therefore plays a major role for 13 SDGs whose challenges are directly linked to its Purpose: Nine objectives linked to its activities As an urban services provider, Veolia plays a major role in managing  essential services in water and sanitation (SDG 6), energy (SDG 7) and  waste (SDG 11, which includes a waste management target). Veolia  promotes innovative industrial production methods (SDG  9) and  responsible consumption through the circular economy (SDG 12).  Finally, through its solutions, Veolia contributes directly to meeting  climate (SDG 13) and ecosystem conservation (SDG 14 and 15)  challenges. Finally, by promoting access to essential services, Veolia contributes to  reducing inequalities (SDG 10).                     Three objectives linked to organization priorities as a responsible company Veolia acts to develop the skills of its workforce to improve  employability, but also to create value for its customers and regions  thought its Campus network (SDG 4). The Group is committed to  gender equality and acts to increase the number of women in its  businesses and strengthen the percentage of women managers (SDG  5). Veolia supports sustainable growth by promoting decent working  conditions for all, in compliance with human rights and the rights of  its employees, subcontractors and suppliers (SDG 8).       One key objective to drive attainment of SDGs Veolia is a local operator and interacts with all its stakeholders, to  build solutions adapted to regional challenges together. Its  commitment to attaining the SDGs leads Veolia to extend its  economic activity chain in order to widen its areas of action and build  new alliances with other players to meet the needs of the public  covered by the SDGs. By developing new partnerships and notably by  calling on additional expertise contributed by its partners and shared  value  creation,  Veolia  contributes  to  strengthening  SDG  implementation resources (SDG 17), Alliance to End Plastic Waste, etc. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Environmental, social and human resources performance commitments 200 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 203 ===== 4.1.3  STAKEHOLDER RELATIONS 4.1.3.1  Strategy and approach The Group's relations with its stakeholder are at the core of Veolia's  purpose. The multifaceted performance strategy proposes to adopt  the same level of focus and standards for the Group’s economic and  financial, commercial, human resource, social and environmental  performance, with respect to the five main stakeholder categories – employees, customers, shareholders, society and the planet. The competition and rapid developments in the markets in which  Veolia operates, associated with its multiple geographic locations,  require dialogue and continual collaboration with all stakeholders,  whether local, national or international. The need for a close  relationship with public authorities, civil society, international  organizations, multi-stakeholder platforms, local communities and  consumers creates an opportunity for the Group to ascertain their  expectations, establish itself locally in the long-term and create  innovative solutions together with different partners.Having an  exceptional relationship with its stakeholders enables better  adaptation to change, and faced with the growing expectations of civil  society and regulations, Veolia must be a regional player in solidarity  with others to facilitate the roll-out of solutions to implement  ecological transformation.  This is why the opening of the Group to its stakeholders goes much  further than mere dialogue and consultation. The challenge is to build  a community that acts together to create value and build valuable  solutions with a strong positive impact for all. Veolia has therefore  structured its stakeholder relations approach under the banner  “Resourcing together”, which focuses on three areas: listening and  exchanging, co-construction and seeking solutions, commitment and  sincerity with regard to the impacts created.  This search for cooperation with its ecosystem is based on regular  interactions between the Group, in particular its governing bodies,  and its stakeholders through various discussion forums: the Critical  Friends Committee, the open-ended consultation process “+1, ecology  turned  into action”, the Veolia Institute Foresight Committee,  dialogue with labor and management, cooperation with academic,  scientific and technical partners, meetings with high-level experts,  participation in working groups, conferences and international events. An in-house methodology guide “Understanding, talking and acting  with our local stakeholders” enables each Group entity to embrace  this commitment to dialogue and cooperation with its stakeholders,  by proposing methodological tools and case studies to analyze,  identify and prioritize its stakeholders and to implement this approach  and the various means of engaging with them effectively over the  long term in line with objectives and local contexts. The guide is  currently being updated and a training course is being designed to  enable CSR managers and operational teams to make progress in their  approaches and better address the various challenges. 4.1.3.2  Listening to stakeholders The various tools for listening to and collecting Veolia’s stakeholders’  expectations  provide  a  more  detailed  vision  of  ecological  transformation challenges and the Group’s response to them. Ecological Transformation Barometer In 2022, Veolia and Elabe launched the first ecological  transformation barometer to fuel a constructive and proactive  debate with its the Group’s stakeholders on the acceptability of  changes necessary to face the environmental emergency. This  unprecedented opinion poll covered 25 countries across five  continents and a sample of almost half the human world’s  population. Countries were selected for their demographic  weight and for their relevance (countries on the front line of  climate change but also pioneering countries for in terms of  ecological policies) to give the survey yet more scientific  credibility.  This barometer, the second edition of which was launched at the  end of 2023, is designed to assess the global and local level of  acceptability for existing ecological solutions and identify the  main levers that facilitate the implementation of solutions as  well as the obstacles that may delay their implementation. Net Promotor Score (NPS) Veolia has developed a unique program called “Voice of  customers” to measure customer satisfaction and monitor the  commercial performance of all the Group’s BUs. The Group uses  the calculation of the Net Promotor score indicator, which  measures customer satisfaction by submitting a simple survey to  customers, then incorporates the obtained responses into a  formula that generates a single figure - the Net Promotor score  indicator - for benchmarking purposes. In its relations with its customers, even though Veolia ensures  above all compliance with its legal and contractual obligations,  the Group is fully committed to implementing solutions that  meet the needs and expectations of its public and private  customers and the beneficiaries of the services entrusted to it. In  cooperation with its customers and relevant organizations,  Veolia strives to develop the means of improving access to  essential services for all. The preservation and protection of asset  integrity  guarantees  the  Group’s  service  quality  and  performance. Thanks to this NPS program, Veolia can listen to  customers, assess its commercial performance and implement  action plans to better meet their expectations. CSR issue materiality analysis In 2020, Veolia updated the materiality analysis of its CSR issues. This  was an opportunity for the Group to assess the perception, by its  external and internal stakeholders, of the decisions taken by the  Group with regard to its Purpose. This was the first step of renewed  reflection that continued into 2021 on the organization of the Group’s  stakeholder relation strategy, under the banner “Resourcing  Together”.  To conduct the analysis, 24 CSR issues were identified based on a  documentary study of data taken from several databases, taking into  account the multifaceted performance indicators defined under the  Impact 2023 strategic plan.  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Environmental, social and human resources performance commitments VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 201  ===== PAGE 204 ===== They were then assessed by 188 internal and external stakeholders  (customers, suppliers, competitors, associations and NGOs, local  residents, end consumers, regulatory authorities, etc.) during an online  consultation organized from April to November 2020 by the firm Des  Enjeux et des Hommes in eight Veolia Business Units: Water France,  Germany, UK, Czech Republic, China, Australia, USA, Colombia. The  Africa – Middle East region was included in the overall results based on  consultations held between 2017 and 2019 by the firm BL Évolution. A  selection of “corporate” stakeholders and head office employees were  also consulted. Internal stakeholders were asked to assess the impact  of CSR issues on Veolia’s activity, while external stakeholders  commented on their expectation in relation to the Group.  To complete this analysis, 75 interviews were held with voluntary  stakeholders, some of whom answered the questionnaire. These  interviews were organized to discuss the risks and opportunities  associated with the CSR issues, and to strengthen dialogue with  stakeholders.  In this survey, the 10 most significant issues were identified  worldwide, analyzed by country and stakeholder category.

Critical Friends Committee Created in 2013, the Veolia Critical Friends Committee is today  made up of around a dozen independent people, experts in  human resources and social and environmental issues, from  institutions,  the  academic  community  and  non-profit  organizations and company partners, including a representative  of young climate activists. The Committee is chaired by Jean- Michel Severino, CEO of Investisseurs & Partenaires. This collective forum of discussion provides Veolia Executive  Management with an external viewpoint on strategic topics in  relation to its corporate responsibility, in order to foster and  support the Group’s initiative to make continuous progress.  Members contributed to establishing the Group’s Purpose and  expressed opinions on its accomplishment. In 2023, the Critical  Friends Committee met before Antoine Frérot and Estelle  Brachlianoff and adressed various topics:  • the lessons learned after three years of implementing the  multifaceted performance as part of the preparation of the  2024-2027 strategic program; • the school ecological transformation project - Terra Academia; • Veolia's 1.5°climate strategy. Veolia's Critical Friends Committee in Japan also met once with  local management to exchange views with experts on Veolia's  strategy in this region. In China, the Committee met with BU  ExCom teams to discuss topics relating to the reduction of CO2  emissions and the circular economy. The Veolia Institute: looking to the future The Veolia Institute looks to the future and considers challenges  relating to both the environment and society. It develops its activities  through ongoing dialogue in economic and intellectual circles and  with practitioners that lead their field in the areas it studies. Through  conferences, a review (Institute Review – FACTS reports) and forward- looking working groups, the Veolia Institute brings together and  circulates the experience and expertise of different players  (researchers, academic experts, public powers, companies, NGOs,  international organizations, etc.) to gain different viewpoints on  certain major planetary issues and shed light on the future: • In November 2023, the Veolia Institute published a edition of its  review dedicated to innovation for ecological transformation,  which brought together academic contributions (MINES Paris- PSL,  Jawaharlal Nehru University, Singapore Management University,  Transition Campus) as well as contributions from multilateral  organizations (UNDP, OECD), CSOs (Paris 2024 Olympic and  Paralympic Games Organizing Committee, Fédération Envie, Inner  Development Goals, imagine H2O, Net Zero cities, etc.), and  businesses (Veolia, GIST impact, circulate Capital, seedlings,  Biomimicry 3.8, etc.). A conference, accessible online, was  organized at Veolia’s headquarters to mark the publication of this  new edition. It is available for free on the Institute’s website. • The Veolia Institute also organized a series of meetings with  experts on innovation and commodity markets as well as a first  scientific meeting on health and the environment. Thanks to the international reputation of its members and their  expertise, the Veolia Institute Foresight Committee guides the  activities of the Institute during its annual meeting. In October 2023,  this committee met to discuss the topic of “Water scarcity: future  threats and possible solutions”. The “+1, ecology turned into action” consultation process To strengthen this dialogue in our geographical areas, BUs and at the  heart of our contracts in the territories. Veolia designed and developed  the “+ 1, ecology turned into action” cooperation process in order to  accelerate multifaceted performance. It is an innovative methodology for dialogue between stakeholders on  the challenges of ecological transformation. The aim? Initiate  exchanges  and  discussions  between  players  from  different  backgrounds so that they can work together to deploy useful solutions  to as many people as possible. Shared in open source to enable other companies and organizations to  benefit from it, it can be transposed to different contexts,  geographical areas and topics. The “+1” variations currently in the works The +1 method was adopted for Veolia’s corporate strategy to prepare  Veolia’s 2024-2027 strategic program. The “+1 Inspire 24-27”  consultation promoted an open dialogue with the Group’s  stakeholders: a committee comprising representatives of employees,  customers, shareholders, society and the planet was set up in each of  the Group’s 8 zones, at Business Unit level (Australia / New Zealand,  Colombia, the United States, France, Italy, Japan, Czech Republic and  Japan). These 8 committees contributed to discussions to develop the next  strategic program through three complementary work sessions  applicable to different contexts and issues (contracts, projects,  Business Units, etc.). At the end of the consultation, the analysis of the  responses resulted in a summary shared with the Group’s top  management and then all employees and zones to fuel and inspire the  program. Other variations of the method were implemented in 2023: an  exchange with France and Europe employee representatives as part of  the development of the strategic program or the launch of governance  at a Veolia site in Nice. The “+1, employee representatives'' Twenty or so employee representatives, members of the  France  and European Works Councils were interviewed using the +1  method on two occasions in November 2022 and May 2023  about their priorities and focal points regarding the Group’s next  strategic program. ''+1'' for Group contracts Veolia and the Nice Cote d’Azur Metropolitan area have devised  for the Arianeo contract – the new green energy production  center in the Nice metropolitan area – an open and participative  governance inspired by the “ +1,  ecology turned into action”  initiative. An Environmental and Societal High Council bringing  together the stakeholders of the contract, namely the Nice Côte  d’Azur Metropolitan Area, neighborhood committees, Banque  des Territoires, and Veolia, met for the first time on January 24,  2024. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Environmental, social and human resources performance commitments VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 203  ===== PAGE 206 ===== Dialogue with international, European and national  authorities As a partner to international organizations, Veolia continues to  cooperate with international bilateral organizations and donor  agencies to give effect to the commitments made when it joined the  United Nations Global Compact in June 2003, and to contribute to the  achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Each year,  the Group renews its commitment to respect and implement the ten  principles of the United Nations Global Compact, in particular by  publishing information on its progress (Communication on Progress)  on the UN Global Compact website. The Group is an active member of  the France network and acts as Vice-Chairman in charge of major  businesses on the Board of Directors. Veolia actively contributes to international debates on the  environment such as during the climate Conference of Parties (COP) or  summits on biodiversity. Since COP21, the Group has worked to play a part at these conferences  and contribute to debates on mitigating and adapting to climate  change.  Veolia was present in December 2023 at the COP28 in Dubai. This  event was an opportunity for the Group to reaffirm its  commitment to invest €1.6 billion by 2030 to phase out coal in  Europe. The Group’s Chief Executive Officer spoke in several  high-level panels, including an event organized by President  Emmanuel Macron on the phase-out of coal. The Group’s  employees participated in around ten events, including side  events co-organized by the WBCSD and the Japanese METI on  avoided emissions. Veolia also participated in the United Nations Water Conference in  New York in March 2023. The Group has committed to investing $1.5  billion annually in infrastructure, technology, and research and  innovation to contribute globally to the achievement of the 13 United  Nations Sustainable Development Goals relating to water and  sanitation. In addition, Estelle Brachlianoff announced the Group’s commitment  to accelerate ecological transformation and deploy solutions to  achieve a Net Zero Water impact. Finally, the conferences attended by Veolia representatives provided  an opportunity to share nature-based solutions developed by the  Group with regard to climate change adaptation. In its commitment to multi-stakeholder platforms, such as  competitiveness clusters, associations and local and international  scientific institutes, the Group develops synergies with its regional  ecosystem. Veolia is a player in partnership ventures such as the  WBCSD, or those locally in France, such as Comité 21, EPE (French  Association of Companies for the Environment), ORSE (French  Observatory of Corporate Social Responsibility), Vivapolis – Institute  for sustainable cities, the French Partnership for Water (PFE), and  competitiveness clusters (Efficacity, Montpellier Water cluster,  Brittany-Atlantic Maritime cluster in Brest and the Mediterranean  Maritime cluster in Toulon). Representation of Veolia’s interests and contributions during the  discussions, consultations and work relating to changes in  management  of  environmental  services,  carried  out  with  international, European and national authorities, are discussed in  Section 4.6.5.3. Dialogue with representatives of civil society and the  academic world In 2022, Veolia joined the Boston-based Change Chemistry Alliance  (formerly the Green Chemistry and Commerce Council), which has  more than one hundred stakeholders (NGOs, businesses, universities,  etc.) that combine their R&I practices to develop chemistry that is  more sustainable and responsible. This partnership, which is part of  the prospective “Chemical transition” program, aims to develop life  cycle analysis research and new approaches for the safer design of our  solutions and processes. This work will continue in 2024 on the  development of green chemistry principles, training requirements and  material loops. In 2023, Veolia renewed its membership with the National Association  of Research and Technology (ANRT) to discuss with other  industrialists, start-ups and other R&I ecosystems all aspects of  ecological transformation, with a focus in 2023 on energy transition,  industrial and technological transition, training and research tax  credit. For 2024, these exchanges will continue on the development of  practices in terms of partnerships and alliances, industrial and  technological transition and the future of measurement. In 2022, the Group also signed agreements, notably with Telecom Paris  as a sponsor of the 2025 year group, and ENSAM Ecole Nationale des  Arts et Métiers, which trains high-level operational engineers, through  a specific commitment to the Paris, Aix en Provence, Lille and  Bordeaux campuses. Through these cooperation agreements with very  high-level institutions, the Group strengthens the appeal of its  employer brand to students training in strategic professions for the  future of its activities, both in the digital professions and in  operational and industrial engineering. 4.1.3.4  Local and territorial commitment In addition to sponsorship, Veolia creates the conditions for strong  local integration and a relationship of trust with the regional  ecosystem. Fondation d’entreprise Veolia Environnement  Hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  Veolia  Foundation  (www.fondation.veolia.com) or the Foundation, its priority areas  are development assistance and humanitarian emergencies,  support for transition to employment and social cohesion and  environmental  and  biodiversity  protection.  The  Veolia  Foundation’s projects involve the Group’s employees, as  sponsors of supported projects (financial sponsorship), or  Veoliaforce network volunteers (skills sponsorship through  expertise provided in the field or remotely). In 2023, Veolia  Foundation provided financial support totaling €812 310 to 31  new projects or action plans. Dialogue with local communities Veolia implements initiatives to foster dialogue with local  communities and residents: targeted information and awareness  campaigns, including neighborhood meetings, meetings with elected  officials and local associations, facility visits and open days to inform  the general public, as well as volunteering. Veolia is involved with these communities in various ways, including  through regional socio-economic analyses, community links and the  provision of methodological tools to organize dialogue with  stakeholders at regional level. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Environmental, social and human resources performance commitments 204 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 207 ===== In Australia in 2022, Veolia reaffirmed its historic commitment to  defending the rights of Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander  peoples by launching the fourth Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP)  2022-2025 (see Section 4.3.2.3.2 below). Veolia works with numerous international and local organizations to  exercise its responsibility with regard to sustainable development:  preservation and protection of the environment (see Section  4.2  below), and support for socioeconomic development in the countries  where the Group operates (see Section 4.3 below). For its employees, Veolia promotes equal opportunities within the  Company through its Human Resources policy (see Section 4.4 below).  Veolia is convinced that developing social dialogue with its employees  contributes to improving local working conditions, particularly in  emerging countries, and encourages the creation of employee  dialogue forums (see Section 4.4.5 below). For its customers and consumers, the Group develops processes  adapted to local requirements (see Section 4.3.3 below). Eco-responsible third places Veolia supports the territories and participates in their economic,  social and environmental development by promoting, with its  local partners, the set-up of third places dedicated to civic  commitment, where ecological transformation takes place  locally. Since 2018, Veolia has been working to roll out this innovative  model by proposing, where relevant, a third place in its contracts.  The challenge is to mobilize its stakeholders (customers, citizens,  NGOs, subcontractors, etc.) around the contract’s environmental  and societal issues but also to engage local populations in the  topics of waste reduction, preservation of resources and  biodiversity or the fight against climate change. Several projects  are under development, in France and internationally. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Environmental, social and human resources performance commitments VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 205  ===== PAGE 208 ===== 4.2  Environmental performance 4.2.1  ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND ENVIRONMENTAL & INDUSTRIAL  MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 4.2.1.1  Commitments and objectives In connection with its Purpose, defined in 2019 and its Impact  2023  strategic  program,  Veolia  drew  up  new  multifaceted  performance commitments, objectives and targets in 2020 (see the  Profile, pages 8-10 above). In terms of environmental performance, Veolia undertakes to combat  pollution and accelerate ecological transition. This commitment  breaks down into several objectives: ■combat climate change (see Section 4.2.3 below); ■promote the circular economy (see Section 4.2.2 below); ■protect environments and biodiversity (see Section 4.2.4 below); ■manage water resources sustainably (see Section 4.2.5 below). As part of its GreenUp 2024-2027 strategic program, this commitment  has been renewed and implemented according to the following  objectives: ■decarbonize; ■preserve freshwater and regenerate resources; ■depollute and protect biodiversity. 4.2.1.2  The Environmental & Industrial  Management System Since 2021, the application scope of the Group’s Environmental  Management System (EMS), rolled out within its BUs in 2002, has  expanded to include industrial risks. This new Environmental &  Industrial Management System (EIMS) now has a new unified list of  environmental and industrial risks as well as risk management  resources (essentials, standards and internal Group best practices).  Veolia’s Environmental Policy and Environmental and Industrial  Management System cover all of the Group‘s activities (see Chapter 1,  Section 1.3 above). Its main joint ventures, particularly in China, are  fully integrated into the EIMS and environmental reporting.  Veolia’s responsible purchasing policy also includes requirements in  terms of environmental protection, applicable to suppliers and  subcontractors (see. Section 4.3.2.3.4 below). Environmental criteria are taken into account by engagement  committees when considering new organic growth or business  acquisition projects. The EIMS: ■allows the Group to measure its environmental and industrial  impacts, with the ultimate goal of reducing them, in accordance  with the commitments defined in the Impact 2023  strategic  program; ■makes it possible to control the risks and opportunities relating to  the environment. It provides a framework that helps the Group to  achieve its environmental objectives based on a review and annual  assessment of its environmental performance.  ■is based on a continuous improvement approach in which the BUs  and their managers play a key role. Each year, the BU director, its  Executive Committee and the EIMS correspondent carry out a  systematic assessment of the following aspects: assessment and  steering of the past year’s operational environmental performance,  definition of targets for the years to come and sharing of the action  plan, update of the BU’s environmental and industrial risk  challenges and exposure, definition and sharing of improvement  plans to reduce this exposure, assessment of the past year’s  environmental  and  industrial  incidents  and  finally  the  identification of best practices to share within the Group.  The objective (initially set for 2023) to attain an EIMS deployment rate  of 95% was already achieved by 2021. This common framework is strengthened locally by environmental  and industrial management systems recognized externally: ISO 14001  and ISO  50001, Process Safety Management certification, labels,  compliance with contractual commitments, etc. 4.2.1.3  Control and deployment ESG Committee Co-chaired by the Group General Counsel, the Senior Executive Vice President for Strategy and  Innovation and the Senior Executive Vice President for Human Resources, it brings together functional  departments in charge of environmental, social, societal, compliance and governance matters and  ensures their coordination. It defines the Company’s strategic priorities and approves its environmental  policy, objectives and management system. Group Business Support and  Performance Department The Environmental & Industrial Management System (EIMS) is overseen by the Group Business Support  and Performance Department, supported by the Director of each Business Unit and deployed by local  managers. The Executive Committee monitors its deployment and the results obtained on an annual  basis. Within the Executive Committee, the  Group Business Support and Performance Director is  responsible for ensuring that this system is effective. Group Internal Audit Department This department verifies the correct deployment of the Environmental & Industrial Management System  and its application by operating managers. Risk Department and Risk  Committee The Risk Department coordinates the identification, assessment and control of Group risks, particularly  environmental and industrial risks. It works with a Risk Committee that brings together the members of  the Executive Committee and is chaired by the Company’s General Counsel and run by the Risk,  Insurance and Internal Control Coordination Director. This committee validates and monitors the  effectiveness of the implemented action plans covering the significant risks identified in the mapping  (see Chapter 2, Section 2.1.1 above). CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Environmental performance 206 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 209 ===== The Group also has a warning system and a crisis management  procedure  throughout  its  locations,  particularly  to  monitor  environmental risks and violations.

More  specifically, industrial investments amounted to €3,730 million in 2023  (see Chapter 5, Section 5.3.2.1) and included investments in growth and  compliance measures. The Group also invested in training, certification programs and the  implementation of the Environmental and Industrial Management  System. A specific Research and Innovation budget was also renewed  (see Chapter 1, Section 1.4 above). The Group continued a policy of selective investment, while  maintaining industrial investments that were contractually required  or that were needed to maintain industrial assets. Provisions for environmental risks primarily consist of provisions for  site closure costs (including provisions for site restoration, the  dismantling of equipment and environmental risks). They totaled  €1,208 million in 2023. GreenPath, an environmental footprint tool for offerings and  contracts Veolia has developed GreenPath, a web platform used by sales  and technical teams to compare the environmental footprints of  several solutions and choose, with customers, the solution that  best meets their performance objectives. The tool calculates the  carbon footprint of new projects and existing contracts in  accordance with ISO  14064 and ISO  14069 and their water  footprint in accordance with ISO 14046 and assesses their impact  on biodiversity. It is available on the Group’s intranet and covers  Veolia’s three business lines: Water, Waste and Energy. 4.2.1.7  Raise employee awareness  and training Training and informing employees about environmental issues is an  integral part of the measures put in place by the Group in each of the  countries where it operates. The integration process calls for management training and  awareness-raising in environmental issues and the challenges specific  to Veolia. The Group Learning Department provides Business Units  with access to environmental training (see Section 4.4.4 below). This is  supplemented by local training sessions based on identified needs. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Environmental performance VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 209  ===== PAGE 212 ===== In December 2020, Veolia launched an e-learning program on  environmental challenges: ■an updated version of the e-learning “Act for the planet – Climate  change issues”, ■a new e-learning on biodiversity. In 2023, these two modules were incorporated into a comprehensive  learning path “Passport to ecological transformation”, presenting the  planet’s limits and the various environmental and societal challenges  of ecological transformation. Alongside this environmental training program, Veolia has also rolled  out since 2022 the ecological transformation fresk: an educational  workshop to raise awareness of environmental issues and the impact  of Veolia’s activities. The Veolia Institute also set up “Les rencontres de l'Institut” for Group  managers to discover current environmental, societal and geopolitical  changes by speaking with top-level experts. Short video interviews  were streamed to pass on the key messages from these meetings to a  wider internal audience. After having addressed in 2022 the challenges  and opportunities of ecological transition, and the problem of reduced  energy use vs growth decline, in 2023 the Institute initiated a cycle of  scientific meetings on the topic of health and the environment. With the support of the Veolia Foundation, the Virtual Environment  and Sustainable Development University (UVED) has developed online  training (MOOC: Massive Open Online Courses) on biodiversity, the  causes and challenges of climate change and ecological engineering.  Veolia scientific experts have contributed to the educational content  (videos) and the Group encourages its employees to enroll in the  courses. 4.2.2 PROMOTE THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY 4.2.2.1  Risks and opportunities By operating its own facilities and those of its customers, Veolia  consumes water, energy and raw materials and generates waste. This  environmental impact exposes the Group to environmental and  industrial risks (see Chapter 2, Section 2.2.2.2 above). However, the very nature of Veolia’s business aims to protect  resources, as reflected by its motto “Resourcing the world”. Veolia  builds long-lasting relationships with its customers based in particular  on its ability to manage risks delegated by them. The Group proposes  specific offerings to its customers to protect natural resources:  processing waste and “complex pollution”, waste and wastewater  energy and product recovery and industrial and regional ecology  services., 4.2.2.2  Policy and commitments As part of its Purpose and its Impact 2023 strategic program, Veolia is  committed to combating pollution and accelerating ecological  transition (see Section  4.1.1 above). This commitment can be broken  down into several objectives, including promoting the circular  economy, mainly by plastic recycling and material recovery. To  illustrate this objective, the Group defined a 2023 target for the  volume of recycled plastic in the Veolia recycling plants. The result of this indicator suffered from lower production mainly in  Europe and China due to massive inflow of raw materials from Asia.  The European regulation that will introduce a minimal threshold of  25% of recycled PET for marketers will only come into effect in 2025.

In  the case of non-consolidated joint ventures, the indicator includes volumes of recycled plastics in proportion to Veolia’s shares in these joint ventures. This objective focuses on: ■developing the circular economy (see Section 4.2.2.3.1 below); ■limiting raw material consumption, mainly through material (see Section 4.2.2.3.2 below) and energy (see Section 4.2.3.3.3 below) recovery of  waste. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Environmental performance 210 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 213 ===== As part of its GreenUp 24-27 strategic program, Veolia renewed its environmental commitment and adopted the following  objective and target: Commitment Objective SDG Indicator – definition 2023  baseline Cible 2027 Combat pollution and  accelerate the ecological  transformation Freshwater  savings and  resource  regeneration Saved freshwater (reuse, desalination,  leakage reduction) 1.4 billion   m 3  ≥ 1.5 billion  m 3 Sponsor Gustavo  Migues Member of the Executive Committee, and Senior Executive Vice  President, for the Iberia and Latin America region 4.2.2.3  Actions and results 4.2.2.3.1  Encourage the circular economy Approach Veolia proposes solutions to protect resources in a circular economy  by: ■producing “secondary raw materials” from waste (recycled plastic,  rare metals from electronic waste, recovered solvents, compost,  etc.); ■producing renewable and recovered energy from waste and  wastewater  and  recovering  unavoidable  energy  (see  Section 4.2.3.3.3 below); ■reusing water (see Section 4.2.5.3.5 below); ■energy performance of buildings and industrial sites; ■creating synergies at multi-customer sites (industrial and regional  ecology, biomass heating network). In 2023, Veolia contributed to discussions on the implementation of  the French law on the circular economy through multi-party  organizations and professional federations in the sector, defending  waste recycling and recovery activities. At European level, the Group  actively participated in the debates on the regulatory changes set out  in the European Green Deal and the European Commission’s Circular  Economy Action Plan to promote reuse, recovery and recycling within  the European Union. A plastic recycling and recovery strategy Veolia has defined a plastic strategy to guarantee its industrial  customers access to high quality recycled plastic that meets their  requirements and is comparable to virgin material: ■Veolia is a member of the “European Plastics Pact” and the  National Pacts on Plastic Packaging in the United Kingdom,  Portugal, Australia and France, which aim to identify common  ambitions among States and businesses willing to follow more  ambitious goals for single-use plastics and packaging, initiate  new cross-border collaborations and develop partnerships  around innovations. Veolia took part in the European and French  discussions on single-use plastics, recycling and recovery, mainly  through multi-player bodies and professional federations in the  waste industry. PlastiLoop, a new global recycled plastics offering Supported by more than 30 years of experience in recycling  plastic, Veolia created PlastiLoop, an unprecedented integrated  platform which enables its customers to source plastic resins  from anywhere in the world, through a range of polymers sorted  by application to meet each specific need.  PlastiLoop therefore brings a concrete solution to the growing  number of industrial customers who wish to commit to a plastic  recycling process in order to reduce their carbon footprint and  help save resources. Establish large-scale partnerships to optimize resource  management As part of its CircPack® offering, the Group enters into  partnerships with industrial companies to act from the design  phase and improve the ability to recycle products and the use of  so-called secondary raw materials; Faurecia, a FORVIA Group company, and Veolia signed a  cooperation and research agreement to jointly develop  innovative compounds for automotive interior modules, aiming  to achieve an average of 30% recycled content by 2025. Through  this partnership, the two companies will accelerate the  deployment in Europe of innovative sustainable interior  solutions implemented in dashboards, door panels and center  consoles. Veolia will start producing these secondary raw  materials at its existing recycling sites in France in 2023. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Environmental performance VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 211  ===== PAGE 214 ===== The set of ISO 59000 standards recently specified the framework for the circular economy  Veolia leads the ISO international standardization work on the circular economy by chairing the dedicated technical committee with 100  countries at the roundtable. The objective is to produce a set of documents (ISO 59000 series) providing a consensus on the definition of the  circular economy, its principles, the action levers and the circularity indicators to be used. These standards are set to be published in May 2024.  In 2023, the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) has followed suit with the creation of a dedicated European technical committee. A  standard on extended producer responsibility and a document on business models and their transition to incorporate circularity are planned.  The latter topic is coordinated by Veolia. Objective and results As part of its 2020-2023 Environment Plan, Veolia set a circular economy revenue target of €6.3 billion  (1). This target involves three business lines:  Waste, Water and Energy. (€ million)  2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Target Circular economy revenue 5.2 5.2 6.0 8.4 9.2 6.3 Following the 2022 increase due to the integration of certain Suez activities, the improvement in 2023 was primarily due to a more precise  calculation of circular activities performed in connection with the European taxonomy and the inclusion in the calculation of energy efficiency  equipment maintenance and repair activities.  4.2.2.3.2  Recover waste and reduce raw  material consumption Commitment Residual waste is what is left once all recovery and processing phases  have been completed. Veolia applies the hierarchical principle of  waste management: it makes every effort to prevent waste  production, seeks new reuse, recycling and recovery possibilities and,  when none is possible, processes any waste produced according to the  applicable regulations. Veolia is firmly committed to the recovery chain, particularly by  developing methods for recovering materials from the waste it is  given for processing (see Section 4.2.2.3.2.1 below) and the by-products  of its other activities (see Section 4.2.2.3.2.2 below). It thus helps third  parties to reduce their consumption of raw materials by making  secondary raw materials available to them. Veolia also seeks to reduce the raw material consumption of the  installations it operates (see Section 4.2.2.3.2.2 below)  4.2.2.3.2.1  Recover customer waste Challenges and approach In 2023, Veolia collected 34.3 million metric tons of waste and  processed 62.6 million metric tons. The Group is responsible for developing innovative and efficient waste  management technologies and solutions that enable waste recovery  (selective collection, material and/or energy recovery) with the aim of  offering these technologies and solutions to its industrial customers  and public authorities, which make the final implementation decision.

The increase in 2023 was due to the start-up of new waste-to-energy  facilities. In the 2020-2023 Environmental Plan, Veolia refined the method for  calculating energy recovery from waste at landfill sites (methane  capture for injection into the network or transformation into heat or  electricity), making it more restrictive. Based on the 2019 scope, the  new objectives are a materials recovery rate of 20% and an energy  recovery rate of 30%.  Over and above the performance of Veolia’s recovery activities, these  indicators especially reflect the type of contracts signed with its  customers: with or without recovery. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Environmental performance 212 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 (1) Circular economy revenue is the revenue of entities that generate over 50% of their revenue from the following activities: the selective collection and recovery of hazardous solid and  liquid waste, by-products and sludge, water reuse, energy performance contracts, heating, steam and cooling network operations using over 50% non-fossil energy, cogeneration, and  multi-activity industrial service contracts.  ===== PAGE 215 ===== To further increase waste recovery at sorting facilities, Veolia conducts  Research and Innovation projects to: ■optimize sorting: development of innovative technologies such as  remotely operated sorting (refined sorting using touch screens)  and sorting using artificial intelligence (Portik: automatic object  recognition); ■search for recycling solutions for complex waste derived from new  technology: electric batteries, electronic equipment, plastics or  solar panels; ■produce so-called “refused-derived fuels” (RDF), an alternative fuel  for cement plants and electricity and/or heat production facilities; ■improve our chemical recycling procedures in South Korea. Innovating to recover new types of waste Veolia develops specific recycling technologies for new types of  products, such as solar panels at the end of their useful life, a  market expected to reach millions of metric tons by 2050. In 2020, GE Renewable Energy signed an agreement with Veolia  to recycle its onshore wind turbine blades in the United States.  This recycling contract, the first of its kind in the U.S. wind  turbine industry, turns the blades into a raw material for use in  cement manufacturing. Veolia uses a co-processing solution that  has already proven its effectiveness in Europe: the blades –  mainly composed of fiberglass – are shredded and the material  obtained is then used in kilns to replace the coal, sand and clay  needed to make cement. More than 90% of the material is  reused: 65% as raw material in the cement plants, and 28%  transformed into energy required for the chemical reaction in  the kiln. This solution, which can be rapidly deployed at scale,  increases the environmental benefits of the wind industry. 2023 confirmed Veolia’s major role in the development of  sustainable agriculture Through its specialized subsidiaries, Veolia is the leading  producer of organic fertilizers and soil improvers in France (over  one million metric tons). Derived from the circular economy (bio- waste, sludge, by-products from the food industries), these  fertilizers are seen as one of the solutions for a sustainable food  model. Agricultural demand for this type of fertilizer has increased  significantly and Veolia, in particular through its subsidiary SEDE,  recorded very good results in 2023.  More generally, Veolia confirms its role as a link between cities  and fields: its offer is designed to recover municipal waste for  use in fields to ultimately provide food. But that is not all. 2023  also confirms Veolia’s major role in addressing decarbonization  issues. Veolia contributes through its subsidiary SEDE to this  circularity within the territories with a complete agricultural  anaerobic digestion solution covering the supply to facilities by  returning the digestate to the soil and site restoration.  Household bio-waste, whether transformed into organic  amendments on our composting platforms or recovered through  anaerobic digestion, will enable Veolia to confirm its role as a key  partner in the farming world. This role consists in supporting the  ecological transformation of agriculture while helping it to  address the dual challenge of food supply and decarbonization. Research into recycling phosphorous used as  agricultural  fertilizer For numerous years, Veolia has worked to develop methods of  remove pollution and recover and recycle the nutrients  contained in wastewater, in partnership with academic teams,  and institutional and industrial players in Europe.  The phosphorous used in agriculture (key fertilizer nutrient) and  animal feed is primarily produced by mining, but this resource is  limited.  Although phosphorus recovery has yet become an economic  reality, it is nevertheless being increasingly discussed and new  legislation in various countries, and even across Europe, is being  studied to promote it. To help reduce environmental impacts and meet future  directives on phosphorus recycling from wastewater, Veolia first  developed the Struvia™ solution for phosphorus recovery from  concentrated aqueous effluents, such as digester centrates,  which paves the way for phosphorus recycling in Europe.  New developments in the works also involve the recovery of  phosphorous from sludge and ash from incinerated sewage  sludge to achieve recovery rates of over 80% in order to meet  regulations currently  implemented in Germany in particular. 4.2.2.3.2.2  Recover residual waste and limit  the production of final waste Challenges and approach The Group generates final waste, and primarily: ■residual waste from incineration (bottom ash and refiom, residues  from the purification of incineration fumes from household waste)  and waste sorting and recycling (sorting refusals) in the Waste  business; ■combustion waste (bottom ash and fly ash) in the Energy business; ■sludge from municipal wastewater treatment in the Water  business. Across its entire business, Veolia proposes solutions to its customers  to reduce final waste production.

(2) Since 2019, this indicator includes waste recovered as energy (biogas). The 2027 new objectives are described in Section 4.2.1.5. 2024-2027  Environmental Plan above. Limit and recover waste incineration residues The recovery of bottom ash, the noncombustible solid residue  produced by incineration, is regulated according to its source. After a  period of maturation and depending on its composition, it may be  recovered as road construction material. In quantity terms, it accounts  for roughly 17% of incinerated non-hazardous waste. Veolia is contractually responsible for managing 53% of the bottom  ash produced by the incinerators that it operates, equivalent to  around 1.1 million metric tons; 91.4% of this was recovered in 2023. The  recovery is subject to the launch of road construction or rehabilitation  projects.  When bottom ash cannot be recovered, it is stored at a landfill site for  household and similar waste. Flue gas treatment residues are stabilized and then stored in landfills  for residual hazardous waste. In quantity terms, it accounts for  roughly 3% of incinerated non-hazardous waste. Limit and recover thermal energy plant combustion waste The combustion of solid fuels (coal, lignite and biomass) produces ash:  solid residue known as bottom ash and fly ash. Fly ash is captured by  dust removal equipment to ensure that only a tiny amount of dust  goes into the atmosphere. Veolia is committed to: ■limiting the production of combustion waste by improving  combustion techniques; ■treating or recovering waste in accordance with local regulations. Recover sludge from wastewater treatment Wastewater treatment produces sludge, which is a concentrate of the  organic and mineral material previously contained in the water. With population growth and increasingly sophisticated wastewater  treatment systems, public authorities and industrial companies are  faced with growing sludge volumes. Veolia’s challenge is to transform  this sludge to reduce the related management costs and recover it: ■as products that can be used in agriculture (spreading and  composting) when the quality of the sludge and the availability of  suitable land permits (40% in 2023), or industry; ■as energy (34% in 2023): anaerobic digestion, use as a replacement  fuel, incineration with energy recovery. Veolia promotes sludge recovery solutions. The Group ensures that the  quality of the sludge is always appropriate for the customer’s  intended use.

Their  consumption is monitored internally, and the related greenhouse gas  emissions are included in the Group’s scope  3 emissions (see  Section 4.2.3.3.1 below). Approach The Group optimizes raw material consumption and efficiency of use: ■at an economic level: through a cost-saving plan; ■at an environmental level: through reduction objectives for Group  greenhouse gas emissions. In the Water business, several solutions optimize the consumption of  materials: ■Hubgrade Performance, a Veolia digital solution, continually  optimizes the consumption of energy and chemicals in wastewater  treatment plants, with savings of up to 50% for chemicals; ■Centaurus, a Veolia digital solution, is a digital resource designed  for experts to create and model efficient and low-energy plants; ■Anitamox processes for reduce energy consumed on site and the  consumption of chemical reagents (processes under development  and in operation at 35 sites). 4.2.3 COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE 4.2.3.1  Risks and opportunities Climate change creates different types of risks and opportunities on  several levels. Climate change leads to physical risks to which Veolia  and its customers must adapt, and the necessary transition towards a  low-carbon economy engenders transition risks. These dynamics also  bring significant commercial opportunities for the Group. One of  Veolia’s businesses is to help customers reduce their carbon footprint,  which could lead Veolia to record greenhouse gas emitting activities in  its carbon assessment in order to decarbonize them. By anticipating  physical climate impacts on its services through adaptation measures,  Veolia also boosts the resilience of its clients and the regions where  the Group operates. These two risk categories can have a negative impact on the Company,  due to: ■the consequences relating to an increase in the frequency and  severity of acute natural events (acute risks) or progressive and  unfavorable changes in climate conditions (chronic risks), notably  for the Water and Energy businesses; ■changes in regulations, in particular on energy production and the  CO2 allowances markets, which also illustrate the negative impact  of transition risks on the Group’s business model. Details of these various risks are presented in Chapter 1, Section 1.3.2  above Factors that could influence the Group’s business line and in  Chapter 2, Section 2.2.2.1 above Risks relating to climate change and  natural disasters, and Section 2.2.2.4 above Risks relating to regulatory  changes, particularly in the area of health or the environment. In order to help combat climate change, Veolia is committed to  implementing solutions to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) and limit  climate change, both for itself and its customers (see Section 4.2.3.2  below).

This commitment can be broken down into several objectives,  including combating climate change. To illustrate this objective, the  Group defined two 2023 targets, one to reduce GHG emissions, the  other to increase avoided GHG emissions. As part of its new GreenUp strategic program for the period  2024-2027, Veolia reaffirms its commitment by embarking on a 1.5°C  aligned decarbonization path and strengthening its decarbonization  levers until 2032, particularly regarding the phase-out of coal for  energy activities and methane capture in non-recyclable waste  landfills.

The 2023 EF IEA updated in the Global Report reporting tool in 2023 shows a value of 14.2 million metric  tons of CO2 eq in 2023. Veolia agrees with the conclusions of the summary of the sixth  Assessment Report published by the IPCC in March 2023 which  emphasize the increase in the frequency and intensity of climate  change, and reiterate the urgency of reducing emissions rapidly and  significantly to limit warming to 1.5 °C. This sixth report also shed light  on the necessary coordination and coherence between GHG reduction  trajectories and plans to adapt to the effects of climate change.   The Group contributes fully to the carbon neutral approach of sites  under its operational responsibility. This approach is based around  four complementary lines of action: Line no. 1: Reduce the Group’s GHG emissions based on measuring and  reporting scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions (see Section 4.2.3.3.1 below). Veolia’s responsibility is divided between: ■its directly owned production assets, such as investment to  eliminate coal in Europe by 2030, estimated at €1.65 billion; (€529  million had already been invested at the end of 2023) and  investment to capture methane at non-hazardous waste facilities  (plan being stepped-up); ■activities and services for which the Group exercises operational  control (particularly it is able to decide on the choice of energy mix,  investments); ■and in the value chain, depending on the Group’s sphere of  influence. In 2019, Veolia committed to a 22% reduction in its greenhouse gas  emissions (scopes 1 and 2) over 15 years, that is by 2034, compared with  the operational scope of the 2018 baseline year 5.This objective is  compatible with Paris Agreement ambitions (below 2°C trajectory) and  was validated by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTii) (6). In September 2021, Veolia signed the Business Ambition for 1.5°C of the  Science based targets initiative and joined the UNFCCC Race to Zero.  In accordance with this commitment, the Group submitted its  validation file to the SBTi in December 2023. To achieve Net Zero in  2050, the Group has stepped up its decarbonization approach by  undertaking to reduce by 2032 its 1 and 2 scope emissions by 50% and  its scope 3 emissions by 30% (7) compared to 2021 (8). The Group also  aims to reduce all its scopes (1, 2 and 3) by 90% by 2050.These new  reduction targets will should be validated by the SBTi in the first half  of 2024 and the result will be communicated in the second half of  2024.

In 2019, the Group defined a €1.274 billion investment program  (reassessed in 2023 at €1,65 billion) to transform its coal-fired plants in  Europe by 2030. This objective is on track. The year 2023 was marked  by the commissioning of new facilities in Braunschweig, Germany and  in Prerov and Kolin in the Czech Republic, rendering GHG reductions  effective. Investments primarily focused on facilities in Poland and the  Czech Republic which should be coal-free by the end of 2024. The average methane capture rate (at constant scope) at landfill sites  is 58.5% in 2023 (and over 85% in Europe). The initial effects of the  landfill site capture plan in Latin America (€70 million of planned  investment should increase the capture rate from 40% to 70% in this  zone by 2026). Other investment programs are being studied for  facilities in Asia and Australia. In addition, other short-term reduction levers are being rolled out:  energy efficiency in water pumping, use of renewable energy and  especially solar energy for own-consumption at our sites, industrial  heat recovery and heat recovery in water networks, cold recovery at  methane terminals, electric vehicles (utility vehicles and waste  collection). As part of its GreenUp 2024-2027 strategic program, Veolia adopted the following objectives and targets: Commitment Objective ODD Indicator – definition 2023  baseline 2027  target Combat pollution and  accelerate the ecological  transformation Decarbonation -  emissions  reductions Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions  reduction -5% vs 2021  (33.6 Mt vs  35.5 Mt) -18% vs  2021 (29 Mt  vs 35.5 Mt) Sponsor Claude Laruelle Member of the Executive Committee, Deputy Chief Executive  Officer Finance, Digital and Purchasing Combat pollution and  accelerate the ecological  transformation Decarbonation -  transformation  of installations Decarbonation Capex, including the  phase-out of coal and methane  capture (2024-2027 aggregate) n/a 600 M€ Sponsor Philippe Guitard Member of the Executive Committee, Senior Executive Vice  President, Central and Eastern Europe region Line no. 2: develop solutions to help its customers to avoid emissions, through the generalization of the circular economy and the recovery of  unavoidable energy.

The 2023 EF IEA updated in the Global Report reporting tool in 2023 shows a value of 14.2 million metric  tons of CO2 eq. in 2023. Through its activities, Veolia enables its customers and third parties to  reduce their emissions compared to a more carbon-intensive  benchmark. These avoided emissions largely concern energy recovery  and waste recycling, the production of renewable energy and low  carbon, as well as biogas capture at non-hazardous waste landfills Avoided emissions increased by around 10% between 2022 and 2023,  from 14.1 to 15.5 million metric tons of CO2 eq. This increase was mainly  due to the expanded scope for the biogas sequestration indicator of  around 886 kt. Also of note are the significant contributions of the  Istanbul incinerator in Turkey (248 kt) and the Madrid sorting facility  in Spain (188 kt).. In 2023, the Group continued to analyze its methodology with regard  to the emerging standard, Guidance on avoided emissions, drawn up  jointly by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development  (WBCSD) and the Carbone 4 Net Zero Initiative (NZI) as well as the  sector work of the Record association on waste recycling and recovery.  This work will extend the indicator’s scope to new cases and update  the methodology for energy production under the 2024-2027 strategic  program. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Environmental performance 218 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 221 ===== As part of its GreenUp 2024-2027 strategic program, Veolia adopted the following objectives and targets: Commitment Objective SDG Indicator – definition 2023  baseline 2027  target Combat pollution and  accelerate the ecological  transformation Decarbonizati on of our  customers -  Scope 4 Erased GHG emissions (new  methodology) 13.8 Mt ≥18 Mt Sponsor Christophe Maquet Member of the Executive Committee and Senior Executive Vice  President for the Asia-Pacific region Line no. 3: CO2 sequestration To neutralize its residual emissions (those which cannot be avoided or  reduced) by 2050, the Group is developing CO2 sequestration  solutions (technological or natural), implemented within or outside its  value chain.  The Group plans to develop demonstrators to test different carbon  sequestration processes, in particular at a household and special  waste incineration site in France. The Group is also studying the  feasibility of storing CO2 at the Marchwood energy recovery plant in  the United Kingdom. Finally, the Group is also exploring different  ways of recoveringCO2, such as direct use in horticulture or industry  and conversion into methanol or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). In addition, in 2023, the Group began working on innovative  sequestration solutions aimed at sustainably storing CO2 in soils while  improving their fertility. Among these solutions is Biochar, a material  produced from biomass pyrolysis or thermolysis or high temperature  sewage sludge; or enhanced rock weathering, whose objective is to  spread basaltic rocks / crushed silicates on land to generate a chemical  reaction with rainwater loaded with CO2 Line no. 4: voluntarily offset GHG emissions Voluntary carbon contribution is by definition optional. It does not  contribute to a company’s Net Zero trajectory but is nevertheless a  way of contributing to global carbon neutrality on a worldwide level,  which is encouraged. Given the main drivers for reducing our direct  emissions and for the investment capacities at our disposal, the Group  is not making voluntary carbon contribution a priority. Nevertheless,  the Group has participated in the development of the French Low- Carbon Label through I4CE (Institut de l’économie pour le climat), and  is voluntarily contributing carbon from some of its contracts at the  request of its customers (for example, the SEDIF carbon neutral water  contract in France with 4.6 million users). The Group is also involved in  market mechanisms allowing it to generate carbon credits,  particularly for its landfill sites in Latin America and Australia, which  offer other players the opportunity to make voluntary carbon  contributions. 4.2.3.2.2  Emission pathways and climate  scenarios Since 2020, Veolia has used scenario-based analysis tools applied to  climate change issues. The scenario analysis used enabled us to  estimate the risks and opportunities associated with both the selected  physical risks and the risks of transitioning to a low-carbon economy.  As the Group already has the tools to analyze the natural risks and  indicators associated with the main physical risks identified (water  stress and flooding)  9, the study made it possible to estimate their  impact on the Group’s risk map in the short, medium and long term,  as well as to financially quantify these risks (see Chapter 2, Section  2.2.2.1 above Risks related to climate change and natural disasters).  The choice of transition scenarios included the recovery plans rolled  out after the first Covid pandemic wave in the countries where the  Group operates: these plans provided a considerable portion of the  financing for low-carbon transition activities, in Europe and Asia. The internal steering committee, chaired by the Executive Committee  Climate sponsor, and comprising the strategy and innovation  directors, the sustainable development director, and the directors of  the main BUs, selected around fifteen business opportunities and  around ten risks that were included in the strategic planning review. Furthermore, Veolia helped develop pragmatic tools to implement this  TCFD  recommendation 10  and,  more  recently,  the  European  Commission’s nonrestrictive non-financial reporting directives on the  use of climate scenarios. Veolia co-steered the AFEP study, “Guiding  companies to build their energy & climate scenarios” and participated  in the EFRAG European Lab Project Task Force (PTF) on climate-related  reporting, to identify best practice and particularly the use of climate  scenarios. Transition scenarios The 15-year GHG emission reduction targets for Veolia’s operational  scope were validated by the Science Based Targets initiative as  compatible with the Paris climate agreement objectives.

(10) The TCFD (Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures), set up by the G20’s Financial Stability Board (FSB), issued recommendations in 2017 on company transparency on  climate-related issues to enable investment stakeholders to promote reductions in GHG emissions and adaptation measures. These were adopted as nonrestrictive guidelines by the  European Commission in June 2019.  ===== PAGE 222 ===== Veolia – a responsible player in energy transition: towards  thermal coal substitution Veolia’s coal activities amounted to 2.9% of its revenue and 31%  of direct emissions of activities under the Group’s operational  control in 2017. Veolia has decided to take a position regarding  coal-fueled heat and electricity production. In 2018, the Board of Directors adopted a thermal coal  substitution plan. Veolia undertook not to develop or acquire  new activities using coal, except activities specifically aiming to  replace coal with energies producing fewer greenhouse gas  emissions. Rather than passing on the responsibility through  divestiture, the Group is committed to converting existing  business activities to totally remove the CO2 impact of using coal  by combining several drivers: improving energy performance by  increasing thermal plants and networks efficiency and  implementing  energy  efficiency  solutions,  as  well  as  replacement of coal, either with alternative fuels (waste,  biomass, gas) or by using recovered waste heat. This  commitment is monitored annually by the Board of Directors’  Research, Innovation and Sustainable Development Committee. In its 2024-2027 Environmental Plan, Veolia set a target of €600  million in additional investments for the conversion of coal-fired  power plants in Europe by 2030, at sites where Veolia controls  investment. (€529 million had already been invested at the end  of 2023) and for investment to capture methane at non- hazardous waste facilities (plan being stepped up). As early as September  2014, Veolia advocated for a robust and  predictable carbon price by signing the statement issued by the World  Bank. In April 2015, the Group showed its commitment by supporting  the World Economic Forum’s CEO climate leaders’ initiative. In  May 2015, Veolia Environnement signed the Global Compact Business  Leadership Criteria, the Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition and that  of the AFEP-MEDEF. Its Chairman and CEO advocates a carbon fee  which would tax greenhouse gas pollution and redistribute these  funds directly to mitigation projects. As part of its 2050 Net Zero  roadmap,the Group will set upCO2budgetsadaptedto each zone in  2024.These budgets are prepared using a process that draws on  budgetary procedures taking into account business sectors,growth  targets and local CO2 regulations. Contributing to carbon neutral regions Veolia contributes actively to reducing GHG emissions in the  regions and countries where it operates. In 2018 and 2019, Veolia took part in the Net Zero Emissions  2050  study (“ZEN 2050”) study supported by Entreprises Pour  l’Environnement (EPE), the contribution of a multi-sector  business group to the discussion on the National Low Carbon  Strategy (SNBC) in France. Together with Imperial College of London, Veolia contributed to  the study “An exploration of the resource sector’s greenhouse  gas emissions in the UK, and its potential to reduce the carbon  shortfall in the UK 4 th and 5 th carbon budgets''. 11 The Group advocates for a scientific accounting of greenhouse gas  (GHG) emissions. The leading scientific body, CITEPA, verified the  compliance of the GreenPath tool developed by Veolia to measure the  carbon footprint of contracts and offerings (see Section  4.2.1.6) with  the GHG Protocol Carbon Footprint® and ISO standards. In 2019, Veolia  also began drafting “Preliminary guidance on accounting for avoided  emissions in the waste management and recycling sector”, benefiting  from European funding 12 and presented this work to European  federations for a project of this scale. Veolia also participated in the  ISO Committee on Carbon Neutrality. The Group is also committed to promoting low-carbon solutions  enabling avoided emissions and participates in the recycled plastic  material ECO-PROFILs produced by the French Plastics Recyclers  professional body (Syndicat national des Régénérateurs de matières  Plastiques, SRP). In 2021, SRP provided its customers with certificates  representing a potential saving of 1  million metric tons of CO2  equivalent. Adaptation scenarios Furthermore, in its strategic thinking, Veolia takes into account the  physical implications of the warming scenarios approved by the IPCC.  In 2022, the Group therefore furthered its adaptation process,  initiating analyses of its activities’ exposure and vulnerability based on  an updated global warming scenario of 4°C by 2100 (SSP5-RCP8.5). This  work increased understanding of climate change consequences on  Veolia’s various activities and the impacts on the infrastructures  operated on behalf of its customers. The teams are therefore able to  integrate adaptation measures into the services they offer,  guaranteeing continuity of service and contributing to the resilience  of both the Group and its customers. This work was continued and  extended in 2023 to provide Veolia with two complementary tools  designed to generally assess the exposure and vulnerability of its  activities by: ■performing a climate exposure analysis at around 2,000 sites  operated worldwide by Veolia, taking into account a RCP8.5  scenario and regional climate models for 2030 and 2050. The  physical hazards considered cover chronic (rising average  temperatures, rising sea levels, change in precipitation regime) and  extreme (drought, floods, heatwaves and cold spells) phenomena  and the study’s scope also includes all Veolia businesses. The Group  is working on this basis using a list of priority countries and sites  with regard to climate change adaptation. ■building benchmark vulnerability profiles per activity based on  pilot studies initiated in 2022. The business scope of these studies  is being extended to cover all Group activities. This work, in line with the expected regulatory changes (13) and the  emergence of good practices on the assessment of physical risks,  supplements the water stress and flood risk indicators previously  incorporated into the 2020-2023 Environmental Plan.

In 2023, the Group decided to adopt a new approach taking into account climate changes in line with emerging good practices that require a  prospective analysis (CSRD and European Taxonomy). This approach stems from the analysis of the developed impacts of climate change. In 2023, the climate exposure analysis of around 2,000 sites operated by Veolia replaced the flood risk analyses and plans. The exposure survey is  based on projections from regional climate models (Cordex) using the Rx5day indicator (15). Helping territories adapt to climate change Veolia supports regional development and contributes to  regional resilience by offering solutions for adapting to (1)  climate change and, more broadly, (2) the stresses and shocks the  territories may experience. The services proposed by the Group to  its customers notably cover: ■the optimized management of the large water cycle; ■water recycling and the reuse of wastewater to reduce pressure  on resources and conflicting usages; ■sobriety and communication with citizens to encourage more  virtuous consumption behavior; ■control of urban wastewater systems in rainy weather to limit  flooding risk and health and biodiversity impacts on waterways  and beaches; ■limiting urban heat islands; ■inclusion of extreme events in the design of plants for our  customers to ensure the protection of property and the supply  of essential services (water purification, distribution and  treatment); ■crisis management and continuity plans for essential services  (water, energy, waste management, etc.) in the case of  extreme events. In this respect, Veolia has developed many references,  particularly  in  the  water  production  and  management  businesses:  ■the Group has therefore developed many anticipation and crisis  management projects around the large water cycle which also  promote biodiversity protection (Aguas de Galicia, Guadalquivir  in Spain) and has several references for underground and  surface resource management for use optimization; ■through its Aquatec entity in Spain, Veolia proposes a multi- risk assessment and warning system (wind, fire, snow,  flooding, etc.), as well as support with defining measures and  emergency protocols to help local authorities draft action  plans; ■in Chile, the Aguas Andinas subsidiary has rolled out a climate  change adaptation investment plan to deal with drought,  turbidity and the aging and degradation of infrastructure.  Actions undertaken include, for example, in 2016, the  construction of water surface storage solutions enabling the  city of Santiago to increase its water autonomy. Several  citizen communication and awareness-raising campaigns  supplement this system. In addition, the Group also proposes risk identification and  planning services, aimed at protecting resources and improving  the resilience of infrastructure and public services, notably  through its consulting division, Seureca and Aquatec: ■as part of the 100 Resilient Cities initiative for which Veolia is a  strategic partner, in 2016 the Group supported New Orleans in  the deployment of its resilience strategy through a pilot project  in partnership with the insurance company SwissRe. The project  led to a detailed assessment of the exposure of the city’s water  infrastructure, including water, wastewater and drainage  systems, to physical climate risks (mainly flooding and  hurricanes); ■similarly,  Veolia  also  worked  with  the  Milwaukee  Metropolitan Sewerage District to help define a resilience  strategy for the Milwaukee region (USA). The plan, published  in 2019, is based on an analysis of regional risks and  challenges  ranked  during  workshops  with  regional  stakeholders. The strategic framework provides operational  recommendations covering the environment, economy and  infrastructure, aimed at making the region stronger and more  resilient; ■since 2020, Veolia also participates in the European project,  RESCCUE, deployed in Bristol, Barcelona and Lisbon; in this  context, the Group supports the roll-out of a methodology  toolbox to analyze urban resilience using a multi-risk  approach, to help cities improve their capacity to anticipate,  prepare for and respond to climate crises;     ■Veolia is involved in the EU project, LIFE BAETULO, focusing on  the municipality of Badalona (Spain). The Group’s Aquatech  subsidiary helped create an early warning system designed to  anticipate climate impacts on the municipal rainwater  treatment and management network; Finally, actions undertaken by the Group to control its own  exposure to future climate physical risks strengthen its role as a  privileged partner of territories for the preparation of their  trajectories and adaptation plans. By way of example, in 2023, teams developed a new offer  entitled Greenpath Résilience which breaks down into five types  of complementary solution: understand, optimize, adapt,  transform and establish a strategy for the long term. This flexible  offer is designed to target issues such as drought, pollution and  flooding by boosting service resilience, resource protection, city  habitability and circularity for self-sufficiency.

The Board of Directors approves the Group’s  strategy and makes decisions which commit the Group, such as the  replacement of coal at heat production facilities in the medium- to  long-term. It monitors the Company’s performance through the  “Combating climate change” multifaceted performance indicators  (see Chapter 1, Section 1.2.1.7).  The results of climate commitments to  reduce Group GHG emissions are presented annually to its Research,  Innovation and Sustainable Development Committee. It is also  regularly informed of Veolia’s climate change adaptation initiatives.  Regarding the management of the associated climate risks, the  Group’s risk map in which they are incorporated is reviewed annually  by the Audit Committee. At Executive Committee level, the Deputy Chief Executive Officer  Finance, Digital and Purchasing, Claude Laruelle, sponsor of the  climate mitigation commitment, presents the Group results on its  mitigation policy and submits proposals for associated action plans.  The environmental indicators chosen to calculate the variable  compensation of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and  members of the Executive Committee are also part of the Group’s  climate commitments (See Chapter 3, Section 3.4 below). The sponsor for climate change adaptation on the Group Executive  Committee is Sébastien Daziano, Senior Executive Vice President,  Strategy and Innovation. As of 2023, Jean-François Nogrette, Senior  Executive Vice President, France and Special Waste Europe, was also  the sponsor for the climate change exposure risk of our activities  under the risk management plan drawn up using the 2023 mapping.  The Strategy Department is responsible for coordinating actions linked  to Group commitments to mitigating climate change. The  corresponding environmental performance indicators are included in  the Group’s Environmental and Industrial Management System. In parallel, the Climate Change Adaptation team in the Multifaceted  Performance and Sustainable Development Department coordinates  climate change adaptation and physical climate risk management  work in conjunction with the Risk & Insurance department. Progress is  presented and validated by the prevention committee, in charge of  monitoring such risks and the related action plans. It comprises  2twoExecutive Committee members, the Chief Financial Officer and  the General Counsel as well as the Chief Risk and Insurance Officer  and the director of the Business Support & Performance department. At an operational level, each Business Unit Director is responsible for  breaking down the Group strategy into business opportunities and  risks inherent to their business lines and region. Climate risk is  identified as one of the main risks of the Group (see Chapter  2,  Section  2.2.1.1 above) and the Non-Financial Performance Statement  (see Section 4.7 below). Active participation in climate change conferences and  alliances Veolia participates in the international conference of the United  Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).  Since COP21, the Group has worked to play a part in these  conferences and contribute to debates on mitigating and  adapting to climate change. . At the COP28 in Dubai in 2023,  Veolia participated in several events, in particular the UNFCCC  Business & Philanthropy Climate Forum as well as a roundtable  on accelerating the phase-out of coal organized by the French  President, during which Estelle Brachlianoff presented the  Group’s ambition to accelerate ecological transformation.

The majority of our emissions, especially in the energy and waste recycling sectors, also help decarbonize our  customers. The rest of our emissions correspond to services essential to human activities, particularly in the drinking water, sanitation and waste  treatment sectors. Furthermore, most emissions are generated by sites over which Veolia has complete control as owner and operator. For the  remaining emissions, it is important to note that Veolia intervenes without full control over any decisions.

In 2023, scope 1 emissions remained stable after by 6.4% increase in  2022 due to the integration of Suez, partially offset by a reduction in  energy consumption linked to the energy crisis.  The main scope 2 emissions are linked to drinking water production  services and processing wastewater which requires the purchase of  electricity for transport and water treatment. A significant portion of  this business activity is in France, but also in countries where the  energy mix is still coal-heavy, such as China or the Czech Republic. In  the energy business, only the physical losses of heat and electricity  distribution networks operated by Veolia are accounted for in scope 2,  in accordance with the GHG Protocol. The 14% increase in scope 2 emissions between 2022 and 2023 is  mainly due to the integration of the Tashkent contract in Uzbekistan. Veolia recognizes biogenic carbon emissions, primarily linked to the  combustion of biomass for energy production and the biogenic  portion of domestic waste and refused derived fuels incinerated. They  amounted to 13.2 million tons of CO2 eq. in 2023 (12 in 2022, 11.2 in 2021  12 in 2020 and 10.6 in 2019).

Veolia applies the approach which reflects its business as an operator: GHG emissions fully consolidated for  the activities in the operational control scope, even if the assets are not fully owned by the Group.  ===== PAGE 227 ===== As part of its 2050 Net Zero roadmap, Veolia is committed to reducing  its scope 3 emissions by 30% (19) by 2032. Thanks to the work carried out  since 2021, Veolia now has a sufficiently reliable and comprehensive  view of its emissions.

Change in total scope 3 emissions: Scope 3 emissions increased by 4.9% between 2022 and 2023. This was  mainly due to a more comprehensive consideration of purchases from  Suez entities and the integration of WTS into item 3.1; as well as the  inclusion of secondary raw material trading and a better assessment  of the collection of sorted materials in item 3.10. Methodological alignment with the GHG Protocol and categorization: In 2023, work also continued on the methodology for calculating scope  3, in particular to improve the type and detail of the data relating to  certain emission items. The recategorization of certain emissions  accounts for most of the changes observed in items 3.3, 3.11 and 3.12 as  explained below. Category 3.1 “Purchased goods and services” includes new emissions  calculated using physical data (volume of raw materials) relating to  the production of membranes and chemicals by the industry entity  WTS. Category 3.12 “End-of-life treatment of products sold” now includes  emissions relating to the end-of-life treatment of sold membranes. Previously, this item calculated emissions generated by the end-of-life  treatment of waste collected and subcontracted to third parties, based  on tonnages collected by the Group, without making any distinction  between outlets (internal or external), resulting in double counting  with the Group’s scope 1 emissions. Data on waste tonnages collected  was collected in greater detail to consider only tonnages  subcontracted to third parties. The calculated emissions were  transferred from item 3.12 to item 3.1 “Purchased goods and services”  to ensure consistency between scope 3 categories. Category 3.3 “Fuel-and-energy-related activities not included in scope 1  & 2 – emissions relating to electricity consumption not included in  scope  1 &   2” was also improved, with the removal of emissions  relating to on-site self-production, already accounted for in scope 3.2  “Fixed assets” and scope 1. Furthermore, to ensure alignment with the GHG Protocol, emissions  relating to energy distribution activities were also transferred: • emissions relating to the distribution of heat and electricity  (upstream of included fuels) are accounted for in category 3.3  (formerly accounted for in category 3.11) • Those relating to the distribution of gas (upstream of included  fuels) remain accounted for in category 3.11 Use of products sold. Category 3.10 “Transformation of products sold” previously included  emissions relating to secondary raw materials marketed by Veolia and  converted by manufacturers. In 2023, it included additional emissions  due to an extension in the scope of activities considered to take into  account additional tonnages (in particular those from pre-sorted  tonnages linked to trading activities). Scope 3 decarbonization levers: Reduction drivers were also analyzed extensively in 2023 to build the  Group’s reduction path. Operational efficiency, renewable energy production, use of low- carbon fuels (energy production or vehicles), additional sorting  upstream of final treatments, development of the circular economy  (such as the development of an internal platform for resale and  leasing of used equipment) are all action levers that will contribute to  reducing the Group’s scope 3 emissions. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Environmental performance VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 225 (19) The coverage rate of our scope 3 emissions is 75.3%, the minimum required by the SBTi being 67%.  ===== PAGE 228 ===== Other measures are in place to decarbonize the Group’s value chain,  such as the supplier commitment strategy (see Section 4.3.2.3.4 below);  this will enable the Group to obtain a carbon footprint of the products  and services it purchases in order to develop the Group’s procurement  policy and ensure that its performance is reflected in its emission  calculations. A customer commitment approach is also being  developed based on the same model as that for suppliers to help  decarbonize their processes. Digital development and digital sobriety Veolia’s digital strategy includes the digital sobriety approach aimed at reducing the information system’s environmental impact, in the  technical (infrastructure, architecture and tools) and behavioral (movement of persons, use of premises and IT tool usage) sections. Veolia has largely outsourced the management of its infrastructure: the data centers are now operated by suppliers committed to a carbon  neutral approach. The computer pool is being replaced by internet terminals. The carbon footprint of replacing the Group’s IT pool and software suite at its  headquarters enabled a 52% reduction in GHG emissions. With regards to architecture and tools, the solutions adopted aim to limit the volume of data processed and stored by using high-performance  collaborative platforms and opt for SaaS applications using virtuous infrastructure. Following the set-up of a partial working from home arrangement, the office space allocated to teams was reduced by 30% at headquarters  level. This approach was also adopted in the Business Units. Finally, an awareness-raising program “One for all”, covering the impact of individual digital use is being rolled out to managers, young  employees and apprentices in the IT departments. 300 people in the Group IT department were trained in 2020. This awareness-raising program  has also been rolled out in the Business Units since 2021. To expand our knowledge of digital sobriety, Veolia participates in the “digital sobriety” working group, alongside the Club Informatique des  Grandes Entreprises Françaises (CIGREF) and the Shift Project. Veolia also uses its reference position on environmental issues to collect precise information or even influence the carbon strategy of leading  global IT service providers. 4.2.3.3.2  Contribute to reducing and avoiding GHG emissions Approach A committed player, the Group provides solutions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions: ■by reducing emissions from the services and processes sold and facilities managed (diagnosis and environmental footprint, greater energy  efficiency, use of renewable energies, destruction of methane arising from landfills); ■by enabling third parties to avoid emissions through its activities (mainly by supplying energy and materials extracted from the recovery of  waste and wastewater). The measures implemented to reduce and prevent GHG emissions, for each business line, are as follows: Business line/Type  Measures implemented  ENERGY Reduction of GHG emissions • Proper use of energy transformation facilities (energy efficiency) resulting in less fuel consumed for the same  energy output. • Recovery of waste energy for a plant to reinject it directly or for use in consumer system heating pumps. This  can be recovered on site or close-by via a heating network. • Use of renewable and recovered energy instead of fossil fuels whenever possible (biomass, solid recovered fuel,  geothermal, solar, wind, etc.). • Optimum supply of energy services (integrated energy management) encouraging a more rational use of  energy by consumers. • Combined production of heat and electricity (cogeneration).  WASTE Reduction of GHG emissions • Collection and treatment of biogas from landfill sites. • On-site consumption of heat and electricity produced from waste incineration and biogas recovery. • Other actions enabling the reduction of fuel and energy consumption. Avoided GHG emissions • Sale of energy produced from waste incineration and biogas recovery at landfill sites and from anaerobic  digesters. • Recovery through direct use of biogas produced at landfill sites and from anaerobic digesters. • Recycling of raw materials contained in waste. • Production of alternative fuels from waste.  WATER Reduction of GHG emissions • Optimization of energy consumption by the facilities. • On-site consumption of heat and electricity produced from renewable sources (biogas from sludge digestion,  recovering potential water energy using hydraulic micro-turbines, heat pumps, etc.). Avoided GHG emissions • Sale of energy produced using renewable energy sources (biogas from sludge digestion, recovering the  potential energy of water by using hydraulic micro-turbines, heat pumps, etc.). CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Environmental performance 226 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 229 ===== The Group has deployed an operational excellence approach,  coordinated at corporate level for its main sites and contracts. These  implement an annual action plan to improve operating performance,  in particular regarding energy efficiency, maintenance and optimizing  reagent consumption, which contribute directly to reducing scope 1, 2  and 3 emissions. The standards setting out operating best practices in  this area are made available to operations. The sustainable purchasing process, which aims to implement a TCO  (Total Cost of Ownership) approach to assessing  costs over the useful  life of the equipment, such as pumps, also contributes to energy  efficiency (see Section 4.3.2.3.4 below). The Group offers its expertise to its customers to calculate and reduce  their environmental footprint and particularly their carbon footprint,  using the Veolia GreenPath tool (see Section 4.2.1.6 above). For each  project, Veolia is able to assess avoided emissions in comparison to a  reference scenario, whether in recycling materials or energy  production from waste. The partnerships such as that signed with Unilever to recycle used  packaging contribute to the circular economy (see Section  4 2.2.3.1  above) and  avoiding emissions.

Since 2018, thanks to our decarbonization efforts, we have successfully  reduced the carbon intensity of our business by 45% for scopes 1 and 2  by taking action in every business area. Veolia has already invested  €529 million to eliminate the use of coal as fuel in Europe by 2030. Comments on change in these indicators can be found in  Sections  4.2.3.2.1 and 4.2.3.3.1. Avoided emissions are calculated  according to the guidelines relating to the multifaceted performance  objectives. Focus on a GHG reduction action: methane capture In landfills, the decomposition of fermentable waste generates biogas  which contains up to 40% to 60% methane: the Group’s expertise in  capturing and recovering this methane is an important factor in  reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Veolia has opted to take into account the actual impact of methane in  its reporting. Calculated over 100 years, the global warming potential  of this gas is 28 times higher than CO2 (5 th IPCC report). The Group’s  decision to use this figure increases its emissions linked to methane by  12% compared to many other companies and countries which still  report based on the 4 th  IPCC report, when the global warming  potential associated with methane was 25.

This good performance is driven by a net  improvement in the capture rate at sites located in the United  Kingdom and Hong Kong and the installation of biogas capture  equipment at several landfill sites in Latin America. The current scope capture rate was lower than for the 2018-2022 pro  forma scope due to the acquisition  of sites with a lower level of  performance and the sale of sites with a higher level of performance.. A capture enhancement plan initiated across Latin American sites   delivered its first results in 2022. The increase in voluntary carbon  credit schemes will encourage this type of initiative.

Saving and preserving energy resources is a major aspect of Veolia’s  contribution to combating climate change. In this area, the Group  commits to: ■increase energy efficiency at the facilities which it operates; ■prioritize the use of renewable and recovered energies and support  its customers in this transition; ■recover as much energy potential as possible from treated waste  and wastewater.

The commissioning of new biomass facilities for energy production  (Japan, Germany, Czech Republic, Brazil), the ramp-up of existing  biomass plants in China and the acquisition of new waste-to-energy  facilities (France and Germany) contributed to the increase in  renewable or recovered energy production between 2019 and 2020. In  2022, the increase was mainly due to biomass electricity generation in  Kanda, Japan. In 2023, this increased slightly, particularly in Turkey  with the contract for a new incinerator in Istanbul.

Veolia also has different objectives based on the specific features of its  businesses, as stated below. Energy business: energy efficiency and diversification of the energy mix Veolia manages energy at over 48,745 energy facilities worldwide. GHG emissions linked to the Group’s Energy business represent 42% of scope 1  and 42% of scope 2 emissions.

The 2027 new objectives are described in Section  4.2.1.5. 2024-2027  Environmental Plan above. Optimization of the Group’s thermal equipment energy performance  is based on the quality of their operation and maintenance, as well as  their modernization. As part of its energy production contracts, Veolia specializes in  operating CHP facilities comprising the simultaneous production of  heat and electricity. These facilities improve energy performance  compared with the separate production of heat and electricity. The  facilities managed by the Group are equipped with the best available  technologies to limit pollution and improve production performance.  Primary energy savings (in GWh) are tied to changes in the portfolio of  CHP facilities operated by the Group. In connection with its greenhouse gas emission reduction target,  Veolia has undertaken the transition of thermal plants using coal to  lower-emission energies, such as biomass or natural gas. Plants using  natural gas can be gradually supplied with biogas and subsequently  hydrogen when it becomes available in its “renewable” form. Downstream from the public authority heat production facilities,  Veolia operates district heating networks: by focusing production at a  single site, energy performance is optimized compared with domestic  sources. Veolia has improved the performance of district heating  networks through significant investment. It is also Veolia policy to  diversify its energy mix towards renewable energies. Thermal  networks are moving towards “5th  generation” low temperature  networks, designed to improve energy performance (increased waste  energy recovery capacity) and develop the use of renewable energies  (by gradually “electrifying” thermal production as and when  renewable electricity becomes available). The share of biomass in the fuel mix for energy production has  increased considerably in recent years (from 8% in 2015 to 23% in  2020). After a decline in 2021, linked to the divestment of activities in  the United States and Canada, the share of biomass increased sharply  in 2022 with the Kanda plant in Japan and increasing use of this  energy in the United States, Spain, Poland and China. As part of its 2020-2023 Environment Plan, Veolia decided to set  targets for the traceability and certification of biomass energy to  contribute to the zero deforestation objective. These objectives are  ambitious, particularly for non-European Union countries. In 2023,  there was a reduction in the share of biomass traced and certified due  to a significant decrease in biomass consumption in Hungary, where  100% of its biomass was traced and certified. It should also be noted  that certification is more more dependent on the local context and the  existence of certification organizations. For its energy services for buildings and industrial customers, Veolia  has deployed performance management centers in all its zones: data  analysts and systems engineers ensure the optimum management of  managed facilities consumption, e.g. in its subsidiary ENOVA in the  United Arab Emirates. Veolia has developed its electricity flexibility offering: in 2019, the  Group acquired the energy business of Actility, now integrated into  Flexcity. It notably intends to apply load shedding, which consists in  deferring the energy consumption of facilities to reduce peaks and  stabilize  electricity  distribution  networks.  Electrical  consumer  flexibility enables the electrical system to receive intermittent  renewable energies while limiting system infrastructure costs. In addition, Veolia supports France's collective effort to adjust its  electricity consumption by joining the Ecowatt system developed by  RTE in partnership with ADEME. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Environmental performance VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 229  ===== PAGE 232 ===== Waste business: gaining in energy efficiency and developing  energy recovery The main sources of energy consumption are waste collection (fuel  consumption representing 3% of the Group’s scope  1 emissions) and  incineration (electricity consumption representing 2% of the Group’s  scope 2 emissions and energy from waste recovery used on-site) (see  Section 4.2.3.3.1 above). Veolia works to limit emissions by managing  its vehicle fleet and optimizing collection routes. Veolia also optimizes  primary energy consumption at its waste incinerators. The Group develops energy recovery from waste at sites such as  incinerators producing heat, landfills and anaerobic digestion units  producing biogas. The energy produced (heat and/or electricity) is  used on-site and supplied to third parties, reducing in both cases  recourse to other higher-carbon energy sources. Moreover, the  material recycling and the production of refused derived fuels (RDF)  helps reduce customers’ primary energy requirements.

The volume of captured methane increased  significantly this year (decrease in CO2 emissions) without being fully  recovered (biogas and energy production) for the moment. The 2027 new objectives are described in Section  4.2.1.5. 2024-2027  Environmental Plan above. Water business: optimizing electricity consumption  and producing low carbon energy locally Drinking water production and distribution activities, as well as  wastewater systems (collecting and treating wastewater) represent  52% of the Group’s scope 2 emissions (see 4.2.3.3.1 above). They also  offer great opportunities to produce renewable energy for use on-site  or supply to third parties, particularly in wastewater treatment plants. Veolia develops its know-how in order to reach or get close to energy  self-sufficiency for wastewater treatment. In Germany and Bulgaria,  Veolia has launched an energy saving and biogas energy production  initiative at all facilities equipped with a sludge digester. Three  treatment plants (Braunschweig, Görlitz and Schönebeck, i.e.  approximately 520,000 population equivalent) are energy self- sufficient. The wastewater plant in Sofia, Bulgaria, has also achieved  this goal. The Group therefore rolled out two additional measures: reduce  energy consumption and develop renewable energy production for its  self-consumption and third parties, therefore contributing to energy  transition. To reduce the energy consumption of its facilities (water and  wastewater, networks and plants), the Group references best practices  and effective technological choices by developing analysis tools and  setting up energy audits or certifications – the Veolia Eau France  management system is ISO 50001:2011 certified: 2011. To this end, Veolia develops solutions and processes such as: ■Hubgrade Performance, a Veolia digital solution, continually  optimizes the consumption of energy and chemicals in wastewater  treatment plants; ■Centaurus, a Veolia digital solution, is digital resource designed for  experts to create and model efficient and low-energy plants; ■Anitamox, a new process already deployed on 35 sites, is designed  to reduce both energy consumed on site and the consumption of  chemical reagents. To support the energy transition, Veolia seeks to maximize the energy  potential of wastewater treatment sludge (see section  4.2.2.3.2.2  above) as an alternative to fossil fuels: anaerobic digestion,  incineration or co-incineration with energy recovery. Furthermore, Veolia boosts local energy production using renewable  energy production facilities on its sites: solar panels, wind farms,  turbines, etc. For example, in Brussels (Belgium), treated water passes  through turbines to generate electricity before being discharged into  the environment. In addition to heat or electricity production, Veolia studies new means  of producing low-carbon hydrogen. In Hyères, a pilot demonstration  combining the “steam-reforming” of biogas from the anaerobic  digestion of wastewater treatment sludge and the production of  microalgae will provide wastewater treatment plants with new ways  of supporting customer energy transition.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Environmental performance 230 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 233 ===== At constant scope (pro forma), consumption for the treatment of  drinking water declined slightly. However, it should be noted that the  Group’s objective is still to limit an increase in energy consumption in  line with a decline in the quality of the untreated water resources  which require more advanced and energy-intensive treatment (e.g.  membrane processes).  Electricity used to treat wastewater remains below the objective set  despite the commissioning of additional treatment facilities,  particularly in the United States and the Middle East.. Veolia also expects an increase in energy consumption in the coming  years due to the strengthening of regulatory thresholds for discharges  into the natural environment and increased reuse of treated water in  several geographies. To remove more nitrogen, phosphorous and  micro-pollutants and better treat odors, the wastewater treatment  plants must strengthen, but also supplement, existing installations  which will be sources of additional consumption. The 2027 new objectives are described in Section  4.2.1.5. 2024-2027  Environmental Plan above. 4.2.4 PROTECT ENVIRONMENTS AND BIODIVERSITY 4.2.4.1  Risks and opportunities The interdependence between Veolia’s activities and biodiversity is  based on a principle of double materiality.  On the one hand, Veolia’s activities contribute to preserving the  environment (water, air, soil) and to reducing several of the factors  that erode biodiversity as a result of the activities of its municipal and  industrial customers (climate change, pollution, overexploitation of  natural resources including water resources). For example, waste  collection and processing reduces the pollution of soil, air, and bodies  of water by urban and industrial pollution. Similarly, sanitation  activities allow the discharge of quality water into the natural  environment, thus helping support the replenishment of water  courses, the achievement of good ecological status, and the  preservation of water resources from pollution. The development of  centralized and strictly regulated urban heating networks that are  continuously monitored, and the use of certified biomass to feed  them, also reduces the environmental impact in comparison to more  polluting systems.  Industrial activities carried out on sites operated by the Group can  however  cause  negative  direct  or  indirect  negative  local  environmental impacts of a magnitude infinitely smaller than that  associated with the reduction of the impacts of its customers, the  control of which is part of the Group’s environmental policy (see  Section 4.2.1 above). These impacts include the consumption of natural  resources as part of the sites’ activities, residual contamination  contained in operating emissions, greenhouse gas emissions and the  impact that the land footprint of sites can have on habitats  (fragmentation or destruction). The management of these risks, which  have been identified as part of the Group’s operational risks (see  Section 2.2.2.2 above) is an integral part of the Group’s environmental  policy (see Section 4.2.1 above). On the other hand, each of Veolia’s activities is dependent on  ecosystem services: ■the production of drinking water is directly tied to a properly  functioning large water cycle: the regularity of precipitation, plus  storage capacity in catchment areas, ensure that the resource is  available. The environment’s self-treatment (self-purification)  capacity helps to maintain good quality water resources used for  drinking water production and therefore limit the amount of  treatment needed to ensure water is fit for consumption; ■wastewater treatment activities are dependent on ecological  factors: microbial activity, and the ability of aquatic environments  to assimilate residual water content, are critical to wastewater  treatment; ■for energy, biomass operations require a sustainable supply of  wood-energy or vegetable waste; ■landfilling, composting and soil remediation all rely on the  structure and nature of the soil, as well as biological processes to  break down organic material. The Group responds to challenges linked to the protection and  restoration of biodiversity through its very activity or through  operational methods adopted at the sites where it operates, but also  more widely by making biodiversity an integral part of its policy and  processes, as is described in the rest of this chapter.  4.2.4.2  Policy and commitments 4.2.4.2.1  Contribution to the Impact 2023 plan As part of the environmental pillar of its Multifaceted Performance  approach, itself integrated into its Impact 2023 strategic plan, Veolia is  committed to combating pollution and accelerating ecological  transition (see Section  4.1.1 above). This commitment can be broken  down into several objectives, including protecting environments and  biodiversity, and comprises 3 lines: ■line 1: strengthen the integration of the protection of environments  and biodiversity in our Group standards; ■line 2: preserve regional environments and biodiversity by limiting  the impacts of our sites and developing their ecological potential; ■line 3: raise maximum awareness internally and externally and  engage our stakeholders in our environments and biodiversity  protection strategy. To illustrate this objective, the Group defined a 2023 target involving  the roll-out of action plans designed to improve the footprint of  environments and biodiversity at sensitive sites, explained more fully   in Section 4.2.4.3.1.

The action plan relating to this objective is monitored by the relevant  Group entities (headquarter functional departments, Research and  Innovation, and Business Units). A network of correspondents located  in the main countries where the Group operates ensures the roll-out  of the Group’s strategy by implementing action plans, sharing best  practices and escalating feedback. TNFD* - Strategy - Our approach to nature-related challenges The Group responds to challenges linked to the protection and  restoration of biodiversity through its very activity or through  operational methods adopted at the sites where it operates, but  also more widely by making biodiversity an integral part of its  policy and processes. Veolia’s activities contribute to preserving the environment  (water, air, soil) and to reducing several of the factors that erode  biodiversity as a result of the activities of its municipal and  industrial customers (climate change, pollution, overexploitation  of natural resources including water resources). Industrial activities carried out on sites operated by the Group  can  however  cause  direct  or  indirect  negative  local  environmental impacts of a magnitude infinitely smaller than  that associated with the reduction of the impacts of its  customers, the control of which is part of the Group’s  environmental policy (see Section 2.2.2.2 above). As part of its Impact 2023 strategic program, within its  2020-2023 multifaceted performance approach, Veolia chose to  monitor the roll-out of action plans designed to improve the  footprint on environments and biodiversity of “sensitive” sites  (see Section 4.1.1 above The methodology used to identify sensitive sites factors in the  location of direct operations with regard to the sensitivity of the  natural environment (using the IBAT mapping tool developed  with the support of IUCN) and the nature of site activities (see  Section 4.2.4.3.1 below). In 2019, Veolia identified 123 sensitive  sites out of the 1,453 main sites managed by the Group. For all other sites, a policy of implementing more virtuous  practices for biodiversity (ecological management, “zero phytos”,  etc.) was rolled out under the environmental plan. Under the multifaceted performance strategy 2024-2027,  combined with the new strategic plan, the roll-out of these  action plans will again be monitored to cover any new sites  included since 2019 and implement new measures at existing  sites (see Section 4.2.4.3.1 above. To better understand its challenges, in 2023 Veolia assessed its  impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities using the LEAP  (Locate Evaluate Assess Prepare) method. This analysis,  performed on direct operations and the upstream value chain,  identified issues at Veolia sites and for certain raw materials and  encourages better consideration of biodiversity in our value  chain. In this context, pursuant to the French legal system, the Group  endeavors to implement mitigation hierarchy principles (also called  the Avoid-Minimize-Compensate approach), the first step of which is  to avoid damaging biodiversity, then to reduce the impacts and finally  to offset them. Furthermore, under its 2019-2023 Environmental Plan, Veolia has  committed the sites it operates to implementing more virtuous  practices for biodiversity, whatever their issues at stake. * Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosures In 2020, Veolia Environnement also renewed for 2023 its 2018  commitment to the Act4Nature International initiative, launched by  the French association EpE (Entreprises pour L’Environnement),  bringing together around sixty major French companies and their  France-based subsidiaries, and supported by numerous public, private  and NGO partners (www.act4nature.com). As part of this, the  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer signed the Act4Nature  International collective agreements and made commitments unique  to Veolia. The progress of the Group’s actions with regard to these  commitments at the end of 2023 is presented in Appendix 8.10.1. In 2022, Veolia signed the commitment ''No water security without  ecological security, no ecological security without water security''  launched by the World Water Council. The aim of this initiative is to  strengthen the links between water and nature and to promote  nature-based solutions. Finally, Veolia has undertaken to adopt in its 2023 URD the framework  recommendations covering the nature-related risks and opportunities  published by the TNFD* in September 2023. Composed of 14 themes  divided into 4 pillars, this framework provides issuers and investors  with a common framework for issuers and investors to assess  corporate policies on biodiversity, as the TCFD does for climate  strategies. Veolia was therefore singled out at the Davos Forum in January 2024  as being one of the TNFD’s 19 French early adopters. The summary information corresponding to the 4 pillars of the TNFD  disclosure framework (Governance, Strategy, Risks and opportunities,  Indicators and targets) is presented in boxes in this chapter.  Furthermore, for more detailed information, the cross-reference table  presented below matches the 14 themes of the disclosure framework  with the chapters of the Universal Registration Document.  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Environmental performance 232 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 235 ===== TNFD - Governance of our impacts, dependencies, nature-related  risks and opportunities To review the risks and opportunities relating to the nature- related impacts and dependencies of Veolia’s activities, the  Board of Directors primarily relies on two of its Committees: ■the Purpose Committee (see Section 1.2.1.7 above), which  performs an annual review of the multifaceted performance  objectives, including the protection of natural environments  and biodiversity, and related indicators (see Section 3.2.2.5  above)  ■the Accounts and Audit Committee, which is in charge of  reviewing the financial and non-financial risk mapping,  including challenges relating to biodiversity, understanding  the management initiatives and corrective measures (see  Section 3.2.2.1 above). As is the case for all multifaceted performance objectives, the  objective of protecting natural environments and biodiversity is  backed by a sponsor, a member of the Executive Committee (see  Section 1.2.1.7 above) and its progress, assessed by an  independent third-party body, is taken into account in the  calculation of the variable compensation of the Group’s  executive officers (see Section 3.4.1.1 above). A network of  Biodiversity officers in the BUs is responsible for its deployment. 4.2.4.2.2  Contribution to the GreenUp 2027  strategic plan The multifaceted performance initiative relating to the GreenUp 2027  strategic plan has placed the protection of environments and  biodiversity in a wider context of decontaminating Group client  activities and maintained, to illustrate this objective, the indicator  involving the roll-out of action plans aimed at improving the  environmental and biodiversity footprint of sensitive sites (see Section  4.2.4.3.1). This indicator will apply to a new scope (pro forma 2023),  including in particular the sites incorporated into the Group’s business  following the Suez merger. It combines a 85% completion target for  2027 and, as previously, will be taken into account in the variable  compensation policy of Group executives (see Section 3.4.1.1 above). More generally, as part of GreenUp, Veolia will step up the growth of  its booster activities with the greatest impact: technologies and new  solutions for water, solid waste treatment and bioenergy, electrical  flexibility and energy efficiency. Their rapid, large-scale deployment  will help erase 18 million tons of CO2 emissions (scope 4),save 1.5 billion  m 3 of water and process 10 million tons of hazardous waste per year  (seethe Profile and Section 1.2.1, above). Furthermore, the Group’s new 2024-2027 Environmental Plan (see  Section 4.2.1 above) raises the Group’s level of commitment in  adopting biodiversity preservation practices, with ongoing actions  over an extended scope following the acquisition of Suez and more  ambitious targets. Finally, in January 2024, the Group renewed its undertaking in the  Act4Nature International initiative for 2024-2027. In addition to the  above Environmental Plan commitments, other undertakings are  aimed at providing its clients with the biodiversity preservation and  restoration solutions devised in its performance and innovation policy  and increasing the importance of biodiversity in the Group’s  governance and its stakeholder communications, in line with the  recommendations of the COP 15Global Biodiversity Frameworkor CRSD  expectations. A breakdown of these new commitments is presented in  Section 8.10.2.

The production and  sharing of tools with stakeholders also contribute in particular to  promoting biodiversity internally and within their organizations. TNFD -Risks and Opportunities - The inclusion of nature in our  risk management The main risks that Veolia faces are subject to an annual  mapping process. Risks are classified according to their potential  impact and probability of occurrence, and ranked according to  importance. Among these risks are environmental and industrial  risks (see Section 2.2.2.2 above). In 2023, the assessment using the LEAP (Locate Evaluate Assess  Prepare) method, recommended by the TNFD, of the nature- related impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities of  Veolia’s activities helped identify risks and opportunities by  activity in the short, medium and long term for our direct  operations and our upstream value chain. The results of this  study were used to include a new component on risks relating to  the erosion of biodiversity in the annual risk assessment  campaign in the Group’s Business Units (see Section 2.1.1 above). The identification of risks in our upstream value chain will also  result in a more extensive dialogue in 2024 with the main  suppliers of the most affected purchasing categories in order to  incorporate biodiversity protection criteria into our supplier  selection and assessment. Similarly, the new environmental plan  defines targets that have been increased to 100% for the  traceability and certification of wood biomass used in our energy  sector (see Chapter 4.2.4.3.1) in order to limit the impact of our  energy supplies and more particularly our biomass supplies Aware of its potential impacts, the Group is already undertaking  reduction measures. The biodiversity footprint of our sites with  significant issues is measured to assess direct or indirect  negative and positive impacts generated by site activities at local  level.  A tailored action plan enables each “sensitive” site to roll  out the necessary measures. In addition, Veolia is committed to eliminating the use of  phytosanitary products in all its operational sites. Veolia also  deploys ecological management at its sites to implement  measures to protect nature.  Finally, the Group’s innovation policy plans to boost the  deployment of our offering relating to Nature-based Solutions,  particularly in large water cycle management (see Section 1.4  above).  Strengthen the integration of the protection of  environments and biodiversity in our Group standards Veolia is developing its internal processes relating to the impacts and  dependency of its value chain on biodiversity (assessment of suppliers  with the greatest impact for the environment, application of the  Veolia green spaces charter to subcontractors, etc.), the project  approval  process  by  investment  committees  (integration  of  biodiversity as one of the criteria for contributing to multifaceted  performance), businesses (integration of recommendations promoting  biodiversity in its operating standards, etc.), marketing (improvement  of offers in line with the protection of ecosystems, etc.). In addition, as part of its 2019-2023 Environment Plan, Veolia included  a biomass energy traceability and certification objective to contribute  to the zero deforestation objective (see Section 4.2.3.3.3). In 2022,  99.5% of the wood biomass used was traced and 70% certified with, in  Europe, certificates ensuring compliance with the requirements of the  Red II Directive (SURE, KZR, INIG) and, outside Europe, FSC or PEFC type  certificates. Veolia is also furthering its understanding of biodiversity and its  nature-related risks and opportunities to better integrate it into its  services. The Group has therefore identified the related challenges for  each of its activities (see Section 4.2.4.1 above) and conducted in 2023,  using the LEAP method recommended by the TNFD, a study of the  impacts and dependencies of its activities. It is steering its research  projects (impact measurement using bioindicators, footprints, etc.)  around these analyses, as well as its innovation policies, particularly  with respect to the design and operation of Nature-based Solutions.   The Group’s innovation program therefore includes amongst its  priorities the development of Nature-based Solutions associated with  the management of the large water cycle, such as artificial wetlands,  like the Green Discharge Zone created in China at one of the sites of  the Sinopec industrial group. Veolia designed a tool to measure the footprint of its activities on  environments and biodiversity. The tool was built in collaboration  with ecology and life cycle analysis experts: the French consultant  agency Ecosphère, the internal environmental consultant agency 2EI,  Veolia Environnement Recherche et Innovation, Veolia Eau and the  French Committee of the IUCN (International Union for Conservation  of Nature). The “environments and biodiversity” footprint measures  the biodiversity issues of a site in terms of quantity and quality, in the  same way as the carbon footprint. The tool is used to draw up a semi- automated action plan according to a site’s major issues and monitor  the site’s progress. In particular, it is applied to measure the footprint  of the sensitive sites described below.  The Group now offers its customer this experience gained in  biodiversity management to support them in their ecological  transformation. Preserve regional environments and biodiversity by limiting  the impacts of our sites and developing their ecological  potential Veolia manages impacts linked to discharges and abstraction in the  environment of sites it operates. By improving its environmental  performance, directly in line with its operational performance, Veolia  reduces its impacts on receiving environments, particularly air and  water, and therefore biodiversity (see Sections  4.2.2 and 4.2.3 above,  section 4.2.5 below). In addition, Veolia manages and develops areas, notably to  compensate for the impacts generated by their land coverage and  instead transform them into reservoirs of biodiversity. 1/ As part of its 2020-2023 multifaceted performance, Veolia has  decided to monitor the roll-out of action plans designed to improve  the footprint on environments and biodiversity of “sensitive” sites, i.e.  those considered to present the greatest challenges in terms of  environmental protection and biodiversity. These sensitive sites were identified in 2019 with regard to several  criteria: ■issues related to the sensitivity and potential of the site:the type of  environment in which the site is located, the presence of protected  natural areas near the site, the potential presence of threatened or  protected species, land and water permeable surface areas, level of  water stress. To this end, the Group reconciles information  extracted from the IBAT database (Integrated Biodiversity  Assessment Tool developed by Birdlife International, Conservation  International, the IUCN and the United Nations Environment  Program) and site geo-location data.  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Environmental performance VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 235  ===== PAGE 238 ===== The natural areas taken into account are the ones defined by the  IUCN (categories  I to  VI), the World Heritage, the RAMSAR  agreement  1, the MAB  2, the Alliance for zero extinction sites, and  the Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBA) ; ■issues relating to the site’s activity: air and water discharges,  treatment efficiency, abstraction of resources, potential past non- compliance, waterproofing of surfaces 123 sensitive sites were initially identified in 2019 following the  assessment with regard to these issues,. As certain sites have since  closed or are being renovated, this figure was revised downward to 114  in 2023 out of the 1,265 main sites managed by the Group representing  a total surface area of 16,116 hectares. All managed these sites have  initiated an action plan since that date.  The biodiversity footprint is measured to assess direct or indirect 3  negative and positive impacts generated by site activities at local level.  This measurement is based on the five direct drivers of biodiversity  loss identified by the IPBES in its 2019 report: degradation of habitats,  overexploitation of natural resources, climate change, pollution and  spread of invasive alien species.  It includes the analysis of indicators and data relating to: ■the site process such as consumption of energy, reagents, water  and raw materials, discharges, waste production or energy and  material recovery; ■site location and management of spaces such as the presence of  protected natural areas (on or near the site) or rare or threatened  species, management of green spaces as well as management of  invasive species, lighting, etc. The involvement of an ecologist, an expert in local biodiversity, is  needed to help Business Units to measure their on-site footprint. The ecologist also helps sites in defining their action plans. They refer  to a list of predefined actions (e.g.: combating invasive alien species,  light pollution, protection of water resources etc.) to be rolled out and  updated according to the major issues identified by the analysis. A detailed methodological framework ensures consistent assessments  and action plans, whatever the location. Examples of measures undertaken at two sensitive sites In France, the Granges landfill rolls out biodiversity preservation  and restoration initiatives in both post-operation and neglected  areas to attracta maximum of species and offer complementary  diversified environments. This includes the rigorous greening of  cells, either by purchasing local seeds (“Végétal Local”) or via a  “hay transfer” project covering an area of 7 ha. In addition,  various environments are maintained, such as the historic  afforestation surrounding the site. A rural hedge stretching over  1 km was planted, and since 2022, an area of 4 ha has been  gradually redeveloped (pond, shrub groves, reptile shelters, etc.)  to attract multiple species. Furthermore, invasive alien species  are partly managed through participatory projects involving site  employees. In Colombia, the Antanas Environmental Technology Park in the  city of Pasto (landfill and incineration site) has since 2021  maintained three conservation areas totaling 73 ha of the 98 ha  site. In these areas, the environmental protection association  “Viva el Planeta” supports Veolia in the ecological management  of rare species such as oak, palm, Colombian pine and theacorn  woodpecker. The creation of a nursery ensures the availability of  endemic species for site regreening or reforestation. Finally, the  site also seeks to raise awareness among its employees and local  communities by conducting visits and organizing conferences on  biodiversity. 2/ Under its 2020-2023 Environmental Plan, Veolia commits the sites it  operates to implementing more virtuous practices for biodiversity,  whatever their issues at stake: ■zero use of phytosanitary products (to manage site green spaces)  at 75% of sites  (4); ■implementation of ecological management at 75% of sites  (4) with  green spaces exceeding 1  hectare (by applying the Veolia Green  Spaces charter). The multifaceted performance target set for 2023, aiming to achieve  an average rate of 75% for the deployment of action plans in place at  sensitive sites, was exceeded. This was not the case for targets  relating to the ecological management of sites and “zero”  phytosanitary products, which will both be maintained and  strengthened  in  the  Group’s  new  international  Act4Nature  commitment, with a 95% target by 2027 and a wider scope now  including former Suez sites.

(2) As of 2021, according to the Group ecological management charter. To support the deployment of the Group’s environment and  biodiversity commitment, the Business Units have been equipped with  various tools, including: ■the ecological management guide, developed in partnership with  the IUCN French Committee, that enables all sites, whatever their  issue at stake, to implement measures to protect biodiversity. It  comprises information sheets on the maintenance of green areas,  ecological developments for roads and buildings, maintenance of  ponds and waterways, intrusion prevention and the management  of invasive exotic species, etc. A sector version of this guide for  landfills was produced in 2022. For these sites, the indicator “areas  which are scheduled to be restored or revegetated in the next four  years'' increased from 450 ha in 2021 to 1,962 ha in 2023; ■EcoLogiCal, a tool designed in partnership with the Noé association  and with the participation of the IUCN French Committee and  Ecocert Environnement. Through an online self-assessment  covering five major themes (flora, fauna, water, waste, lighting), it  allows you to compare the economic and ecological footprints of  the traditional management of green spaces with environmentally  friendly practices. EcoLogiCal is aimed at all site managers. It is  free, public and can be accessed online: https://eco-logical.fr; ■the Green Spaces charter aims to support the transition of green  spaces towards more ecological practices. It commits Veolia sites  and service providers to managing green spaces ecologically. It also  incorporates mandatory measures to consider the effective  transition to ecological management; ■The Zero Phytosanitary Products charter lists the practices to be   adopted for a site to be considered virtuous with regard to the  management of its green areas without using phytosanitary products  (herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and biocides). In the same way as  the Green Spaces charter, it applies to sites and their green space  service providers. A “zero phyto” sheet, developed for educational  purposes, completes the approach to raise awareness among  employees. It describes the benefits of discontinuing the use of  phytosanitary products (the required changes in site aesthetic  standards through greater integration of nature in green spaces, etc.). Raise maximum awareness internally and externally and  engage our stakeholders in our environment  and biodiversity protection strategy The Group seeks to continue raising awareness among internal (on- site personnel, support functions) and external (subcontractors,  customers, general public, etc.) stakeholders on environment and  biodiversity protection issues. The ultimate aim is to firmly establish  the change of culture needed to transform operational practices at all  of the Group’s decision levels (ecological management, green  infrastructures, etc.). The Group also involves its stakeholders in the  dialogue preceding its decisions (e.g.: partnerships with national and  local associations for the protection of the environment, etc.). Fully aware that naturalist expertise is needed to set up and monitor  actions tailored to regional issues, the Group encourages its sites to  forge partnerships with conservation associations. Following the 2020-2023 Environmental Plan, with a site deployment  rate of 59%, Veolia achieved its objective relating to its commitment  to raise awareness internally or externally on the issues of protecting  environments and biodiversity for 50% of its sites.  In 2023, the Group in particular continued the deployment of its  biodiversity e-learning to boost and accelerate awareness among its  employees. Intended for a wide audience of Business Unit support  functions and operators, it was specifically designed for the  biodiversity issues of Veolia’s activities (understand the issues of  protecting environments and biodiversity, master the Group’s strategy  regarding the challenges of its businesses and identify action levers). Since 2008, Veolia has partnered with the International Union for  Conservation of Nature (IUCN) French Committee, which provides  expertise for the roll-out of its commitment (drafting of its commitment in  relation to the French National Strategy for Biodiversity, creation of  operational tools, etc.). The Group actively participates in think tanks of  leading French associations on the subject: EpE (Entreprises Pour  L’Environnement), OREE, or the IUCN French Committee, where Veolia  chairs the working group “Businesses and biodiversity”.  In November 2022, the Group participated in COP15 organized in  Montréal and chaired by China, and was notably invited to take part in  the two-day closing session of the Business and Biodiversity Forum,  part of the official COP program. The Group expressed the desire to  strengthen its capacity for innovation and deployment of its solutions  in order to meet its customers’ commitments to reduce their impact  on biodiversity, while continuing to work on reducing its own impacts.  In November 2023, following the publication of the National  Biodiversity Strategy 2030, the Group was invited by the Ministry of  Ecological Transition to participate in the Business and Biodiversity  “Roquelaure” working group, aimed at formulating recommendations  to reduce risks and identify opportunities with regard to biodiversity in  the main business sectors in France.

TNFD - Metrics and Targets  The interdependence between Veolia’s activities and nature requires the various indicators to be monitored and targets to be defined to assess,  avoid and reduce the impacts of activities. These indicators and objectives are monitored as part of our multifaceted performance  commitments in our environmental plan as well as our Act4Nature International commitments. As part of the Impact 2023 strategic program, Veolia’s commitments have resulted in targets for the deployment of action plans at sites with  issues as well as targets for the deployment of more virtuous practices for biodiversity as described in Section 4.2.4.3.1. Veolia also set targets for  2023 as part of its Act4Nature International commitments (see Note 8.10.1). Under our new 2024 GreenUp strategic plan (see Section 4.2.4.2.2 above), the multifaceted performance indicators and the Impact 2023  environmental plan were reapplied with more ambitious objectives over a wider scope, with:  ■the implementation of action plans at our “sensitive” sites with an overall deployment rate of 85% for 2027; ■the deployment of ecological management at all Group sites with over one hectare of green space with a target of 95% by 2027; ■the discontinuation of phytosanitary products at all operational sites with a target of 95% for 2027; ■a 100% traceability and 100% certification target for the wood biomass supplies in our energy sector for sites whose supply chain we control. The preservation of natural environments once again resulted in concrete objectives for the preservation and restoration of natural  environments (ecosystems, habitats) as described in detail in our new Act4Nature International 2024-2027 commitments (see Note 8.10.2): More generally, and as part of its new environmental plan for 2024-2027, the Group is strengthening its commitments by 2027 to reduce  pollution (see Section 4.2.1. above): ■by improving the average treatment efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (BOD5: 96%, COD: 92%); ■by reducing the average emissions of atmospheric pollutants for its thermal installations (g/MWh of fuel consumed): NOx (190), SOx (120),  dust (10) and Hg (0.005) and its hazardous and non-hazardous waste incineration units (mg/Nm3): NOx (110), SOx (20) and dust (3). ■by strengthening its commitment to preserving water resources with a target of 1.5 billion m3 of freshwater saved in 2027 through the reuse  of treated water, desalination and leak reduction. 4.2.4.3.2  Limit the discharge of pollutants into water Challenges Veolia provides sanitation services to nearly 103 million people worldwide and operates 3,222 municipal wastewater treatment plants and 128,000  of sanitation network.

Commitment, approach and result Protecting water resources is one of Veolia’s areas of expertise, and it  is committed to optimizing management of the water cycle. Collect and decontaminate wastewater Veolia has developed a comprehensive approach to help public  authorities efficiently manage wastewater collection and treatment  services, mainly in wet weather to avoid flooding, according to their  size and issues. Optimizing the performance of sanitation networks and efficiency of  treatment processes is an ongoing concern for Veolia, both in terms of  operating facilities under its management (Hubgrade Performance  digital solution) and developing new processes. The average rates of pollution abatement, expressed in BOD5 and  COD, for the wastewater treatment plants operated by the Group are  very satisfactory. Under the 2020-2023 Environmental Plan, Veolia set  minimal efficiency thresholds of 95% and 90% respectively, well above  French regulatory thresholds  5, and largely exceeded them. These targets were strengthened (96% and 92% respectively) under  the new2024-2027environmental plan (see Section 4.2.1.5 above).

Treatment of micropollutants Our domestic use (household products, solvents, medicines, etc.), agriculture, transport, industry and craft industry are responsible for the  presence of micropollutants in water. During wastewater treatment in sewage plants, some micropollutants end up in aquatic environments because they have not been eliminated.  Treating micropollutants is highly complex and conventional technologies cannot completely isolate them. In Europe, awareness is increasing,  and the new Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on urban wastewater treatment plans to incorporate new requirements in  terms of the quaternary treatment of urban wastewater discharges from 2035 at certain sites. The science is moving forward and Veolia expects  regulations to become stricter. With its subsidiary Veolia Water Technologies, the Group already offers innovative solutions that efficiently  treat these micropollutants, including: ■ACTIFLO® CARB: this process, which is equipped with a pre-contact tank with powdered activated carbon for adsorption and can be  combined with the oxidizing action of ozone, eliminates 95% of endocrine disruptors; ■OPACARB® FL: up-flow stream reactor consisting of a micrograin activated carbon bed which removes compounds responsible for endocrine  disruption; ■Filtraflo® Carb: for lower flow rates than the OPACARB® FL, this process eliminates the micropollutants in the water by adsorption, but also  filters them simultaneously through a reactor with micronized powdered activated carbon operating in counter-current; ■Opaline™ C: this process, which can be combined with the oxidizing action of ozone, combines membrane technology and adsorption using  activated carbon to better eliminate pesticides, endocrine disruptors, etc.; ■Anoxkaldnes MBBR (Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor) technology: fixed culture biological treatment processes for removing carbon and/or  nitrogen pollution. The Group’s MBBR technologies are available in different configurations, including EXENO™ and HYBAS™. And since the integration of Veolia Water Technology & Solution, this portfolio has expanded and is supplemented by:  ■OZONIA ozone generator systems with a full range of ozone generators ranging from laboratory products to the largest water treatment  systems in the world; ■UF, NF and RO membrane treatment systems or membrane bioreactors from the WTS portfolio (Leap MBR, ZEEWEED UF membranes, etc.); ■ZEELUNG technology to intensify the biological treatment of wastewater treatment plants equipped with activated sludge while reducing  energy consumption; ■ZEEDENSE technology, which combines ZEELUNG technology and INDENSE activated sludge densification, is designed to over intensify the  treatment of wastewater treatment plants in terms of hydraulic and biological or nitrogen capacity. A comprehensive range of monitoring services Veolia offers customers a comprehensive range of monitoring services for water pollutants involving sampling and analyses. It has developed  regulatory analysis techniques and biological tools for measuring the impact of these discharges on target organisms. When necessary, the Group  works with its customers to define and implement solutions to reduce or eliminate the discharge of hazardous substances into the environment  and manage the attendant risks.  These solutions can either be implemented at source (for example, by connecting plants and monitoring networks) or take the form of remedial  measures (by optimizing processes, introducing additional treatments, etc.). CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Environmental performance VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 239  ===== PAGE 242 ===== 4.2.4.3.3  Limit atmospheric pollution Challenges The atmospheric emissions generated by Group activities mainly concern its Energy business (combustion plants for heat or heat and power  production) and its Waste business (incineration). 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 SOₓ emissions (1)(2) 13,188 13,832 14,224 13,945 13,027 NOₓ emissions  20,991 22,484 22,619 22,846 23,561 Dust emissions from thermal plants selling more than 100 GWh/year  and waste incinerators 641 776 725 713 622 (1) For combustion facilities, Sulfur Oxide (SOx) and Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) emissions are calculated in accordance with the European Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) of November 24,  2010 as from fiscal year 2018 after bringing facilities managed by Veolia up to standards. This document sets the maximum values for emissions based on fuel type and facility  capacity. (2) The calculation methods for SOx and NOx emissions may differ depending on the activity. For the Group’s waste incinerators, particularly in Europe, dust, TOC, HCI, SO2, HF, CO, NOx and  flue flow are measured on a continuous basis. Analyzers provide substance concentration measurements every minute or so. For thermal energy plants, emissions are calculated based  on energy consumption and regulatory emission limits for large combustion plants (from 50 to 100 MW). These emission limits have been applied to all energy consumption, regardless  of the size of the facility. Other methods may be used in response to local requirements, based on emission factors depending on the tonnage burned, with these factors being  determined through tests under real operating conditions. Despite the increase in the scope of activity related in particular to the acquisition of Suez, Group emissions remained stable between 2021 and  2023, as activity at heat production combustion plants in Europe was impacted by mild winters. Breakdown of SOx emissions in 2023 (as a %) Breakdown of NOx emissions in 2023 (as a %) Combustion  plants for heat  production 93% Waste incineration 7% Combustion  plants for heat  production 56% Waste incineration 44% Commitment and approach As part of its commitment to combat pollution, Veolia strives to  reduce the atmospheric emissions of the facilities which it operates by  implementing the best available techniques (BAT). Objectives and results Thermal plant emissions Most atmospheric emissions are derived from the production heat  used for district heating networks.  Centralized energy production facilities are equipped with efficient  smoke treatment resources which help improve air quality in district  areas compared with individual resources. Under its 2020-2023 Environmental Plan, Veolia set the objective of  reducing atmospheric emissions per unit of energy produced, and  defined threshold objectives for 2023. These objectives were  strengthened under the new 2024-2027 Environmental Plan (see  Section 4.2.1.5 above). CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Environmental performance 240 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 243 ===== Emissions of thermal plants selling over 100 GWh/year (g/MWh)* 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023  Target NOx 280 233 216 201 182 < 270 SOx 196 170 147 136 120 < 210 Dust 12 12 11 11 10 < 13 Mercury (mg/MWh) 2 2.3 2.1 2.3 2.8 < 5 * Grams of emissions per MWh of fuel consumed. The decline since 2019 in SOx, NOx and dust emissions by these  facilities reflects the ongoing efforts of the sites and the technical  centers of excellence to capture and treat air pollutants emitted by  heat production plants. Changes in the energy mix also help reduce  emissions. The increase in the value of the mercury ratio in 2023 is due for some  installations to changes to the measurement protocol to include  mercury emissions from biomass, which were not accounted for in  previous years. For other installations, it is due to differences in fuel  quality related to the supply context since 2022. However, the ratio  value remains well below the target set for 2023. The Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) defines an integrated  approach for the prevention and reduction of pollution emitted by  industrial facilities. It provides for the use of Best Available Practices  (BAT) to prevent all types of pollution. These BAT are listed in the “BREF” (Best available techniques  REFerence documents). For thermal plants, Veolia implements BREF (BAT Reference  Document) best available techniques. They mainly focus on optimizing  combustion while minimizing nitrogen oxide (NOx) and carbon  monoxide (CO) emissions and flue treatment systems (denitrification,  desulphurization and dust removal from combustion gases).The Group  is also continuing efforts to reduce fuel consumption and encourage  the use of cleaner fuels, specifically biomass and natural gas. The coal  phase-out plan in Europe takes this approach, promoting the recovery  of unavoidable or lost energies and the use of biomass or recovered  fuels (see Section 4.2.3 above). Waste incinerator emissions As part of its 2020-2023 Environmental Plan, Veolia defined more  demanding objectives for SOx and NOx emissions than the strictest  regulatory standard – the European Union standard – to assess its  overall performance worldwide. These objectives were strengthened  under the new 2024-2027 Environmental Plan (see Section 4.2.1.5  above). Emissions from hazardous and non-hazardous waste incineration plants in 2023 NOx SOx Dust mg/Nm³ mg/Nm³ mg/Nm³ Average concentration of emissions from hazardous and non-hazardous  waste incineration plants 128.6 13.2 2.0 2023 objective < 115 < 40 < 10 European Directive limit values (1) < 200  (2) < 50 < 10 (1) European Directive 2000/76/EC of December 4, 2000, repealed by the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) of November 24, 2010 and enacted into French law by two amended decrees  of September 20, 2002 (daily averages). (2) For NOx, the standard depends on the output rate: 200 mg/Nm3 for plants > 6 metric ton/hour and 400 mg/Nm3 for plants < 6 metric ton/hour. Veolia contributed actively to the review of the Waste Incineration  BREF (Best available techniques REFerence document), published in  December 2019. These technical documents are prepared by the  European Commission and the incineration industry and are a  reference for best available techniques, specifically for improving the  environmental impact of installations, by including air emissions with  high threshold specifications for NOx, CO, TOC, HCl, HF, SO2, PCDD,  metals, dust, etc. From the date of publication of the 2019 BREF, existing hazardous and  non-hazardous waste incineration units have a period of four years to  carry out work to improve flue gas treatment and install new  continuous analyzers, such as for mercury, necessary to comply with  the BREF emission thresholds, which were therefore applied from  December 3, 2023. In 2023, as in previous years, average concentrations at incineration  plants around the world for NOx, SOx and dust were well below  European regulatory limits and the high thresholds set by the BREF.  For example, the threshold set by the European regulations for  average NOx emissions is 200 mg/Nm3 and will be 180 mg/Nm3 when  the BREF comes into force. With regard to the objectives set by the Group’s 2019-2023  Environmental Plan, while the average SOx and dust emission values  are, as in previous years, well below the objectives set by the Plan for  2023, the average NOx emission values remain slightly above the  target.  Thus,fourmajor non-hazardous waste treatment plants were included  in the Group’s scope of activity in 2023, which increased incinerated  tonnage by 15.6%. Three of them are not yet equipped with a NOx  catalytic treatment system, which explains a 7% increase in the  average NOx concentration emitted between 2022 and 2023. For SOx, the ratio is stable, while the dust ratio has declined (-13%). CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Environmental performance VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 241  ===== PAGE 244 ===== 4.2.4.3.4  Optimize land use Challenges The landfill sites and drinking water production sites operated by the  Group cover the largest areas. At these sites, soil contamination can  lead to groundwater or surface water pollution. Veolia is also committed to restoring and maintaining soil quality  through the remediation of contaminated soil and organic recovery of  waste and wastewater sludge (see Section  4.2.2.3.2.2 above, Recover  residual waste and limit the production of final waste). Commitment and approach Site land areas are not fully sealed. Veolia designs and operates its  sites to minimize the footprint of its activities by maximizing the  percentage of soil favorable to the maintenance and development of  biodiversity. As part of its biodiversity strategy, the Group drafted an ecological  design and management guide for its sites with the support of IUCN  France. Site operating rules include conditions governing the use of  land that are consistent with the Group’s commitment to ecosystem  management. Furthermore, Veolia is careful not to cause any chronic or accidental  soil pollution at all the sites it operates by: ■storing and using materials under good conditions; ■properly managing storm water and effluents; ■ensuring that resources for preventing accidental spillages remain  operational. Redevelopment of landfilling cells The operation of a landfill site requires landfilling cells to be dug and  prepared. When responsible for this task, the Group complies with all  obligations regarding surface sealing and the recovery of excavated  materials. Veolia has minimum standards which govern the design and  operation of landfill sites. These include hydrogeological and  geological soil studies, a watertight system made up of a double  barrier (passive, with a low permeability soil or equivalent and active,  with the application of a geomembrane tested and certified by an  external service provider), systems for collecting and treating  leachates and surface water; and monitoring groundwater. Over the duration of operations and post-operations (at least  20 years), the monitoring system is based, inter alia, on the analysis of  surface water, groundwater and discharges. All Veolia sites self-assess  their compliance with these standards. Should they fall short, the sites  must either propose an action plan showing how they intend to  achieve compliance, demonstrate that equivalent measures are in  place, or obtain special dispensation on the basis of additional  monitoring measures. Areas to be re-vegetated after the closure of storage landfills or when  reshaping land in connection with levelling work (redevelopment of  spaces, construction, etc.) are taken into account to identify sensitive  sites and sites with more than 1 hectare of green spaces. These sites  are covered by specific biodiversity conservation measures (see  Section 4.2.4 below). Once used, the cells are covered as quickly as possible, encouraging  the development of local ecosystems. The cells are monitored for  environmental impacts before being returned to general use. When  the entire site is redeveloped, monitoring continues to ensure that the  species planted repopulate the area (post-operation phase). Ecological restoration and renovation When specific issues arise when protecting resources, adapting to  climate change or preserving biodiversity in a region, Veolia may offer  its customers ecological restoration or renovation projects. These  projects are designed to satisfy particular objectives such as protecting  or improving water quality, reinstating the landscape, safeguarding  against risks of flooding, etc. For example, Veolia is required to draft or  contribute to programs designed to re-naturalize rivers, set up green  discharge areas outside wastewater plants (before discharge into the  environment), reforest, or reintroduce endemic species in connection  with the regreening of storage landfills. These solutions are proposed  on a case-by-case basis as they must satisfy very specific criteria  (project objectives, feasibility, performance, costs, financing, etc.). Implementation of protective perimeters around water  catchment areas Catchment areas for water intended for consumption are surrounded  by protective perimeters. Human activities that could directly or  indirectly damage water quality are prohibited or regulated. In its  wellfield operations, the Group conducts voluntary biodiversity- friendly actions: management of green areas, inventory of animal and  plant life, etc. 4.2.4.3.5  Reduce local pollution The Group seeks to minimize any local pollution in all its activities. Limit, capture and treat odors Challenges The natural process of organic matter decomposition can generate  odorous molecules. This process concerns several Group activities:  biological water treatment, composting, collecting household waste,  waste storage facilities. Commitment and approach Tackling odor emissions is an ongoing concern for Veolia. The Group  strives to limit, capture and treat them. It implements solutions directly and works with its customers where  they are responsible for the necessary capital expenditure. To this end,  Veolia has developed technology and works with partners to treat and  control odor (e.g. biofiltration treatment, scrubbing and electronic  measurement systems). It also implements physical-chemical and  biological techniques that limit odor problems. In the event of  perceived pollution, the Group consults with the local population. For  example, the creation of a “nose jury” made up of local residents who  have been trained to identify odor and the introduction of a special  telephone line both help to assess the odor problem more effectively  and enable Veolia to take appropriate steps. Limit waste collection noise Challenges Noise issue has become a key concern for local elected representatives.  The main noise problems primarily concern waste collection. Approach Veolia is carrying out research and has developed some particularly  innovative solutions, such as a pneumatic waste collection system  that significantly reduces the volume of trucks in towns and cities.

Water abstraction and consumption tend to  reduce the availability of local water resources while discharges tend  to damage their quality. Land take tends to increase water-related  risks, such as drought or flooding. Driven by demographic growth,  economic  development  and  increasing  industrialization  and  urbanization, water resource management issues have multiplied and  become more and more significant: ■access to drinking water and sanitation services for communities; ■overexploitation of water resources; ■soil, groundwater and river and stream pollution; ■destruction of wetlands and damage to aquatic environments; ■or the resilience of territories to the impacts of climate change on  the water cycle. Note that these impacts are already confirmed. Certain regions such  as Spain or Pyrénées Orientales (France) are in a constant state of crisis  with regard to water resources. Examples of measures implemented  or proposed by Veolia to its clients in regions subject to high water  stress or recurrent drought include actions to boost the capacity of  available resources, e.g. optimizing existing drilling, developing new  underwater resources, increasing capacities to treat and build  interconnection engineering works, setting up managed acquifer  recharge systems, developing new storage facilities, reusing treated  wastewater, desalination, and actions to reduce water demand such  as improving the water efficiency of drinking water plants, reducing  water loss in distribution networks and reducing drinking water  consumption. Furthermore, water is used to produce products and services. This is  called “virtual water”. More and more people believe that the water  footprint  of  individuals,  organizations  and  regions  which  manufacture, consume and exchange these products and services  must be controlled. As water is central to climate processes, these issues are now  exacerbated by global warming, which amongst other things  accelerates the water cycle and notably intensifies extreme weather  events. Sustainable management of water resources is therefore a  primary line of defense against the consequences of this warming and  is at the core of ecological transformation. In operating its plants and those of its customers, Veolia abstracts,  consumes and discharges water. This environmental impact exposes  the Group to environmental and industrial risks (see Chapter  2,  Section 2.2.2.2 above) and can generate a risk, particularly for sites in  areas of high water stress or close to sensitive ecosystems. However, the very nature of Veolia’s business aims to protect  resources, as reflected by its motto “Resourcing the world”. Veolia  builds long-lasting relationships with its customers based, in  particular, on its ability to manage risks delegated by them. The Group  proposes specific offerings to its customers to protect natural  resources: water treatment, wastewater recovery, protecting water  resources, particularly in situations of water stress. Veolia’s proven expertise in sustainably managing water resources is a  commercial advantage that enables it to undertake ambitious  commitments vis-a-vis its customers and satisfy the expectations of  citizens. More generally, it is a question of improving our water  footprint and that of our customers through a range of technical,  economic and behavioral solutions, including actions on our supply  chain. It is the responsibility of all Veolia businesses to sustainably preserve,  protect and manage water resources. For example: ■by promoting access to the essential services of water and  sanitation for communities, drinking water production and  distribution and wastewater collection and treatment which  contribute significantly to the protection and proper management  of water resources (Water business); ■by reducing water losses in drinking water networks and raising  awareness about efficient and responsible water usage to limit  water resource abstraction (Water business); ■by treating industrial wastewater, leachates, hazardous liquid  waste collection and treatment, sludge recovery and soil  decontamination which also help to considerably reduce  discharges and the transfer of pollutants into resources (Water and  Waste businesses); ■by reusing treated wastewater and recycling water which can  preserve valuable resources and secure access to water in areas  with considerable water stress (Water business); ■by collecting, managing and recovering solid waste, which also  contributes to a healthier environment, and by preventing its  discharge into the environment, helps protect water (e.g. plastics)  (Waste business); ■finally, by saving energy and raw materials, our heating network  operation, industrial services and building energy efficiency  activities also help reduce the water footprint of our customers and  indirectly preserve water (Energy business). CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Environmental performance VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 243  ===== PAGE 246 ===== 4.2.5.2  Policy and commitments As part of its Purpose and its Impact 2023 strategic program, Veolia is  committed to combating pollution and accelerating ecological  transition (see Section 4.1.1 above).  This commitment can be broken down into several objectives,  including sustainably managing water resources. To illustrate this  objective, the Group defined a 2023 target to improve the efficiency of  the municipal drinking water distribution networks that it operates. Commitment Objective SDG Indicator – definition 2020  Results 2021  Results 2022  Results 2023  Results 2023  Target Combat pollution and  accelerate the ecological  transformation Sustainable  management of  water resources • Efficiency of drinking water  networks (Volume of  drinking water consumed/ Volume of drinking water  produced)  (1)  73.4 %  75.6 % 76.3% (√) 76.4% (√) > 75% Sponsor Angel Simon Member of the Executive Committee, and Senior Executive Vice President for the  Iberia and Latin America region (1) For networks serving over 50,000 inhabitants. At constant scope. The efficiency of a drinking water distribution network is an indicator  representing the ratio of volume of water consumed by end users to  the volume of water pumped into the distribution network. The  difference between these two volumes represents network water  losses. These losses include leaks (physical losses) which return to the  environment and commercial losses (metering errors, illegal water  supply). Even if it does not cover all of the Group’s impacts on water  resources, this indicator was chosen as it measures the largest  volumes of wasted water. It is important to reduce these volumes as  any drops of water not abstracted from the environment may be used  for other purposes and any drops of water not treated or transported  contributes to the need to reduce energy and reagent consumption,  limit greenhouse gas emissions and ultimately combat climate  change. Any drops not treated or transported also help to reduce  operational costs and investments, enabling the optimum use of a  region’s existing infrastructures before considering capacity increases. Our main lines of action to prevent physical losses are repairing leaks,  managing service pressure and renewing networks. These actions also  emit greenhouse gases. A balance must be found to preserve  resources through a sustainable network efficiency. A 100%  performance is not technically feasible or environmentally sought as  water losses are inevitable in aging water networks and cannot be  totally eliminated.  The human, technical and financial resources needed to achieve a  100% performance would be so significant in the water network  infrastructure and management that they could jeopardize the  economic balance of the water service and even substantially increase  its environmental impact. It is therefore preferable to target a realistic  and sustainable drinking water network performance, by focusing on  loss reduction and water preservation and responsible water use  awareness. A realistic performance for a drinking water network  largely depends on the level of local water stress and the network’s  technical features.  Veolia assumes its responsibilities as operator but cannot replace its  customer, who decides on the measures to take to preserve resources,  especially if these require major investments. Apart from a few  exceptions, Veolia does not own its facilities. As part of its multifaceted performance strategy, Veolia aims for 2023  to improve water output by +2.5  points compared to the 2019 base  year. The attainment rate at the end of 2023 (76.4%) enables annual  savings in water abstraction of around 320 million m 3. As part of its GreenUp 2024-2027 strategic program, Veolia renewed its environmental commitment and adopted the  following objective and target:    Commitment Objective SDG Indicator – definition 2023 baseline 2027 target Combat pollution  and accelerate the  ecological  transformation Freshwater  savings and  resource  regeneration • Saved freshwater (reuse,  desalination, leakage reduction) 1.4 billion m 3 ≥ 1.5 billion m 3 Sponsor Gustavo Migues Member of the Executive Committee, and Senior Executive Vice President,  for the Iberia and Latin America region CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Environmental performance 244 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 247 ===== Challenges In 2023, Veolia abstracted 11.039 billion m 3 of water, primarily for its  drinking water production and distribution activity (87% of the total  volume abstracted). Through its contracts with public authorities,  Veolia produced 8.137 billion m 3 of drinking water in 3,809 production  plants. It operated 386,218 km of pipelines, supplying 9.409 billion m 3  of water into supply networks. In 2021, the decrease in the volume of  water abstracted and the volumes of drinking water produced and  pumped into municipal distribution networks was primarily due to the  Group’s sale of its investment in the Shenzhen water concession in  China. In 2022, the increase in abstraction volumes is due to the  integration of Suez’s drinking water production and distribution  activities, with very large contracts such as the sites and networks  operated by the Group in Santiago de Chile (13,490 km of networks)  and Barcelona (4,705 km of networks) ). In addition, in 2022, Veolia  also abstracted 96 million m 3 of water for its energy production and  distribution activities: the increase in volume compared to 2021 is due  to the integration of the Tashkent (Uzbekistan) and Kanda (Japan)  contracts and of the IPKW industrial park in the Netherlands.

Committed to managing the water cycle and saving resources, Veolia  has developed and offers solutions to its municipal and industrial  customers to: ■diagnose and improve their water footprint; ■protect existing resources; ■optimize the long-term management of resources; ■support end users for responsible consumption; ■develop alternative resources. Where relevant to the local context, these measures are offered to the  Group’s customers, who then decide whether to apply them on a case- by-case basis. Contribution to international projects At European level, Veolia actively contributes to legislative work to  finalize the revision of the Urban Waste Water Directive. Following the  proposal of the European Union of October 26, 2022, the parliament  and council approved their amendments, to confirm the improvement  in the treatment of pollutants (nutrients but now also micropollutants  and rainwater). The file also concerns the energy neutrality of the  “wastewater” sector, the reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation  and other usages, access to sanitation and the transparency of  wastewater treatment services. Veolia commented on the timetable  for the implementation of the directive that was significantly  extended by joint legislators. This file should be concluded before the  2024 European elections. Veolia also contributes to regulatory changes  in the industrial emissions sector, in the air, water and soil: the new  “Industrial Emissions” directive is on the same timetable as the urban  wastewater treatment directive, and also reduces the leeway for  standardizing  practices  between  Member  States:  e.g.  new  environmental quality standards should be, where necessary,  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Environmental performance VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 245  ===== PAGE 248 ===== incorporated into existing permits. The Group is also a member of the  OECD initiative on water governance and takes part in major  international events on the theme of water (World Water Council and  World Water Forum which will be held in Indonesia in May 2024,  World Water Week in August 2024, and COP28 recently held in Dubai);  Veolia is also member of the CEO Water Mandate and the Water  Resilience Coalition. 4.2.5.3.1  Diagnose and improve water  footprints The Group has developed a Water impact index (WIIX) tool, which is  included in its GreenPath environmental footprint overall assessment  tool (see Section  4.2.1.6 above). This enables businesses and public  authorities to determine measures for managing and using water. It  can be used with the carbon footprint. Since 2016, Veolia has also used this tool to conduct diagnoses on its  sites, specifically those with significant water stress issues. These sites  were identified based on their water requirements and local water  stress using the WRI Aqueduct tool. The WIIX tool connected to a risk  assessment tool, the GEMI® Local Water Tool™ (LWT) was used to  conduct the assessment. At the end of 2019, Veolia performed a water diagnosis at 96% of its  sites identified in 2016 with significant water stress issues, exceeding  the Group objective of 95%. Totaling 25 across all Veolia’s businesses  (Water, Waste and Energy), these sites represented nearly 10% of  water abstraction by the Group in 2016. In its 2020-2023 Environmental Plan, Veolia renewed its objective of  performing a diagnosis at 95% for its sites with significant water  stress within a new scope. These sites with significant water stress  issues were identified for the scope of sites operated in 2019 and  represented 19.7% of Veolia’s abstracted water.  In 2023, 67% of sites with high water stress issues had completed a  diagnosis; the change compared to 2022 was due to the inclusion of  sites that have left Veolia’s scope since 2019. It does not include the  incoming sites resulting from the Suez merger. In 2023, the Group decided to adopt a new approach taking into  account future climate changes and/or water requirements, in line  with emerging good practices that require a prospective analysis  (CSRD and European Taxonomy). This approach stems from the  climate change impact analyses developed in Section 4.2.3. Deployment of water diagnoses at sites with significant water stress issues 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 * 2023  Target Share of sites diagnosed with significant water stress issues  (2016 scope)  96 % 2016-2019  plan  finalized 2016-2019  plan  finalized 2016-2019  plan  finalized 2016-2019  plan  finalized / Share of sites diagnosed with significant water stress issues  (2019 scope) /  36 %  57 %  63 %  67 % 95 % * the change in methodology is detailed below. In 2023, the climate exposure analysis of around 2,000 sites operated  by Veolia replaced the water stress analyses. The main methodological changes are as follows:  ■The initial approach resulted in a specific focus on the water  business while the exposure analysis covers all Group businesses; ■The analysis of exposure to water stress performed using the  Aqueduct tool and the “Baseline water stress” indicator was based  on historical data while the drought risk analysis is now assessed  using projections extracted from regional climate models (Cordex)  using the SPI6 (1) indicator.  The conclusions of the diagnoses show that water stress issues are  identified by the sites. In addition to adopting measures to control  water consumption, certain sites have already proposed or set up for  their customers solutions to mitigate water shortages e.g.  interconnections or alternative resources.  The drinking water production system audited in France has, for  example, set up water transfers between drinking water production  plants which each draw water from a different sub-basin to remediate  a potential water shortage. In the USA, the audited energy production  unit chose to replace municipal water with untreated river water and  pre-treat it with a water softener. Certain sites, located in basins with  considerable water stress, also benefit from structural work conducted  by governments to transfer water from excess catchment areas.  Certain sites audited in Asia benefited from the deviation of major  rivers (Yangzi Jiang, Xi Jiang) to remediate water shortages or the poor  water quality that was used up until recently. The water risk and  impact study for each site provides valuable information on water  resource issues which can help foster dialog with customers and other  stakeholders. Veolia Eau France has partnered with Cerema to create a tool for local  communities called Score Card Résilience Eau. This tool is designed to  assess the resilience of their water management (wastewater and  drinking water) and devise a strategy to improve it in the short and  long term with concrete measures. The Communauté urbaine Creusot  Montceau (Saône et Loire) and the Communauté de communes Sud  Roussillon (Pyrénées Orientales) are undergoing a test phase.  4.2.5.3.2  Protect existing resources Protecting  existing  water  resources  to  prevent  them  from  deteriorating and becoming unusable consists in: ■establishing protection zones around catchment areas and  implementing actions to prevent accidental pollution; ■working with regional participants to identify chronic sources of  damage to resources and set up actions plans to restore water  quality; ■treating as efficiently as possible all discharges into the  environment and limiting as much as possible sanitation network  overflows; ■implementing resource monitoring and surveillance and protection  measures; ■managing abstraction with a long-term perspective.

These permits, which are generally granted based on  prior environmental impact studies, define the conditions for  sustainable abstraction and allocate abstraction between the various  consumption methods. The Group is also involved in partnerships involving local authorities,  industry and farmers for the qualitative protection of water resources  in watersheds. Thus, Aguas Andinas is a founding member of the  Santiago-Maipo Water Fund, a collaborative public-private initiative  that aims to ensure the protection and sustainable use of local water  resources. An innovative solution for monitoring the quality of surface water Veolia’s SWARM service offering, designed around connected multi-parameter sensors, enables unusual changes in the quality of surface water  to be rapidly detected. The buoy measures the main water quality parameters and communicates the data in real time for analysis. In addition  to the measurement system, the buoy comprises an anchor, a float and an energy recovery module enabling it to be self-sufficient. The buoy  can be installed directly and easily in any water body or course. With the SWARM system, the water operator can constantly monitor changes in  key water quality parameters and the state of surface water: conductivity, temperature, speed, depth, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, organic  materials, chlorophyll A, phycocyanin and phycoerythrin. In addition to directly measuring micro-algae photosynthetic pigments, a  mathematical model based on the analysis of oxygen concentration was developed in 2021 to warn the operator of the growth of micro-algae. 4.2.5.3.3  Optimize the management  of resources Optimizing the management of resources to preserve them, mainly in  regions where they are scarce, consists in: : ■optimizing water treatment processes and promoting process  water recycling; ■reducing water loss through improvements to distribution network  efficiency. In many cities, 20% to 50% of the water produced is lost mainly  through leaks in distribution networks. Veolia has made reducing  losses from networks one of its priorities. Certain municipal contracts set a leak reduction objective, particularly  targeting network leaks: for example, drinking water network  performance improvement objective of 79% to 85% by 2023 for the  city of Lille. Water consumption and efficiency rate of networks serving over 50,000 inhabitants 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Target Efficiency rate of drinking water networks (as a%) –  current scope  71.4 %  72.5 %  73.4 %  73.1 %  74.6 %  74.8 % / Efficiency rate of drinking water networks (as a%) –  pro forma 2019-2023  -  72.5 %  73.4 %  75.6 %  76.3 %  76.4 % ≥ 75 % ⁽¹⁾ (1) The 2023 objective is included in the 2019-2023 pro forma scope. The increase in the drinking water network efficiency rate, for a pro forma scope, was due to the implementation of leak reduction programs (leak  detection, break-up of networks into sectors, improved metering control, etc.). This demonstrates the Group’s ability to improve the efficiency of  complex systems. The 2027 new objectives are described in Section 4.2.1.5. 2024-2027 Environmental Plan above. Optimization of water abstraction in the Waste business The Veolia Waste business accounted for 0.2% of its water  abstraction. For optimization purposes, Veolia created a “Water  Efficiency” guide which identifies three types of measure:  limitation of losses, optimization of consumption and alternative  water resource solutions. For each Waste activity, this guide lists  the possible actions, technical details, cost components,  implementation difficulties, recommendations, water-saving  benefits and examples of on-site application. In the Waste  business, 3/4 of the water is consumed by the incineration  activity, particularly  certain incinerators which use a wet flue  treatment process; water reuse is the solution primarily adopted  for this activity. 4.2.5.3.4  Encourage responsible consumption  by users and digitalization Preserving water resources also consists in promoting limited uses  through awareness-raising, price incentive policies or individual water  meters or remote metering. Veolia has developed and now offers its local authority customers  tools to raise awareness and empower end-users to manage their  consumption. Performance contracts Veolia develops new types of contract aimed to enhancing the  measures implemented to reduce water consumption. The historical  compensation model based on cubic meters distributed does not  encourage energy-saving measures as they could threaten the  economic balance of services. These performance contracts are a way  to reduce the water consumption of users and public clients in a  context where water resources are scarce. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Environmental performance VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 247  ===== PAGE 250 ===== MEL water distribution contract Veolia Eau Hauts de France pledged in its water distribution contract for the MEL (Métropole Européenne Lilloise) to save 65 million m3 of  abstracted water over 10 years, i.e. the equivalent of one year’s consumption. This contract, which began on January 1, 2024, also includes  support for 1,200 “major consumers” to save 15% of water consumption. A substantial financial penalty is imposed should these commitments  not be achieved. Veolia Eau Hauts de France is compensated using social tariffs which, in contrast to progressive tariffs, take into account the  number of persons per household and their means. A €1.1 million annual price cap was planned to limit household water bills to 3% of their  income in accordance with OECD recommendations. Perpignan water and sanitation contract In 2023, Veolia Eau Pyrénées-Orientales won a 12-year water production and sanitation contract with Perpignan Méditerranée Métropole. In this  area already affected by climate change and drought, Veolia has pledged under the 12-year contract to reduce drinking water abstraction by 36  million m3 (i.e. saving of 13.4%) by improving network performance and reusing wastewater. Consumption and sobriety  In 2023, Veolia rolled out the Eco Eau initiative to support regions and industries in dealing with water resource scarcity using educational tools,  a voluntary commitment charter and advice. A wide range of stakeholders have already adopted the approach: municipalities (i.e. around 3  three million individuals), businesses, NGOs, schools and even media.

ServO, management center of the largest water department in France Veolia Eau Ile de France designed ServO, an integrated management center equipped with the latest technologies, for SEDIF (the Greater Paris  Water Authority). With 1.3 billion items of data processed, it is used to manage and monitor the largest water department in France: 4.5 million  inhabitants, in 150 municipalities in Greater Paris. ServO incorporates all service components: distributing quality water in sufficient quantity,  responding to all events affecting production or distribution, providing water consumers with precise information in real time and  guaranteeing the network’s technical performance. It is crucial to ensure continuous water supply, safety of consumer health, and crisis  prevention and management. The “Hubgrade” digital suite In 2023, at the Smart City Expo in Barcelona, Veolia announced the worldwide roll-out of its digital solution suite Hubgrade that is designed to  coordinate water, energy and waste production and consumption to help cities and industries optimize the management of their resources and  safeguard them. With over 10,000 sites already connected across the world, Veolia draws on its vast network of 60 monitoring centers  managed by 500 experts and data scientists. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Environmental performance 248 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 251 ===== 4.2.5.3.5  Develop alternative resources The development of alternative resources also helps save resources, such as the reuse of purified water, the retrieval of rainwater, groundwater  recharge and sea water desalination. Volume of water reused from collected and treated wastewater 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Target Volume of water reused from collected and treated wastewater⁽¹ ⁾  (in millions of m³ ) 401 350 299 989 1,144 ì (1) The indicator includes the Water and Waste businesses. In 2021, the decrease in water volumes reused from collected and  treated wastewater was mainly due to the sale by the Group of its  investment in the Shenzhen water concession in China. In 2022, the  increase in volume was linked to the integration of Suez activities,  including several sanitation contracts with water reuse, such as in  Spain, Chile, Jordan and the United States. The 2027 new objectives are described in Section  4.2.1.5. 2024-2027  Environmental Plan above. Durban and West Basin, reducing water stress by reusing  wastewater South of Durban Veolia recycles 98% of the water produced by  the eThekwini wastewater treatment plant. The 47,500  m3 of  wastewater treated daily (equivalent to 15 Olympic swimming  pools) is used by local industries in their production processes.  Recycling water for industrial use helps to reduce water  abstraction in the environment and to concentrate freshwater  resources on the production of drinking water for  220,000  inhabitants of the Durban agglomeration. In West Basin, California, the Edward C. plant Little produces  around 150,000 m 3 of water every day, making it one of the  largest water recycling facilities in the United States. It produces  five distinct water qualities, meeting different criteria for various  uses (industrial water, municipal irrigation, groundwater  recharge, etc.), reducing the pressure on water resources in a  region highly exposed to drought.   As Samra, supplying water for agricultural irrigation The As Samra plant in Jordan was designed to treat 100 million  m3 of wastewater each year and produces high-quality recycled  water that can be used for irrigation, covering nearly 10% of the  country’s water consumption (corresponding to around 4,000  farms or 10,000 hectares irrigated). The Jourdain Project, reusing freshwater from wastewater  treatment, a circular economy model In the Vendée region in France, 9 out of 10  liters of drinking  water are produced from surface water. For the last twenty  years, the Vendée has suffered long periods of water shortages,  particularly in the summer, due to the lack of rain and a booming  tourist business. Our customer, Vendée Eau, focused on finding  alternative resources to supply the region with water. In early 2021, Veolia was selected to build and operate a refining  plant for treating wastewater before its release into a reservoir  for consumption. Veolia has undertaken to support Vendée Eau  in a 4-year R&D partnership on the fringe of the wastewater  reclaim unit’s operations. Using this facility, inaugurated in  November 2023, a total of 1.5 million m3 out of the 4.5 million m3  of wastewater treated by the city will initially be reused. This  capacity will gradually increase to between 2 two and 3 three  million m3 of treated wastewater reused by 2027, i.e. The  equivalent consumption of 60,000 inhabitants. This experiment,  a first in Europe, complies with the directives established by the  General Department of Health (DGS) on the recommendations of  the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational  Health & Safety (ANSES) to demonstrate the satisfactory levels  of health and environmental safety and the relevance of this  water reuse model. Provide water to the United Arab Emirates by desalinating  seawater In 2023, Veolia was chosen to lead a consortium through its  subsidiary SIDEM responsible for the engineering, supply and  construction of the Mirfa 2 desalination project entrusted to it by  Abu Dhabi National Energy Company PJSC (TAQA) and Engie.  Located in Abu Dhabi, this reverse osmosis seawater desalination  plant will be the third largest in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).  With a daily capacity of around 550,000 cubic meters of drinking  water, it will provide around 210,000 households with drinking  water  while  improving  efficiency  and  reducing  the  environmental footprint thanks to state-of-the-art technologies.  The project’s construction will begin in the second quarter of  2023 with commissioning scheduled for 2025.

The associated  multifaceted performance approach (see the Profile, pages 8-11 above)  expresses a commitment to support the development of the regions in  a responsible manner, which is reflected in three societal objectives: ■job and wealth creation in the territories (see Section 4.3.2 below); ■access to essential services (water and sanitation) (see Section 4.3.3  below) ■ethics and compliance (see Section 4.6 below). The Business Units worldwide are the main players in implementing  the Group’s commitments, in cooperation with the functional  departments and through the Executive Committee and zone  managers.  Firmly anchored in local regions, Veolia works with all local  stakeholders to strengthen access for all to essential services, improve  living and health conditions and promote jobs and training,  integration, economic development, and relations between industry  players and public authorities. As part of its GreenUp 2024-2027 strategic program, this commitment  was renewed and implemented according to the following objectives: ■support for local communities (Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3 below); ■ethics and compliance (see Section 4.6 below). 4.3.2  JOB AND WEALTH CREATION IN THE TERRITORIES 4.3.2.1  Risks and opportunities Due to the significant geographic diversity of its operating locations  and the very nature of its local activities, the Group faces many  challenges. Whether environmental, economic or social, the  development of Group activities creates impacts on the environment  where it operates, society and all its stakeholders, including its supply  chain (see Section 2.2.2.4 above). These diverse challenges and the need to take local requirements and  expectations into consideration are included in the Group’s  multifaceted performance strategy in respect of its objective to create  jobs and wealth in the territories. There are many opportunities for  Veolia to implement local, innovative solutions which are beneficial  both socially and economically, supporting local development and  momentum. 4.3.2.2  Policy and commitments The Group plays a leading role in local employment and development,  through its management, its local sites, its human resources policies  (see Section  4.4 below), its sustainable purchasing policies (see  Section  4.3.2.3.4 below), initiatives by the Veolia Foundation, its  constant dialogue with local stakeholders and institutions (see  Section  4.1 above), its economic partnerships, innovation and  entrepreneurship support systems, access and service development. As part of its Purpose and its Impact 2023 strategic program, Veolia is  committed to supporting the development of the regions in a  responsible manner. This commitment can be broken down into  several objectives, including job and wealth creation in the territories.  To illustrate its commitment, the Group defined a 2023 target which is  to assess each year its socioeconomic impact in terms of employment  and wealth in the countries where the Group operates. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Social performance 250 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 253 ===== In pursuing this responsible development commitment in the region  and the job and wealth creation objective in the widest sense, Veolia  seeks, through its activities, to: ■contribute to the economic and social vitality of the regions where  the Group operates; ■dialogue constantly with local communities and co-build  innovative services tailored to local contexts; ■contribute to social solidarity and the fight against exclusion,  notably through the Veolia Foundation; ■establish responsible relationships with our suppliers. The dialogue and links which Veolia creates with all stakeholders (see  Section 4.1.3 above) are the tools needed to implement the initiatives  and achievements presented in this section.  To understand and explain its impact, Veolia has measured its  socioeconomic footprint worldwide in collaboration with the  consultancy firm Utopies. The model, which includes databases from  tens of national and international statistical sources, helps reproduce  the actual economy in the most realistic manner possible.  The study conducted in 2023 on fiscal year 2022 helped quantify the  impacts of Veolia activities beyond their direct impacts (employment  and added value of the Group). The indirect impacts linked to the  supply chain, and impacts caused by household consumption (Veolia’s  employees and suppliers) and public spending are also measured. The  financial flows of 58  countries where Veolia operates, representing  over 98% of the Group revenue, were analyzed.

The sharp increase in 2023 results was primarily due to specific macro- economic context. The impact of the integration of Suez activities in  2022 in numerous countries and entities mostly contributed to the  40% rise in mass payroll between 2021 and 2022. A geopolitical and  economic context established long-term global inflation (around 9%  in 2022 and 7% in 2023, according to the International Monetary Fund).  Veolia’s annual socio-economic footprint studies completed since  2020 are available on a dedicated platform, accessible from the  Group’s website (1). 4.3.2.3  Actions and results 4.3.2.3.1  Contribute to local development The Group contributes to local development through the performance  of delegated public services and the significant local investments that  it makes for the repair, maintenance and development of  infrastructures and sustainable access to services. As close as possible  to local social issues, Veolia accompanies regions in their transition to  tackle challenges which they face, and supports their development,  innovation and entrepreneurship. Reinvesting locally and measuring its regional  socioeconomic footprint The majority of the Group’s spending is carried out in the regions  where Veolia operates. This creation of wealth, including direct or  indirect jobs linked to its activities, cannot be offshored and therefore  contributes to local development and economies and enhancing the  value of their human potential. In 2023, as part of its commitment to support regional development  through responsible means, Veolia locally reinvested more than 90%  of its spending, in line with its objective to keep it above 80%. 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Target Percentage of spending reinvested locally  86.3 %  87.3 %  90.5 %  90.9 %  90.2 % Maintain the percentage of spending  reinvested locally above 80% Scope (as a% of Group revenue)  74.3 %  74.4 %  98.9 %  98.2 %  98.4 % - CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Social performance VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 251 (1) www.veolia.com/en/purpose/our-multifaceted-performance  ===== PAGE 254 ===== CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Social performance 252 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 255 ===== Supporting innovation and entrepreneurship Veolia’s involvement in regional economic development is reflected in  different open innovation systems. They encourage the emergence of  technical, social and environmental solutions with local entrepreneurs  and constitute opportunities for joint development. Technological Open Innovation Veolia relies on its in-house expertise and an ecosystem comprising a  set of players which interact to promote innovation (see Section 1.4.5  above). Social Open Innovation The social Open Innovation program (Pop Up) was created in 2014 with  two strategic objectives: strengthen the Group’s local roots by  supporting the emergence and growth of social entrepreneurs and  develop with these entrepreneurs innovative solutions with a high  social impact. Locally, Veolia works with social entrepreneurship  incubators (MakeSense, Antropia, Ronalpia, Ennovent, etc.), but also  alongside other partners – public authorities, companies and other  regional social players – to detect, select and support entrepreneurs  responding to regional challenges. The incubators also facilitate  experimental collaboration between these entrepreneurs and local  Veolia entities, to develop new solutions linked to the Group’s  activities (improved access to services for users living in poverty or  informal settlements, creation of new local outlets for product  recovery, etc.). Pop Up is fully in line with Veolia’s multi-faceted performance  objectives and contributes in particular to the creation of jobs and  wealth in the territories, the development of innovative solutions and  customer and consumer satisfaction. Key figures for the Pop Up program in 2023: ■13 partner incubators (in France, India, Japan and Mexico); ■around 200 social entrepreneurs incubated since the beginning of  the program; ■over 20 collaborations between Veolia and social entrepreneurs. Veolia India launched the Pop-Up India 2.0 project, with the support of  the incubator Ennovent, to focus on waste recovery. The program  successfully identified two high-potential start-ups, Agri2Power (A2P)  and Krimanshi,. A2P developed a marketplace for biofuel trading,  using Artificial Intelligence and satellite imaging to monitor the  combustion of straw and provide social and environmental impact  metrics. Krimanshi created a insect protein production facility to feed  poultry and fish, promoting the set-up of a circular economy and  reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Pop-Up India 2.0 program  was terminated in April 2023. Both start- ups presented their results  and proposed scalable solutions with major environmental and  economic benefits, thereby contributing to the positive change in the  resource management sector in India. Projects are being analyzed for  collaborations with Veolia. France, Bordeaux: The maison RéVée, a zero-waste third place Veolia worked with the Association for Territories and Social  Innovation (ATIS) on the emergence of social innovations. One of  their projects was the maison ReVée, a zero-waste and circular  economy third place in Bègles. This combines an educational,  recreational, catering and work space with a zero-waste  approach. It enables the general public to access item repair  workshops, a store offering items from local companies that are  part of the circular economy and/or help us to reduce our daily  waste and a co-working space proposing workshops and training  based on a zero- waste approach. 4.3.2.3.2  A sustainable engagement with local  communities Strengthen the positive impact for affected communities Veolia has formalized a policy acknowledging its responsibility to  respect human rights and its ability to contribute to positive impacts  on human rights. This human rights policy is based on the principles  and guidelines defined by leading international organizations such as  the United Nations, the OECD and the International Labor  Organization.  It reconfirms Veolia’s undertaking to respect the rights of populations  affected by the company’s activities, and in particular the right to a  safe environment and protection of resources, the right to water and  sanitation, and the rights and lifestyles of local communities (see  Section 4.6.4.2 below). This framework applies to all Group entities. Local entities are  responsible for its deployment and implement initiatives to monitor  the Group’s commitment to respecting the rights of communities in  line with the specific challenges of each entity. It is an opportunity for  Veolia to implement local innovative and socially and economically  effective solutions to help the growth and development of regions  while respecting business ethics, Human Rights and, more generally,  its duty of care vis-a-vis all the stakeholders involved in its activities.

This commitment started in 1997 with the partnership to employ Aboriginal  people signed with Indigenous Business Australia. In 2013, The North West Alliance joint venture was created with the Aboriginal Australian  company, Our Country. This alliance has become the biggest provider of waste management services in the Pilbara region. This was followed by  the 2014-2016 and 2017-2019 RAP, strategic frameworks to combat inequality and to develop long-term ties  with local communities and  organizations. In the 2019-2022 plan, Veolia prioritized action in the areas of education, employment, community partnerships and  collaboration with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The 2022-2025 plan sets out Veolia’s vision for a future in which all Aboriginal  and Torres Strait Islander people are recognized as indispensable to contributing to a sustainable Australia.  This plan has quantified targets: ■have 4% of Veolia employees from indigenous and island populations; ■spend at least 20 million dollars with suppliers from aboriginal or island companies over the plan period; ■raise cultural awareness among all employees and teach them about the culture of aboriginals; ■partner with at least five “First Nations” community organizations each year to achieve tangible results in employment, training, education  and capacity building. An adapted governance was also set up, with an ExCom member sponsor, a dedicated project manager and a steering committee involving  representatives of Veolia’s various departments. Chile: Impact on communities in the strategic plan Aguas Andinas, a Veolia subsidiary in Chile, included in its  strategic plan a social pillar, aimed at building sustainable  relations with local communities. Among the commitments:  strengthen the trustworthy relationship with communities and  collaborate to achieve the target of universal water access,  promote dialogue with communities, increase awareness-  raising regarding water and climate protection and support the  development of social initiatives. Targets were therefore defined  for 2024 such as strengthening the trustworthy relations with  the various interest groups, based on transparency and  confidence. Aguas Andinas develops strategic projects put  together with the communities by setting up participatory  bodies that encourage discussions about community needs. Six  working groups were therefore set up, with meetings every three  months and combining various local players - such as  municipality representatives, district associations, healthcare  centers or rural drinking water  services - to analyze their needs  and implement tailored responses, with a positive impact on  local development. One of the projects launched is the toll-free  number Aló Vecino which enables inhabitants from the  communities living around the Santiago wastewater treatment  plant to report odor problems and Aguas Andinas to roll out  adapted corrective measures. Dialogue with local communities Veolia implements initiatives to foster dialogue with local  communities and residents, including targeted information and  awareness campaigns and notably neighborhood meetings, meetings  with local officials and associations, tours of facilities and open days to  keep the general public informed, as well as volunteering. Veolia is involved with these communities in a variety of ways,  including  through  regional  socioeconomic  diagnoses,  the  implementation of community links and the provision of methodology  tools to organize dialogue with stakeholders at a regional level. In India, community outreach teams called the Social Welfare Team  form a link between local people and the local technical and customer  services. Their primary mission is to explain the benefits of the  proposed 24/7 drinking water supply services. The teams spend a lot of  time in the field to build trust with citizens, discussing the services  with the local population and organizing meetings with the  community, community leaders and local political representatives to  raise awareness of responsible water use issues, conduct constructive  feedback sessions and perform the necessary investigations and  studies. The team also organizes workshops in schools and colleges on  the advantages of a constant water supply. In Australia, through the Veolia Mulwaree Trust, Veolia supports a  large number of small rural and regional communities near the  Woodlawn eco-neighborhood. The Trust works alongside community  organizations to support improvements in infrastructure and facilities  through community-led projects. The Trust also aims to support  individuals from these communities in their higher education and  creative artistic pursuits. Since 2005, Veolia Mulwaree Trust has  distributed around $12  million across more than 1 400 community  projects. In Colombia, Veolia has deployed processes for dialogue, mediation  and local information in the cities where it operates. Participation in  various community meetings and working groups comprising players  such as social leaders, spiritual leaders, local board presidents, elected  officials and municipal councilors, to integrate health, education and  the environment and improve service delivery. Education and fun  events in local districts are organized to raise residents’ awareness of  their rights and duties in terms of public services, but also sustainable  development issues. Mobile customer service points help respond to expectations and  needs as close as possible to local people, in particular isolated  individuals or individuals with reduced mobility. In total, in 2023, more than 175,000 users were supported and over  2,000 managers were assisted by these informative exchange  processes. Local community outreach initiatives Volunteering initiatives led by Veolia employees in close conjunction  with local organizations and populations, and supporting social or  environmental causes, are an important means of adopting a dialogue  approach tailored to specific local contexts. Veolia in Poland launched a local project “In the shadow of the heart of Łódź” covering the revitalization of the area around the Łódź city stadium with biodiversity objectives: tree planting and installation of recreational benches. This project was selected by citizens as part of the city’s participatory budget. In Bulgaria, Veolia has partnered since 2017 with the Health & Social  Development Foundation (HESED), an NGO which seeks to implement  actions and activities contributing to the social, educational, domestic  and cultural development of Roma communities living in the Sofia  region. Through volunteer employees, Veolia has developed an  educational program on the theme of water and works every year  with children aged three to seven and their parents, in the HESED  Foundation educational centers. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Social performance 254 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 257 ===== In the Sultanate of Oman, Veolia supports the Namat competition  organized by the Environment Society of Oman (ESO). In 2023, 84  schools in the Sultanate took part in this competition which aims to  promote environmental awareness and resource conservation.  Students are supported by volunteers from the Environmental Society  of Oman and Veolia Oman to be innovative and address an  environmental challenge in their school and community, such as  waste, water or energy management. Through the actions of the Foundation, which are performed as close  as possible to local populations and in partnership with local  organizations, Veolia supports different social and professional  integration initiatives (see Section 4.3.2.3.3 below) as well as  development assistance projects (see Section 4.3.3.3.4 below). Citizen mobilization program for employees Through its local services and its offices and employees in the  field, Veolia is a major contributor to regional growth and forms  part of their ecosystem, in connection with the various  stakeholders. The Group developed Resourcers for communities,  a civic mobilization program, to facilitate the direct engagement  of its employees with local associations. Tested in several pilot  entities in France and Morocco, it is currently being rolled out in  France, particularly at the headquarters in Aubervilliers. This  program provides a framework for volunteers wishing to  conduct solidarity and general interest missions focusing on the  environment and inclusion, and facilitates the move towards  action through a dedicated platform which relays the needs of  local associations. Beyond this initiative, mobilization is now  possible in all Group BUs in line with the Veolia Cares policy (see  Section 4.4.4.4 below). In 2023, this represented 3,500 mobilized  FTEs for 1,400 actions undertaken with more than 700 partners  worldwide. The aim is to widely deploy this program across the Group. Educating and raising awareness of sustainable  development Each year, various sustainable development education programs and  awareness campaigns are conducted in the regions where the Group  operates through open days at facilities. These help explain  sustainable development challenges, supporting dialogue with local communities. In the United Kingdom, over 900 facility visits were proposed to the  public. During the year, more than 53,000 people visited, including  36,300 students. Each year, thousands of people are invited to visit commercial  buildings, art galleries and much more across Milwaukee in the United  States, during the city’s annual Open Day. Once again this year, Veolia  sponsored the event and invited local people to visit the Jones Island  facility, inaugurated in 1926 and classified as a national civil  engineering historical monument in 1974. This facility is reputed  throughout the world as a pioneer in modern wastewater treatment  technology. In the Czech Republic, Veolia proposes primary school educational  programs and competitions in conjunction with Recyklohraní, a  recycling NGO that produces teaching materials. The objective was to  draw attention to the importance of water and how households and  even schools can reduce consumption. The materials are distributed  free of charge to schools and are available for free online. The program  includes educational workshops for teachers. 150 schools participated  in the competitions and 3,800 schools, or around 95,000 pupils, used  the teaching materials. In Hong Kong, Veolia built and manages one of the largest and most  advanced sludge treatment facilities in the world. Known as T-PARK,  the installation, which is 100% water and power self-sufficient,  combines cutting-edge technologies and environmental living. With a  gallery for visitors, a conference room, an observation platform and  large green spaces, the installation adds an awareness and public  education aspect to sustainable development. In 2023, the site  welcomed more than 11,500 visitors from NGOs, and local  communities as well as 700 people in educational and awareness- raising workshops. For the twelfth year running, Veolia Latin America and the  Organization of Ibero-American States combined efforts to support  the Alrededor de Iberoamérica program. As part of this program,  Veolia participates in the development of teaching materials. These  change every year and are distributed to participating schools in paper  and digital format. Since 2012, more than 230,000 schoolchildren and  students from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Panama, Ecuador,  Mexico and Peru have participated in educational activities on topics  such as protecting biodiversity, the circular economy, renewable  energy, recycling and protecting marine biodiversity. In 2023, 15  companies and 2 native communities took part in the program. In Colombia, Veolia conducted many environmental educational  activities across the country under the “Environmental Guardians” and  “Alrededor de Iberoamérica” programs. In 2023, over 39,600 children  benefited from awareness-raising actions in their schools on  environmental protection practices (preserving natural resources,  waste  management,  water  use).  Local  communities  virtual  educational workshops were also organized for global events such as  Water Day, Environment Day and Recycling Day. Veolia Spain develops educational programs, teaching aids and  recreational activities enabling students to understand the  importance of water as a vital resource and learn about its  natural cycle, responsible consumption and the challenges of  sustainable management. Educational programs, such as  EscolAQUA and Aqualogía, go beyond the classroom, extending  to the entire community. The company organizes activities  involving children, young people and adults to promote water  and the environment. It also works closely with local  organizations to conduct awareness campaigns on the  importance of preserving and protecting water resources and  promoting sustainable water use practices. These programs and visits to facilities and awareness-raising  campaigns on responsible water consumption and the current  drought situation have involved over 560,000 people. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Social performance VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 255  ===== PAGE 258 ===== 4.3.2.3.3  Encourage social and professional  integration Veolia, a responsible local employer Through its management and human resources (see Section  4.4  below) and purchasing (see Section 4.3.2.3.4 below) policies, Veolia is a  major employer in the regions where it operates. It is also a provider of  qualifications, equal opportunities and social protection for its  employees and employees of partner companies and organizations  (suppliers,  associations,  etc.).  The  Company  currently  has  218,288 employees and acts as a responsible employer and a creator of  business growth and social solidarity (employment, training and the  local economy) in the regions where it operates, through: ■making work-study contracts a priority in external recruitment.The  Group is convinced that work-study schemes are an excellent way  of acquiring skills, in particular under apprenticeship and  professionalization contracts (3,510 trainees in 2023 - see Section  4.4.4.2.1 below); ■its insertion actions through economic activity, in coordination  with the Veolia Foundation and in partnership with insertion  organizations (see below); ■creating pathways between the Group and professionals and  partners involved in training, orientation and employment to  prepare young people and those most alienated from the  workplace for the Group’s businesses: “Second Chance Schools”,  local community support networks in France, the “Elles Bougent”  and “Sport dans la ville” associations, etc.; ■a diversity policy and actions: fighting discrimination, supporting  the employment of people with disabilities (see Section  4.4.5.3  below); ■a  policy  of  openness  towards  training  sectors  (schools,  universities): hiring of student interns, Trophées de la Performance  (performance awards), summer schools, student forums and fairs  (see Section 4.4.4 below). Terra Academia, a coalition of committed players Supported by Veolia and its economic, academic, public and  associative partners, the School of Ecological Transformation is  deployed through a regional network of campuses, the first two  of which opened in early 2024 in Arras and Paris, France. Terra  Academia is aimed at young people with diploma training  programs in green careers, active professionals or those  undergoing a career change with training in skills required for  ecological transformation and certificate training programs in  short-staffed professions, as well as entrepreneurs, managers  and executives, elected officials and directors of community  services, with short sessions and modular courses. In concrete  terms, an initial course to learn about ecological transformation  professions for young people has been launched since January  2024 with the Maison de l’emploi et des Métiers d’Arras and the  “Terra Innov” program to help entrepreneurs incorporate  ecological issues into their business model will be launched in  the spring of 2024. Community initiatives adapted to a specific local context are rolled-  out in the different geographies: ■the Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) 2022-2025 in Australia aimed  at Aboriginal Australians; ■the collaboration of Amendis, Veolia Morocco, with the Enfants du  Paradis association to support the socio-professional insertion of  young people with mental health issues; ■in 2023, Veolia in Spain continued to deploy its social initiative  strategy, focusing on 3 main themes: educational opportunities  (such as FP DUAL or green job training), improving employability  (such as OLA, a program to help people benefiting from low water  tariffs find employment) and sustainable communities (through  volunteering, awareness campaigns, etc.). More than 16,600  people have benefited from these measures. To develop this  strategy, the company worked with various strategic and local  partners;  ■to support local employment, Veolia India partnered with a local  NGO, Life Project for Youth (LP4Y), to organize training sessions for  disadvantaged children. The training focuses on the development  of professional skills such as the use of computer resources, CV  writing, communication. A workshop was organized as well as a  session with around ten Veolia employees which benefited about  50 young individuals; ■in Colombia, Veolia promotes overcoming vulnerable situations  and the exercise of citizenship by former combatants through  training and employment. Veolia has therefore partnered with  ARN,  the  government  agency  for  reincorporation  and  normalization, which supports and advises demobilized individuals  transitioning to peace and legality. The Cartagena, Pasto,  Manizales, Bucaramanga, Aguachica and Yopal Business Units have  therefore received requests from individuals having completed  their reincorporation into civilian life program; ■in the United States, Veolia’s Regeneration and Recovery Solutions  (RRS) Business Unit joined the Future of STEM Scholars Initiative  (FOSSI), which offers scholarships to students at historically black  colleges and universities (HBCU). This initiative seeks to help  underrepresented groups access and succeed in STEM (science,  technology, engineering and mathematics) careers in chemical  industries. Veolia will finance two four-year scholarships and offer  students internships coordinated by FOSSI; ■in the Czech Republic, Veolia’s STARTER program supports the  creation of new long-term jobs in two major regions with the  highest unemployment rates. The Veolia Endowment Fund  supports projects in the Moravia-Silesia and Olomouc regions and  particularly craft-industry projects that bring social benefits to the  population. Since 2000, over 2,500 jobs have been created,  including 391 for people with disabilities. ■Veolia United Kingdom worked with Comensura and the Impellam  Group to offer 50 internships to Ukranian refugees. Taking account of the informal sector The informal sector covers significant social and environmental  challenges and can, in some countries, represent a crucial challenge  for Veolia’s activity. The Group develops programs to integrate and  increase the efficiency of existing informal collection networks,  notably through the use of digital technologies, and thereby offer  solutions tailored to local issues. In India, as part of the social Open Innovation approach, “Pop Up by  Veolia” (see Section 4.3.2.3.1 below), Veolia identified the Hasiru Dala  Innovations Private Limited social company. This organization works  to create livelihoods for informal waste collectors through inclusive  companies in Bangalore and the surrounding areas. Veolia has linked  up with Hasiru Dala to create training modules through an interactive  approach, aiming to improve safety standards and working conditions  of waste collectors. In Indonesia, Veolia is implementing various programs to ensure  responsible and inclusive plastic collection. Veolia’s PET recycling plant  in Pasuruan, Indonesia, has committed to achieving fully sustainable  raw material sourcing by 2026. In Indonesia, this material mostly  comes from informal waste collection centers, raising issues regarding  the sustainability of the activity and social responsibility. A joint  project bringing together Veolia, Danone-AQUA, the Danone  Ecosystem Fund and two local NGOs, YPCII and JARAK, was launched in  February 2019 to structure the value chain and improve existing PET  collection centers and make them more efficient and sustainable. This  objective gave rise to a series of activities in collection centers  including skills development training sessions for informal collectors,  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Social performance 256 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 259 ===== improvements to existing infrastructure, PPE and equipment  donations and, more broadly, improvements to working conditions  and health and safety on the sites. The project aims to develop ten  sustainable collection centers with traceability in the supply chain, to  collect 5,400 metric tons of PET bottles per year. This program  strengthens relations with suppliers, making them loyal to Veolia. In  2023, this program brought social benefits to more than 2,100 people. The Veolia Sustainable Collection Centers (VSCC) project is developed  and supported by purchasing and sustainable development teams in  Indonesia. It targets all collection centers in the Indonesian  archipelago and aims to achieve a 100% sustainable supply by 2025.  Among the actions taken in 2022, Veolia’s CSR teams in Indonesia  documented and distributed to collection centers a booklet containing  recommendations on best practices to implement covering health and  safety, environmental management, child labor, discrimination and  forced labor. Quarterly visits were organized, as well as training and  regular  discussions  with  collection  centers  to  address  all  implementation issues and challenges.  This project is supported by quantified objectives for  2021 to 2025: ■support 25 collection centers each year: ■collect 24,000 tons of plastic waste by the end of 2025; ■train 200 people each year; ■secure or improve the incomes of 200 families each year. Colombia: the “Recuperador Amigo” program This program which started in Manizales is a cooperation model  with informal waste collectors. It relies on collaboration with  multiple parties (government, civil society, business) in order to  include informal collectors in an organized waste collection, sale  and recycling circuit. This model helps improve recyclers’ quality  of life, while increasing the volume of waste recycled. Deployed  in the cities of Manizales, Pasto, Cartagena, Aguachica, Cúcuta,  Palmira, Buga and Tuluá, it involves over 700 waste collector  organizations. This program was recognized in 2022 by ANDI (National  Association of Entrepreneurs of Colombia) and its partners as an  inspiring initiative for the private sector’s contribution to  building a fairer and more inclusive country. Support for the transition to work and creating social  cohesion with the Veolia Foundation Support for the transition to work and social cohesion is one of the  Veolia Foundation’s priority areas of action, along with development  assistance and humanitarian emergencies and environmental and  biodiversity protection. In particular, it supports initiatives and  structures that encourage the return to work of people outside  mainstream society (e.g. work sites, associations and companies that  foster professional reinsertion through economic activity, training,  social assistance, entrepreneurial solidarity and microcredits, etc.).  Beyond just financial support, the Veolia Foundation aims to create  pathways between supported projects and initiatives and the Veolia  Business Units to encourage integration and a long-term return to work. Multi-year partnerships Through its multi-year partnerships, the Veolia Foundation supports  associations involved with the social and professional reinsertion of  the most disadvantaged populations. ■The major partnerships are: Territoire Zéro Chômeurs de Longue  Durée (see below), an innovative scheme to put an end to long-  term unemployment This voluntary system allows accompanied  persons to be employed on permanent contracts by social and  solidarity economy enterprises; ■L’École des cuistots migrateurs, a reference center for training in  catering trades for refugees. Projects to support the transition to work and social  cohesion in 2023 Beyond these historic partnerships, each year the Veolia Foundation  supports various associations and companies working to help the  most underprivileged transition to work and to improve neighborhood  social cohesion. In 2023, the Foundation supported eleven projects that  help people find employment and build social cohesion, such as Life  Project for Youth (LP4Y) in India and Indonesia or la Traverse in  Bergerac (France). Zero long-term unemployment (TZLD) TZLD (Territoire Zéro Chômeurs de Longue Durée) is an  innovative scheme to put an end to long-term unemployment.  Trialed in January 2017 under a law passed unanimously by the  French Parliament in February  2016, it is being piloted in ten  regions of 5,000 to 10,000 inhabitants thanks to the  involvement of several NGOs. The scheme is founded on a  conviction: transferring the social cost of unemployment to jobs  that meet local needs enables regional economic development  to be combined with social cohesion and ending long-term  unemployment. Specifically, jobs are created by employment creation companies  (Entreprises à but d’emploi, EBE) assisted by the French State,  which recruit, on a voluntary basis, long-term unemployed on  minimum wage permanent employment contracts, with the  working hours they choose. What do they do? They are entrusted  with work that is locally useful but abandoned by the traditional  sector as not considered sufficiently profitable. TZCLD projects therefor complement, with proven success,  existing regional back-to-work initiatives and particularly those  developed by organizations that promote insertion through  economic activity (Structures de l’insertion par l’activité  économique, SIAE). The Veolia Foundation supports the national organization  carrying the program and seven territories recently approved:  Bouffémont-Attainville-Moiselle (Val-d’Oise), Vannes-Ménimur  (Morbihan),  Pontchâteau  (Loire-Atlantique),  Villeurbanne  (Rhône), Joinville (Haute-Marne), Le Teil (Ardèche) and Livron sur  Drôme (Drôme).

Subcontracting is carried out by local and  small-scale  players  (small  and  medium-sized  enterprises,  intermediate-sized enterprises, etc.); ■industrial equipment and materials and mobile equipment, at the  core of the business operations carried out for the Group’s major  customers, represent a significant portion of energy consumption.  These purchases are therefore fully costed over the life cycle. Veolia’s sustainable purchasing policy is based on four principles,  measured by three indicators. Monitoring indicator 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 1/ Engaging suppliers Share of contracts including sustainable  development clauses  71 %  76 %  88 %  93 % 89 % 2/ Evaluating their CSR performance Share of strategic suppliers ¹  evaluated  in the past three years  61 %  70 %  75 %  81 % 77  % 3/ Contributing to local development External spending on the protected and  adapted sector 10.40M€ 8.70M€ 11.00M€ 12.10M€ 10.40M€ (1) A strategic supplier directly contributes to the Group’s strategy and has a critical role in Veolia industrial processes (industrial equipment, production energies, chemical products,  rolling stock and major telecoms & IT operators). It represents a recurring expense at Group or Business Unit level. The Sustainable Purchasing program The Purchasing Department developed a new Sustainable  Purchasing program in 2021. A true transformation, this program  aims to align the purchasing strategy with the Group’s Purpose  and its multifaceted performance model, to comply with new  regulatory and non-financial reporting requirements, control  risks in the supplier chain, integrate supplier innovation through  new business models by creating differentiating value for our  offerings and finally, to affirm the strategic role of purchasing in  ecological and social transformation, with our stakeholders. Governance  Led and managed by the Group’s Purchasing Department’s, the  program is supported by an international network of  ambassadors. A real community, they meet several times a year  to discuss the deployment of the program and good local  practices. Five pillars of the sustainable purchasing program  The program is founded on four pillars relating to defining themes and  a fifth cross-cutting pillar to support change management: 1/ Decarbonize the supply chain This program contributes directly to reducing the Group’s GHG  emissions across all three scopes. Environmental performance is taken  into account in purchasing strategies to promote equipment with low- carbon technologies, seek energy efficiency, introduce alternative  energies and promote renewable energies. The TCO ( Total Cost of  Ownership ) is systematically taken into account when selecting the  most energy-intensive equipment.  Digital prescription solution for the replacement of electric pumps To assist operating staff as well as possible and manage the renewal  of its pumps, Veolia, in partnership with Greenflex, has developed a  prescription solution for this equipment using a TCO approach.  Deployed in France and abroad, it enables: CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Social performance 258 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 (2) Based on the 2023 annual consolidation scope.  ===== PAGE 261 ===== ■implementation and energy consumption costs to be simulated for  the different equipment; ■purchasing gains to be generated by calculating the new TCO of  the replaced model; ■energy consumption savings to be achieved of 8.1 GWh in 2023 and  therefore 480 metric tons of CO2 to be avoided; ■the refocusing of needs on referenced suppliers according to the  prescribers’ requirements (buy better).  In 2023, tests were carried out with a view to including air blowers as a  new equipment category. VEGA Move, the Group’s  mobility program With its Vega Move mobility plan, Veolia continues to reduce the CO2  emissions associated with its vehicle fleet and, more generally,  employee mobility. In 2023, 73% of the vehicles available in the company car catalogue  were equipped with environmentally friendly engines. An alternative  to thermal engines is also offered for our utility vehicles. The active  vehicle fleet has been gradually electrified to comply with legal  requirements. To achieve these results, Veolia is also deploying its own  network of charging stations (more than 900 in France at the end of  2023) to facilitate the use and adoption of electric vehicles. Finally, the  Vega Move mobility plan also includes new soft mobility offers, such  as managing a fleet of more than 1,000 company bikes or sharing  resources with genuine car-sharing or carpooling solutions. These  initiatives seek to encourage Group employees to adopt more  sustainable travel methods and reduce the carbon footprint of their  journeys.  Alternative energies for trucks and construction equipment The modernization and optimization of the truck fleet are also a  priority, with the introduction of electric trucks (and trucks fueled by  compressed natural gas (CNG), and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO).  Over 50% of our mobile fleet acquisitions use these alternative energy  sources. Our suppliers were selected based on their productivity and a  reduction in CO2 emissions of more than 41%. New low-emission  models have also been added to our backhoe catalogues, while  standardization of the “Stop & Start” solution also reduces their CO2  impact. Energy efficiency certificate program In 2023, policies to replace energy-intensive equipment in France  contributed to the Group’s energy efficiency certificate program for a  total of 397 GWhc excluding exceptional projects. Calculation of scope 3 and structuring of a supplier engagement  strategy In preparing its 2024-2027 strategic program and defining its Net Zero  2050 roadmap, the Group continued in 2023 the in-depth analysis of  its scope 3 purchases, calculating emissions by purchase category and  supplier. This work helped identify around 300 high GHG emitters and  structure the Group’s relevant commitment strategy. Veolia wishes  that these companies implement plans to reduce their GHG emissions  in accordance with the requirements of the Science Based Targets  Initiative. 2/ Promote the circular economy To limit the extraction and consumption of raw materials and the  production of waste, the Sustainable Purchasing program encourages  giving consideration to the impacts of products and services  purchased over their entire life cycle and promotes internal or external  solutions for reuse or recycling. Integrating products made of recycled  and recyclable materials is also part of demands made to suppliers. Recycling plastic containers In 2021, the Purchasing Department launched a Europe-wide call for  tenders for the supply of waste collection plastic containers. Account  was taken of environmental and societal criteria enabling the roll-out  of an innovative approach: only containers manufactured using locally  sourced recycled plastic were referenced.  This project is in keeping with a circular economy approach. By placing  European plastic recycling subsidiaries in contact with referenced  suppliers, Veolia collects used containers and recycles them in its  plants and then sells the recycled plastic to its partner suppliers Life2Life At the end of 2022, the Group Purchasing Department, in partnership  with the France BUs, launched an in-house resale and rental platform  for second-hand equipment. This platform allows you to place ads and  reserve equipment: operating equipment, mobile equipment, office  equipment and furniture, IT equipment, etc. Three indicators are  calculated: metric tons of CO2 avoided, waste tonnage avoided and  savings achieved compared to the purchase of new equipment. As  such, 200 t of CO2 and 42 t of waste have been avoided in 2023.  B100 Biofuel Since March 2021, a contract has been rolled out to supply Veolia  subsidiaries in France with biofuel produced from used food oil. The  biofuel is produced by Dielix, a subsidiary of SARPI (hazardous waste  treatment in Europe).  3/ Deploy the compliance program and protect  human rights A key pillar of the policy, the Purchasing Compliance Program  comprises the following four stages: identifying risks, engaging  suppliers, evaluating their CSR performance and steering continuous  improvements.    Identifying risks In calls for tenders, supplier risks are identified using a risk mapping by  purchasing category integrating the following supplier standards:  critical importance of the expenditure, energy consumption, business  strategy, as well as CSR criteria consistent with the Group’s risk  mapping. This mapping allows buyers to identify, analyze and rank  strategic suppliers and/or suppliers in the most exposed categories  (overall score of 1 to 5). Buyers must also assess the supplier’s financial  risks, as well as geopolitical risks.  Engaging suppliers The supplier charter, updated in March  2019 and available at  veolia.com, is always sent during consultations and signed by third  parties. It helps engage and make suppliers accountable regarding  Veolia purchasing principles and standards, including their supply  chain. In order to prevent risks linked to compliance with ethical rules,  employment law and the environment regulations (human rights,  child labor, corruption, etc.), specific sustainable development and  anticorruption clauses are systematically included in new contracts or  renewed contracts/amendments with suppliers and subcontractors, as  well as Veolia’s Purpose and the Group’s health and safety  commitments. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Social performance VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 259  ===== PAGE 262 ===== At the end of 2023, 89% of active contracts in the Group supplier  database included a sustainable development clause. This clause  commits the supplier to: ■complying with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the  United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child; ■complying with ethical, social and labor law requirements,  particularly all applicable mandatory labor law regulations and  International Labor Organization (ILO) conventions: concealed  employment, child labor, forced labor, etc.; ■complying with the Group’s health and safety prevention policy; ■complying with regulations concerning the protection of the  environment and the implementation of necessary measures to  reduce its impact on the environment; ■making sure that its own suppliers and subcontractors comply with  the same obligations; ■making available and communicating its commitment policy to  Veolia. Also, the Veolia Group’s whistle-blowing process is open to suppliers  and partners and allows breaches to be reported in complete  confidentiality (corruption, discrimination, conflicts of interest, human  rights violations, fraud, anti-competitive practices, psychological  harassment, environmental law violations, health and safety, etc.). Evaluating suppliers A Compliance/CSR questionnaire was made mandatory in the bidding  phase for suppliers in global risk purchasing categories three to five,  according to the risk mapping by purchasing category. This  questionnaire contains questions about the supplier’s business and  financial information, its certifications, ethics and compliance, and  social, environmental and societal commitments and performance. In  addition,  was marked by greater use, of the Group's high-risk  suppliers assessment solution, which was widely adopted in 2022. In addition, Veolia uses an assessment system to measure the CSR  performance of its strategic and high-risk suppliers. This involves a  documentary audit and the consideration of controversial aspects  (current affairs, news, inclusion on an international sanctions list,  Politically Exposed Person in a supplier, etc.) by an independent service  provider. The analyses are performed by experts and cover twenty-one  criteria across environmental, social (human rights, etc.), ethical  (corruption,  etc.)  and  sustainable  purchasing  issues.  These  assessments are performed during calls for tenders and through  annual campaigns. The CSR performance of suppliers is taken into account when  assessing bids during calls for tenders, with a weighting of 5% to 20%.  The supplier selection grid must include environmental, social and  societal criteria. In 2023, the level of strategic suppliers assessed over the past three  years was 77%. In the same fiscal year, a total of 1,900 suppliers in all  categories were subject to a CSR assessment. This represented total  assessed expenditure of €6.6 billion. Where the resulting score does not meet Veolia requirements, the  supplier is asked to implement a corrective action plan and is then  reassessed. In 2023, 63% of suppliers who have been reassessed at  least once improved their score.  4/ Create value in our territories and encourage inclusive  sourcing Since 2019, the Purchasing Department contributes to calculating the  Group’s socioeconomic footprint, enabling a better understanding of  Veolia’s impact on its supply chain. Veolia purchases in 2022  supported over 460,200 indirect jobs in the supply chain and  generated GDP of €21  billion. On average, 87% of purchases are  sourced locally. In France, 74% of Veolia’s suppliers are SMEs  (expenditure of  €1,945 million in 2022) and 14% are mid-caps  (expenditure of €1,507 million in 2022), and 4% belong to the social  economy sector.  Protected workers sector in France In 2023, purchase expenditure, excluding VAT, in the protected  workers sector totaled €10.4 million for the France scope. Inclusive sourcing  In Australia, Veolia undertakes to increase the level of diversity of its  supply chain through greater purchases for the benefit of aboriginals  and Torres Strait islanders (see Section 4.3.2.3.2 above). Cole Supplies is  the first and only safety equipment wholesaler owned by aboriginals.  In an exemplary context of inclusiveness and partnership, Cole’s  Boomerang range of high-quality work clothing is distributed to  Veolia sites nationally with the support of the e- commerce,  warehousing and logistics network, Bunzl Safety. In 2023 in North America, Veolia Water Technologies  Solutions and  Veolia North America signed an agreement with a data service  provider to update their expenditure bases for suppliers concerned  with diversity, particularly companies owned by women or persons  from ethnic, racial and gender minorities. 5/ Support and accompany our buyers and partners In 2019, Veolia launched a buyer certification program, through an e-  learning course developed jointly with the Veolia Campus, to  strengthen the roll-out of the purchasing compliance program. In 2022, 989 buyers and compliance managers have followed an  updated and strengthened “Purchasing Compliance and CSR” e-  learning course. Training courses in how to assess suppliers are held  each year prior to the annual campaign in French, English and Spanish,  for all Group BUs. Supplier webinars were organized by the Group in  Poland and Chile in 2022. A real change in the way we buy, the Sustainable Purchasing approach  must be integrated into purchasing strategies and processes and  transforms the traditional buyer-supplier relationship into a buyer- partner relationship. Tools were therefore created in 2021 and 2022  and made available to purchasing teams: Sustainable Purchasing  sheets offering a harmonized approach for nine purchase categories; a  purchasing awards system to report, promote and share best practices  in sustainable purchasing awareness-raising for BU Purchasing  Directors, as well as Sustainable Purchasing training for Group  Ambassadors. This approach continued in 2023 with the development  of an updated version of this training, including issues related to the  decarbonization of the supply chain, and the promotion of  49  responsible purchasing initiatives in connection with the above- mentioned awards covering themes such as inclusivity, energy  transition, circular economy and business model innovation.

Through its business, close ties with local communities and its  significant regional presence (see Section  4.3.2 above), Veolia   contributes globally to the United Nations Sustainable Development  Goals. This regional network and the Group’s proximity to local issues  are an opportunity to develop services adapted to specific contexts,  and to launch development aid or emergency assistance activities for  vulnerable populations. 4.3.3.2  Policy and commitments The Group provides drinking water to 113 million people, wastewater  treatment services to nearly 103  million people, waste collection  services to 43  million people, and supplies heating to close to  8.2 million people worldwide (3). Operating worldwide, Veolia is attentive to the objectives of the  international community. Alongside delegating authorities, partners  and customers, Veolia aims to offer sustainable access to essential  water, waste and energy services, specifically in favor of targeted  policies for the most disadvantaged people or districts. As part of its Purpose and its Impact 2023 strategic program, Veolia is  committed to supporting regional development through responsible  means. This commitment can be broken down into several objectives,  including that of developing and maintaining access to essential  water and sanitation services: ■notably by developing adapted solutions in developing countries  (see Section 4.3.3.3.1 below); ■but also by favoring assistance measures for the most vulnerable  populations and those not living close to services across the world  (see Section 4.3.3.3.2 below). To illustrate its commitment, the Group has set a target for 2023 of  increasing by 12% the number of people benefiting from these inclusive  schemes and maintaining access to water and sanitation services. Commitment Objective SDG Indicator – definition 2020 Results 2021 Results 2022 Results 2023  Results 2023  Target Support regional development through responsible means Access to essential services (water and sanitation) • Number of inhabitants  benefiting from inclusive  measures for access to  water or sanitation within  contracts (1) 6.12 million inhabitants (+7%) 6.71 million inhabitants (+17.5%) 6.92  million inhabitants (+21.3%) 7.27 million inhabitants (+27.4%) '+12% vs 2019 at constant scope Sponsor Sébastien Daziano Member of the Executive Committee, Senior Executive Vice President, Strategy and Innovation (1) The typology of inclusive schemes includes: • schemes related to the price of water: social tariffs, etc.; • bill payment assistance schemes to respond to consumers’ financial difficulties: payment plans, debt remission, water vouchers, etc.; • technical solutions to promote access to water: social connection programs, infrastructure, etc. The indicator is calculated on the basis of consumer reporting (number of subscribers), to which a conversion coefficient is applied to determine the number of beneficiaries (number of  people per household – source UNDESA). As part of its GreenUp strategic program 2024-2027, Veolia has renewed its commitment to support the development of  territories in a responsible manner by aiming to support local communities: Commitment Objective SDG Indicator – definition 2023  baseline 2027 Target Support regional  development through  responsible means Support  to local  communities • Residents benefiting from inclusive  solutions to access essential  services (all activities) (2) 7.8 million inhabitants 8.4 million inhabitants (at  constant 2023 scope) Sponsor Isabelle Calvez Member of the Executive Committee, Group Human Resources  Director (2) The typology of inclusive schemes includes: • schemes related to the price of services: social tariffs, etc.; • bill payment assistance schemes to respond to consumers’ financial difficulties: payment plans, debt remission, vouchers, etc.; • technical solutions to promote access to utilities: social connection, programs,infrastructure, etc. The indicator is calculated on the basis of consumer reporting (number of subscribers), to which a conversion coefficient is applied to determine the number of beneficiaries (number of  people per household – source UNDESA). CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Social performance VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 261 (3) The number of people served takes account of people directly supplied by a distribution network operated by Veolia and people receiving water produced by Veolia but supplied by a  third party. For distribution, this relates to people identified according to local practices (INSEE in France) in the region supplied. For production without distribution, the number of  people supplied may be estimated from the volume sold to the distributor based on an average volume distributed per day and per person. The data gathered regarding the number of  people and volumes sold to third parties are updated each year. The number of people supplied with sanitation services is calculated according to the same principle, using the capacity  of wastewater treatment plants in terms of population equivalents when wastewater is collected by a third party.  ===== PAGE 264 ===== 4.3.3.3  Actions and results 4.3.3.3.1  Developing access to services in accessdeficient countries Veolia plays an active role in implementing objectives defined by the  international community. While it contributes to all 17 Sustainable  Development Goals (see Section  4.1.2 above), the Group focuses in  particular on providing access to water services for the most  vulnerable populations and those not living close to services. Veolia  therefore works with public and private partners (public authorities,  public bodies or delegating authorities, NGOs, local associations,  industrial companies, etc.) to develop solutions providing new access  to water and sanitation. These development models necessarily lead  to a sharing and transfer of skills and technologies between the  different players (see 1001fontaines partnership below). In developing and emerging countries, several years of working with  local public authorities, including through projects conducted by  Veolia Foundation (see Section  4.3.3.3.4 below), have shown that  Veolia is reliable, effective and creative and can help them develop  and implement ambitious policies to effectively achieve the SDGs. The  Group has worked with numerous municipalities in these countries  under contracts with specific goals and incentives to extend access to  and maintain services. Since the implementation of the SDGs in 2015, the Group has provided  8.5 million people with access to drinking water, and 9.8 million people  with access to sanitation services. In 2023, 1.8  million people gained  access to sanitation, and 1.4 million to drinking water (4). Veolia  participated in the commissioning of 4 new drinking water production  plants in Egypt and the commissioning of wastewater treatment plant  in Ho Chi Minh (Vietnam). Since definition of the SDGs (2015) Objective Population with new access  (in millions of people) • drinking water : 8.5 million • sanitation : 9.8 million Contribute to the United Nations sustainable development objectives, in  the same way as we contributed to the Millennium Development Goals In February 2021, Veolia signed a strategic partnership with the NGO  1001fontaines,  Accenture  and  Danone  Communities.  This  collaboration seeks to accelerate the development of decentralized  solutions for accessing water, in particular in rural regions in  developing countries. The partnership accompanies 1001fontaines in  the structuring of a sustainable and viable economic model, that can  be replicated in new geographies, enabling equitable, high-quality and  sustainable access to water. Veolia contributes, in particular, technical  support by mobilizing its social engineering expertise, its research and  development teams specializing in water treatment and the Veolia  Foundation for its expertise in decentralized water treatment in an  emergency context. This initial work led to the conceptualization of a  new kiosk model in 2021, more efficient and carbon neutral for water  production. Veolia also played the lead role in a Fasep project (support  measure for the international development of French companies),  involving young innovative French companies in the co-construction  and deployment of a pilot of ten kiosks in Cambodia, integrating the  following three objectives: ■100% decarbonizing of the drinking water supply chain with solar  energy solutions; ■optimizing and decarbonizing maintenance and quality processes  by implementing digital solutions; ■increasing drinking water capacity and improving drinking water  quality through the use of innovative treatment technologies. In November 2023, Veolia, with its partners Tergys, GREENCITYZEN and  the Veolia Foundation, inaugurated in Cambodia a new model of  water kiosk, developed with the NGO 1001fontaines, in the presence of  the Ministry of Rural Development and the Ministry of Economy. It  combines UV filtration, solar energy, and digital tools to improve  access to drinking water for 100,000 people. For Veolia, this project  seeks to improve understanding of decentralized systems, which can  be complementary to the network in many territories (especially peri-  urban areas). Projects involving decentralized access issues are being  studied with the Africa zone and Seureca.  This pilot will be fully operational in the first half of 2024. 4.3.3.3.2  Develop and maintain systems  for access to services adapted  to the local context Some groups of people have difficulty accessing or maintaining water  and sanitation services crucial for health and development. This can be  for financial reasons (high initial connection costs, cost of work  required for network connection or difficulties in paying the  subscription), or administrative, linguistic or physical reasons  (remoteness, elderly persons, etc.). As a result, Veolia works with delegating authorities, partners and  industrial customers to provide long-term access to essential services  for the most vulnerable populations and to develop locally adapted  solutions. Inclusive measures take a variety of forms: ■financial schemes related to the price of water: social tariffs, etc.; ■bill payment assistance schemes to respond to consumers’  financial difficulties: payment plans, debt remission, water  vouchers, etc.; ■technical solutions to promote access to water: social connection  programs, infrastructure, etc. These measures are accompanied by decentralized dialogue measures  with consumers to promote these solutions, in particular to the most  vulnerable populations, enabling access to water and sanitation  services and their maintenance (see Section  4.3.2.3.2 “Dialogue with  local communities” above). CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Social performance 262 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 4 Providing new access to drinking water and sanitation systems includes distribution and new production/treatment units, without final distribution, in countries with limited access,  where Veolia works to provide access to these services. For distribution, data is obtained from the number of connections by Veolia, multiplied by the average number of people per  household as estimated by INED (French National Institute of Demographic Studies). For production plants, the number of people with access to drinking water is estimated from the  volumes produced, the average water network yield observed by Veolia and the average consumption ratio observed locally. For treatment plants, the number of people is estimated  from plant treatment capacities and the average wastewater production ratio per person observed locally. The number of people supplied with sanitation services is calculated  according to the same principle, using the capacity of wastewater treatment plants in terms of population equivalents when wastewater is collected by a third party.  ===== PAGE 265 ===== In addition to these measures, Veolia also acts with these vulnerable  populations to raise awareness and promote reasonable and  responsible use of water resources: ■implementation of technical and incentive measures such as the  roll-out of smart meters and consumption-based progressive rates  (see Section 4.2.5.3.4 “Encourage responsible consumption by users  and digitalization”, above); ■Veolia seeks to raise the awareness of consumers and civil society  more  generally,  and  particularly  children,  of  responsible  consumption practices through open days at drinking water  production plants or directly in schools through education  programs (see Sections 4.3.2.3.2 “Dialogue with local communities”  and  “Educating  and  raising  awareness  of  sustainable  development” above). In numerous entities where water or energy service users receive  social measures, the local agencies organize open days in conjunction  with the consumer protection association to raise customer  awareness of rational water and electricity use. The aim is to  encourage citizens to adopt responsible resource saving behavior and  act for a general interest cause, resource preservation. Access to services Giving everyone access to high-quality services  through the ACCES approach The Group has developed a set of solutions tailored to the local  context, ensuring everyone has access to high-quality services. ACCES  expertise (technical, financial, institutional, or societal engineering) is  a good example of Veolia’s strategy and commitment. It is broken  down into three areas: ■technical engineering: serving more people with the same  resources and infrastructure, and proposing new distribution  methods; ■financial and institutional engineering: implementing socially  acceptable  price  policies,  increasing  individual  subsidized  connections, developing new social research and innovation  models, seeking innovative funding and approaching backers;  ■social and customer relations engineering: developing local  customer services and mediation initiatives to propose solutions to  the most vulnerable populations, in particular, promoting suitable  service use to optimize benefits, evaluating the impacts on quality  of life, developing partnerships and co-creating new solutions. These solutions, initially developed for water access in Africa, have  now been rolled out to all countries and services. Veolia is particularly  in favor of targeted policies for more disadvantaged populations and/ or districts. In developing and emerging countries, Veolia has shown it is reliable,  effective and creative and can help them develop and implement  ambitious policies to effectively achieve the SDGs. The Group works  with many municipalities and countries under contracts with specific  goals and incentives to extend access to and maintain services. A subsidiary of Veolia Maroc, Redal installs automatic  standpipes in districts not yet served by  the  main  water  network. In Morocco, in rural areas without drinking water networks, or in  the douar neighborhoods, access to drinking water is provided by  standard standpipes. In 2023, 57  standpipes are currently  installed in Skhirat-Témara, Salé and Rabat. In a bid to save  drinking water and preserve resources, these standpipes are  replaced by “Saqayti” (my fountain), which are equipped with a  smart card reader enabling water to be delivered to users with a  magnetic card. The cards are credited with a monthly water  volume, enabling families that qualify for this system to receive  a free monthly allowance equivalent to the essential water  needs of a family. In 2023, 21 Saqaytis have currently been  installed. Éco Solidaire offering for all service users In developed countries, the Group is also mindful of maintaining  access to services for the poorest populations, as well as for people in  situations of financial uncertainty and the homeless. In France, a  commitment  was  given  under  the  France  Water  Impact  2021-2023  strategic project to propose inclusive measures in all  offerings. The Éco Solidaire offering is founded on three pillars: ■a policy included in contracts involving both the Consumer  Department and development teams to provide for these  measures when offerings are developed; ■an organization built around a solidarity officer; ■means and actions: Housing Solidarity Fund, water vouchers, local  partnerships, advice to reduce water consumption, assistance with  administrative measures. Regional diagnoses are conducted upstream of calls for bids to identify  the regional profile and the service needs and expectations of the  population. In the organizational structure, the introduction of solidarity officers  at regional level provides a single point of contact dedicated to these  issues, in contact with consumers in payment default and local  authority social services. They are responsible for implementing the  program with all measures (Housing Solidarity Fund, water vouchers,  digital inclusion, etc.) and events with social partners and mediators. Finally, dedicated tools propose solutions to access issues, such as: ■the “water voucher” system provides means-tested assistance to  users through partial or full payment of their water bill or water  charges in the case of tenants. Vouchers may be received by users  that are not eligible for the Housing Solidarity Fund or supplement  benefits under this fund to provide significant assistance. They are  dematerialized to facilitate their grant, simplify exchanges and  improve monitoring. This format also enables the inclusion of  social housing tenants; ■prevention and support measures (with local insertion teams) to  teach consumers how to better manage consumption, for example  through eco-friendly behavior, and better understand their true  water consumption; CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Social performance VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 263  ===== PAGE 266 ===== ■the Water for all emergency fund seeks to ensure access to  essential services for the most vulnerable populations (installation  of gooseneck taps, water or sanitation connections, measures in  the event of non-payment), in migrant camps, shantytowns and  squats and also provide assistance on consumer cases with  exceptional debt (major leaks, condominium associations in  difficulty, consumers in excessive debt, etc.); ■social tariff experiments (initial cubic meters free of charge). This structuring of the approach and the introduction of solidarity  officers helped improve effectiveness and enabled a more efficient  roll-out of measures within the regions. In 2023, close to  170,000 people benefited from these inclusive measures in France, for  a total amount in excess of €4.8 million. In China, nearly 7,600 low-income or extremely poor households in  the cities of Lanzhou, Kunming and Changzhou benefited from low- cost drinking water services or initial cubic meters free of charge. In  Harbin, one of the ten most populous cities in China where Veolia  operates an urban heating network, social tariffs and free home visits  were introduced for the most vulnerable households (low-income  residents, workers with disabilities, etc.). Over 2,700 households  benefited from these initiatives in 2023. In Armenia, the authorities promoted the installation of systems for  the most vulnerable individuals in sectors affected by rising prices.  Veolia was able to support 169,000 people to maintain access to  drinking water and sanitation In Colombia, means-tested differentiated tariffs are implemented for  water and sanitation services. Low-income households receive State  subsidies for their basic needs while high-income users and industrial  and commercial establishments must pay a solidarity contribution.  These State-subsidized differentiated tariffs range from -70% to +60%  and are applied by Group companies in accordance with Columbian  law and public service regulations. In Colombia, in coordination with the Sincelejo city council, Veolia  Sabana invested in the commissioning of an aqueduct in seven  villages in the rural region of Sincelejo. These villages are mainly  indigenous local councils that have for centuries received their water  supply from surface wells or retention ponds. They now benefit from  drinking water services following the completion of an aqueduct, a  project designed and conducted by Veolia and managed by the  municipal authority. 705 families in the Sincelejo rural region benefit  from these inclusive projects for indigenous populations. In India, through local public policies, over 2,700,000  people in the  country benefit from support schemes for access to and maintenance  of drinking water services. In Nagpur, under the national slum  development program, specific actions for slum dwellers are carried  out in favor of sanitary hygiene, education, skills development training  and other awareness programs such as the preservation of natural  resources. In Nangloi, the Social Welfare Team, a community liaison  team, informs residents directly about drinking water connection  conditions (initial cubic meters free of charge) and raises awareness  about resource preservation. In Morocco, since 1999, REDAL has been implementing a social welfare  policy aimed at accelerating and extending access to services by the  population across the entire scope of the Rabat-Salé region’s  delegated management contract.  The welfare connections are  intended for households meeting specific social welfare criteria,  offering a lump-sum payment and flexible payment terms over  several years. They are initially defined and managed through  agreements with the delegating authority. From 1999 to end  November 2023, 103,380 welfare connections have been provided for  drinking water, 16,330 for sanitation and 56,0908 for electricity. Also in Morocco, with the launch of the National Human Development  Initiative (INDH) in 2005, and the signing of a framework agreement in  2006 in the presence of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, describing  the principles of the program to provide universal access to water and  wastewater services, Veolia Amendis is developing its welfare  connections programs.  By the end of 2023, more than 143,800  households had been equipped in Tangier and Tetouan within the  scope of the delegated management contract. The improved coverage  rate is largely due to the proactive policy pursued by Amendis and its  delegating authority to provide welfare connections through  partnership agreements with the various municipalities, provincial  councils and prefecture. Maintaining and organizing services Throughout the world, services delivered daily by Veolia meet the  essential needs of populations. More than ever, the Covid-19 pandemic  highlighted the fundamental nature of these businesses. The Contigo program in Spain To ensure universal access to water services, Agbar (Spain) introduced  the Contigo program, an initiative focused on identifying access and  economic barriers and establishing mechanisms to overcome them:  video call services, chatbots, multilingual customer service (English,  Chinese, Urdu, Arabic and sign language), accessibility of user-friendly  offices (for people with physical, sensory and intellectual disabilities),  and even a mobile stand to offer face-to-face customer service in  villages. For the economically vulnerable, the objective of the program  is to ensure that people that are financially insecure are aware of the  assistance and payment facilities available to help them manage their  situation (social tariffs and funds, installment payments, interest-free  deferment and repayment of debt, etc.). The Contigo program,  developed with the SERES Foundation, received the OSUR (Urban  Services Observatory) award for best practices in access to water and  several other awards in 2022 in the customer relations field. Agbar is also involved in the A-Porta project. Initiated by the  Confederation  of  Neighborhood  Associations  of  Catalonia  (Confederació d’Associacions Veïnals de Catalunya, CONFAVC), this  project seeks to socially empower districts in which charismatic  neighbors (Picaportas) occupying neighborhoods with substantial  social needs, are recruited, trained and coordinated to visit their  neighbors and provide them with support, advice and resources on  how to improve their quality of life (access to social rights, energy  vulnerability, job search, district resources, waste management,  coexistence and civility, support for the elderly, etc.). In France, Veolia is a leading partner of PIMMS It is crucial to have access to drinking water and energy to be able to  live and work with dignity. Veolia believes it has a leading role to play  to help users in difficulty who are in a vulnerable situation or have  even lost access to public services. That is why the Group took part in  the creation of the PIMMS system (Multiservice information and  mediation point), alongside other major public service operators.  The PIMMS concept consists of facilitating access to public services for  people in a given area and preventing problems, thanks to mediation  staff who offer users support, explanations (about topics such as day- to-day processes, billing arrangements and access to Internet services)  and advice (on matters such as managing a family budget and  controlling energy consumption). As part of its Avanza+ strategic plan, Aguas Andinas (Veolia Chile) is  leading work on universal access to water. The aim is to propose  processes to develop access to drinking water and sanitation for the  benefit of local communities. Among the first measures implemented  in 2023 was an agreement reached with the Association of  Municipalities of Chile (AMCHUH) to grant easy payment terms to  older customers.  Aguas Andinas also provides advice on the use of  state subsidies for low-income families. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Social performance 264 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 267 ===== In Pudong in China, Veolia launched an online management platform  for water services, Wei customer service, in 2019. Users can use mobile  phones and other mobile devices to manage their services and request  a bill, submit an arrears application, request electronic billing, obtain  sundry information and access online customer services.  As an illustration of its utility, in October 2023 the platform had more  than 222,000 users and over 168,000 cases were resolved online. Colombia: “Mi isla limpia” program In Cartagena, Colombia, Veolia continued its “Mi isla limpia”  program, focusing on the technical, environmental and social  problems specific to waste management in this isolated area.  Collections on foot or by electric scooter, as well as the  establishment of temporary storage zones, provide fair access to  waste collection services for 7,000 people in the Baru peninsula  and the islands of the Rosario archipelago. 75% of this  population belongs to the most vulnerable segments of the  population. In addition to collecting waste, Veolia undertook  environmental education measures in 2023 in which 2,800 island  inhabitants and 1,500 tourists participated. Meetings were also  held with communities and community councils, addressing  their needs to improve service delivery, with a total participation  of 160 people, where they socialized with them about  implementing the construction of the Isla Grande and Tintipan  waste collection centers. 4.3.3.3.3  Take consumer health and safety  measures Veolia provides drinking water to 113 million people around the world.  With the constant concern of controlling the quality of the water  produced and distributed, Veolia has established a water quality  control policy in order to comply with current standards and anticipate  changes using a complete range of technological solutions. This  approach is based on four principles: ■anticipating:  through  scientific  monitoring  of  emerging  parameters, particularly new micropollutants such as endocrine  disruptors and pharmaceutical product residues, improving  analytical methods for detecting these micropollutants and  assessing their effects on health; ■monitoring: • by performing more frequent and complex water analyses  within shorter timescales, using standardized methods, cutting- edge equipment and qualified personnel. In 2023, regulatory  compliance rates for water distributed were 99.8% and 99.8%  respectively  for  bacteriological  and  physicochemical  parameters, • by monitoring compliance of the largest distribution networks  throughout the world. 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023  Target Compliance rate with local regulations and  distributed water contractual requirements Bacteriological  parameters  99.8 %  99.8 %  98.8 %  99.8 %  99.8 % > 99 % Physicochemical  parameters  99.7 %  99.8 %  99.5 %  99.7 %  99.8 % > 99 % ■offering solutions to local public authorities for operational  improvements and the investments required to control water  quality across the entire supply chain: maintaining network water  quality, safeguarding the production and distribution of drinking  water and protecting resources; ■informing populations and ensuring an optimal response in case of  accidents or crisis situations: on-call service 24/7, telephone service  for responding to consumer concerns, distribution of bottled water  in the event of extended service disruption, telephone warning  system to advise all consumers of any restrictions on consumption  and distribution points for bottled water. Ensure an ongoing service for vulnerable customers and people with  illnesses: Veolia acts locally to ensure a continuous supply to people who need  constant access to water for medical reasons. The Group has therefore  implemented specific measures to guarantee an uninterrupted water  supply for these people. For example, in Spain, Aigües de Barcelona identified all hospitals and  health facilities among the 23 municipalities in the metropolitan area.  These facilities were classified as “significant” customers and specific  protocols were developed to ensure they are not affected by water  outages and establish channels of communication and coordination to  minimize the impact on their operations. At Aigües de Barcelona, a  dedicated team monitors water consumption, bills and water leakage  alarms to ensure that the healthcare facilities receive a constant and  uninterrupted water supply. More specifically in 2022-2023, in  response to the drought that permanently affects the Barcelona  region, the Drought Operational Plan and Protocol devised by Aigües  de Barcelona and validated by the authorities take into account health  facilities (public or private) as “significant” customers to ensure they  do not suffer water outages. In Prague, Veolia PVK’s local subsidiary set up a system for distributing  bottled drinking water to vulnerable customers (people with  disabilities, elderly people, hospitals, etc.) in case of an interruption in  supply. The project was launched in 2018 in cooperation with a district  in Prague, and in 2023 21 districts were involved, with 397 registered  customers. 4.3.3.3.4  Lead international outreach  and development actions with  the Veolia Foundation Solidarity is expressed in contracts through the services that the  Group provides and that contribute to the common good. Combating  insecurity and inequality by ensuring access to essential services for  people without a water supply, sanitation services or electricity is one  of the ways that Veolia is actively committed. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Social performance VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 265  ===== PAGE 268 ===== Veolia’s commitment is also demonstrated through its Foundation.  One of its missions is to help people to live healthily and with dignity.  As part of this mission, the Veolia Foundation: ■provides emergency humanitarian assistance during natural  disasters and humanitarian crises to evaluate requirements and  ensure that people have access to water, sanitation, energy and  waste management;  ■supports development aid projects for these essential services  which are core Veolia businesses. Veolia Foundation’s international solidarity initiatives help develop  access to essential services. It provides financial support and the skills  of the Group’s employees. Multi-year partnerships The Veolia Foundation has forged numerous partnerships: with United  Nations agencies (UNICEF, UNHCR), major international bodies (Red  Cross, Doctors of the World, Doctors Without Borders, International  Solidarity Movement, etc.) and States. One such example is the  partnership signed in 2014 and renewed on 19 December 2017, with the  French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs to boost efficiency  when responding to emergency humanitarian situations.  The Foundation has also committed to providing Doctors without  Borders with Veoliaforce experts to support its research and  innovation projects for humanitarian issues in sectors close to Veolia’s  business lines. Veoliaforce missions, emergency humanitarian assistance  and development aid in 2023 The Veolia Foundation naturally works alongside stakeholders to  temporarily respond to essential needs in the event of a crisis or  deploy long-term solutions in regions without suitable infrastructure.  In 2023, the Veolia Foundation took part in 10 development aid or  emergency  humanitarian  assistance  projects.  Around  twenty  Veoliaforce missions called upon some 31 volunteers for 450 man-days  of skill-based sponsorship, in addition to the nine permanent staff  members dedicated to the Foundation’s support and sponsorship  activities (i.e. 1,474 man/days). 5 weeks of mobilization in Morocco Veoliaforce experts, deployed by the French Red Cross via the  International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, took  turns in Morocco to work on providing access to water following the  earthquake of September 8, 2023. Assigned to the French Red Cross  Emergency Response Unit (ERU), these team members deployed  hundreds of meters of network extension and installed several dozens  of water access points as well as showers and latrines. Aim: to respond  as quickly as possible to the needs of the population by guaranteeing  healthy drinking water distribution and proper hygienic conditions. Veoliaforce equipment and human expertise to watch  over Ukraine On June 6, the Ukrainian population suffered terrible floods after the  destruction of the Kakhova dam. In support of the solidarity  operations carried out by the Crises and Support Center (CDCS) of the  Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs, the Veolia Foundation provided  mobile water treatment units. These units - Aquaforces 2000 - can  supply up to 10,000 people, in line with humanitarian standards (20  liters per person per day).  This equipment was dispatched prior to the  assignment of a Veoliaforce volunteer in Lviv, Ukraine, to train the  staff of Solidarités International, an NGO present in the field, in how  to deploy the units. Turkey: Intervention of Veoliaforce experts after  the earthquake The Veolia Foundation mobilized to help the populations affected by  the earthquake that devastated south-east Turkey and northern Syria  on February 6, 2023. Less than a week after the earthquake, the  Foundation’s Deputy CEO was in the field for a week of coordination  with employees from Veolia Water Technologies (VWT) Turkey. Joined  by a Veoliaforce volunteer shortly afterwards, he deployed an  Aquaforce 2000, a mobile water purification unit, transported from  France by cargo plane, to cover the needs of 2,000 people. The unit,  installed near Antioch in the Hatay region, supplied water to refugees  in a camp run by AFAD, the government disaster management agency. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Social performance 266 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 269 ===== 4.4  Human resources performance:  impact on employees 4.4.1  COMMITMENTS AND ORGANIZATION Human resources are at the core of Veolia’s Purpose (see Chapter  1,  Section 1.1.2 above). They play a key role in a culture that is common to all Veolia’s actions,  founded on the five principles of responsibility, solidarity, respect,  innovation and customer focus. Veolia’s responsibility is to ensure the health, well-being, development  and fulfillment of its employees. Social cohesion and dialogue, notably  within staff representative bodies, are very important to the Group,  which ensures the promotion of professional equality between men  and women. The Group’s overall performance also depends on its  ability to attract and retain talent. Veolia endeavors, as never before,  to be an employer of choice for all the regions. Under its Impact 2023  strategic program and its commitment to  multifaceted performance, Veolia confirmed its human resources  performance policy around four objectives for 2023: ■safety at work (see Section 4.4.3 below); ■employee commitment (see Section 4.4.4 below); ■employee training and employability (see Section 4.4.4 below); ■diversity (see Section 4.4.5 below). Working groups were conducted throughout the year to prepare the  contribution of human resources to the next 2024-2027 strategic  program, which will focus on the following three objectives (see  Chapter 4, Section 4.1.1 above): ■safety at work, with a commitment to achieve an employee lost  time injury frequency rate of less than 4.1; ■employee engagement, with the employee engagement rate to  remain above 85%; ■diversity and inclusion, by increasing the number of women in the  Group’s executive bodies (commitment: 30% of women on the  Group Management Committee). The Group uses social reporting to monitor the roll-out of its human  resources policies and their performance using the Group’s human  resources data. The human resources information presented below is  extracted from this tool. The year 2023 was marked by the integration of the Suez teams. To  support the cultural dimension of this integration, work to align the  two cultures resulted in “Management Behaviours@Veolia”, a  veritable code of conduct for managers transmitting the Group’s  5 values.  The year 2023 was marked by the launch of Veolia Cares,  initiated by Madame Estelle Brachlianoff. This global social  benefits program, which protects all Group employees, was  rolled out in all Group regions on September 1, 2023 (see Chapter  4, Section 4.4.4.4 below). In terms of health & safety, 2023 was marked by a very significant  improvement in the work accidentfrequency rate.  Among the numerous measures undertaken: the deployment of live- saving rules, formalized at the end of 2022, readjustment of the health  and safety prevention policy and the roll-out of Health & Safety  performance contracts, thereby strengthening managerial presence in  the field. In parallel, work began on managing Health & Safety for our  temporary employees in order to reduce number of accidents and  improve their well-being at work. In terms of social dialogue, work was carried out in close collaboration  with labor and management representatives to finalize draft common  resolutions in favor of health & safety and well-being at work. At the same time, negotiations continued on the draft European  Diversity and Inclusion agreement. In addition, the Diversity & Inclusion department furthered its efforts  in 2023 to promote gender diversity, disability, inclusion and the fight  against discrimination. The measures also focused on the prevention  of sexism and sexual violence in the workplace. Talent training and development efforts also continued in 2023. In  2023, 94.5% of Veolia employees benefited from at least one training  course. The number of training hours increased significantly to 29  hours on average per employee (vs 26 hours on average in  2022).Training covering a total of 5,887,961 hours was followed by  Group employees, of which 78% by non-managers.  Finally, to support the Group’s ambition to become the global leader  in ecological transformation, and ensure the realization of the  GreenUp program, an analysis was conducted to identify the  competencies that the Group should develop or acquire. New training  programs are being designed and rolled out, particularly on hazardous  waste, energy, decarbonization, digital technology and artificial  intelligence. At the same time, programs designed to train/inform  employees in ecological transformation continue to be rolled out  across the world (Fresque, Atelier 2 tonnes, Greenpath, etc.). All these human resource initiatives are essential to secure the  engagement of all employees. According to the external engagement  survey Voice of Resourcers 2023, 89% of employees are fully  committed to serving the Group to contribute to its ambition of  becoming the world champion in ecological transformation.

Of the total departures (permanent and fixed term contracts) recorded  by the Group in 2023:  ■12.2% were the result of individual redundancies (same in 2022); ■0.5% collective redundancies (0.4% in 2022). The turnover rate for employees with permanent contracts was 14.3%  in 2023 (14.7% in 2022) and the employee resignation rate was 8.2%  (8.6% in 2022). This was primarily due to a stretched labor market. A  general downward trend was observed in 2023. Departures recorded in 2023, under voluntary departure programs or  redundancy plans, involved 207 employees mainly in Uzbekistan. The  restructuring  plans  implemented  in  2023  most  often  corresponded, after a review of the various alternatives inside the  Group, to a reorganization that was vital for Business Units.

In accordance with Veolia’s Human Rights  policy, sustainably protecting the health and safety of employees and  subcontractors while protecting customers and communities served  by the Group is an absolute priority. The variety of Veolia’s business sectors, geographic zones and working  environments requires constant due diligence (see Chapter  2,  Section 2.2.2.2 above). The Group is committed to ensuring the physical  and psychological integrity of its employees and subcontractors in all  its businesses and facilities by implementing an ongoing initiative and  an enhanced health and safety culture. Veolia is also committed to  continually improving working conditions and ensuring a safer  environment for future generations. Mindful of its responsibility, the Group makes health and safety “non- negotiable” and “zero accidents” an objective and a performance  driver. 4.4.3.1.2  Policy and commitments Health and safety at the core of Veolia’s Purpose As part of its Purpose and the Impact 2023 strategic program, Veolia  gave commitments in favor of its employees with a 2023 target (see  Chapter 4, Section 4.1.1 above).

They are also shared with employee representative bodies at local and  Group levels (Group French and European Works Councils)and are  made available to all Group employees via the Veolia intranet.  A process was set up to escalate initiatives according to their  importance and impact. Strategic decisions and actions are developed  by the Health and Safety Center of Excellence, then submitted to the  Executive Committee, and finally integrated into the three-year  strategic plan and, more generally, the commitment of Executive  Management. A commitment shared at all levels of the organization The Group implemented measures to meet the highest international  standards and the principles and recommendations of international  organizations. It includes in its health and safety roadmap and  continuously monitors compliance with legal obligations with regard  to health and safety at work in all its geographies. Veolia Environnement is signatory to the Seoul declaration of the  International Labor Organization (ILO), which recognizes the basic  human right to a safe and healthy working environment. Based on the guiding principles of the ILO, Veolia is committed to  promoting the continuous improvement of prevention, health and  safety and training for managers and employees and more generally,  all Group stakeholders, as well as promoting social dialogue on these  issues. At the highest level of the organization, Veolia’s continuous  improvement approach to prevention, health and safety is formalized  in a letter of undertaking that was updated in September 2022  following the appointment of Estelle Brachlianoff as Chief Executive  Officer. This update strengthens the Group’s commitment to well- being and psychosocial risks, in addition to business risks. Veolia’s five strategic pillars on which the prevention, health and  safety policy is built are to: ■involve the entire managerial line; ■mitigate health and safety risks; ■communicate and discuss; ■train and involve all employees; ■monitor and control health and safety performance. This process supports the efforts already initiated and involves all  employees at all levels of the organization, as well as the Group’s  suppliers, subcontractors and joint venture partners. The policies and standards deployed by the Group are very proactive:  in addition to being consistent with ILO guiding principles and  complying with local regulations and standards, they incorporate  additional requirements stemming from the Group's best practices  and accident feedback. For example, the set of 10 high-risk  management standards includes around 650 requirements, including  100 newly created in 2022-2023. In 2023, the policy roll-out initiative was bolstered with the set-up of  “health & safety performance contracts”. 55 contracts were signed by  the Group Health & Safety Prevention Department and the directors  of delegated zones or BUs. Through transformation programs and  proactive indicators, these contracts cover managerial visibility,  employee engagement, standards deployment, etc. They are  supported all year round by the officers of the Health & Safety  Prevention Department and a detailed year-end review is conducted  to assess the state of progress of commitments resulting in a rating. This assessment forms part of the indicators used to determine the  variable compensation of executive corporate officers (Executive  Resourcers) and, more generally, managers for certain Group regions,  when measuring performance in terms of prevention and health &  safety. A steering body: the prevention, health and safety center  of excellence The prevention, health and safety center of excellence is comprised of  some 30 international experts within the Group. It proposes  prevention, health and safety strategies to the Group’s Executive  Committee and coordinates Group-wide projects, creates synergies  between the businesses by encouraging the sharing of best practices,  and evaluates results using performance indicators. In addition,   experts have been appointed to ensure the consistency, monitoring  and coordination of measures  by country and by region. This  organization  provides  a  structured  and  flexible  continuous  improvement system which incorporates the cultural and regulatory  dimensions specific to each country. The year 2023 was marked by strategic discussions to draw up the  Group health & safety roadmap for the period 2024-2027, in line with  Group directives: increase sharing and momentum in terms of health  and, more generally, well-being, take into consideration the  stakeholders and increase the focus given to temporary employees,  anticipate risks such as those relating to chemical transition, climate  change as well as those pertaining to new Veolia businesses deployed  in new regions (e.g.: battery recycling, etc.). A continuous improvement process To  communicate  their  involvement  and  commitment,  all  management levels regularly conduct managerial safety field visits.  These visits offer an opportunity to observe working situations in situ  and promote discussions on best practices and areas for improvement  with employees, and thus take action on certain behaviour. More than 150,000 managerial safety field visits were conducted in  2023 (132,005 in 2022), up by over 15.4% compared to 2022. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Human resources performance: impact on employees VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 271  ===== PAGE 274 ===== As part of the process to establish and formalize a common culture  (creation of a Management Behaviors guide (see section 4.4.4.3.1  below))incorporating the arrival of employees from the Suez merger,  several defining initiatives were developed to assist managers:  creation of common culture training OHS Leadership, design of the  health & safety manager guide, promotion of a just culture, signature  of  health  &  safety  contracts  describing  expected  cultural  transformations. These initiatives adopt the founding principles of  both corporate cultures to create a new common dynamic. 4.4.3.1.3  Actions and results There was a huge collective response to the theme of health and  safety. In the 2023 Voice of Resourcers engagement survey (see  Chapter 4 section 4.4.4.3 below): as in 2002, 94% of respondents (+18  points above the external benchmark) pointed out that health and  safety are deemed very important in their entity/Business Unit. The lost time injury frequency rate is one of the indicators of Veolia’s  multifaceted performance under its Impact 2023 strategic program. Since 2010, the lost time injury frequency rate (the number of lost time  accidents per million hours worked) has been constantly falling from:  18.09 in 2010 to 4.95 (√) in 2023 (i.e. a decrease of 72.6% in 13 years -  a decrease of 25.6% since 2021). This decrease is the result of significant measures implemented to  prevent workplace accidents and occupational diseases for all  employees on a human, technical, organizational and behavioral level.  These measures are reinforced by a major training effort that  combines both face-to-face and online training. In 2023, 31 countries where the Group is active did not record any lost  time injuries. In 2022 the Health and Safety Department conducted a detailed  benchmark with Veolia’s main historical business operators. Based on  its global performances in 2022, Veolia is ranked among the best in  comparison to the benchmark by business: for Water 4.0 (vs 6.6), for  Waste 8.2 (vs 16.2) whereas this business records many more accidents  due to the type of activity with a high risk exposure.

In 2023, the monitoring and analysis of accidents suffered by temporary employees and subcontractors were strengthened to establish a 2024-2027  improvement plan. A major project to improve the reliability of temporary employee data was prioritized in 2023. 2020 2021 2022 2023 Lost time injuries (excluding commuting) (employees) (1) 2,103 2,101 2,112 1,895(√) Lost time injuries (excluding commuting) (tempory staff)  (1) – – – 418 (√) Calendar work days lost due to lost time injuries (excluding commuting) (permanent and  fixed-term contracts) (employees) 137,082 136,243 148,221 130,110(√)  Lost time injury frequency rate (employees) (number of workplace accidents with lost  time per million of hours worked) (2) 6.60 6.65 5.61 4.95(√)  Injury severity rate (number of days lost due to workplace accidents per 1,000 hours  worked) (2) 0.43 0.43 0.39 0.34(√)  Lost time injury frequency rate (employees, temporary workers, employees of  employment placement agencies and self-employed  workers) (number of workplace accidents with lost time per million of hours worked) – – – 5.71 Number of employee deaths tied to processes 3 6 2 7 Number of subcontractor and employees of temporary employment agencies deaths tied  to processes 1 4 3 3 Injury rates analyzed (based on root cause analysis)  74.1 %  74.5 %  69.7 %  71.1 % Near misses, unsafe acts, unsafe conditions related to work and equipment failure  (excluding commuting) reported 177,546 228,094 274,563 313,203 Number of employees having participated in at least one health and safety training  course 136,072 130,221 160,550 184,101 Number of employees who have benefited from a well-being program 36,438 102,189 60,636 71,752 Percentage of employees having participated in at least one health and safety training  course  67.5 %  72.1 %  74.3 %  83.0 % Number of authorities dedicated to or incorporating the study of health and safety issues 1,927 2,268 2,307 2,555 (1) Workplace accidents, excluding commuting, resulting in lost time of at least one day. (2) Including the Chinese concessions. The Group noted with regret the deaths of seven employees tied to  business processes: two in Asia relating to equipment safeguarding,  two who fell from a height in France and Bulgaria, two in a confined  space in Spain and one in Armenia following a trench cave-in.There  were also three subcontractor and temporary employee deaths related  to processes: one in China, one in France and one in Mexico. “Feedback” committees were set up to analyze each of these  accidents. The assessment was presented to Executive Management  and the Health & Safety Prevention Department by local management  and action plans covering the scope of the BU, zone or Group were set  up. The Bird pyramid ratio of the number of safety observations (near  misses, unsafe acts, unsafe conditions related to work and equipment  failure) to the number of lost-time injuries, demonstrates cultural  progress, in particular in the escalation of near misses, and a  preemptive approach to more serious accidents. The ratio of safety  observations escalated per employee has steadily increased from 0.93  in 2018 to 1.52 in 2023 (1.36 in 2022). This highlights the atmosphere of  trust and the engagement of employees. Since 2022, the Group strengthened its approach to identify, collect  and analyze High Potential (HiPo) incidents. An HiPo is an incident of  minor or considerable severity which realistically could have become  serious or very serious under slightly different circumstances The  treatment of HiPos is key to reducing situations that lead to serious  accidents. 3,510 HiPos were reported in 2023. The HiPo analysis rate in  2023 was 94%. The HiPo indicator is now a Veolia health & safety  indicator. Guidelines for the management of health and safety at work The Group has a defining and structured approach based on two sets  of compliance guidelines: guidelines for Health and Safety  Management and high risk activity management standards. In 2018, members of the Health and Safety Center of Excellence  developed guidelines to manage health and safety at work based on  best practices identified in all of the Group’s activities. The aim of these guidelines is to organize and define clear guidelines  to enable management to develop and roll out a continuous  improvement plan tailored to each business unit. The guidelines were designed on the basis of the five strategic pillars  of Veolia's health and safety prevention policy; they cover the specific  measures, actions and requirements to achieve an ''interdependent''  safety culture and make zero accidents a choice and goal of excellence.  These guidelines are available in several languages. Risk mapping and the 10 management standards  for high-risk activities  To improve control of major risks, ten management standards for  high-risk activities have been defined (e.g. working in confined spaces,  safeguarding of facilities; excavation and trenching, hotwork, working  at a height, hazardous substances, electricity, traffic management,  lifting operations, high pressure etc.) This list, which is common to Veolia business lines, was drawn up by  the prevention, health and safety center of excellence after analyzing  past events at Veolia. A matrix to evaluate the level of compliance  with human, organizational and technical requirements was also  implemented to support operational deployment in the field. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Human resources performance: impact on employees VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 273  ===== PAGE 276 ===== As part of the integration of Suez employees following the merger and  the updating of standards to improve assimilation by all employees,  mixed work sessions were set up to share and supplement, where  necessary, each of Veolia’s ten management standards for high-risk  activities. Seven standards were therefore revised over the period  2022-2023. The latest three standards are under revision. To support  the deployment of the revised standards, a cycle of Group webinars  was launched in 2023 with an explication of the requirements and  new components of each standard as well as the highlighting of  accidents and good practices. In 2023, efforts mainly focused on  specific work traffic requirements (on and off-site): traffic plan,  strengthening of measures for areas of concurrent activity generating  risks of collision between vehicles and pedestrians, additional safety  features for collection trucks and on those relating to the  safeguarding of facilities or hot works. The implementation and development of standards are tracked within  each country then and each zone, and finally to be consolidated at  Group level. For example, overall revised standards compliance for the  Latin America delegated zone was 84.2% at the end of 2023, verified by  several on-site audits following a self-assessment. Various projects were also undertaken to build a common culture: the  first joint project was to clarify the common life saving rules to  illustrate the most dangerous situations. Based on health and safety  standards., they are applicable to all, and are the latest employee  protection measures designed to avoid serious or fatal accidents.  Distributed at the end of 2022, they were the subject in 2023 of game- based employee commitment and innovation meetings (quizzes,  escape games, etc.). In addition, Veolia has set up safety management systems (SMS)  based on standards such as ISO 45001, ILO OSH  2001 and/or  OHSAS 18001. Every year, entities throughout the world are certified,  labeled or recognized for their procedures in prevention, health and  safety. At the end of 2022, 57.7% of Veolia revenue was covered by a SMS  (ISO 45001, ILO OSH 2001 or equivalent). A global accident and non-accident management solution:  the “PaTHS” program The Prevention & Training on Health & Safety (PaTHs) program,  currently being rolled out, comprises a collaborative tool and a mobile  app. This program helps to significantly improve and harmonize the  management of health and safety events, strengthen the benchmark  between geographies and build a reliable database and a predictive  risk approach. The tool is designed to anticipate and manage various  health and safety training courses, certifications and authorizations.  Alerts are generated to anticipate expired authorizations and  certifications. This process is used to systematically manage all  sensitive training courses (e.g. chemicals, confined spaces, explosive  atmospheres, hot works, working at height, consignment, etc.) and  issue a health and safety passport for each employees that can be  presented at any time (in paper or digital format) to a supervisor,  auditor, client or any other stakeholder. Initiated in 2021, the PaTHS program considerably expanded and the  employee coverage rate was 75% at the end of 2023 with an expected  rate of over 90% at the end of 2024 (countries such as China cannot  integrate the program due to regulatory constraints). Risks assessment, safety audits and visits,  and the monitoring of action plans A risks assessment as well as safety audits and visits of the facilities  are carried out before operations commence to detect any risk  situations and propose corrective measures. The Group’s facility  design and building activities incorporate risk prevention mechanisms  as far upstream as possible, in order to eliminate risk situations and  guarantee the health and safety of any future operators.  At the same time, the BUs implemented audit programs to develop  their health and safety culture and/or to ensure that the minimum  health and safety requirements defined by the country’s regulations,  Veolia's rules, the Business Unit or customers are applied. These audits  include all stakeholders. Self-assessments are conducted in addition to  the audits. Corrective and preventive actions must be put in place once  the findings of the audits have been analyzed.  In addition, the members of the Group Prevention, Health and Safety  Department carry out audits every year to assess the health and safety  culture maturity level., post serious or fatal accident audits and verify  the level of standards implementation via the BU self-assessment. Since 2022, a dedicated system has been set up for the entities with  the highest accident frequency rate, i.e. 19 entities whose workforce is  greater than 500 FTE with an injury frequency rate greater than ten,  representing 5% of the entities. The BUs comprising these entities  each established an overview of their situation as well as a specific  action plan, shared at strategic meetings with the Group Prevention,  Health and Safety Department. Some were also audited by health and  safety experts to better assess the situation, understand the areas  where progress is needed and adjust the initial action plan as part of a  continuous improvement process. The health & safety performance  contract (see Section 4.4.3.1.2 above) was strengthened to ensure a  differentiated and more qualitative monitoring. The Group’s Prevention, Health and Safety Department therefore  carried out over 130 site and project visits and 6 complete audits  covering, as is the case every year, a wide Group scope (Japan, India,  Korea, Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, United States, Canada, Spain,  United Kingdom, Belgium, Uzbekistan, Poland, Germany, Chile,  Mexico, Ecuador, South Africa, and numerous sites and subsidiaries in  France). In 2023, the health & safety questionnaire included in the internal  control department self-assessment process used to assess the  maturity of each BU was expanded from 12 to 15 key questions. The  self-assessment is designed to strengthen current processes and  implement action plans to improve overall organizational efficiency in  terms of performance and compliance. The participation rate was 100% with 66 questionnaires. The results  illustrate a very good level of maturity for the various pillars with 88%  of responses ranging between satisfactory and high. Regular presentations to the Executive Committee allow the fit  between actions conducted and the Group strategy to be verified. Each assessment is followed by one or more action plans to adopt the  necessary measures to improve risk management. The effectiveness of  each action plan is measured using pre-determined indicators and  objectives (budget, deadline, target risk level, etc.). Following the  implementation of action plans, the level of risk management is  reassessed and new priorities are drawn up, resulting in a continuous  improvement process. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Human resources performance: impact on employees 274 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 277 ===== Personal protective equipment Veolia provides all employees with personal protective equipment  (PPE) at work that meets the best international standards. PPE is  provided for each employee in sufficient quantities, taking into  account the risk assessment, and is periodically renewed. Sharing best practices Each Veolia employee can suggest a best practice that may, after  validation, be widely shared at Group level. The Group Health & Safety  Prevention Department set up a platform with contacts for each BU in  order to organize the submission process and share proposals.  Furthermore, Group Health & Safety Prevention Department produces  and distributes a publication Believe News containing the top best  practices. The platform is intended to guide managerial staff in implementing  high risk activity standards and the health & safety at work  management framework and showcase the best practices of business  units worldwide. It is also set up to help other entities copy & adapt  such practices. At the end of 2023, it featured more than 2,000 best  practices. To promote the sharing of these best practices, the Group Health &  Safety Prevention Department organized an annual competition to  reward the top best practices with an “Always safe Award”. The  awards are handed out by Group Executive Committee members. In  2023, in connection with these awards, the Group Health & Safety  Prevention Department promoted the collaboration of Veolia teams  with subcontractors, temporary employees and other stakeholders. A joint commitment The themes of occupational health and safety are fully integrated into  the social dialogue (see  Chapter  4, section  4.4.5.2 above). Signed  agreements relating to prevention and health & safety, which have  steadily improved, represented 11.4% of agreements in 2023 (10.9% in  2022 and 10.7% in 2021). To promote greater collaboration and sharing with labor and  management representatives in terms of prevention, health & safety,  the decision was made at the Group European Works Council meeting  at the end of 2022 to set up a dedicated working group. This group  comprises representatives from eight countries and the main topics  discussed were: ■value of health and safety monitoring indicators; ■social dialogue on health and safety; ■health and safety policy within the Group; ■human and organizational factors: commitment of individuals; ■well-being at work, health including psychosocial risks. In 2023, the working group met six times to discuss the current  situation, European disparities and priorities for the 2024-2027  roadmap in the form of common resolutions. Raise awareness and train Training is one of the five pillars of the occupational prevention,  health and safety policy. At the heart of human resources performance with respect to Veolia’s  Purpose, the goal of “zero accidents – a choice” was set for all Group  activities. To support cultural changes in terms of health & safety  prevention, each Group employee must receive specific training in  these topics.  In 2023, 83% of Veolia employees received health & safety training or  training involving a major health & safety component (vs. 74.3% in  2022, 72.1% in 2021, 67.5% in 2020), and 42.3% of training hours were  devoted to safety (vs. 42.3% in 2022, 45.6% in 2021, 46.5% in 2020). Development of the health and safety culture: the OHS  Skills program To support cultural change with respect to safety and strengthen the  integration of health & safety at all levels of the organization, a new  training program OHS Leadership is currently being rolled out across  the entire Veolia scope. This program is intended for all managers,  Health & Safety Prevention functions to become a coach and internal  trainers to facilitate the program’s roll-out. After the training, managers receive individual safety coaching to  boost the impact of their managerial safety visit and their leadership  in these topics. The health & safety performance contracts initiated in  2023 and renewed for 2024 very clearly define the roll-out objectives  and priorities for this program. Participants received several guides and supports to help them put  into practice the conduct expected in the Management Behavior  guide. At the end of 2023, 883 managers, 168 safety coaches and 16 internal  facilitators were trained in various Business Units, including the  management committees in France, Germany, Latin America, Portugal  and Asia. At the end of 2024, training is scheduled for all Group BU  management committees and around 30% of managers of entities  which report the most accidents. In parallel, the Group continued the OHS Skills program, initiated in  2019. This program seeks to: maintain the technical competencies of  health & safety prevention professionals, develop their know-how,  help them improve their management and ability to support the  development of managers during managerial safety visits, safety  discussions, risk and incident analyses and application of the 10  standards and life-saving rules. The aim is to share a safety-related  state of mind, acquire the best leadership practices and strengthen  the health & safety at work culture in Veolia. At the end of 2023, 120  experts from different BUs had been trained or were in the process of  being trained. E-learning program on the management standards  for high-risk activities To help assimilate the 10 high risk activity management standards  deployed in the Group since 2016, and the 12 life-saving rules, an online  training program on each of these activities was launched in 2021.  This course aims to strengthen the health and safety culture at all  levels of the organization, increase the perception of hazards for such  activities, increase employees’ knowledge of the risk control measures  and ensure that the fundamental components of these standards are  known and understood by all employees including external  stakeholders (subcontractors, service providers, suppliers, customers)  and that they are effectively adopted. Six available courses are being rolled out in all BUs. Course no. 1  “Introduction: health and safety culture at Veolia” and course no. 2  “Work traffic” concern all Veolia employees. They were already  deployed to over 85% of employees at the end of 2023 and will be  maintained for new hires in 2024.  All BUs have also selected two or three programs to train by the end of  2023 risk-exposed individuals (work from height, facility safeguarding,  confined spaces, hot works). All the programs for the other 5 standards  will be gradually produced and rolled out by the end of 2025. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Human resources performance: impact on employees VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 275  ===== PAGE 278 ===== In addition to widespread e-learning, the Group has set up a  framework agreement to deploy virtual reality modules to put  ourmajor risks into context. More than 39 headsets and licenses were  contracted in various regions. Specific business models were designed  for life-saving rules and the primary risks.SARP designed a video  combining real-life images and 3D effects to educate teams about  safety. Virtual technology offers more opportunities to view the inside  of a pipe and simulate serious accidents. The video is shown to all new  employees who then receive an assessment that determines their  subsequent assignment to projects. Use of digital tools to complete training Veolia uses digital tools to anticipate and complete various health and  safety training courses. Alerts are generated to anticipate expired  authorizations and certifications. An authorization should be issued at  the end of a training course upon signature of the attendance sheet  and then approved by the hierarchy. This process is used to manage all  sensitive training courses (e.g. chemicals, confined spaces, explosive  atmospheres, hot works, working at height, etc.) and issue a health  and safety passport that can be presented at any time (in paper or  digital format) to a supervisor, auditor, customer, etc.  Analysis to prevent risks The Group is particularly attentive to employee awareness and the  monitoring of at-risk situations and near misses, in particular HiPos. The Prevention, Health and Safety Department uses the Bird pyramid  to prevent accidents, which has five levels: ■near misses, unsafe acts, unsafe conditions (base of the pyramid); ■first aid injuries; ■medical treatment injuries; ■lost time injuries; ■fatalities. At Veolia, all work accidents are analyzed. Material incidents that  impact activity (explosion, fire, etc.) and HIPO (High Potential)  incidents must also be analyzed. Accidents are analyzed in order to: ■prevent the repetition of these events; ■understand and clarify what really happened; ■effectively identify the causes that led to the events; ■determine and implement action plans; ■continuously improve and monitor your work environment; ■avoid the costs (direct and indirect) associated with an accident,  particularly in human and social terms; ■ensure compliance with applicable regulations. The Group has also implemented a procedure for many years to  investigate work-related incidents and accidents for prevention  purposes, mainly using “safety alerts”. In the event of a workplace  accident, the health and safety coordinator sends the Group  Prevention, Health and Safety Department a record using a template  detailing the circumstances, consequences of the event and the  corrective measures put in place (human, organizational and  technical). A more in-depth analysis is conducted for serious accidents.  These safety alerts are then shared with the entire prevention, health  and safety network, and more broadly on the Group intranet.  International Health and Safety Week Veolia has organized an International Health and Safety Week  since 2015, to help firmly establish a health and safety culture at  work. This event is one of the Group’s main levers of change to  achieve “zero accidents”. The 2023 edition was built around two themes: awareness of  unconscious errors focusing on the risks of accident relating to  reflex actions and the identification and treatment of HIPOs  through a challenge involving an external stakeholder  (subcontractor, temporary employee, client, etc.) to continue  forging a real partnership in terms of health & safety. Monitoring of subcontractors,employees of temporary  employment agencies, employees of employment placement  agencies and self-employed  workers Suppliers are also expected to take steps to guarantee the health,  safety and well-being of their employees in accordance with the  Supplier Charter. Accordingly, a preliminary risk analysis is performed  of subcontracted activities to contractually define the prevention  measures to be applied by all subcontractors. These measures are  regularly audited. Depending on the specific characteristics of Veolia’s businesses,  regulatory measures and a cultural adaptation approach are  integrated into the management of stakeholders’ health and safety  within the Group. Managing subcontractors operating on Veolia sites and Veolia  customer sites is a vital component of the overall prevention, health  and safety policy. It is reiterated in the Veolia Occupational health and  safety management guidelines that each Veolia BU must have an  exhaustive list of its subcontractors and must inform them of the  Veolia Health and Safety requirements in relation to the tasks  subcontracted. A documented risk assessment is carried out jointly by the BU, the  subcontractor and all companies operating in the work area, to define  joint preventive measures. A system for assessing health and safety  requirements is put in place and determines whether the  subcontractor is listed and used again. The system provides, where  appropriate, for the temporary or permanent exclusion of a  subcontractor in the event of a serious breach of the prevention,  health and safety rules. The BUs provide a health and safety induction for subcontractors’  employees working on Veolia sites. This training session includes a  final test with a minimum threshold to be allowed to work on the site.  A manager is identified at each site to supervise the subcontractors. As part of its commitment to continuous improvement, Veolia has  monitored workplace accidents of subcontractors in the same way as  employees since 2018. In 2023, efforts focused specifically on managing the health & safety  of employees of temporary employment agencies, employees of  employment placement agencies and self-employed  workers in terms  of their lost time injury frequency rate (14.15(√) in 2023). It  supplements the historical annual meetings with temp agencies  which assessed their performance and growth. A review of countries  using this type of contract and the related accidents was conducted. A  specific pilot approach for France, where the Group has had  framework agreements with temp agencies for several years, was set  up. Internationally, a purchasing task force was launched to set up in  2024 four global framework agreements to better structure our  requirements. In France, all temp agencies were met and several  decisive projects were rolled out: CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Human resources performance: impact on employees 276 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 279 ===== ■creation of a temporary employment charter specifying the  responsibilities of temp agencies and Veolia sites to better  integrate temporary employees. Signed by seven main temp  agencies, it will be deployed in 2024 at all Veolia sites; ■launch of a satisfaction survey on the health and safety of  temporary employees who have worked during the year at Veolia.  Transmitted at the end of 2023 by each temp agency, the results  will be escalated and consolidated by March 2024; ■conduct of analyses at certain Veolia agencies which have reported  the highest number of temporary employee accidents to identify  improvements. This work should help gradually reduce the number of temporary  employee accidents and improve their well-being at work. Medical check-ups and prevention of occupational diseases All employees attend a regular medical check-up to detect  occupational diseases, with a particular focus on prevention. In 2023, 146 new employees had an occupational disease (vs. 153 in  2022 and 126 in 2021). However, the information on occupational  diseases can vary due to differences in local practices and regulations.  The Group monitors occupational diseases by cause category, namely:  chemical agents, physical agents, biological agents and infectious or  parasitic diseases, respiratory disease, skin disease, musculoskeletal  disorders, mental or behavioral disorders, occupational cancers.  Musculoskeletal disorders represent over 80% of the occupational  diseases recognized in the Group. Work station ergonomics: a musculoskeletal disorder  prevention tool Veolia strives to detect any ergonomic defects that could generate  risks relating to musculoskeletal disorders, lack of visibility and falls.  To this end, the Group rolls out 3 types of ergonomics to improve the  performance  of  professional  activities:  physical  ergonomics,  cognitive ergonomics and organizational ergonomics. With this in  mind, Veolia undertakes to improve and optimize the ergonomics of  a workstation by: ■studying the work environment; ■consulting employees before selecting equipment; ■respecting basic rules governing office supplies; ■organizing the work. The Veolia Department of Scientific and Technological Expertise  (DEST) therefore conducts analyses during design projects (initial or  upgrading). They enable the ergonomist to have detailed knowledge  of all determining factors and their interactions and a systemic view of  work activity. The ergonomist can then: ■direct design options and priority work streams in order to save  time in carrying out the project; ■encourage more operators to accept the innovation/solution  approach using the “user-centric design” concept tailored to  specific user requirements and contexts determined previously by  analysis; ■help employees assimilate this innovation/solution approach in  the medium and long term; ■ensure, via feedback after several weeks or months of use, that  innovation is actually used and such use meets initial project  expectations. Risk of exposure to noise and vibrations Veolia pays particular attention to occupational risks associated  with exposure to noise and vibrations, assessing such risks and  reducing exposure to the lowest reasonably possible level.  Efforts are made to combat noise and vibrations using existing  collective protection best practices. Workstations are designed  and continuously adapted to reduce exposure time. For vibrating  vehicles, machines and work situations, operators and drivers are  rotated to reduce exposure to vibration. Health and safety tested by the health crisis After successfully managing the COVID crisis period, Preventing  preventing health crisis situations remains a priority at Veolia.  Monitoring remains well organized and flu and Covid vaccination  campaigns are offered to Group companies worldwide. Prevention of psychosocial risks (PSR) Prior to implementing any measures to improve well-being and  quality of life at work, Veolia incorporated management of  psychosocial risks, an essential phase in the management of Group  professional risks. The Internal Audit Department conducted an analysis at around ten  BUs, enabling them to issue recommendations in April 2022 to achieve  the following objective: “increase the sharing of good practices and  the roll-out of a common Group approach in terms of psychosocial risk  management”. Based on the audit results, it was concluded that in most countries,  various psychological hotlines with external specialists provide  valuable information, while ensuring support for employees  encountering  difficulties  professionally  and  personally.  These  therefore help the Group to assess possible factors and sources of  stress and supplement the risk analysis conducted in connection with  the single documents, which cover both business and psychosocial  risks. To strengthen current processes in the BUs, a Group training program  for all managers will be rolled out in 2024. The objective is to gradually  structure a Group management system, training courses and tools as  well as a coordination system to bolster existing local initiatives and  strengthen “copy and adapt” within the entities. In the RVD BU in France, a PSR prevention action plan was set up with  a specialized firm. It resulted in support measures in regions/ subsidiaries for managers and employees who encounter difficulties  (training, forums, individual assistance, emergency interventions,  mediation, etc.). At the end of 2023, 88% of managers were trained  and around 600 workshops were held to extend the notions. In 2023, Veolia drafted its PSR strategy in Australia & New Zealand.  Projects were initiated to address ISO 45003:2021 (PSR management  guidelines) recommendations. The risk assessment model to identify  and mitigate psychosocial hazards was finalized and will be tested in  2024. A training program “Responding to Mental Health and  Psychosocial Hazards at Work” was launched for executives. To date,  100 managers/supervisors completed a training program with positive  feedback. 220 mental health first-aiders were also trained and invited  to attend a quarterly improvement session covering various topics on  how to support our employees and prioritize the management of their  own health. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Human resources performance: impact on employees VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 277  ===== PAGE 280 ===== Employee well-being and support The well-being of the Group’s employees is a priority that is firmly  anchored in the Group and enshrined in Veolia’s Purpose (see Chapter  1, Section 1.1.2 above).  In 2021, the Group launched, with the Center of Excellence, an  initiative to support the entities with their health and well-being  issues, improve the quality of life at work, strengthen cohesion and  contribute to the Group’s performance. This So’Well initiative is based  on promoting best practices and aims to raise awareness and embed  well-being into the daily lives of employees.  The Group made real progress in 2022 and 2023 in structuring its well- being policy and the related transversal action plans. A Group officer  was appointed to coordinate these actions in liaison with a new  division set up in early 2023 within the HR and health and safety  networks: well-being officers. At the end of 2023, this network covered  all Veolia regions with 60 officers. It has been regularly facilitated and  will be extended in 2024 by a training program on various topics such  as emotion management, stress management, eco-anxiety etc. These  training courses are also available to all HR and Health & Safety  divisions. In 2022, a well-being at work indicator was therefore set up in the  Voice of Resourcers engagement survey (see Chapter 4 section 4.4.4.3  below) It measured 75 out of 100 in 2023 (74 in 2022), +9 points above  the external benchmark. 81% of respondents (80% in 2022) are  satisfied with the work/life balance (+5 points above the external  benchmark). The Veolia Care program (see section 4.4.4.4 below), initiated in 2022,  was fully rolled out on September 1, 2023 in all Group regions. It  supplements this process by proposing tangible improvements in the  level of social security protection offered to our employees  (healthcare, important life moments, etc.). An additional return-to- work help initiative supports employees who have been off work for  long periods due to an accident or illness to enable them to easily  resume a professional activity while limiting the risk of relapse or  social exclusion.  In addition to the Group’s programs, more local health and well-being  at work initiatives, adapted to their context are adopted by different  Business Units.  For example, since 2020, Veolia has rolled out an online well-being  program in Poland in which 2,298 employees have already participated  (555 in 2020, 762 in 2021, 451 in 2022 and 530 in 2023). The program  covers over 70 different topics such as: energy and time management,  resilience and anxiety management, taking care of oneself in a world  of uncertainty, sleep physiology, art of optimism, managing stress and  emotions, work station ergonomics and working from home, diet  under stress, etc. In Portugal, over the past year, Veolia has organized Happy Mondays  on the first Monday of each month to debunk the myth that Monday  is always the most difficult day of the week. In an atmosphere of  benevolence and empathy, an employee shares a personal project and  its impact (Kilimanjaro climb, original agricultural project, etc.) In 2023, in Australia and New Zealand, Veolia launched an annual well- being calendar, with a monthly theme (sleep, cardiac health, nutrition,  etc.) and dedicated toolboxes and webinars. An employee heart health  check campaign was launched at 35 sites and will continue in 2024.  The process is supplemented by an app proposing various types of  mental health content and local events (seminar, barbecue, breakfast,  etc.) were organized by sites to facilitate dialogue on the matter and  ensure freedom of speech. Finally, qualified specialists (Thrive by  Assure) provided free consultations 24/7 (psychology, nutrition,  financial and legal, wellness coaching). Corporate sport: a dynamic vector of well-being at Veolia Veolia also relies on sport as a vector to promote well-being, quality of  life and health in the workplace.  In the various zones,Veolia enables its employees to take part in  national, European and global sporting events. 8,000 sportspersons  from over 50 countries took part of numerous sporting events and  won multiple national, European and global awards, including the title  of World Champion in Mexico in December 2023. Since 2014, from the first race on diversity organized in Paris to 12  simultaneous races in various cities in 2023, Veolia has brought  together over 5,900 participants while highlighting a gender balance  and the inclusion of persons with disabilities in each race. The week- long “International E-run for Diversity” was held in parallel. This online  race  brought  together  73  countries  and  entities,  with  2,800 participants (vs. 2,227 in 2022). This event flies the flag for the  Group and its values. To accompany the buzz surrounding the Olympic Games on its home  ground, Veolia has used its “Talents & Champions” program to recruit  and employ seven top-level champions in different entities. The Group  supports them in their career paths while helping them to prepare for  the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. At the end of 2023, four had already  qualified, while the others are soon to qualify. Thanks to these efforts and results, in September 2022 Veolia obtained  the European Workplace Active Certification for 2022-2025 for these  activities in Europe, which presented their sporting, preventive and  well-being actions in the workplace. This certification proves that  Veolia successfully promotes physical, preventive and sporting  activities at work. 4.4.3.2  Work organization The terms and conditions governing the organization of working time  depend on the companies concerned, the nature of their business and  where they are located. Nevertheless, the Group is particularly focused on work rate flexibility  and working conditions. 31.2% of collective agreements signed in 2023 relate to the  organization and working time. In an attempt to increase agile working, the Group has introduced  working from home in several Business Units for jobs where this is  possible. In France, in 2021, the Group negotiated with all the  representative trade union organizations a framework agreement  defining the terms and conditions for working from home for those  who are able to do so and also defining the balance between working  from home and working in the office to ensure team cohesion. The number of part-time employees in 2023 was 6.1% (7.6% in 2022). According to the Voice of Resourcers 2023 survey, 81% of employees  are satisfied with their work/life balance. The average work-week is 40 hours (√). CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Human resources performance: impact on employees 278 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 281 ===== Moreover, Veolia promotes the Nation-Army link. As such, the Group  pays particular attention to its reservist employees, supporting their  commitment through a partnership agreement with the French  National Guard. Signed in 2019, the purpose of this agreement is to  facilitate the operational employment of salaried reservists in the  Group, by giving them the opportunity to spend an extended reserve  period (15 days) compared to the legal period (10 days) and maintain  their salary over this period. The agreement expires in March 2024 and is being renewed under a  new model tripartite agreement: Veolia - French Ministry of the  Armed Forces - French Ministry of the Interior and Overseas Territories  that will prolong the existing provisions and extend them to reservists  in the French National Police Force. The total number of overtime hours worked was 18,875,088 (√), i.e. an  average per employee of 92 hours of overtime per year (vs. 93 hours in  2022). The definition of overtime, however, varies from country to country,  which can make it difficult to evaluate this indicator. Moreover, in a  service business, a large number of overtime hours are due to  emergency work performed by on-call or on-site personnel, to restore  water supplies or heating within a reasonable time frame, for  example. Veolia ensures that every employee is treated fairly and with  dignity and that the labor laws and regulations applicable in each of  the countries where the Group operates are respected: health and  safety standards to ensure a safe and healthy working environment  and conditions.   Absenteeism trends 2020 2021 2022 2023 Absenteeism rate (excluding maternity and paternity leave)  4.54%   4.22%   4.37%   4.19%  Absenteeism rate (illness)  3.39%   3.17%   3.36%   3.19%  4.4.4 ENCOURAGE EACH EMPLOYEE’S PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT  AND COMMITMENT 4.4.4.1  Risks and opportunities The quality of Veolia’s responses to environmental challenges and the  growing demands of public authorities and industrial entities depends  on its expertise and, more generally, the performance of its labor  relations model. Veolia’s performance partly depends on its ability to  attract and retain talent and manage risks linked to the availability of  skills which it needs (see Chapter 2, Section 2.2.2.2 above). The Group is convinced that the motivation and mobilization of the  Company’s staff are an asset and a genuine competitive advantage.  This is why Veolia strives to attract, train, develop and retain its staff  at all levels of qualification and in all areas of employment in which it  operates. 4.4.4.2  Policy and commitments As part of its Purpose and the Impact 2023 strategic program, Veolia  gave commitments in favor of its employees with a 2023 targets (see  Chapter 4, Section 4.1.1 above). These commitments break down into  several objectives, including employee commitment and employee  training and employability. The level of employee commitment is  measured annually via an independent survey (see Section 4.4.4.2.3,  below). In 2023, the participation rate was 79%.

The 2023 Veolia Academy roadmap  comprises four priorities: ■spread the Veolia common managerial culture; ■cultural assimilation of all employees to ecological transformation  issues; ■development of new Group training programs on strategic  competencies; ■acceleration of digital learning. Spread the Veolia managerial culture Spreading the Veolia managerial culture involves: ■The Group’s Executives, Talents and Managers programs: in 2023,  over 1,300 Executives, Talents and Managers took part in a Group  training program. Nearly 800 managers took part in the new  managers integration program (VIP). In this context, they took part  in the “Management Behaviors” workshop developed by Veolia  Academy to improve the adoption of behaviors aligned with Group  values; ■E-learnings available for all managers on Veolia’s fundamentals  (Purpose in Motion, Essentials, Health-Safety Standards); ■A new program intended for Group executives and managers to  strengthen the safety culture (OHS Leadership) was designed. and rolled out in pilot entities in 2023. More than 50 Executives and  150 Managers completed this program in France, LATAM and Asia  zones. It will be further deployed in 2024. Support the challenges of ecological transformation An entire catalogue of classroom and digital Group programs  promoting awareness of environmental and ecological transformation  issues is available to Group entities and included in Group Onboarding  programs. This catalogue, launched in 2022, was gradually expanded  in 2023. It includes: ■The Ecological Transformation Fresk (more than 5,000 participants  since its launch in September 2022): this educational workshop,  based on the “Climate Fresk”, explains environmental issues and  the role and impacts of Veolia’s activities in relation to them. This  tool is designed to raise awareness and engage all employees as  ambassadors of ecological transformation; ■2  tonnes workshop: the purpose of this recreational and  educational workshop is to understand individual and group  actions to substantially reduce our carbon footprint. It is proposed  to all Group entities. 95 workshops were facilitated in the Group in  2023 for 940 participants. The roll-out momentum accelerated at  the end of 2023 in particular. ■A set of online e-learnings on sustainable development was  uploaded to the Group training platform Learning@Veolia and is  available to all platform users. It mainly includes: • 20 courses from our partner Climate School. These courses  available in 9 languages are aimed at assimilating climate  issues and measures to be taken in the various corporate  functions (HR, Marketing, Finance, IT, etc.). • An e-learning on the planet’s limits deployed in September 2023 • A “Responsible purchases” e-leaning deployed in December  2023. Develop the Group's strategic competencies In the second half of 2023, the Group’s HR department worked with  each zone to identify the competencies required for the 2024-2027  strategic program. According to the type of competency, the Group may choose the best options according to internal and external  resources: recruitment, development of competencies via training,  outsourcing, acquisitions. The Veolia Academy business academies design and roll out programs  for the BUs to help them accelerate the deployment of the strategic  competencies identified by the Group. In 2023, Veolia Academy launched the following programs: ■Digital Academy: the “Digital Keys” course, rolled out in September  2023, is designed to share digital fundamentals at Veolia. It  currently comprises 3 short modules (''Digital@Veolia'', ''Digital  technology driving ecological transformation''; ''Introduction to  cybersecurity''). At the end of 2023, an Introduction to Generative AI  workshop was tested on pilot BUs (headquarters and France): it will  be further deployed in France and internationally in 2024. ■Innovation Academy: in collaboration with the innovation  department, this academy build and tested 3 programs in 2023. The  Innovation Behaviors workshop is designed for managers to  understand how to create innovation conditions. The Design  Thinking training is intended for Innovation project teams. Finally,  an “Innovation” passport will be deployed in early 2024 for all  employees. ■Hazardous Waste Academy: in collaboration with BS&P, this  academy rolled out several e-learnings, including a course on  incineration. A Sales rep training program on the specificities of  hazardous waste is currently being designed and will be deployed  in 2024. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Human resources performance: impact on employees 280 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 283 ===== ■Energy Academy: 2 new programs are currently being tested for a  deployment in 2024. “Virage Energie” was set up to training site  managers and technicians on optimizing energy at our sites.  “Energies Locales” is a recreational workshop designed to find out  about Veolia’s local decarbonizing energy solutions. ■Sales & Marketing: 2 Decarbonization training programs are  currently being deployed. The “Greenpath Digital Platform” is  aimed at training local coordinators and sales reps in how to  measure the environmental footprint of our solutions. “Greenpath  0 Carbon” is designed to train managers and sales reps in the sale  of Veolia’s decarbonizing solutions. Accelerate Digital Learning to foster a learning culture  for all ■Digital Learning is a pillar of the training strategy, designed to  provide everyone with easy access to training at the right time and  on a wide range of subjects. ■2023 marked a turning point with the launch in early July of the  new  Group  digital  learning  catalogue,  available  for  all  Learning@Veolia platform users (over 100,000 users in all Group  BUs). This catalogue includes all Group e-learning courses  organized by major theme (Veolia culture, Health-Safety, Digital,  Veolia Businesses, etc.) as well as access to more than 19,000  LinkedIn Learning catalogue courses, available in over 24  languages. ■Following the launch of the catalogue, there was a sharp increase  in completed e-learning courses. • In November 2023, a total of around 8,000 users logged on at  least once to LinkedIn Learning • The number of average log-ons per month to Learning@Veolia  jumped to over 24,000 in 2023 (vs a monthly average of 13,000  in 2022). ■In addition to the catalogue that is always available on shelf, 3 key  Group campaigns were rolled out in 2023: • “Les Essentiels” campaign: this campaign, compulsory for  Executive Resourcers (500+ completed e-learning courses), was  then deployed by the BUs (completed by over 9,000 managers) • “Maximiser la génération de cash” campaign: this campaign  was compulsory for the finance department. More than 10,000 • employees completed this e-learning course (5,000 financial  employees, i.e. 87% of the target financial population, 5,000  non-financial managers) • Compliance campaign: as in the case each year, this campaign  took place in the last quarter and concerned all Group managers  as well as certain non-managers with a sensitive role in terms  of compliance. In total, over 35,000 employees validated the  course, i.e. 99.9% of the population targeted in the campaign Work-study policy Veolia confirmed its commitment to apprenticeship and the  recognition of competencies by degree or diploma by signing an  apprenticeship pact in January  2020. It undertook to increase the  number of apprentices to 2,500 in France by 2023 and the number of  apprentices present to 5% of its French workforce.  Work-study contracts are a key recruiting tool for helping young  workers into stable employment, particularly in France, Colombia,  Germany, Morocco and the UK. Work-study encourages the transfer of knowledge and key skills  thanks to intergenerational exchanges between the tutor and their  trainee, and develops corporate culture through professional  promotion. By placing Group employees in a tutor role, it reinforces  the feeling of belonging to the Group, whilst providing a tangible  avenue to promote their expertise. The work-study policy is specifically implemented within regions and  contracts through a significant number of partnerships with local  employment and training players. To this end, Veolia is one of the  partner companies in the FIPA network (Innovation Foundation for  Apprenticeships) with which it has developed several innovative and  inclusive programs. ■the Lotus program, supporting the integration of refugees via  work/study training ■the !ngénieuses project enabling young women aged 17-29 to  complete technical work-study training and be qualified to join an  engineering school ■the Altern’Up project, which aims to showcase the entrepreneurial  mindset of work-study students who wish to develop a business  creation project. At the end of 2023, Veolia had 3,510 apprentices worldwide. In France,  there were more than 2,200 apprentices, representing 4.4% of the  total workforce; i.e. an increase of 32% in five years. 4.4.4.2.2  Manage careers: sourcing,  identification and development tools Attract talent Faced with growing pressure from the employment market, the Group  initiated a process to optimize its employer brand: creation of a  recruitment  campaign  launched  in  2023,  optimization  and  enhancement of career pages, improved applicant experience, support  for recruiters to help their hire and attract talent. A call for tenders  was launched in 2023 to choose a service provider which will help  Veolia to create a new more attractive job offer portal, proposing a  more efficient job search engine and an improved applicant  experience. It will be deployed in the first half of 2024. Support, develop and retain talent  The Group Talents Department seeks to attract and retain talent  throughout the world and facilitate the assessment of managerial  performance. Its dual aim is to meet the skills requirements of the  Group’s business activities and provide career opportunities for  employees. Employee career development is a major focus of the  human resources management policy. Talent management is  performed by sector and comprises support for jobline mobility and  the identification and development of experts, managers and the  leaders of tomorrow.  Its implementation relies on various processes and tools described  below.  A common job appraisal tool for all the Group’s businesses  A single classification tool is deployed for all executive positions  (Global Grading System, developed by Willis Towers Watson) and even  all employees in some Business Units. It is used to apply HR processes  in a transparent and fair manner. Grading is deployed across all Group regions and is used to apply HR  processes in a transparent and fair manner. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Human resources performance: impact on employees VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 281  ===== PAGE 284 ===== Sourcing tools A career portal Publishes all job offers in the Group A bimonthly publication Veolia JobLink: publishes the Group’s latest management jobs on the career portal and management jobs  advertised locally. Programs to attract young talent PANGEO: a program offering young talent under the age of 28 international experience for 12 to 24 months. It  enables Veolia to create a multicultural pool of employees trained in its business lines. The program relies in  large part on the International Business Volunteers (VIE) contract. GRADUATE PROGRAM: permanent contract hires were finalized at the end of 2023 for 7 BUs (France and  international), enabling eight young engineers to discover the Group in all its diversity thanks to a dedicated 24- month program. Talent APP: a new skills management digital app A pilot test of the Talent App was launched in January 2021 with 2,000  users. Backed by artificial intelligence, this app is designed to  accelerate the development of mobility and cooperation by mobilizing  employees for short assignments. It is gradually being deployed, with  12,000  employees registered in 2023. It can also be used to actively  implement a skills and career path matrix at all levels of the  organization. Its roll-out will be continued in 2024. A simplified and scalable Group job library In 2021 Veolia finalized a simplified job map shared by all the Group’s  entities. The aim is to share a common language, to adapt to and  anticipate changes in jobs and skills (notably through the organization  of skills vision workshops), to improve clarity and promote mobility.  This library is also shared to help employees explore the business lines they are interested in. Job descriptions are  displayed in “Talent App” so that an employee’s skills can be compared  to those required for a job. This library also enables the Human  Resources network to visualize career paths by presenting grade bands  for generic jobs. It consists of approximately 130 jobs divided into two  areas: business lines and support functions. SmartRecruiters: the recruitment tool The recruitment tool SmartRecruiters was rolled out in the last quarter  of 2021 and in 2022 for all entities in France, the United States,  Northern Europe and certain entities in Asia and Latin America. Its roll- out in Spain was completed at the end of 2023 while it continues to be  deployed at WTS. To date, more than 700 recruiters share a platform  ensuring enhanced tool usage, with the creation of talent pools and  an improved applicant experience. Talent hub: the shared human resource process  management tool A comprehensive and integrated human resources solution, Talent  Hub is the Group tool for employees managing annual reviews  (OneForm), salary reviews, people reviews and succession plans. This  tool supports users in their human resources and/or managerial  activities, facilitates access to information through a single entry  point, assists managers in managing teams, builds a reliable database  and makes human resources reporting secure. At the end of 2023,  more than 50 Business Units deployed the tool. A robust talent management process Since 2017, people reviews common to all entities have been organized  for senior executives, key contributors and high-potential employees.  They are used to systematically develop succession plans and  implement development plans to retain the managers of the future.  They aim to consolidate organizations’ sustainability and agility, and  to help with the individual development of the most talented  employees.  This annual process is carried out, zone by zone, then by sector to get  an international overview. It also helps to address the challenge of  diversity within teams and in management positions, to enable Veolia  to achieve its multifaceted performance objectives in this regard. In 2023, more than 1,300 employees were reviewed at Group level.  These reviews for senior executives, key contributors and high- potential employees are used to systematically develop succession  plans and implement development plans to retain the managers of  the future. The Group therefore has succession plans for most senior  management positions and where this is not the case, action plans  have been implemented: In 2023, the number of women in the Veolia staff review has  increased: 34% women in total and 50% among high-potential  executives; These reviews are also rolled out in zones and Business Units for other  Group employee categories. A policy for recognizing and promoting experts The Human Resources Department, in conjunction with the main  functional departments and, first and foremost, the IT, technical and  purchasing divisions, has launched a specific expert management  program. This will be used to accurately map the expertise present in  the Company, structure the sectors and offer career recognition and  paths to experts. A common model for performance appraisal In order to ensure managers’ objectives are aligned with the Group’s  strategy and values, a single annual interview process, Oneform, is  used for all managers at all our sites worldwide. (for non-managerial  employees, a different form is used by the Business Units). In 2023, the annual executive interview form was modernized. Following the optimized ergonomics proposed in 2022, the basic  structure and reasoning behind the annual interview were questioned  to provide a more tailored response to business unit expectations. In a collective intelligence approach involving BU executives, the HR  network and managers, the 2023 version promotes dialogue between  employees and management, while limiting data entry requirements. While offering a simplified interface, this version defines individual  objectives more clearly in line with the company’s multifaceted  performance and strategy and addresses the Group’s values by  enabling discussions on the behaviors expected to meet our  challenges (Management Behaviours@Veolia). The “development” section leaves considerable scope for discussions  on career aspirations and the support options offered by the Group. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Human resources performance: impact on employees 282 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 285 ===== Finally, this new form is structured to promote discussions on well- being at work and support the assimilation of a feedback culture  within the company. Development tool Talent development programs Talent development programs Veolia Excellence is the training  program for Veolia talent. Sessions are organized in three primary  areas: business models, value creation, and team management in a  context of rapid and profound change. The program uses innovative  training methods, with e-learning sequences, inter-session work,  collaborative workshops and a post-seminar follow-up. It also includes  a 360° evaluation that is debriefed by internally trained individuals. In 2023, 124 participants were trained in the program, of which 30%  were women and 19% were employees from the Suez merger. Four other collective individual development programs are deployed  by the Group: ■DISRUPT is aimed at “millennial” managers to accelerate their  integration within the Group; ■ACCELERATE is aimed at middle management as part of the digital  transformation. This program allows participants to better  understand the potential of this transformation and to develop the  required interactions with Group businesses. It should help change  behavior by allowing managers to become the business partner of  other Veolia players and to see the bigger picture in order to better  anticipate future challenges; ■WIL (Women in Leadership) is designed to develop female  leadership in relation to the Group’s ambitious gender diversity  targets (see Section 4.4.5.3.2 below). ■FEEDBACK: an individual and collective feedback development  program. Three “pilot” sessions were launched in 2022: in the  United States and within the VESA Purchasing Department and the  VESA BS&P department. In 2023, 519 employees participated in the Group’s talent programs.  Mindful of allowing its talents to have personal alignment as well as  sharing a common strategic vision, the Group fully integrates staff  development tools in these programs (MBTI, 360°, Self Management  Leadership). Equivalent programs are offered in different zones such as Impulsa in  Latin America, BOOST in Africa and the Middle East, ''THE LEADERSHIP  CADRE'' or ''STEP UP'' in the UK, OMEGA in Benelux, STREAM in Asia or  RELIEF in France and Leaders For Tomorrow in the United States and  Canada. Increased mentoring The Group mentoring program, initiated in 2021, continued in 2023  with 75 pairings. With the involvement of mentors, members of the Group Executive  Committee and Management Committee, mentoring helps develop  competencies, accelerate career opportunities and expand the  professional network of mentees. In 2023, two new aspects were set up: ■“boosters” workshops were created. They were specially designed  to provide practical tools, integrate apprenticeships and make the  most of the mentoring relationship, strengthening the leadership  and operational effectiveness of mentees; ■this program, exclusively reserved for women upon its creation,  was also opened to men in 2023. This program is scheduled to be renewed in 2024, with a launch in  April that will welcome 50 new pairings. Executive development programs ■The EXECUTIVE SEMINAR prepares individuals for corporate  management by working on a changing world and its impact on  our current and future activities, and the ability to carry the values  of corporate social responsibility. It is based on four study trips  spread over one year and offers training conferences, the discovery  of Veolia activities and numerous visits to external companies.  Trainees complete the program with a project related to the  Group’s strategy, which they present to the Executive Committee.  Veolia is particularly focused on including a significant portion of  women in training schemes aimed at talents and executives. ■EXPLORE  TOMORROW:  a  learning  expedition  focused  on  innovation and digital transformation; ■LEADING TEAMS in crisis times: team management training  focused on crisis and uncertainty management. In 2023, 168 top executives participated in the Group’s talent  programs. 4.4.4.3  Actions and results Training indicators The indicator adopted for the Impact 2023 plan is the average number  of hours of training per employee (expressed in FTE - full- time  equivalent) and per year. In 2023, the Group delivered 29 training hours per employee,  compared with 26 hours in 2022, i.e. a 3h increase per employee. This  result largely exceeds the 2023 target of 23 hours. Change in average training hours per employee 17h 21h 26h 29h (√) 23h 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023  Objective 0h 10h 20h 30h 40h In addition, this progress is reflected in the results of the 2023 Voice of  Resourcers Engagement Survey, which highlights a high level of  employee satisfaction with training. 84% of respondents consider that  they have enhanced their skills in the past year. Change in training indicators These very satisfactory results were attributable to: ■improved tracking of learning situations (induction days, webinars,  workshops, etc.) which, based on an educational objective, enables  employees to develop their skills in the context of their activity; ■continuation of Group programs launched in 2022 to support the  integration of management teams (more than 1,200 executives,  talents and managers participated in a Group program in 2023); CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Human resources performance: impact on employees VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 283  ===== PAGE 286 ===== ■accelerating Digital Learning with an on-shelf catalogue available  to all 100,000 users of the Group Learning@Veolia platform,  offering a wide range of e-learning courses in many languages  through new partnerships with LinkedIn Learning and Climate  School. The aim in 2024 is to consolidate this excellent result and improve it  further by refining the learning ambition of the Strategic Programme,  which is based on the following pillars: ■development of the strategic competencies identified in GreenUp  24-27; ■strengthening of the Veolia leadership and culture; ■further improvement in learning effectiveness through digital  technology. This indicator was not used as a main multifaceted performance  indicator at Group level for the new strategic plan. However, it will  continue to be steered and monitored to assess the Group’s human  resources performance.

In 2023, the Group invested €743 per full-time equivalent employee in  training (€652 in 2022). Relations with schools at Group level A proactive approach reaches out to the public and local employment  and training partners to raise awareness of environmental activities  and services. It facilitates the recruitment of candidates for local jobs,  including people with no prior experience. Mobilizing and attracting  the resources required by the company is a key priority: Veolia affirms  its presence through events focused on environmental businesses, job  and work-study fairs, and forums in schools and universities. The  partnerships set up with schools and universities also contribute to  the reputation of Veolia and its businesses among students  completing strategic training for Group. Programs like the “Veolia  Summer School”, the Ecological Transformation trophies and the  Student solidarity Prize are special opportunities that give  international students an opportunity to discover Veolia’s businesses  and to adapt their course of study to the Group’s challenges. These  actions aim to consolidate Veolia’s visibility with young graduates,  and strengthen its appeal by positioning it as a responsible, innovative  and meaningful business. Veolia Summer School dedicated to ecological  transformation In 2023, the fully virtual Veolia Summer School brought together  students from all its geographies. Over five days, 63 Master’s students,  from 36 countries, spread across 14 multinational teams and three  different time zones, discovered the Veolia universe through  presentations from experts and operational managers in all countries.  Along with Veolia specialists, they discussed the challenges of  ecological transformation and possible solutions by working as a  group on business cases, the results of which they presented to a  panel of experts. Ecological transformation trophies Since 1998, the Trophies have been awarded to the most innovative  end-of-study dissertations by French or foreign students in their last  year of education (Bac+5) from engineering and business schools and  universities.  Short-listed students and applicants came to Veolia’s headquarters in  December 2023 to present their theses to a jury of Veolia  professionals. Four 2023 winners from UTH in Zurich, Imperial College  & Royal college of London, UFJR in Rio de Janeiro, and INP de Grenoble  were rewarded. Launch of a Group Graduate Program In 2023, the Group Human Resources Department launched a new  program: the Veolia graduate program. Hirings were finalized at the  end of 2023 for an official launch of the first year group on January 11,  2025: in total, seven entities (Eau France, RVD, VESA, SARPI, VWT Egypt, India, Middle East) are taking part in this 24-month  program, during which eight recently graduated young engineers will  discover the Group in all its diversity. Hired under permanent contracts, they will begin their first year with  two months at the recruiting entity’s headquarters, before a ten- month assignment at the operational site. In the second year, they will  learn about the Group’s diversity thanks to a 3-month innovation  assignment (in a Hub or at the IT department), followed by a 6-month  operational assignment abroad before returning to the original entity. At the same time as these field experiences, the graduates will  complete an ad hoc training program, combining Group talent e-  learnings and programs (VIP and Disrupt). The purpose of this program is to train young high-potential engineers  and retain operational managers destined to progress rapidly within  Veolia.  4.4.4.3.1  Engaging employees Management Behaviors @Veolia, a common  managerial  identity Because the cultural dimension is one of the major challenges and one  of the key success factors for the integration of Suez into Veolia,  defining a new common culture was essential. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Human resources performance: impact on employees 284 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 287 ===== With this in mind, consistency / pooling work resulted in  “Management Behaviours@Veolia”. Via workshops with Veolia managers (1,200 participants), the Group’s  five values were reflected in 20 concrete behaviors. These behaviors contribute directly to ecological transformation and  the multifaceted performance and are really unique. A new guide on managerial behavior was drafted for the Resourcers of  this common cultural identity. The roll-out began and should continue in 2024 and behaviors were  incorporated into several key HR processes: next annual assessment  cycle (OneForm), 360° assessments, training programs, etc. Management Behaviors@Veolia is also included in several events and  gatherings: VIP, Excellence, etc. Employee engagement survey In line with its Purpose and the Impact 2023  strategic program,  Veolia is committed to giving meaning to our employees’ work and  helping them with career development and engagement, with the  objective of maintaining the employee engagement score at more  than 80% by 2023. The engagement index and the positive response rate to the ethics  and compliance question are therefore included in Veolia’s  multifaceted performance indicators. The Voice of Resourcers engagement survey was conducted over three  weeks in November 2023 with an extended panel of around 155,000  employees (equivalent to 2022) based on a fully online questionnaire  available in 29 languages and adapted to a wide audience as follows: ■all Group managers in 55 countries; ■all employees in 37 Business Units/entities: Germany, Argentina,  South Africa, Australia/New Zealand, Belux, Brazil, Canada, China,  Ecuador, Water France, Enova, USA, Spain, Hong Kong, Hungary,  Italy, Ireland, Macau, Morocco, MIB, Middle East, Nordics,  Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Czech Republic, Waste Recycling  and Recovery, Romania, United Kingdom, VESA, Veolia Water  Technologies, WTS, SARPI-IWS, Seureca, Slovakia; This panel represents 75% of the Group’s workforce. The 2023 survey participation rate increased significantly: 79% of the  entire panel, or more than 121,000 employees, responded to the  questionnaire, i.e. up by 7 points compared to 2022. Changes in the engagement index 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Employee  engagement index  84 %  87 %  87 %  89 %  89 % Manager  engagement index  92 %  94 %  94 %  91 %  91 % Employee engagement, the index for which is calculated based on  questions regarding work objective clarity, useful contribution, work  atmosphere, sense of belonging and the desire to recommend Veolia  to family members as a place to work, remained high at 89%. It was  maintained at 91% for managers and 88% for non-managers. The  overall index is 15 points above the sector benchmark. The results highlight the Group’s strong dynamics and the support of  teams in the context of the Suez post-merger: 82% of respondents are  confident in the Group’s ability to achieve its ambition of becoming  the world leader in ecological transformation. The strengths identified since 2019 were once again confirmed:  initiative, collaboration, pride of belonging, performance and  customer focus, health and safety. More and more employees believe  in the Group’s ability to innovate and processes are becoming more  simplified and effective. The results are positive; 28 assessment criteria gained points. 70% of respondents know the Group’s purpose and among them (+11  points vs 2022), 93% consider that their work contributes to this  purpose (+1 point vs 2022). Over the past year, 84% of respondents believe they have enhanced  their skills (+2 points vs 2022). 84% also see themselves working well  at Veolia in the years to come. Managerial practices are appreciated: 86% of respondents consider  that their manager supports them in difficult situations (+2 points vs  2022) The Diversity and Inclusion Index gained 2 points with 79% positive   responses. This survey in now conducted annually, demonstrating Veolia’s  interest in the employee experience and ascertaining employee  expectations in the field, their perception of the business and their  professional situation. The 2023 “Voice of Resourcers” edition delivered an updated view of  the social climate, providing key indicators and trends for employee  commitment and their understanding of the Company’s vision,  policies and culture. The 2023 “Voice of Resourcers” helped: ■supplement HR performance indicators at different levels of the  organization (Group, zone, country); ■support managers by providing tools updated for interaction with  and feedback from teams; ■demonstrate, once again, the importance of HR innovation and  dialogue with employees at Veolia. The overall results of this survey were presented to the Group’s  Executive Committee and the Veolia Environnement Board of  Directors. The results per zone were sent to zone directors and human  resources directors, which organize feedback with the surveyed  employees. Action plans are established based on the overall results of each zone  and will be implemented during the first-half of 2024. 4.4.4.4  Compensation policy  and employee savings Veolia applies a comprehensive compensation policy that is consistent  with the Company’s results and encompasses the following  components: wages, social protection, employee savings and  retirement. This policy is based on the following general principles: ■offering competitive compensation in accordance with local  markets; ■guaranteeing competitive fixed and variable compensation which  reflects the Company’s results; ■harmonizing the calculation bases and methods for the variable  components of executive compensation across the Group,  particularly by integrating Veolia’s multifaceted performance  indicators in the bonus calculation of all managers; CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Human resources performance: impact on employees VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 285  ===== PAGE 288 ===== ■optimizing coverage of health care and insurance costs in the main  countries where the Group operates; ■harmonizing existing employee savings plans; ■securing existing pension plans in the various countries where the  Group operates by privileging defined contribution plans. Compensation Total compensation consists of a basic salary and individual or  collective performance-based variable compensation (depending on  the professional category, countries and applicable regulations). Veolia ensures that the compensation paid to employees complies  with the legislation in force in the country (minimum wage, overtime  etc.). Veolia ensures that the Group’s employees, particularly blue  collar workers (50% of the workforce), are systematically above  national minimums or on minimum wages paid on the labor market  for a given job. The annual average gross compensation for all Group employees was  40,350 in 2023 (€39,303 in 2022). In 2023, average gross compensation was €40,973 for men (€39,983 in  2022), and €38,034 for women (€36,732 in 2022), representing an  average difference of €2,939 (vs €3,251 in 2022). Breakdown of average compensation by category  (in euros) Average  compensation of  women Average  compensation of men Managers 65,953 83,421 Non managers 28,142 32,774 This difference is mainly due to the distribution of men and women  between different jobs. These averages are only indicative, however, and should be  interpreted with an element of caution. They correspond to a wide  diversity of situations due to the nature of the professions and jobs  carried out and their geographic location. This data is also impacted by  fluctuations in exchange rates. It is Veolia policy to respect equality between men and women who  have the same employment conditions and qualifications. For this  purpose, the Group is particularly vigilant regarding the application of  a fair wage policy. Decent salary  As part of its ESG policy, Veolia launched a pilot scheme in 6 countries  representing a significant proportion of the group’s workforce and  covering all the main operating regions: France, United States, United  Kingdom, Japan, Colombia, Poland. Work was initiated at the end of 2023 during meetings organized with  local HR officers. The study will be finalized in 2024. Anti-inflation measures In France, with regard to the ongoing inflationary context in 2023 and  in keeping with the measures adopted in 2022 (additional wage  increases set up on September 1 and measures to promote soft  mobility), a 1% wage increase measures for non-executive employees  as of September 1, 2023, in addition to wage revisions at the start of  the year. For the second year running, the implementation of a measure to  factor in a high level of inflation helped maintain a stable social  environment, in the same way as it resulted in the satisfactory  conduct of 2024 mandatory annual negotiations. Internationally, wage measures in addition to those already applied at  the start of 2023 were also adopted in a certain number of countries to  take into account the inflationary context. Social protection: Veolia Cares Veolia aims to offer all its employees the social guarantees to protect  them against life’s risks. Veolia Cares is a comprehensive employee  benefits program that is exceptional in its avant-garde nature and  scope. Launched in 2022, it has been fully deployed in all our  geographies since September 1, 2023. Veolia Cares is based on five pillars: ■parental leave: basic salary maintained over 10 weeks for the first  parent, and over 1 week for the second parent. This measure can  also be used in the event of adoption. ■death cover: capital equivalent to at least six months of salary is  paid to beneficiaries, whatever the cause of death. ■health cover: guaranteed access to medical care for all our  employees, whatever the local organizational methods (legal life  insurance and corporate schemes). ■support for our employee carers: all employees carers are given the  necessary flexibility in the organization of working time. ■community charity work: possibility for each employee to devote  one paid day-off per year to a charity or environmental protection  organization in line with Group values. Veolia Cares applies to all Group employees, without gender  discrimination, and whatever their status from the first day of  recruitment. This program seeks to improve the safety and well-being of  employees. It is a factor of appeal and pride for employees and future  employees.  In addition to these 5 Veolia Cares program pillars, and specifically for  France, two new measures were also adopted as of January 1,2024. The extension of death cover in the event of a professional accident:  Previously, this cover was only offered to executives, via the Veolia  insurance captive; now non-executives also receive this cover with the  payment of 2.5 years of salary for beneficiaries. A scheme to help eligible employees return to employment organized  by a dedicated service provider. With this program, employees who  have been off work for long periods due to a long- term illness are  supported to enable them to easily resume a professional activity  while limiting the risk of relapse or social exclusion. To date, this  program covers ⅔ of Veolia employees in France and should be  extended in 2024. Profit-sharing and incentive schemes The Group’s French entities are generally covered by profit-sharing  agreements when they fulfill the necessary employee and financial  conditions. Veolia favors extending incentive agreements in France to give  employees a vested interest in the performance of the companies to  which they are assigned, based on criteria tailored specifically to the  business in question. At the end of 2022, nearly 96% employees of  French entities were covered by an incentive agreement. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Human resources performance: impact on employees 286 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 289 ===== In 2023, gross profit-sharing and incentive payments for all French  entities including Veolia Environnement, in respect of 2022, totaled  €107,803,929. Gross amounts invested in 2023 by employees of French  entities in respect of 2022 profit-sharing and incentive payments  totaled €65.94 million  (1),or 61.16% of the sums distributed. Added to this amount is a gross contribution from the Group’s French  entities amounting to €4.04 million. Employee savings and retirement savings Since 2002, Group employees in France have been able to save in the  medium term with the help of their company via the Group savings  plan (PEG). In addition, Veolia Environnement offers its employees and the  employees of its French subsidiaries under an agreement signed with  labor and management partners (December 2012), access to a Group  retirement savings plan (“PERCOL G”). This plan allows employees who  so wish to prepare for retirement under advantageous tax and social  security conditions. In 2020, a new amendment was signed changing  the PERCO to a PERCOL and enabling Group employees to benefit from  the advantages offered by the Pacte Law. At the end of 2023, employee savings in France in the two Group savings plans totaled €816.89 million broken down as follows: ■€720.57  million in the PEG held by 76,653 current and former  employees; ■€92.04 million in the PERCOL G held by 41,956 current and former  employees. ■€4.23 million in Blocked Current Accounts (CCB) held by 6,275  current and former employees. Company investment funds invested in Veolia shares (employee share  ownership) total €475.89 million in 2023 and are held in the PEG. The range of dedicated company investment funds (monetary, equity,  bonds, and diversified) totaling €336.77 million is held in the PEG and  the PERCOL. Sequoia: Employee share ownership The last transaction took place in 2023. Veolia wished to enable  190,144 employees (2) in 49 countries to benefit from a leveraged offer  in addition to the standard offer. With these two offers, employees  benefited from: ■a secure offer guaranteeing a minimum return on capital invested  of 4% per year (including the employer’s contribution as part of the  offering), as well as a multiple of 2.9 in the event of an increase in  the Veolia share price; ■a standard offer with a discounted subscription price. Subscriptions therefore totaled 78,935 representing a 41.5% Group-  wide subscription rate. The average person contribution invested per  employee increased significantly to €831 in 2023 (vs €552 in 2022).  Accordingly, the total amount subscribed was €221.9  million (3),  including leverage and the Group’s additional contribution. This rate  represents a 0.5-point rise on 2022 and is also the highest rate ever  achieved by Veolia since the launch of the first employee share  ownership transaction in 2004. As of December 31, 2023, over 158,000 current and former Group  employees were Veolia Environnement shareholders, holding 7.5% of  its share capital (vs. 6.5% at the end of 2022). Veolia employees  therefore remain the Group’s leading shareholder. As such, all of the Group’s employee shareholders voted in 2022 to  elect an employee director to represent them on Veolia's Board of  Directors. Performance share plan In 2023, Veolia deployed a performance share plan aimed at 526  beneficiaries, including Group executives, high potential staff and key  contributors, including corporate officers. This plan benefits senior executives, high potentials and key  contributors equally. It is subject to the following conditions: ■beneficiaries must remain with the Group until the end of the  three-year vesting period i.e. until expiry of the plan scheduled for  2025; ■a performance condition tied to the attainment of the following  internal and external criteria: • an economic criterion, • a stock market criterion, • criteria relating to the Company’s Purpose. These elements are detailed in Chapter 3, Section 3.4.3 above. Pension plans Pension plans are directly managed in the various countries where the  Group operates based on the applicable labor and tax legislation. The Group pension plan policy is to replace defined benefit pension  plans, if possible, with defined contribution pension plans that are  more cost-effective and balanced with respect to all stakeholders.

Veolia considers diversity and social cohesion  as an asset and a driver of performance. Moreover, the Group views  diversity as a priority, as it ensures internal cooperation, commitment  and employee loyalty. Non-compliance with human and social rights has a direct impact,  leading to labor disputes, disengagement and damage to the  employer brand (see Chapter 2, Section 2.2.2.4 above). Consequently, Veolia aims for innovative and respectful labor  relations with its internal stakeholders, which allows it to provide  collective solutions. 4.4.5.2  Cohesion and social dialogue 4.4.5.2.1  Policy and commitments Veolia is particularly vigilant regarding labor relations, as it  contributes to greater workforce cohesion, the implementation of  human resources policies, and the Group’s economic and social  performance. As part of its Purpose, Veolia encourages social dialogue, particularly  within employee representative bodies, which help employees to  adopt the collective project. Social dialogue takes place at the highest level of the organization,  with the two Directors representing employees appointed by the  Group French and European Works Councils, respectively and a non- voting member who sit on the Board of Directors. It forms an integral part of the Group’s purpose: “Veolia also  promotes,  particularly  on  staff  representative  bodies,  social  dialogue,which encourages employees to adopt our collective project  as their own.” Veolia reiterated its commitments, objectives and vision of social  dialogue in its social dialogue policy published in 2023. The social  dialogue commitments have been incorporated into the “Essentials”,  an internal document that sets out the rules, processes and policies  that apply to all managers within the Group. Veolia has prepared a certain number of indicators to assess and steer  the policy and quality of its social dialogue to define its new  objectives: ■social dialogue coverage rate (countries legally recognizing the  freedom of association and collective bargaining); ■list of countries not covered and action plan; ■collective bargaining: number of agreements signed for the Group  as a whole and by country (1,713 agreements signed in 2023 in  40 countries); ■thematic analysis of the signed agreements; ■monitoring of conflictuality rates; ■analysis of feedback or conclusions of mediations organized during  major controversies or conflicts; ■analysis of Whispli alerts on social dialogue matters; ■number of employee representatives in the Group and by country. To advance the quality and development of labor relations, Veolia  ensures that there is effective dialogue with employees at all levels of  the organization: ■at company or site level, a place for negotiations on many issues  that impact employees’ daily lives. Within Veolia, 1,713 new labor  agreements signed at operating level supplement the Group  directives and agreements; ■at country level, which includes the formal structures for  consultation and dialogue that handle all transversal national  issues; ■at Group level in the corporate offices and with the Group French  and European Works Councils. In collective bargaining negotiations, Veolia draws on both direct  relationships with trade union and employee representatives, as well  as the joint organizations created according to the rules of each  country. Veolia gives the same amount of attention to its various levels of local  and national bargaining and initiated in 2023 a process to build  transnational agreements with the European Federation of Public  Service Unions (EPSU). Social dialogue is expressed in the employee representation bodies,  through information and consultation processes or exchanges of  views on key issues within local, country or Group bodies (France and  Europe Group Committees). Executive Management systematically  participates in Group bodies. Role of the Group’s Committees Through an agreement, Veolia has implemented a Group French  Works Council and a Group European Works Council. The Group  European Works Council represents about two-thirds of Veolia  employees. It is made up of 16  countries: Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech  Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg,  Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, United  Kingdom.   The Group Works Councils are key players in Veolia’s transformation.  They receive information on the activity, the financial position and the  employment situation. They must be informed or consulted in the  event of restructuring, acquisition or disposal plans, as was the case  throughout the merger between Veolia and Suez. They are also  informed and consulted each year to exchange ideas on the Group’s  strategic direction and its social impacts. The agreements signed with trade union representatives at Group  France level and agreements in the form of joint commitments made  within the Group European Works Council demonstrate the will of  Executive Management to structure unique relations with employee  representatives and thus contribute to the Group’s actions on behalf  of all its employees. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Human resources performance: impact on employees 288 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 291 ===== Annual discussion on Group strategy with the Group French  and European Works Councils Since 2015, management meets annually with members of the  Group French and European Works Councils to discuss the  Group’s strategic direction and its human resource impacts.  These annual discussions provide a shared understanding of the  strategic and commercial challenges and their impacts on the  workforce, employment and skills.  At a time when various consultations were being conducted  within the Group to build the 2024-2027 strategic program, it  was requested that employee representatives for the Group  French and European Works Councils be included in the  discussions. The aim of this integration is to consider the  priorities raised by the Councils when preparing the next  strategic program, particularly regarding the main human  resources issues in the context of ecological transformation.  The “+1” consultation process (see section 4.1.2, above) dedicated to  employee representatives was set up to create a common dynamic to  address ecological transformation and devise, with the help of our  stakeholders, solutions for the future.  Following a second session, the main recommendations of Group  France and European Works Council members focused on the  performance of an analysis of current competencies, the capitalization  of competencies already present internally or even the development  of internal and geographical mobilities, and on the transmission of  know-how and investing in training in connection with the ecological  transformation, the set-up of specific training assessment and  monitoring indicators, encouraging and showcasing the sharing of  know-how between peers (mentoring, joint development) and raising  the awareness of managers about monitoring and upskilling their  teams. In addition, in 2023, the new members of the European Works Council,  particularly those from the merger with Suez, received a two-day  training session on European Works Council operating procedures and  the role of its members. Veolia - Member of the United Nations Global Compact Veolia has adhered to the United Nations Global Compact since  June  2003, committing the Group to promoting ten fundamental  principles concerning in particular human rights, labor rights and the  environment. Since 2014, Veolia has been at the “Advanced” level of  the Global Compact Differentiation Program, which, based on  21 specific criteria, is the highest level of UN reporting and voluntary  performance standard with respect to sustainable development. 4.4.5.2.2  Actions and results Change in the rate of coverage by a social dialogue body In 2023, 86.2% of employees were covered by a social dialogue body. 88% 86% 87% 85% 86% (√) 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 0 20 40 60 80 100 In countries where freedom of association and the right to collective  bargaining are not recognized, Veolia maintains labor relations by  leading workshops groups on specific issues (health and safety, social  protection, social responsibility, etc.). Furthermore, each year Veolia examines whether the countries where  it operates are covered by a social dialogue body. The results are  presented to the Group France and European Works Councils as part of  the review of strategic directives. Those countries which are not  covered are discussed with council members. Veolia reiterated its  commitments on the promotion of basic human and social rights  including freedom of association and the importance of collective  bargaining. Overview of collective agreements In 2023, 1,713 new collective agreements were signed at entity or  company level or with Group bodies in each country. All of these  collective agreements impact the Company’s labor and therefore  economic performance.

There were 1,009 strikes in 2023, mainly relating to the pension reform  in France. They represented 0.05% of the total number of days worked. Pursuant to the employment protection law, two directors  representing employees were appointed in 2014 by the Group French  and European Works Councils, respectively, to sit on the Veolia  Environnement Board of Directors for four years. In May  2018,  Mr. Pavel Pâša was reappointed by the Group European Works Council.  In September  2018, Mr.  Franck Le Roux was elected by the Group  French Works Council. Their terms were renewed in 2022 for another  4 years and will expire on October 15, 2026. (see Section 3.1.1.2 above). Furthermore, Mr. Enric Amiguet i Rovira, a director representing  employees on the Suez Board of Directors was appointed as a non-  voting member of the Veolia Environnement Board of Directors in 2022.

Group European Works Council meeting in Agbar/learning expedition with labor and management representatives on ecological  transformation solutions: during the Group European Works Council meeting organized in Barcelona, Spain, at the headquarters of  Agbar, two site visits were organized for members of the council and the council’s new Spanish delegation: one to the Aigües de  Barcelona center in Collblanc on the theme of water reuse and another to the Biogas plant in Zona Franca on Veolia Énergie innovative  solutions. Social dialogue at European level In November 2023 the latest meeting of the European Works Council  Health & Safety Working Group was held to finalize common draft  resolutions to develop and accelerate the roll-out of the health, safety  and well-being at work culture and policies. This working group  launched at the end of 2022 comprised European Works Council  members appointed from 8 different countries and representing all  Group activities in Europe (Water, Waste and Energy). These common  draft resolutions comprise 10 fundamentals which are consistent with  the 5 Veolia Health & Safety pillars and applicable to all entities  included in the scope of the Veolia European Works Council. Aligned  with these 10 fundamentals on health and safety at work, 10 priority  measures were defined to strengthen the prevention culture and  performance in terms of the health, safety and well-being of all  employees and external contributors working on Veolia sites within  the Veolia European Works Council scope. They are in line with the  health and safety performance contracts drawn up in early 2023 to  help Group Bus and/or entities to roll out priorities and transform  their safety culture. At the end of June 2023, further negotiations were launched on a draft  European framework agreement on Diversity and Inclusion in  collaboration with the EPSU (European Public Services Union). The aim  of this framework agreement is to build momentum and outline with  main principles of the Veolia diversity and inclusion policy in line with  national and European requirements, particularly the European  Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). A Special Negotiation  Group was set up comprising 19 trade union representatives from 13  European countries (France, UK, Spain, Germany, Czech Republic,  Belgium, Poland, Italy, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Bulgaria and the  Netherlands). The key discussions focused on: ■the widespread expansion of the diversity and inclusion culture,  particularly through social dialogue and the challenge of cognitive  biases; ■further action against any form of discrimination and exclusion in  favor of equal treatment based on 4 Veolia D&I policy  pillars(gender diversity, respect for gender identities, integration  and development of employees with disabilities and diversity of  social and cultural bodies); ■prevention and strengthening of measures against any form of  harassment and violence, including support for employees  experiencing domestic violence; ■support for the living conditions of employees, including the Veolia  Cares program, support for parental leave, help to family  caregivers, etc.; ■training/awareness-raising  (including  the  deconstruction  of  stereotypes and support to managers/HR to promote the roll-out  of the Veolia D&I policy). Under the 2010 Group France agreement, reviewed in 2020, trade  union seminars were set up by each organization in order to improve  their structure and define the priorities of the Group’s employee  policy. These seminars are renewed each year and are the subject of an  open dialogue session with Group human resources management. The  new agreement on the quality and development of social dialogue  signed in 2020 also includes a general system for union career  management and to support representatives at the end of their  mandates. Adherence to the Global Deal Veolia participates actively in Global Deal France working groups,  notably on the future of work and changes to skills. Veolia’s skills- based international social dialogue experience was presented in 2019  in the publication “Global Deal members commit to the G7 Social” and  in 2021 upon the creation of a social dialogue quality index, currently  being validated by the Global Deal bodies and its ILO and the OECD  partners. In 2022, Veolia participated in the working group on duty of  care issues.

These commitments comprise several objectives, including diversity. Commitment Objective SDG Indicator – definition 2020  Results 2021  Results 2022  Results 2023  Results 2023  Target Give meaning to our  employees work and  help them with career  development and  engagement Diversity • Proportion of  women appointed  among Executive  Resourcers from  2020 to 2023  (1) 28.3% 30.4% 30.3%  30.7 % 50% Sponsor Helman le Pas de Sécheval Member of the Executive Committee, Group General Counsel (1) Previously referred to as the Group’s Top 500 senior executives. As part of its GreenUp 2024-2027 strategic program, Veolia renewed its commitment in favor of its employees and  adopted the following objective and target: Commitment Objective SDG Indicator – definition 2023 baseline 2027  target Give meaning to our  employees work and  help them with career  development and  engagement Diversity and  inclusion • Proportion of women in the Group  Management Committee  25.6%  ≥ 30 % Sponsor Helman le Pas de Sécheval Member of the Executive Committee, Group General Counsel Diversity policy and inclusion Our Diversity and Inclusion policy is based on Group values of respect  and solidarity that require our employees to be treated with respect  and fairness and without discrimination. This implies that they should  feel recognized as an individual and full members of our collective  system so that they can contribute fully to the Group’s ambition to  become the champion of ecological transformation. The Group has therefore renewed its commitment to be a more  diverse and inclusive company, ensuring non-discrimination, equal  treatment and individual social promotion for all employees. Our Diversity and Inclusion policy focuses on three fundamentals: ■guarantee fair and non-discriminatory HR and managerial  practices, from induction until the end of careers, for all employee  categories; ■guarantee non-discriminatory access to employment in Veolia  (age, origin, disability, gender, sexual orientation, religion, etc.); ; ■guarantee the advancement of social dialogue and employee  freedom of speech. Accordingly, the Group wishes that all its entities endeavor to: ■further the roll-out of action plans in favor of gender diversity and  gender equality (attract and retain, reduce wage inequalities,  promote and support women’s careers and combat sexism and  sexual harassment); ■develop and create inclusion programs for individuals with  disabilities (welcome and integrate, retain in employment,  facilitate accessibility, forge partnerships and raise employee  awareness); ■develop and create inclusion programs for LGBT+ individuals in  accordance with local laws (train and inform about LGBT+ phobias,  ensure inclusive HR and managerial processes and showcase our  commitment); ■develop and create action plans in favor of social and cultural  diversity (promote access to employment for those most exposed  to discrimination, create conditions for social promotion, unite all  diversities and combat racial discrimination). The diversity of the Group’s employees and the recognition of all  talents and competencies are key to overcoming the challenges of  ecological transformation. It is for this reason that diversity and inclusion at Veolia must form  part of a corporate culture which leaves no-one to one side and is  based on HR and managerial processes that can deliver our ambition. In accordance with applicable local laws and regulations, Veolia will  not permit, practice or support any type of discrimination based on  age, medical condition, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation,  pregnancy, disability, ethnic origin, religion, political opinions,  philosophical opinions, family status, morals, family name, trade  union activities, place of residence, vulnerability resulting from their  economic situation, migrant status, belonging or not belonging, in  reality or presumed, to an ethnic group, a nation or so-called race. This  list of examples of discrimination was drawn up for the sake of clarity  and is not exhaustive. Coordination of the Diversity and Inclusion policy The Diversity and Inclusion policy is supported by a global network of  Diversity and Inclusion coordinators. At the end of 2023, the Group had around 100 correspondents and  33 local Diversity and Inclusion networks in the following countries/ BUs: Veolia North America, United Kingdom, Poland, Germany, Belux,  Italy, India, Australia-New Zealand, China, Ecuador, Mexico, Argentina,  Chile, Peru, Colombia, Portugal, Spain, Morocco, France, Romania,  Netherlands, Côte d’Ivoire, South Africa, Taiwan, South Korea. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Human resources performance: impact on employees VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 291  ===== PAGE 294 ===== Their duties are to: ■implement commitments with regards to local issues; ■establish diagnoses and action plans adapted to contexts; ■measure results; ■promote innovative actions which support Veolia values. The Diversity & Inclusion action plan was set up to promote a culture  of inclusion guaranteeing that each employee is treated without  discrimination, recognized as an individual and is a full member of the  company’s collective system. It focuses on four priority targets: ■diversity; ■LGBT+ employees (in regions where the cause may be supported) ■disability; ■social and cultural diversity The Group Diversity and Inclusion Department organizes meetings  with the Diversity and Inclusion coordinators every 2 months. In 2023, a seminar brought together Group D&I coordinators to further  strengthen our Diversity &amp; Inclusion network and enhance our  roadmap based on 4 priority pillars and transversal themes. Assessment of the Diversity and inclusion policy To measure the impact of its diversity and inclusion actions, Veolia  monitors several indicators: ■gender equality: the employment rate for women, the percentage  of women managers, the percentage of women in management  recruitment, the percentage of women departures, the percentage  of women executives, and the percentage of women on Group  company Boards of Directors, including the Veolia Environnement  Board; ■disability: the employment rate for employees with disabilities; ■the employment rate for employees over the age of 55; ■the employment rate for employees under the age of 30. ■training rate by age and gender An annual Diversity and Inclusion index produced in connection with  the Group engagement survey is used to measure employee  perception of this topic. In 2023, the index stood at 79% Diversity and inclusion training and awareness-raising A comprehensive offer of online training modules (LinkedIn Learning)  was made available to employees in 2023 in connection with the  Diversity and Inclusion Academy of the Group Learning program.  Employees can therefore access around twenty online training courses  covering  gender  diversity,  disability,  inclusive  management,  unconscious biases, cultural and social diversity and the issue of LGBT+  issues in regions where it can be raised. In addition, a workshop on unconscious biases (in French, English and  Spanish) is available to entities to raise employee awareness about  stereotypes and prejudices. A sequence dedicated to the presentation of the Diversity and  Inclusion action plan was included in the Group’s VIP integration  program More than 800 Group managers attended this new sequence  in 2023. Support for the United Nations LGBTI standards of conduct  for business  In accordance with its CSR commitments, its human rights policy and  its adherence to the Global Compact, Veolia supports the United  Nations standards of conduct for business regarding combating  discrimination against the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and  intersex community. These five standards were developed by the  United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. 4.4.5.3.2  Actions and results Ongoing partnerships The Group is a partner and/or a member of various organizations that  promote diversity and equal opportunity, notably the UN Global  Compact and the International Labor Organization.  In France, Veolia has also partnered with several associations such as  the  French  Association  of  Diversity  Managers  (AFMD)  the  À Compétences égales association and ANVIE. Diversity within the Group To encourage diversity and gender equality in the workplace,  Veolia has set itself quantified objectives: • women to make up more than 40% of the Veolia  Environnement Board of Directors; • women to make up 30% of managers in 2023; • 35% of women managers recruited on permanent contracts  every year; • 50% of women appointed among senior executives  (Executive Resourcers) between 2020 and 2023; • 26% of women among the Group’s senior executives in 2023  (Executive Resourcers); 30% in 2026 and 40% in 2029.

(Code de commerce). Since 2020, 30.7% of women were appointed among top executives (Executive Resourcers). The percentage of women among the Group’s executive officers (Executive Resourcers) rose from 15% in 2016 to 26.7% in 2023. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Human resources performance: impact on employees 292 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 295 ===== The percentage of women managers has steadily increased since  2020, from 28.3% in 2020 to 31% in 2023. The 30% target set for the  end of 2023 was achieved in 2022. Similarly, the external recruitment rate of women managers increased  from 30.9% in 2020 to 36.6% in 2023. The annual target of 35% was  achieved in 2022. In top management (executive resources), the proportion of women  increased by almost 6 points between 2020 and 2023 standing at  26.7% in 2023. Gender equality To attract talented people and ensure women are present at all levels  of the Group and in all its businesses, the Group has implemented an  action plan focusing on gender equality in the workplace so as to: ■develop gender equality in its jobs and operations; ■increase the number of women in the Group’s executive bodies  and management; ■promote gender equality in employee representative bodies. The Group’s actions to develop diversity in management focused on  the following points: ■recruitment: inclusive recruitment process and youth talent policy,  creation of a pool of women executives; ■identification: executive succession plan including at least one  woman for each executive (Executive Resourcers), a target of 50%  of women in high-potential people reviews, additional people  reviews for women with a grade below Executive Resourcers; ■development: development of mentoring by senior executives for  high-potential women executives, target of 50% of women in  Talents and Executive programs achieved; ■coordination of the WEDO gender equality network: numerous  initiatives promoting gender equality in the workplace have been  rolled out in the various countries where the Group operates with  the support of the WEDO network. WEDO is Veolia’s internal  gender equality network launched in 2016, bringing together  Veolia’s men and women who and seeking to promote gender  equality within the Group. At the end of 2023, this network had in  the Google Space community over 3,000 employees from around  50 countries: • among the actions undertaken by the network, WEDO renewed  the “Yes WEDO Week” which centered around the theme  chosen by the UN for International Women’s Rights Day 2022  on March 8, 2023: “DigitALL: Innovation and technology for  gender equality”. This week, dedicated to internal and external  awareness actions, was again very successful: 50 entities (+2 vs  2022) on 5 continents organized over 200 initiatives (+50 vs  2022): talks with young female pupils in schools, visits by  female middle and high school students to Veolia sites to learn  about Veolia’s businesses, conferences and webinars with  employees on gender equality issues, etc., • at the Group level, various gender diversity awareness-raising  initiatives were proposed to employees (in French, English and  Spanish): a roundtable at the Veolia headquarters “Les femmes  et la Tech” which brought together around 400 participants,  participation in a self-analysis “Êtes-vous un allié de la mixité? ”  accessed by around 1,500  employees, participation in a  conference based on key self-analysis components which  brought together 530 participants; ■the new WEDO for Tech program: • in 2023, Veolia set up the WEDO for Tech program to raise  awareness of young girls in technical sectors (IT, engineering,  etc.). This program rolls out various initiatives including  employee involvement in schools, welcoming students atVeolia  under the Ma Ville en Vert program or theTech my Job day. • The day of March 8, 2023 was also an opportunity to launch  Tech My Job as part of the WEDO for Tech program, set up for  Veolia women engineers, technicians or IT specialists to  welcome female students for a day to learn about their  profession and spend valuable time with a professional. The  aim is to inform young girls about technical businesses and  make them want to enter these sectors where women are  under-represented. At the headquarters, thirteen young girls  were welcomed by Veolia female employees; Tech My Job was  also set up in various countries and entities: Morocco, Niger,  France, Ecuador, Lebanon, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, India,  Colombia, i.e. 11 entities in total. ■awareness-raising initiatives such as the organization of the  conference on the prevention of sexist and sexual violence on the  International Day For The Elimination Of Violence Against Women  on November 24, 2023 to inform employees about the issue. This  event brought together 200 participants. ■the development program entitled “Women In Leadership - WIL”:  initiated by Veolia in North America, WIL was gradually deployed in  other regions: Africa (Morocco), Latin America (Colombia, Mexico)  and Asia-Pacific; WIL also has a Group program that is available to  participants from all geographic areas. This 7-month coaching  program seeks to create development opportunities for women  managers in the organization. It coached 83 women in 32 different  entities in 2023. This program alternates between group and  individual face-to-face and online sessions. Digital coaching and  online workshops are flexible and guaranteed to have an impact.  They maximize interaction by organizing regular meetings  between participants and their managers, who also benefit from  the program. The success of WIL is demonstrated by its high  satisfaction rate. In 2023, the program achieved a Net Promoter  Score (NPS) of 90 from participants; ■combating sexism at work: • with the set-up of the online module “Combating everyday  sexism in the workplace”. In 2023, 6,350 employees worldwide  were  invited  to  complete  this  module  launched  in  September 2020 for a pilot group of 1,000 individuals in France.  4,500 completed it, bringing the completion rate to 70%. This  module supplements the awareness actions already conducted  within several Veolia entities; • the signature in 2023 of the StOpE Sexisme initiative by Veolia  as part of its membership with the AFMD which seeks to  promote and share good practices within a group to combat  everyday sexism in the workplace. Veolia relies on internal tools  and took part in 3 good practice sharing events. ■the male/female professional equality index that companies with  over 50 employees in France are required to publish, the results of  Veolia entities in France published in March 2023 are mostly above  75/100 (legal minimum), with an overall index at 89/100, i.e.  +2  points compared to 2022. This result reflects Veolia’s efforts  over many years to create appealing and adapted conditions to  allow women to reach the same level of pay and career  opportunities as men.

(2) Number of employees with declared disabilities compared to the total workforce as of  12/31 in France (excluding subcontractors and the sheltered sector). At the end of 2023, 2.4% of Veolia employees worldwide had  disabilities, i.e. 4,167  employees. In France, this rate was 3.8% and  €10.4 million was spent in the protected workers sector. Veolia wishes  to change people’s perceptions of disability and the ways it is  represented. It also seeks to accompany people with disabilities and  their integration. Several actions were undertaken in this area: ■“Disability and work” of the International Labor Organization (ILO) Veolia joined the “Disability and Work” network of the ILO in  December 2022, strengthening its commitment towards the inclusion  of people with disabilities at Group level. In 2023, as a member of this  network, Veolia became involved in initiatives undertaken by the ILO,  particularly in consultations regarding the inclusion of people with  disabilities in green transition sectors, an active contribution to the  sharing of good practices such as the RVD entity initiative (waste  activity) “Handiscape” (an escape game designed by internal teams to  inform employees about invisible disabilities) that has to date  involved 700 employees (including 153 in 2023). ■Group Disability Good Practices Handbook To encourage our entities worldwide to support disability, in 2022  Veolia produced a handbook of good practices which is updated every  year. Structured around the action levers of our Diversity & Inclusion  (D&I) policy, this handbook focuses on welcoming and integration, job  retention, accessibility, local partnerships and the transformation of  the Group’s culture. Each entity is invited to share their experiences  and good practices in this handbook with the aim of going beyond  internal inspiration by also encouraging other BUs to set up similar  initiatives. To date, the handbook identifies 68 initiatives; 27 were  added in 2023. ■Group awareness-raising webinar On December 4, 2023, World Disability Day, the Group organized a  Webinar on neurodiversity, facilitated by an international expert, to  underline our commitment to explore all aspects of diversity to create  an inclusive work environment. This webinar was an opportunity to  reiterate the Group’s D&I strategy and recognize the signature of a  new Disability agreement at the headquarters. This webinar brought  together 600 participants (1,300 registrations in total). ■Signature of a Disability agreement at headquarters An agreement was signed between the HRM of the Veolia  Environnement SA entity (VESA) and labor and management  representatives on June 21, 2023. This agreement promotes  integration, job retention and career advancement for employees with  disabilities. It strengthens current initiatives and focuses on  recruitment, integration and training, job retention, development of  employability and awareness-raising and communication. Under this  agreement, a network of voluntary sponsors was set up, offering  customized support to employees with disabilities, ranging from an  individual welcome to guidance towards the right contacts. ■A few Group initiatives Additionally, numerous Group entities in different countries implement action plans and deploy awareness campaigns to better  acknowledge people with disabilities, in accordance with the legal  framework in each country. In France, during the Week for the Employment of People with  Disabilities (SEPH) in 2023, headquarter employees were made aware  of disabilities by taking part in the DuoDay program of the FACE  association. This initiative enabled voluntary employees to welcome  for a day people with disabilities at Veolia. In 2023, 80 1- day  internships were proposed and 40 positions were filled. In Germany, Veolia’s “Diversity Tuesdays” brought employees from  various departments and regions online to discuss diversity. Internal  and external experts enriched the exchanges and answered employee  questions. This initiative particularly showcased the inclusion of  people with disabilities. In India, Veolia WTS showcased a recruitment policy seeking to  promote the inclusion of people with disabilities. This initiative  comprises specific financial support for the children of employees with  mental disabilities to facilitate their access to special schools and  provide measures to promote their mobility and learning. This  strengthens  Veolia’s  commitment  to  an  inclusive  working  environment in support of caregiver employees. Social and cultural  inclusion and equal opportunities Various programs drive social and  cultural diversity globally and locally at Veolia. Below are few  examples. Social and cultural inclusion and equal opportunities Various programs drive social and cultural diversity  globally and locally at Veolia. Below are few examples. ■In 2023, “Ma Ville en Vert”, a program enabling students aged 13 to  18 from disadvantaged backgrounds to learn about the professions  of ecological transformation, was set up in several entities. It seeks  to make them aware that they have a role to play in ecological  transformation and there are different professions at Veolia to  achieve this. Welcomed at Veolia by volunteer employees who  accompany them throughout the day, students learn about  Veolia’s professions and are asked to imagine how their city could  become greener based on the knowledge they have acquired about  Veolia. At the end of the day, they present their project to an  internal jury of employees. In France, the most motivated students  are offered the chance to complete their ninth grade internship at  Veolia. In 2023, the program was rolled out in several entities (headquarters,  Seureca, Water France, Veolia Morocco, Veolia Argentina, Veolia  Colombia and Veolia South Africa, etc.). It is part of the group’s  human resource and social approach, particularly in terms of  diversity and inclusion and equal opportunity initiatives. ■In the Middle East, employees come from different countries,  which helps create a rich and inclusive work environment. Veolia  set up a practice to celebrate various cultural events and promote a  working environment in which employees can share their personal  experiences and cultural habits and learn from their diverse  backgrounds. Under this initiative, presentations are organized,  during which employees delve into the history and meaning of  various cultural and religious festivals. These presentations include  visual items such as traditional dishes, items of clothing and  decorations in relation to the event in question. These practices  strengthen our commitment in favor of an inclusive work culture  that respects all cultural diversities. ■Veolia Portugal set up the “Cultural guidance/teaching in  Portuguese” program for sorting operators who do not speak the  language. Classes took place at the Veolia site in Loures, where the  employees work. Each two-hour lesson is facilitated twice a week,  half during working hours and half after work. To date,  13 individuals benefited from these classes. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Human resources performance: impact on employees 294 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 297 ===== Measures promoting LGBT+ employees Train, inform, guarantee inclusive HR and managerial processes and  showcase Veolia’s commitment are lines of actions to promote LGBT+  employees. In 2023, a kit comprising around fifteen good practice sheets were  made available to D&I coordinators. These sheets inform employees  about LGBT+ phobias and the discriminations they may face, support  HR and managers in assisting LGBT+ employees with single parent  issues, gender transition, etc. This kit was created by the Agence  Française des Managers de la Diversité (AFMD), a Veolia partner. This  kit is also available in English. In June 2023, a conference in English and French was proposed to  employees to better understand LGBT phobias and how to act for  inclusion for LGBT+employees. This conference brought together 160  employees worldwide and two real transition situations were  addressed following this awareness-raising. Recruit without discrimination In France, recruitment without discrimination is addressed by Veolia’s  partnership with the association À  Compétence égale, renewed for  2023. This partnership enables Veolia recruiters to draw on good  practices from other companies, receive legal advice or even  participate in workshops on this topic. In 2023, the offer was  strengthened with an online kit Recruter sans discriminer (Recruit  without discriminating) which provided recruiters with the e-learning  module “Recruter sans discriminer” (441 recruiters have completed it  since 2021, including 141 in 2023), the online guide Recruter sans  discriminer for recruiters and any person in a recruitment situation  and tools proposed by the association À Compétence égale. Development of inter-generational relations In 2023, 21.7% (√) of the Group’s workforce were seniors (over the age  of 55) and 13.4% (√) were young (under the age of 30). Veolia  encourages its employees to profit from the knowledge of  experienced seniors, as well as the latest professional skills and  aptitudes of its young recruits. Veolia maintains the balance between  seniors and young people through internal recruiting, tutoring,  mentoring, training, etc. Supporting the most vulnerable employees To support the most vulnerable employees, the Group in France has  deployed an active outreach plan in consultation with trade union and  employee representatives. Alongside this, an employee listening and  support system has been established under the name Allô Solidarité to  offer assistance during difficult periods. Today, employees in France  have access to a telephone platform that allows them to discuss their  social challenges with professionals. In 2023, around 224 calls were  received (vs 281 in  2022 due to the national context), mainly about  housing and/or financial issues. The partnership with the Vivons  solidaires association, since September  2010, helps to tackle social  emergencies. The association receives many requests for assistance  with emergency housing, food donations, and children’s aid.

The process  deployed by Veolia has enabled this calculation to be performed as  soon as 2023 and Veolia has sought to anticipate the publication of  the alignment of all its activities to properly inform its stakeholders,  even though the European Commission only requires companies to  publish eligibility of new activities for 2023. However, to date the Veolia process has not provided for the multi- assessment of alignment for an activity that may contribute to several  environmental objectives. For this reason, Veolia only retained the  multi-objective assessment of eligibility in the new tables requested  by the Commission to provide the percentage of eligibility and  alignment for each of the 6 environmental objectives (see Sections  8.10.3.1.2, 8.10.3.2.2 and 8.10.3.3.2 below). The Veolia process will be  adapted accordingly for the full publication of the multi-objective  alignment starting in 2024. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Taxonomy 296 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 299 ===== 4.5.1.2  An alignment of revenue beyond climate change mitigation (CCM) Aligned turnover Eligible turnover These charts show that the eligibility and alignment rates increased  mainly due to the extension in 2023 of the taxonomy to all 6  environmental objectives (Taxo 2023), which enabled a more  comprehensive  translation  of  the  Veolia  Group’s  various  environmental contributions beyond climate change mitigation. Activities related to hazardous waste account for just over half of this  progress. More specifically, the main new developments that have an impact on  Veolia are: ■Climate change adaptation: • Eligibility of  desalination ■Water resources: • Greater consideration of water quality in assessing the  alignment of wastewater treatment plants ■Development of the circular economy: • Eligibility of water reuse following wastewater treatment, an  activity that is now essential to combat the general rise in water  stress • Consideration of intermediate sorting centers between  selective collection and recyclers, compensating for the scope of  the climate objective, now limited to only those centers  producing secondary raw materials, pursuant to the Q&A of the  Commission of December 19, 2022. • Eligibility of hazardous waste collection and treatment  activities focused on the circular economy ■Pollution prevention: • Eligibility of hazardous waste collection and treatment  activities focused on pollution prevention. ■Biodiversity: Veolia is not directly concerned by new activities  eligible for this objective, while contributing very significantly to  the preservation of biodiversity and ecosystems through its  multiple water and waste decontamination activities. In addition to the activities added in 2023, Veolia encourages the  Commission to continue gradually extending the taxonomy on each of  the 6 environmental objectives for an even more comprehensive  coverage of all ecological transformation acceleration levers. 4.5.1.3  Capex primarily focused  on sustainable activities The figures show a substantial increase in eligible and aligned Capex  rates between 2022* and 2023, with 75.1% eligible Capex, including  44.5% aligned Capex:  ■the 2023 rates surpass the revenue eligibility and alignment rates,  demonstrating the priority focus of Veolia’s Capex on sustainable  activities; ■an analysis of the 44.5% of aligned Capex in 2023 (see section 8.10.3  below) reveals the following breakdown:  • 13.5% in Energy (withdrawal from coal, green energies, heating  networks, energy efficiency, etc.); • 14,5% in Water (primarily drinking water production and  distribution); • 8.1% in Hazardous Waste ; • 8,5% in Non-Hazardous Waste (separate collection, material  sorting and recycling). (*) Reminder of 2022 Capex indicators:  ■13.7% eligible Capex, including 8.5% aligned Capex ■These extremely low rates were not representative of the Group’s  “normal” activity due to the exceptional impact of the Suez merger  during the year:  • Abnormally high Capex denominator due to the change in the  asset base and reduced numerator due to the fact that Suez  scope Capex could not be analyzed, • It is therefore more relevant to compare 2023 with the  assessment that supplemented the 2022 taxonomy report for  the historical Veolia scope: 58% eligible Capex, including 36%  aligned Capex.

It excludes energy, water, chemicals, carbon tax and especially operating expenses, which represent a huge proportion of Veolia’s operation and  maintenance costs. 4.5.1.5  Eligible activities In terms of turnover, all major sectors of Veolia contribute to eligible  activities, mainly: ■drinking water production and distribution;  ■wastewater treatment; ■heating networks; ■energy performance services; ■selective collection and waste treatment. Main Eligible activities in 2023 (Turnover) 4.5.1.6  Non-eligible activities To properly inform stakeholders, Veolia supplements the information  on the eligible scope with an analysis of activities corresponding to  42% of non-eligible revenue: Detailed breakdown of revenue A breakdown of non-eligible activities is presented in the following table: 1.5% Veolia  complement Activities reported by Veolia to the European Commission as good candidates for the subsequent extensions of the eligible activity  lists; e.g.: • treatment before discharge of industrial wastewater; • storage of certain hazardous waste; • energy recovery of non-recyclable RDF. 23.2% Neutral Activities with no negative impact on the environment and not covered by the Taxonomy at this stage include a large proportion  of basic services provided by Veolia to municipal or industrial customers in the water sector. 15.9% Discarded Activities excluded from the European Commission taxonomy as they are not part of priority ecological transformation financing: • either for reasons of selectivity regarding best practices, thereby excluding activities that nevertheless contribute to the smooth  running of environmental services: • non-selectve collection of waste and related downstream activities, • incineration of non-hazardous waste, • non-hazardous waste landfills, • energy services to buildings with no optimization. • or for reasons of exclusion regarding “brown” activities: • energy production using coal. 1.5% Not studied The non-analyzed scope was reduced as much a possible below the materiality threshold. It includes: • Ukraine and Russia, as stated in Section 4.5.3.2 below; • a certain number of entities which could not be analyzed as part of this first-time full application of the taxonomy. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Taxonomy 298 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 301 ===== 4.5.2  EUROPEAN TAXONOMY GENERAL FRAMEWORK 4.5.2.1  Taxonomy general principles The European “Taxonomy” Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of June 18, 2020 forms part of the sustainable finance policy rolled out by the European Union  (EU). It defines a framework to facilitate sustainable investment through improved disclosure by financial market participants. The sustainability of company activities is assessed in relation to six environmental objectives: 1. climate change mitigation (CCM); 2. climate change adaptation (CCA); 3. sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources (WTR); 4. transition to a circular economy (CE); 5. pollution prevention and control (PPC); 6. protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems (BIO). For each of these objectives, the taxonomy bases the notion of sustainability on best practices that contribute to ecological transformation. To be  considered as sustainable, an activity must be eligible and aligned: Eligible Activity featuring in the list of activities that are likely to contribute substantially to at least one of the six environmental objectives Aligned Be an eligible activity and : • comply with the corresponding environmental criteria set by the Taxonomy: • contribute substantially to the environmental objective in question; • do no significant harm to any of the other five objectives; • respect the minimum safeguards (see Section 4.5.3.3.3 below). 4.5.2.2  Regulatory framework The general framework is set by Regulation EU/2020/852 of June 18,  2020 and is supplemented by various texts clarifying the means of  implementation: ■Commission Delegated Regulation EU/2021/2178 of July 6, 2021,  specifying the mandatory Taxonomy-related information to be  published in the Non-Financial Performance Statement, and  particularly the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), their calculation  methods and related contextual disclosures. It sets out that, after  limited reporting in 2021, from 2022 onwards companies must  publish KPIs covering (1) sustainable, i.e. eligible and aligned, (2)  eligible but not-aligned, and (3) non-eligible scopes for:  • percentage of revenue, • percentage of capital expenditure (CapEx), • percentage of operating expenditure (OpEx); ■Commission Delegated Regulation EU/2021/2139 of June 4, 2021 on  eligible activities and technical criteria for objectives 1 and 2  (climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation);  ■Commission Delegated Regulation EU/2022/1214 of March 9, 2022,  supplementing the above regulation on energy production  activities from natural gas. ■reports published in 2022 by the Platform on Sustainable Finance  on taxonomy for objectives 3, 4, 5 and 6 (''Taxo 4'') and minimum  safeguards; ■Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2485 of June 27, 2023  amending Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 establishing  additional technical screening criteria for determining the  conditions under which certain economic activities qualify as  contributing substantially to climate change mitigation or climate  change adaptation and for determining whether those activities  cause no significant harm to any of the other environmental  objectives ■Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486 of June 27, 2023  supplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European  Parliament and of the Council by establishing the technical  screening criteria for determining the conditions under which an  economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to the  sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, to  the transition to a circular economy, to pollution prevention and  control, or to the protection and restoration of biodiversity and  ecosystems and for determining whether that economic activity  causes no significant harm to any of the other environmental  objectives and amending Commission Delegated Regulation (EU)  2021/2178 as regards specific public disclosures of eligibility and  alignment rates for each of the six environmental objectives. ■interpretation documents published by the European Commission  in December 2021, February 2022, December 2022 and June 2023. The new eligible activities published in 2023 are referred to in this  document as ''Taxo 2023''. 4.5.2.3  Additional voluntary  publications To provide additional information and give stakeholders a  comprehensive overview, Veolia voluntarily publishes a breakdown of  its non-eligible revenue according to three categories: ■activities proposed by Veolia for future extensions of eligible  activity lists; ■activities that are environmentally-neutral; ■activities excluded by the European Commission. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Taxonomy VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 299  ===== PAGE 302 ===== 4.5.3  ORGANIZATION AND PRINCIPLES APPLIED 4.5.3.1  A robust organization Veolia has adopted measures to be able to provide the required  information as reliably as possible. This approach mobilized the  Group’s financial and technical teams both at headquarters and in the  BUs to precisely define how to apply the Delegated Regulations to the  operational context of Veolia’s activities. It reflects the taxonomy  requirements, very often drawn up with reference to European  directives, in a manner that is comprehensible and applicable  worldwide. The produced methodology was validated by a specialized  consulting firm and incorporated into an internally generated tool  that is deployed in all BUs. This tool is designed to facilitate and  improve the reliability of financial and non-financial data input, while  avoiding any double counting:  ■entity-by-entity  assessment  of  eligibility  and  alignment  (contextual methodological support); ■reminder of 2022 information to take advantage of the most recent  detailed inventory carried out at local level and the technical  criteria assessment. 4.5.3.2  Scope covered The scope covered is that of Veolia’s consolidated entities as of  December 31, 2023. Entities were assessed and KPIs calculated without  taking into account Ukraine and Russia, which were not therefore  included in the KPI numerators due to their geopolitical situation over  the entire period under review. Certain activities representing 1% of  revenue were also not assessed as they were considered to be  immaterial. 4.5.3.3  Activity assessment  methodology  4.5.3.3.1  Eligible activities  As part of the 2022 Taxonomy assessment, published in the 2022  Universal Registration Document, the Group identified 26 Taxonomy- eligible operational activities, and two activities for individual CapEx.  In 2023, Veolia added 17 eligible activities based on the Commission’s  new delegated regulations published on June 27, 2023 (see 4.5.2.2  above). For certain activities, this generates substantial overlap between  activities defined with regard to climate change mitigation and similar  activities defined with regard to water resources and the circular  economy:  Topic Activities with  significant overlap Drinking water production  and distribution CCM-5.01; WTR-2.01 Wastewater treatment CCM-5.03; WTR-2.02 Collection and treatment  of non-hazardous waste CCM-5.05; CE-2.03 Material sorting and recovery CCM-5.09; CE-2.07 These overlaps are taken into account when determining eligibility for  each of the six environmental objectives. The following clarifications may be provided for the collection and  treatment of non-hazardous waste: ■as in 2022, waste collection was broken down into separative  (eligible) and non-separative (non-eligible); ■the activity CCM-5.09 Material recovery with reference to the  climate change mitigation objective was redefined to take into  account the clarifications provided by the European Commission in  December 2022:  • this activity is now reserved for centers producing at least 50%  directly reusable secondary raw materials, • sorting centers, which do not produce secondary raw materials,  are analyzed with reference to the new activity CE-2.07 (Taxo  2023 – circular economy), which covers both material sorting  and recycling centers, ■the heat recovered in incinerators and used for municipal heating  is  included in eligible activity CCM-4.25 Heat/cold production using  waste heat; ■electricity production from the biogenic fraction of incinerated  household waste is included in eligible activity CCM-4.08:  electricity production using bioenergy. This fraction represents over  half of total electricity produced, and is by default assessed at 50%  under a cautious approach. 4.5.3.3.2  Substantial contribution  and DNSH criteria  Two types of technical criteria must be assessed when calculating the  alignment KPIs: ■substantial contribution criteria for the activity’s main objective; ■DNSH (do no significant harm) criteria defined by the same  regulations to confirm that activities do not cause significant harm  to the other five environmental objectives. The practical assessment of this criteria by business units is based on  the application of the methodology developed by Veolia and referred  to in section 4.5.3.1 above. Regarding certain DNSH criteria, the European Commission has  defined generic conditions that do not depend on activities, which led  Veolia to define transversal methodologies for purposes of efficiency  and consistency:  ■Generic DNSH for climate change adaptation:  • seven types of potentially impactful climate change were  identified, associated for each Veolia activity with specific  vulnerabilities, • IPCC projections were conducted at around 2,000 sites  worldwide, with reference to the extreme scenario RCP 8.5, • climate risks are assessed by comparing the climate changes  projected by the model and the vulnerabilities specific to the  activity. ■Generic DNSH for water resources: the assessment is conducted in  relation to the materiality of a qualitative or quantitative impact of  activity on water resources; if this impact is material, Veolia  verifies:  • the appropriate treatment by the authority in charge of  operating permits (general case), • the treatment within an ISO 14001 certification when the  regulatory framework is lacking. ■Generic DNSH for pollution prevention: this DNSH only concerns a  very limited number of activities at Veolia (five in total) and  involves the exclusion of chemicals listed as hazardous. For several  years, Veolia has mobilized a chemical risk prevention group which  brought its expertise to analyse the situation: Veolia does not use  such chemicals in the products it assembles or in the processes it  operates (except in cases where these products are the input  materials treated as hazardous waste, in which case the aim is to  eliminate them). Finally, the group purchasing department takes  into account this concern and gradually rolls out a supply policy  excluding such products vis-a-vis our suppliers. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Taxonomy 300 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 303 ===== ■Generic DNSH for the preservation of biodiversity and ecosystems:  when the activity is one of the potentially impactful activities listed  by Directive EU/2011/92 (Appendices I and II), the assessment  focuses on whether or not an environmental impact including  biodiversity has been assessed, and the resulting necessary  measures have been undertaken. Note that in the European Union,  operating permits take into account this issue. 4.5.3.3.3  Minimum safeguards When applying the taxonomy in 2023, “Minimum Safeguards” were analyzed as follows: Human rights and workers’ rights in accordance with the OECD  Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles  on Business and Human Rights; Veolia complies with these conditions due to its pre-existing  compliance, risk and human resources management systems, as set out  in Sections 4.4 “Human resources performance”, 4.6 “Ethics and  compliance” and 4.7 “Vigilance plan” of this document, and in the  absence of significant breaches, in line with the French “duty of care”  regulation. Fair competition, bribery and corruption Taxation This issue is closely monitored at head office level by the Veolia Finance  Department to ensure compliance with regulations and the absence of  any major tax conflicts. Appropriate due diligence and mitigation measures have been set up, using a risk-based approach.  They will be extended to the value chain in line with the deployment of the CSRD, with two years to adapt the new reporting requirements (i.e.  FY-2026 closing at the latest). In mid-2023, the European Commission also introduced the need to identify, prevent, mitigate and correct the following main adverse impacts  arising from the SFDR: 1. Violation of the UN Global Compact principles and the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises 2. Lack of processes and mechanisms to monitor compliance with the UN Global Compact principles and the OECD guidelines for multinational  enterprises 3. Unadjusted gender pay gap 4. Lack of gender diversity of the Board of Directors 5. Exposure to controversial weapons (anti-personnel mines, cluster munitions, chemical and biological weapons) These issues are identified by Veolia as subjects of interest, with a measurement of the situation and: ■appropriate due diligence and mitigation plans for points 1 and 2 (see URD 4.1.2.), ■action plans for points 3 and 4 (see URD 4.4.5.), ■and no exposure to point 5. It is therefore considered that Veolia satisfies the minimum safeguards in 2023. 4.5.3.4  Methods applied to calculate the Key Performance Indicators Accounting standard • The analysis was carried out according to IFRS, in accordance with the financial reporting. Currency • Figures are expressed in millions of euros, by applying the same exchange rate to local currencies as for the financial  closing. 4.5.3.4.1  Key performance indicator for revenue Denominator • The total revenue recognized for the denominator is  the consolidated revenue in the financial report. • Revenue collected on behalf of third parties is not taken into account 1. Break down  contracts into basic  lines of Taxonomy- eligible activities or  activities that are not  Taxonomy-eligible • The analysis was conducted at basic level, i.e. contracts and contract sub-components for multi-activity contracts. This  enabled the identification of the basic lines of activity, corresponding, where applicable, for the same contract to  different activities which may or may not be Taxonomy-eligible. 2. Allocate revenue  to the basic lines of  activity • Group  revenue was allocated at basic level to the various aforementioned contracts, after neutralization of internal sales  to determine a contributory revenue consistent with the Group’s consolidated revenue.  • In certain cases, the allocation of total revenue to basic activities required the use of a physical or financial allocation key  selected for its availability and relevance. For example, in the case of collection, tonnages were used to separate  Taxonomy-eligible selective collection and mixed collection. For water concessions that do not distinguish between  drinking water and wastewater in their revenue, OpEx was used to allocate revenue to basic Taxonomy-related activities. • Accordingly, all Group consolidated revenue was allocated with no double counting in eligible or non-eligible, aligned or  non-aligned basic activities.  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Taxonomy VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 301  ===== PAGE 304 ===== 4.5.3.4.2  Key performance indicator for CapEx The taxonomy requires the inclusion in CapEx of asset additions  resulting from investments during the year and merger-acquisition  transactions corrected for changes in goodwill. In 2023, Veolia included the following CapEx items : ■gross industrial capex as mentioned in Section 3.2.1 above and  including: • (a)  CapEx relating to eligible activities, • (b) transformation CapEx relating to the transformation of non- eligible or eligible non-aligned activities into aligned activities  or the creation of new aligned activities, • (c) individual CapEx, excluding eligible operating activity, for  the set-up of Taxonomy-aligned schemes, such as the roll-out of  energy efficiency schemes for Veolia buildings.  ■changes in the asset base due to mergers-acquisitions and  including in 2023 the following acquisitions: • the subsidiaries Reciclados La Red S.LL and Banales III located in  Madrid and Seville, respectively; • Lydec following its consolidation; • U.S. Industrial Technologies in the United States. ■restatement of goodwill. Type (b) CapEx was analyzed using individual datasheets by analyzing  investments over the long-term and assessing the taxonomy impact  of their activities. Type (c) CapEx taken into account relates to light vehicles (activity  CCM 6.05) and real estate  (activity CCM 7.07).  4.5.3.4.3  Key performance indicator for OpEx The OpEx to be taken into account in the taxonomy is only a limited  portion of OpEx: mainly maintenance and excluding current  operations costs. This limited definition creates serious problems for  Veolia due to the strong interconnection between the maintenance  and operating processes with regard to activities performed which  makes it difficult to mark out a clear boundary between the  corresponding OpEx. ■For the 2022 closing, the decision was made to align as closely as  possible with the definition provided by the European Commission  and a certain number of expenses were deducted from costs of  sales: energy for production and distribution, energy for trading  activities, costs of certificates and CO2, cost of water and  chemicals, treatment and elimination of by-products, site  restoration and various operating costs. ■For the 2023 closing, and considering the numerous different  financial monitoring tools, it was decided to study a reliable and  representative sample, in order to define, after the elimination of  energy, water, chemicals and CO2 certificate costs, a ratio based on  the residual Opex of BUs to isolate the maintenance Opex required  by the taxonomic definition. This ratio was then applied to all BUs,  in order to simplify their reporting and improve the reliability of  overall earnings calculated at Group level; ■As for revenue, the most relevant allocation keys were used to  allocate OpEx, for which the current internal monitoring is not as  detailed as the taxonomy breakdown into basic activities. Note: Individual OpEx, excluding operating activities, relating to the  set-up of Taxonomy-aligned schemes was not assessed as it was  immaterial (application of the materiality principle). CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Taxonomy 302 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 305 =====   4.6  Ethics and Compliance Veolia considers ethics and compliance to be inextricably linked; they both contribute to “ethical security”. The Group is therefore attentive to the knowledge, understanding, sharing and compliance by all employees with these values and the resulting  rules of conduct and especially those relating to human and social rights and business ethics set forth in international laws and treaties in the  57 countries (1) where it is present. This approach fits naturally with the Group’s Purpose, in the same way as consideration of cultural diversity and  preserving the environment. The Company makes every effort to promote these issues among all of its stakeholders. The Groups rolls out ethics and compliance policies aimed at preventing ethical, legal and reputation risks through compliance with applicable  standards to ensure the implementation of its values. As part of its GreenUp 2024-2027 strategic program,Veolia renewed its commitment in favor of its territories and adopted  the following objective and target: Commitment Objective SDG Indicator – definition 2023  baseline 2027  target Support regional  development through  responsible means Ethics and  compliance • Positive answers to the ethics and  compliance question in the “Voice  of Resourcers” survey   88 % ≥ 83 % Sponsor Eric Haza Member of the Executive Committee, Chief Legal Officer 4.6.1  ETHICS 4.6.1.1  Ethics Guide In  February  2003,  the  Company  implemented  the  “Ethics,  Commitment and Responsibility” program, which was updated in  2004, 2008, 2011, 2013, 2018 (when it was renamed the “Ethics Guide”),  2020 and 2023. The most recent version of this Guide, issued in  December  2018, includes the presentation of the new Group Ethics  Whistleblowing  system,  implemented  in  response  to  the  recommendations set out in the Sapin II law of December 9, 2016, the  Law of March 27, 2017 on the corporate duty of care, and the GDPR  general data protection regulation and the Waserman Act of March 21,  2022 which boosts protection for whistleblowers. This system  supplements the whistleblowing mechanism levels implemented in  the Business Units. It is designed as a reference document for the conduct of all Group  employees at all management levels and in all countries where the  Group operates. The anticorruption Code of conduct is appended. The Ethics Guide sets out the Group’s core values and the resulting  rules of conduct that form the foundation of the Group’s economic,  social and environmental performance: ■responsibility: the Group is committed to promoting the  harmonious development of territories and improving the living  conditions of populations affected by its activities from a public  interest perspective, as well as internally, by developing employee  skills and improving occupational health and safety; ■community spirit: as the Group serves collective and shared  interests through its business activities, this value applies to  relationships entered into with all stakeholders. Concretely, it  involves developing solutions enabling the supply of essential  services for everyone and compliance with a Code of conduct for  managers to ensure the Group’s core values are shared and  complied with throughout the world; ■respect: guides the individual conduct of all Group employees  through compliance with the law and the Group’s internal rules  and the respect shown to others; ■innovation: imagine, create and be audacious in order to develop  the environmental services of the future. Veolia has placed  research and innovation at the center of its strategy in order to  develop sustainable solutions of service to its customers, the  environment and society; ■customer focus: seek ever greater efficiency and quality in our  services, listen to customers and strive to fulfill their technical,  economic, environmental and societal expectations through our  capacity to provide appropriate and innovative solutions. 4.6.1.2  Ethics Committee The Ethics Committee has five members appointed by the Executive  Committee, who may be employees, former employees or individuals  from outside the Company offering the necessary guarantees of  independence and expertise. Independent in the conduct of their  duties, Committee members cannot receive instructions from  Executive Management or be removed during their renewable four- year term of office. The Committee is responsible for ensuring the proper application of  the values set out in Veolia’s Ethics Guide, which have been embraced  by the Group and all its employees. In the course of its duties, the Ethics Committee interprets the Ethics  Guide taking account of the diversity of companies comprising the  Group, the specific nature of their activities and the regulatory, social  and legal frameworks in the countries in which they operate.

On that  basis, it can access any useful documents and hear any Group  employee, the auditors and third parties. In the conduct of its duties, it can be supported by the Internal Audit  Department and all other Group departments which it can ask to  intervene on any issues within its remit. It can also call on the services  of external experts or visit any Group sites or companies. Since 2004, any employee who believes there has been a failure to  comply with the values and rules of conduct set forth in the Ethics  Guide and who believes that informing his or her line manager may  cause difficulties or is not satisfied by the latter’s response can refer  the matter directly to the Ethics Committee. In this context, the Ethics Committee is responsible for managing the  new Group Ethics Whistleblowing tool in force since January 15, 2019  and based on a secure platform enabling whistleblowers to report in  over  twenty  languages.  An  information  campaign  informed  employees of the launch of this tool and was rolled out in all zones by  the Internal Communications Departments. This whistleblowing  system was opened to third parties in early 2020. As in the past, a whistleblower may also refer any matters within his  or her remit to the Ethics Committee and in particular any actions  considered to represent corruption or influence peddling, using all  means available. While the Ethics Committee does not recommend that whistleblowers  remain anonymous, employees and third parties may do so if they  wish by using the secure digital platform. The Ethics Committee will safeguard the rights and interests, not only  of the whistleblowers, who it will protect throughout the  investigation, but also of the accused parties. The Committee  communicates reports that appear within its remit to the Compliance  Department and particularly issues covered by the Sapin II law and the  corporate duty of care. It can also be assisted by country alert  delegates in its investigation. The existing ethical whistleblower system complies with the  Waserman Act of March 21, 2022, which strengthens whistleblower  protection. The Ethics Committee reports annually on its activities to the Veolia  Environnement Board of Directors. 4.6.2  COMPLIANCE 4.6.2.1  Strategy and organization Veolia has a Compliance Department, which reports directly to the  Group General Counsel. It is responsible for identifying and preventing  compliance risks as well as compliance with procedures in the  following areas: ■combating corruption and influence peddling; ■money laundering and terrorist financing; ■corporate duty of care; ■violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms; ■environmental breaches; ■anticompetitive practices; ■personal data protection; ■conflicts of interest; ■lobbying; ■insider trading; ■fraud. The Compliance Department is responsible for strengthening the  compliance culture within the Group and its relations with third  parties to protect it against the risks of noncompliance. To this end, it  uses all the tools at its disposal: standards, procedures, compliance  programs, training and awareness campaigns, etc. Specifically, the Compliance Department supervises the creation,  updating and distribution of all standards: the required charters,  guides, codes, policies and procedures linked to its compliance  programs. It is supported by a network of compliance officers in the  zones and countries to provide Business Units (BUs) with support (see  Section 4.6.3.3.1 below). Along with other departments, the Compliance Department is also  responsible for detecting cases of noncompliance, handling them  appropriately and proposing potential corrective measures so that  these events do not occur again. Its scope covers the entire Group as well as its relations with  customers, partners, intermediaries, suppliers and subcontractors. The  governing  bodies  (Executive  Committee,  Management  Committee) and the Board of Directors of Veolia Environnement are  fully involved in the definition and application of the Group’s  compliance policy. The Chief Compliance Officer is a member of the  Executive Committee and: ■regularly attends Executive Committee meetings, and at least once  a year attends a meeting of the Accounts and Audit Committee.  When needed, he is also consulted by the Board of Directors; ■reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer.  Compliance Department policies must be deployed by each functional  department in relation to their respective activities and by all Business  Units and zones, with the necessary adaptations at local level, where  needed. Zone Compliance Officers are responsible for deploying the  Group’s policy at zone level. 4.6.2.2  Management The Group’s Compliance Department interacts with the following  Group functional departments: the Risk & Insurance Department, the  Security Department, the Legal Department, the Finance Department,  the Internal Audit and Internal Control Department and the Human  Resources Department.

Inside Information  Committee Created following a meeting of the Disclosure Committee in 2016, this Committee rules in particular on the  classification of any event or information likely to be classified as inside information pursuant to the Market  Abuse Regulation (MAR). It is chaired by the Deputy CEO Finance, Digital and Purchasing. Fraud Prevention  Committee Set up in 2020 and chaired by the Chief Compliance Officer, this Committee brings together the departments  involved in fraud detection, investigation, implementation of action plans and prevention. It meets twice a year  and ad hoc meetings are organized when necessary. 4.6.3  PREVENTING CORRUPTION, ANTICOMPETITIVE PRACTICES  AND FRAUD 4.6.3.1  Risks and opportunities Preventing corruption and other unethical business practices is a  major issue for the Group and all its employees. The Group must be  particularly vigilant regarding these risks (see Chapter 2, Section 2.2.2.4  above on regulatory, legal and ethical risks in particular), mainly due  to the nature of its contracts, the investments made and the  difficulties unique to certain countries where it operates. Actions by  employees, corporate officers or external stakeholders which  contravene the principles set out by the Group could expose it to  criminal and/or civil penalties as well as harm to its reputation. Prevention of corruption, anticompetitive practice and fraud programs  fosters a culture of transparency and integrity within the Group,  thereby working to protect its reputation and retain the trust of  internal and external stakeholders. They not only help reduce risk in  these areas, but also strengthen the Group’s appeal and the  uniqueness of its commercial offerings. 4.6.3.2  Policy and commitments Veolia values, which are set forth in the Ethics Guide, and notably legal  compliance, the Group’s internal rules and respect for others, must  guide the individual behavior of all employees and managers. The Company’s Executive Management is highly committed to  preventing and uncovering corruption, as well as preventing  anticompetitive practices. Various internal standards have been  implemented under its supervision in this area (notably the Ethics  Guide, the Competition Law Compliance Guide, the Criminal Risk  Prevention Guide, the Anticorruption Code of conduct, the internal  whistleblowing system, the “key” procedures, etc.), specifically aiming  to prevent the risks of corruption and anticompetitive practices. These  procedures cover a certain number of the Group’s “at risk” activities,  such as commercial intermediation, sponsorships and patronages,  activities in sensitive countries, etc. This Group commitment is also reflected by various statements by the  Company’s Chairman and its Chief Executive Officer, underlining the  importance of the compliance policy (management seminar, New  Year’s speech, etc.). Veolia also conducts ongoing employee training and awareness  actions in this area (see Section 4.6.3.3.4 below). This policy is part of the application of Law no. 2016-1691 of December  9, 2016 on transparency and anticorruption and modern business  practices (also known as the “Sapin II law”). As part of the Engagement Survey (Voice of Resourcers), an  independent survey conducted annually by an external provider, the  results on the topic of “Ethics and Compliance” improved in 2023. Out  of approximately 160,000 employees surveyed, 88% gave a positive  answer when asked whether Veolia’s values and ethics are applied in  their respective entities (See Section 4.1.1 above). 4.6.3.3  Actions and results 4.6.3.3.1  Define, steer and coordinate  compliance programs Governance and definition of compliance programs A Compliance Department was created in 2018. It is responsible for the  governance of compliance programs regarding notably the topics of  corruption, anticompetitive practices, fraud and lobbying (see  Section 4.6.2. above). Governance, steering and coordination of zones  and Business Units The compliance policy reinforcement initiative was accompanied by  the implementation of a mission statement for Zone Directors,  underlining their compliance responsibilities. Each zone was  attributed a Zone Chief Compliance Officer (zCCO), reporting  hierarchically to the Zone Director and functionally to the Group  Compliance Director. Each zCCO deploys the Group compliance policy  and performs her/his duties in accordance with the zone or  subsidiary’s requirements.  In 2022, in the context of the Veolia-Suez  merger, the compliance network was gradually extended to cover the  entire new scope of the Group, in compliance with prevailing  anticompetitive regulations.  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Ethics and Compliance VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 305  ===== PAGE 308 ===== Veolia Ethics and Compliance Committee To materialize the complementarity between ethics and compliance a  steering committee was created in 2018: the Veolia Ethics and  Compliance Committee. Chaired by the Ethics Committee chairman, it  brings together the functional departments the most interested in  ethics and compliance matters and, especially, the Compliance,  Finance, Legal, Human Resources, Internal Audit and Internal Control  and Communication departments. The Committee fosters exchanges,  the better understanding of ethics topics as well as the coordination of  action plans rolled out to materialize the Group’s ethics policy. 4.6.3.3.2  Identify and evaluate non- compliance risks Since 2017, the Group has been continuously strengthening its  compliance systems, based on the results of its specific mapping of  corruption risks using a common Veolia methodology, which  combines internal and external data.  Corruption risks are mapped initially at Business Unit level. This then  provides a consolidated view at Group level, which enables the  Business Units to identify the risks at global level. In 2023, the corruption risk mapping was updated, based on a new  methodology, at both Business Unit and Group levels. Group corruption risk mapping: main stages of implementation and updating 2017 Audit of existing situation • Mapping of systems and best practices in place in the form of an online questionnaire  sent to the main internal stakeholders (legal directors, corporate secretaries, risk  managers, etc.). 2018 Corruption risk mapping at Group level • Identifying and evaluating the main risk areas, depending on business segments,  contracts and internal processes; • Inventorying existing systems and determining their level of deployment; • Reinforcing the level of control through specific action plans deployed for the Group. 2018  and 2019 Corruption risk mapping at Business  Unit and zone level • Developing corruption risk scenarios based on risk areas identified at Group level.  These risk analyses are organized with local teams (executives and management)  representing the zone or Business Unit, in the form of interviews and workshops; • Identifying priority actions to be implemented and monitored in action plans. 2020 Update of the Group Corruption  Risk Map through consolidating  analyses from  Business Unit and zone  • Consolidating corruption risk areas based on the risk scenarios from the Business Unit  and zone workshops; • Determining the risk profile of each geographic zone and assessing the level of  maturity of their control environment. Third Party Corruption Risk Mapping • Updating the map of supplier corruption risks based on the Group’s purchasing  categories;. 2021 Ongoing roll-out and updating  of corruption risk maps • For newly acquired entities; • Updating of Business Unit maps. 2022 Overhaul of the corruption risk mapping  methodology • Revision of the methodology and alignment with Sapin II Law requirements  • Launch of the update campaign in November 2022. 2023 Update of the BU and Group corruption  risk map • Roll-out of the new methodology for Business Units; • Consolidation of Business Unit maps and production of a Group map.  This methodology is consistent and integrated with the Group’s  overall risk mapping process. It is also in line with the best  professional practices and recommendations issued by public  authorities and professional associations. Third party assessment (suppliers, partners,  intermediaries, customers) Based on its business risks, Veolia has chosen to prioritize the  assessment of its suppliers, strategic customers and certain other  particularly sensitive third parties, such as commercial intermediaries  and partners in Group development projects, Veolia’s system for  assessing the integrity of its third parties is based on several  components. Firstly, large customers and suppliers are analyzed using a dedicated  software solution, whose deployment was launched in 2021 and  continued throughout 2022. In 2023, this solution was operational  throughout the Group. In addition, commercial intermediaries are subject to a specific  process, governed by an internal procedure. The Compliance  Department is in charge of the process with the support of the  Security Department. The contracts regarding these intermediaries are  subject to a systematic review. A dedicated team within the Security  Department is responsible for the part of the third party assessment  process designed to identify and assess the legal, commercial,  financial and reputation risks associated with using commercial  intermediaries. Furthermore, when the Group considers contracting with third parties  for project development purposes, an assessment of these third  parties is performed based on the corresponding internal procedure.  Significant projects are therefore systematically reviewed by the  compliance chain. Integration of former-Suez companies Following the merger with Suez, an integrity risk analysis and  integration plan was implemented in 2022 to ensure the effective  deployment of Veolia's compliance system within the entities that  joined the Group. As such and using a risk-based approach, these  entities brought their systems into line with applicable Group  compliance rules. The compliance system has since been gradually  extended to former Suez entities that joined Veolia, in compliance  with prevailing anticompetitive regulations. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Ethics and Compliance 306 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 309 ===== 4.6.3.3.3  Identify and manage  whistleblowing reports Whistleblowing system  Veolia has a general whistleblowing system which is included in the  Ethics Guide. Any breach of one of the rules of conduct indicated in  this document can be reported to the Ethics Committee via a  dedicated number, the Committee’s email address or any other  means. In 2022, this system was extended to the scope of Suez  companies that joined the Group. This whistleblowing system is intended to allow the collection of  alerts regarding conduct or situations which are contrary to applicable  laws and Group policies and rules, notably the Ethics Guide and the  Anticorruption Code of conduct. It is important to underline that this  whistleblowing system supplements the existing hierarchical alert  systems within the Business Units (BU), which continue and are  encouraged. This reporting system is managed by the Ethics Committee. This  centralized and secure tool allows whistleblowers to remain  anonymous, if they wish. It is available to both Group employees and  third parties. However, all internal and external parties can still bring  their concerns directly before the Ethics Committee, again with a high  level of confidentiality. Any reports received by the Ethics Committee via this system that  appear to fall within the remit of the Compliance Department are  immediately forwarded to it to be dealt with. It is important to underline that this whistleblowing system  supplements reports made using other channels within the BUs  (hierarchical whistleblowing reports), which continue and are  encouraged.Furthermore, certain Group entities (notably the US,  Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany) have previously  implemented a specific financial whistleblowing system, operated by  an external supplier. Any alerts received via these various systems that appear to fall within  the remit of the Compliance Department are immediately forwarded  to it by the Ethics Committee to be dealt with. Internal communications are regularly issued on the handling of  whistleblowing reports, hierarchical whistleblowing reports and the  promotion of whistleblowing among new employees at Veolia. In  2023, a new communication campaign on the “Whispli Voice” add-on  module was conducted. Fraud reporting The facilitation and coordination of the fraud prevention system is  founded on several components. The “Warning and fraud reporting”  mechanism seeks to facilitate the escalation and understanding of  fraud patterns, thereby enabling the implementation of necessary  protection measures. Cases of fraud identified within the group must  be reported. They are broken down into three major categories:  “misappropriation  of  assets”,  “communication  of  fraudulent  information” and “corruption and unethical behavior”. Fraud is  assessed based on its severity determined according to the amount, as  well as other risks such as reputation risk and commercial risk for the  BU and the Group. Since 2020, a Fraud Prevention Committee has  been set up within the Group. It brings together all stakeholder  departments to continuously improve the fraud prevention process. In  2021, a new online training program on preventing wire transfer fraud  was launched for all Group employees. It continued to be rolled out in  2022, particularly to employees who have recently joined the Group.  Since 2023, the corruption risk map has been produced using the  lessons learned from fraud reporting. 4.6.3.3.4  Train and raise awareness  of our employees and stakeholders Anticorruption, fraud prevention and competition law  compliance training program Veolia regularly organizes training sessions in ethics and compliance.  These programs, which are regularly updated and improved, focus on  the prevention of anticompetitive practices, criminal risk and fraud.  They are delivered both through e-learning tools and face-to-face  activities. Specific training sessions on the Anticorruption Code of conduct and  anticompetitive practices, the content of which was defined by the  Compliance Department, are regularly organized. These training  sessions are mandatory. Jointly deployed by the HR and compliance  departments in the form of e-learning, they are intended for all Group  managers. In 2023, 36,200 Veolia employees attended mandatory e- learning courses. In a broader sense, the Zone Compliance Officers are responsible for  defining a compliance training plan specific to each zone at BU level,  in close collaboration with the Human Resources Department and  based on a risk approach. Under this plan, additional training can be  provided to employees in exposed roles. Anti-corruption Code of Conduct The Anticorruption Code of conduct, adopted by the Executive  Committee in 2018, describes the principles and actions intended to  respect the Group’s commitment to ban any form of corruption and  similar or equivalent behavior, and to comply with best practices and  regulations in this field. It applies within all companies controlled directly or indirectly by  Veolia, in France and all countries where they operate or are located,  regardless of legal status. All zones and Business Units must deploy the Code in their respective  areas. In France and certain countries, the implementation requires  the integration of the Code in the internal regulations of the legal  entities in question. Within Veolia Environnement, the modified  internal regulations entered into force on July 15, 2018. For France, the  Anticorruption Code of conduct was presented to the Works Council.  Outside France, the Code disclosure and implementation processes  depend on local legal requirements. This Anticorruption Code of conduct was presented in sketches  illustrating the corruption scenarios presented in the document, in  order to help the Group’s employees better assimilate the issues at  hand. Each situation is supplemented with insights, references to the  wording of the Anticorruption Code of conduct and practical advice.  This illustrated guide is an easy-to-share awareness and training tool  that complements other initiatives deployed by the Group, such as e- learning modules or resources made available to employees primarily  through the Compliance Department’s intranet site. Ongoing “Ethics and compliance”  communication initiatives Veolia communicates regularly on corruption prevention issues.  Accordingly, in 2021, the Group conducted a communication campaign  entitled “Ethics & Compliance”, to raise awareness of these issues  among all the Group’s employees over a period of several months. It  was disseminated in a variety of ways (videos, messages from  management bodies, posters, presentations at team meetings, etc.) in  order to reach and involve as many people as possible. This campaign  gives concrete expression to the “non-negotiable” ethics and  compliance commitments made by the Group within the context of its  Purpose and more broadly. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Ethics and Compliance VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 307  ===== PAGE 310 ===== On the 2022 International Anti-Corruption Day, Veolia’s Chief  Executive Officer reiterated to the Group’s employees the importance  it attaches to compliance with ethical and compliance rules. In 2023, in  a Group-wide video message, the CEO announced the update of the  “Les Essentials” document, the Group’s manual of 30 main guidelines  and policies, the first 10 of which concern ethics and compliance. 4.6.3.3.5  Control and improve processes Overall assessment of Veolia’s compliance system The Group conducts an annual assessment campaign focusing on the  main components of its compliance system. Almost all Veolia entities participate in this campaign in which the  BUs must firstly substantiate their replies (self-assessment phase).  Subsequently, this information is reviewed by the Group Compliance  Department which considers the system’s accuracy and maturity  (assessement phase). As such, the compliance function performs a  level two control of the existing system. Following the campaign, the  results are presented to the Group Audit and Accounts Committee. In  2023, the methods used in this campaign were subject to a level  3 control. ISO 37001 certification initiatives ISO 37001 is the international reference standard for anti-corruption  management systems. A number of Group zones are currently or will  soon be certified. Currently, in 2023 all 36 entities were certified in the  Latin America zone. At the end of 2023, the Central and Eastern Europe  zone had 86 certified entities across eight BUs and continued to  deploy certification in its scope. In the same year, Water France and  OTV were also ISO 37001 certified. These initiatives reflect the Group’s  efforts and commitment to prevent and fight against corruption. Development of an anticorruption accounting and non- financial control system In 2023, an anti-corruption control process was set up as part of an  internal project involving several central departments of the risk and  control functions. Its purpose is to provide the Group with the means  to better understand corruption risks and satisfy regulatory  requirements. The effectiveness of these controls will be verified in  annual assessment campaigns. 4.6.4  HUMAN RIGHTS 4.6.4.1  Risks and opportunities Due to the geographic scope of its activities, the Group is exposed to  non-compliance by stakeholders with the principles set out in the  Group’s human rights policy and notably external stakeholders  (subcontractors, suppliers) (see Chapter  2, Section  2.2.2.4 above on  regulatory, legal and ethical risks in particular). Veolia therefore  implements appropriate due diligence to ensure compliance. The Veolia Human Rights program seeks to retain the trust of internal  and external stakeholders, reinforce appeal and commercial  differentiation and protect its reputation. This program naturally  forms part of the Group’s Purpose. 4.6.4.2  Policy and commitments Since it joined the United Nations Global Compact in 2003, Veolia has  backed and promoted the principles in its sphere of influence,  particularly the recognition of collective bargaining rights, and the  fight against employment discriminations. Compliance with these  fundamental rights and these commitments for sustainable  development is naturally part of the human rights policy defined by  the Group. Its formal documentation in 2016 led to the creation of the  Human Rights and Duty of Care Committee, which is responsible for  supervising the human rights framework within Veolia (see  Section 4.6.2.2 above). The Group has been working hard for years to uphold the rights not  only of its employees, subcontractors and suppliers, but also of the  communities living in the areas where it operates. Veolia’s dedication  is reflected in its sustainable development commitments (see  Section 4.1.1 above) and its fundamental values and principles set out  in its Ethics Guide (see Section 4.6.1.1 above). The Veolia human rights policy focuses on eight priority issues: ■three issues relating to the rights of the people impacted by its  activities: • right to a healthy environment and protection of resources, • right to water and sanitation, • rights and lifestyles of local communities; ■five issues relating to fundamental labor rights: • elimination of forced labor, • abolition of child labor, • elimination of discrimination, • promotion of freedom of association and collective bargaining, • right to a safe and healthy work environment. The Human Resources Department and the Compliance Department  have pledged to ensure these rights are respected in cooperation with  the Group’s other functional departments and all entities. Right to a healthy environment and protection  of resources These concerns are particularly important for Veolia, as they are at the  heart of its businesses. Section  4.2 above presents detailed  information regarding these two themes. Right to water and sanitation These two topics are essential issues for Veolia due to its history and  business activities. They are detailed in Sections  4.1.1, 4.1.2 and 4.3.3  above. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Ethics and Compliance 308 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 311 ===== Rights and lifestyles of local communities Veolia is committed to recognizing the rights and lifestyles of  communities where it operates. The Group implements various  initiatives to maintain a constant dialogue with local people (see  Section 4.3.2.3.2 above). Elimination of forced or compulsory labor Veolia prohibits any form of forced or compulsory labor. These  commitments are recalled in the Ethics Guide, in particular, the  requirement to comply with fundamental international labor  standards and the prohibition on the use of forced labor in all its  operations. This prohibition also applies to any form of modern slavery  and human trafficking. Abolition of child labor Veolia strictly prohibits child labor. Minors can work in certain special  cases, particularly work-study apprenticeships, but only in compliance  with all regulatory provisions. These commitments are listed in the  Ethics Guide, particularly in regard to compliance with the  fundamental international labor standards and the prohibition of  child labor. Fight against discrimination Veolia’s commitments are described in Section 4.4.5.3 above. Freedom of association and recognition  of the right to collective bargaining Veolia’s commitments are described in Section 4.4.5.2 above. Right to a safe and healthy work environment Veolia’s commitments are described in Section 4.4.3 above. Veolia has therefore clearly adopted a continual improvement  approach to the challenges it faces. To this end, the Group requests the opinion of various stakeholders  especially  concerned  with  this  issue  such  as  international  organizations, specialist associations and businesses. 4.6.4.3  Actions and results 4.6.4.3.1  Define, steer and coordinate  the Human Rights program Program governance The Human Rights and Duty of Care Committee is at the center of  Veolia’s approach to coordinating issues concerning human rights and  fundamental freedoms. Chaired by the Group’s General Counsel and  led by the Compliance Department, it is responsible for the proper roll- out of Veolia’s Human Rights policy and its appropriation by employees  and monitors the implementation of action plans. The Committee met  twice in 2023 to guarantee the effectiveness of this policy. Contribution of the international network The Compliance Department performs its human rights role through  a network of compliance officers covering the entire Group (see  Section 4.6.3.3.1 above). This network is coordinated and facilitated by  a human rights and duty of care manager reporting to the  Compliance Department. Under this system, compliance directors  regularly participated in Veolia’s Human Rights and Duty of Care  Committee in 2023. 4.6.4.3.2  Identify and evaluate risks Veolia identifies risks linked to human rights and the duty of care  through different tools and methods. Human rights risk mapping The human rights risk mapping was updated in 2020 based on a  survey. This used a methodology developed by the Risk Department,  combining the results of studies carried out at Group level with  contributions from the operating entities. Unlike previous years, the  2020 survey covered the entire scope of the Group. It was also  redesigned to focus on the following issues: human rights within the  Business Units; external stakeholders; and the Group’s human rights  management system. As part of a long-term approach, the findings of this work served as a  basis for steering Veolia’s human rights system in 2023. Third-party assessment Veolia has a third-party assessment system, comprising several  components. The Group evaluates the performance of its strategic and/or “at risk”  suppliers, including in the fields of fundamental, social and  environmental rights. Assessments cover 21  criteria including topics  such as water, local contamination, social dialogue, child labor and  forced labor. In 2020, the Purchasing sector enhanced its ability to assess third  parties with the introduction of a CSR questionnaire targeting the  suppliers considered to be most at risk, in the context of calls for  tenders conducted by the Group.  Assessments carried out as part of the so-called “Major Projects”  process (see Section 4.6.3.3.2 above), also take into account human  rights issues.  4.6.4.3.3  Identify and manage  whistleblowing reports Whistleblowing system The Group’s whistleblowing system is used to handle incidents linked  to violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, issues  carefully monitored by Veolia. It can be accessed by third parties. The  whistleblowing system is explained in Section 4.6.3.3.3 above. 4.6.4.3.4  Train and raise awareness  of our employees and stakeholders Deployment of the updated Ethics Guide The Ethics Guide presents the values and principles the Group abides  by. The most recent version underlines Veolia’s commitment to  comply with major international initiatives, such as the UN Global  Compact, international human rights law and the OECD guidelines for  multinational enterprises. Development of an online human rights training course A Human Rights e-learning course was developed in 2022 following the  findings of the Human Rights Survey conducted in 2020. This training  course was completed by over 60% of Group's employees in 2023.  Raising supplier awareness Veolia’s Supplier Charter, “Our General Principles for Supplier  Relationships”,  aims  to  engage  and  make  Veolia  suppliers  accountable, particularly in terms of labor law and environmental  protection. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Ethics and Compliance VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 309  ===== PAGE 312 ===== Furthermore, as part of assessments, we ask suppliers to consider our  recommendations, to implement corrective action plans if needed and  to involve their own suppliers and subcontractors in this approach. The purchasing compliance policy is detailed in Section 4.3.2.3.4 above. Raising awareness of sustainable purchasing Purchasing is an essential topic as part of commitments made by  Veolia to sustainable development. In order to reach its targets, the  Group has implemented a progressive approach targeting purchasing  teams as a priority. In 2019, Veolia launched a buyer certification  program, through an e-learning course developed jointly with the  Veolia Campus, to strengthen the roll-out of the purchasing  compliance program. Training courses in how to assess suppliers are  held regularly in French, English and Spanish, for all Group BUs.  4.6.4.3.5  Control and improve processes Control and assessment In 2023, the Human Rights and Duty of Care Committee examined  progress with operating and functional actions plans. The Committee’s activities benefited from the Group’s participation in  the human rights association, Entreprises pour les droits de l’homme,  a forum for peer exchange aimed at consolidating and distributing  human rights best practices. The Committee takes account of  feedback from members of this organization, particularly with regard  to steering the Group’s vigilance plan (see Section 4.7 below). As part of the annual assessment of the Group’s compliance system  (see section 4.6.3.3.5 above), compliance with requirements related to  the duty of care (human rights, health and safety, environment,  sustainable purchasing) is subject to in-depth review. The results of  this work are presented and discussed by the Human Rights and Duty  of Care Committee. Implementation of the sustainable development clause The sustainable development clause is mandatory and included in  new contracts, renewed contracts and amended contracts with  suppliers and subcontractors. It aims to prevent risks related to ethics  and labor law rules (human rights, child labor, corruption, etc.). The   clause was 89% deployed in 2023 (see Section 4.3.2.3.4 above). 4.6.5  OTHER COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS 4.6.5.1  Personal data protection The Group has organized itself to ensure that local regulations and the  European Regulation on the protection of individuals with regard to  the processing of personal data (GDPR) are applied, giving priority to  entities falling within the scope of the GDPR. This approach also  contributes to the constant strengthening of data protection  measures, to limit risks relating to information systems and data loss.  It is based on the deployment of data privacy principles. The Group  Compliance Department therefore defines guidelines to strengthen  data protection for employees, applicants and customers, as well as  the physical persons representing the Group’s stakeholders. All the  Group’s standards were then deployed by the Business Units to adapt  to local legal specificities.  In 2023, the Group further strengthened its network organization,  which ensures the roll-out of common data protection standards as  defined by the Group Compliance Department. This roll-out is being  led by the Global Data Protection Officer (GDPO), who is also the DPO  of Veolia Environnement SA and reports to the Group Compliance  Director. The GDPO works with the Group’s Information Systems  (IS&T), Legal and Security Departments (“DPO Team”), and coordinates  a network of Data Protection Officers (DPOs) and Data Protection  Correspondents (DPC) covering all Group BUs, which also have Data  Protection Managers in each entity.  The Group takes the necessary measures to efficiently respond in a  timely  manner  to  data  subjects  requests,  thanks  to  the  implementation of an appropriate organization through the DPOs and  internal escalation processes. To the best of our knowledge, all  requests from individuals exercising any of their rights have been  addressed by the Group entity concerned without this giving rise to  sanctions from the supervisory authorities. In addition, in 2023, Veolia Environnement furthered the roll-out of its  Design and Legal Authority process, common to the IS&T, Security,  Compliance and Legal Departments, to guarantee proper consistency  and the best possible personal data protection. This process assesses  several hundred IT tools annually (evaluation of the technical  architecture, security standards, user experience and legal documents,  particularly with regard to the protection of personal data, limitations  on corresponding liability and licensing policies).  The Group was also involved in integrating the new measures enacted  by the European Commission in June  2021 and July 2023 on the  standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data between  controllers and processors located in third countries and the new  adequacy decision for safe and trusted EU-US data flows.  These measures required the legal department to review the work  undertaken to ensure the GDPR compliance of suppliers agreements.  This update work continued in 2023.  As part of its compliance internal control, Veolia annually assesses the  compliance program rolled out by its entities to strengthen data  protection. This assessment process seeks to measure progress with  the level of maturity of each entity and their ability to prevent risks of   infringement to personal data protection. It includes the roll-out of  Group standards and procedures and is subject to constant  improvement.  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Ethics and Compliance 310 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 313 ===== 4.6.5.2  Environmental compliance Environmental management and protection are closely monitored by  the public authorities due to the importance of these issues. This is  reflected by numerous regulations in this area with which Veolia must  comply. To ensure a high level of performance and thereby satisfy its  obligations, the Group has defined an ambitious environmental policy  evidenced  by  the  implementation  of  a  dedicated  internal  management system (see Section 4.2.1 above). In 2023, updated with  new methodological clarifications designed to simplify and make the  drafting of action plans more relevant, the process now takes into  account feedback from previous assessments, as part of a continuous  improvement approach. 4.6.5.3  Lobbying Veolia actively contributes to discussions, consultations and projects  on changes in environmental services management initiated by  international,  European  and  French  authorities,  professional  associations, think tanks and NGOs. Pursuant to applicable  regulations, these actions are implemented in the context of its  adherence to the Global Compact and within the general framework  of the Group’s Ethics Guide and in accordance with its Anticorruption  Code of conduct. Veolia Environnement is listed on several transparency registers,  including: ■the transparency register, the European Commission and European  Parliament register of lobbyists (since 2009); ■the lobbying disclosure register in the United States; ■the public digital directory managed by the High Authority for  public transparency (HATVP) in France. The Group is also  registered in the Senate register in France, which records lobbyists  on its own list. Similarly, lobbying employees (or employees likely to lobby) have been  made aware of the two objectives of respecting ethics rules and the  duty to declare, in coordination with the Group Compliance  Department. In June  2019, Veolia issued an internal standard on the appropriate  conduct of employees who are members of professional associations  or participate therein. This procedure aims to ensure that lobbying is  performed to the highest prevailing standards. In accordance with strengthened reporting obligations in France and  the extension of the system to include activities conducted with  certain local public decision-makers that came into force in July 2022,  Veolia adapted its internal system to satisfy its legal obligations in this  area. In 2023, the Group expanded its reporting requirements to fully  comply with the strengthened reporting framework. Through these rules and initiatives, the Group is formally committed  to adhering and ensuring adherence to the rules adopted by the  various countries and institutions to guarantee transparency and  compliance for lobbying actions. 4.6.5.4  Preventing insider trading To help prevent insider trading, the Company has adopted a Code of  conduct for Securities Trading. The Chief Executive Officer and  members of the Executive Committee are deemed to be “permanent  insiders” and trading by any of them in the Company’s securities is  prohibited, except during strictly defined periods and provided that  they do not hold material inside information during such periods.  These measures also cover so-called “occasional” insiders. The  Company’s Code of conduct for Securities Trading takes into account  changes in regulatory requirements applicable to issuers and their  executives and particularly those concerning the compilation and  update of a list of named “insiders” and obligations to report  transactions in the Company’s securities by senior Company  executives and closely-related persons. 4.6.5.5  Sensitive countries Due to its global footprint, Veolia conducts business in certain  countries in respect of which some national authorities and  international bodies have issued restrictions. The Group may also have  contact with individuals against whom restrictive measures have been  issued. To prevent risks arising from the potential breach of such restrictive  measures, Veolia has set up a procedure to ensure the compliance of  the Group’s activities with prevailing regulations on sanction  frameworks. This procedure requires a prior risk assessment by the  Compliance Department of any activity, new or existing, in countries  or in connection with persons likely to be affected by sanction  frameworks, and subsequent monitoring of validated projects. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Ethics and Compliance VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 311  ===== PAGE 314 =====   4.7  Vigilance plan This  section  summarizes  measures  implemented  by  Veolia  Environnement to meet the requirements of the French duty of care  law. Law no. 2017-399 on the duty of care of parent and subcontracting  companies requires the implementation by these companies of a  vigilance plan (the Plan). This plan is notably founded on “reasonable  due diligence to identify risks and prevent severe impacts on human  rights and fundamental freedoms, on people’s health and safety, and  on the environment”. Veolia Environnement has developed a vigilance plan in accordance  with prevailing legislation, covering the entire Group. A detailed version of the Plan was also prepared. It can be consulted  on  the  Group’s  website  via  the  following  link:  https:// www.veolia.com/fr/groupe/profil/conformite-vigilance. 4.7.1  COMPLIANCE OF THE PLAN WITH THE LAW The Plan includes the five pillars required by the duty of care law: ■a risk mapping; ■regular  assessment  procedures  covering  the  situation  of  subsidiaries, subcontractors and suppliers; ■actions to prevent and mitigate risks and serious harm; ■a whistleblowing system that collects reporting of existing or  proven risks; ■a monitoring scheme to follow up on the plan’s implementation  and the efficiency of measures. The law provides for an implementation report which is presented  below. 4.7.2  2023 IMPLEMENTATION REPORT Throughout 2023, Veolia ensured that the system implemented within  the framework of the duty of care law matched its requirements. In  this respect, the following initiatives were undertaken: ■development of a comparative study on the existence of a human  rights policy in CAC 40 companies. The purpose of this initiative  was to study the possibility of highlighting Veolia Group’s  commitment to this cause by officially publishing a policy; ■set-up of a new feature of the internal whistleblowing system  “Whispli Voice”: this digital hotline enables the whistleblower to  leave a voice alert; ■improvements to the Group’s Environmental and Industrial  Management System (EIMS): updated with new methodological  clarifications designed to simplify and make the drafting of action  plans more relevant, the process now takes into account feedback  from previous assessments, as part of a continuous improvement; ■development of an online training course on human rights: the e- learning aims to raise awareness of human rights issues among  Group employees. This module enriches the communication  component of Veolia’s duty of care system. The improvements made to the Group’s duty of care system, as  described above, are all part of a process of continuous improvement  in keeping with the spirit of the law.

Based on its business model (see Chapter 1, Section 1.2.2 above), Veolia  has identified the main risks linked to its business activities for each of  the required information categories. In 2017, Veolia mapped its CSR issues. These issues were ranked with  respect to their impact for the Group and its stakeholders. In 2019,  Veolia clarified this mapping, explaining the risks and opportunities  associated with each issue. An update was made in 2020. Veolia then analyzed the consistency of: ■its mapping of CSR issues (risks and opportunities); and ■its mapping of the Group’s risk factors (see Chapter 2, Section 2.2  above). These two mappings adopt a complementary analysis in their  strategic, non-financial and financial approaches to address the  challenges of publishing the non-financial performance statement Principles Section Methodological notes Opinion on compliance and fair presentation of information 4.9 4.10 Business model and value creation Business model Our Purpose Environmental, social and human resources performance commitment 1.2.4 1.1.2 4.1 Environmental consequences of Veolia’s activity Natural  resources Risks • No major risks Opportunities • Circular economy solutions 4.2.2 Circular economy Climate change Risks • GHG emissions at sites • Service interruption in the case of extreme climate events Opportunities • Energy efficiency, renewable energy use and methane capture  solutions proposed to our customers • Climate change adaptation solutions proposed to our customers 4.2.3 Combating climate change Biodiversity and  environments Risks • Pollution emitted by Veolia’s activities • Damage to biodiversity at sites with significant issues Opportunities • Solutions for the treatment of difficult pollution proposed  to our customers • Biodiversity protection and restoration solutions proposed to our  customers 4.2.4 Protection of environments and  biodiversity Water resources Risks • Operating sites located in areas of water stress Opportunities • Solutions for protecting water resources 4.2.5 Sustainable management of  water resources Risks and opportunities Description  of risks,  policies and  results Link with the Purpose and  the multifaceted performance  objectives Section CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Non-Financial Performance Statement Information Summary VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 313  ===== PAGE 316 ===== Consequences on society of Veolia’s activity Stakeholder  dialogue Risks • Discontent or protests by civil society or users of our services Opportunities • Development of partnerships and new dialogue mechanisms • Anticipation of expectations of external stakeholders • Legitimacy to operate 2.2.2.1 4.1.3 Multifaceted performance  commitments with and for  stakeholders Local  development Risks • Environmental, social or ethical violations by our suppliers  or subcontractors • Discontent or protests by civil society or users of our services Opportunities • Local socioeconomic development • Co-development of new services and new dialogue mechanisms  tailored to local issues 2.2.2.2 et 2.2.2.4 4.3.2 Job and wealth creation in the  territories Access to  services Risks • Discontent or protests by civil society or users of our services • Distribution of water of unsatisfactory quality Opportunities • Tailored solutions to maintain and develop universal access to services • Solutions to develop reliable access to quality water 2.2.2.1 2.2.2.1 4.3.3 Access to essential services  (water and sanitation) Workforce consequences of Veolia’s activity Health and  safety Risks • Risk of employee or subcontractors accidents or death Opportunities • Physical and mental health of employees • Employee satisfaction and well-being • Productivity and performance improvements 2.2.2.2 4.4.3 Safety at work Professional  development  and  commitment Risks • Reduced employability of our employees • Lack of employee commitment Opportunities • Development of employee skills • Employee satisfaction, well-being and commitment 2.2.2.2 4.4.4 Employee training and  employability Employee commitment Respect for  diversity,  cohesion and  social dialogue Risks • Noncompliance with collective bargaining and diversity rights Opportunities • Workforce cohesion and stability • Employee motivation and commitment 2.2.2.4 4.4.5 Diversity Preventing corruption Risks • Corruption Opportunities • Trust of stakeholders • Competitiveness and unique commercial offer 2.2.2.4 4.6.3 Ethics and compliance Risks and opportunities Description  of risks,  policies and  results Link with the Purpose and  the multifaceted performance  objectives Section CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Non-Financial Performance Statement Information Summary 314 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 317 ===== Respect for Human Rights Risks • Noncompliance with human rights Opportunities • Trust of stakeholders • Competitiveness and unique commercial offer 2.2.2.4 4.6.4 Combating tax evasion The Group applies a fiscal policy, available on the website, which consists  in : • complying with all laws and prevailing international tax agreements ; • paying the right amount of tax around the world ; • ensuring that the tax risk is managed ; • applying tax choices which correspond to the economic substance of  its activities ; • adopting a responsible approach with the tax authorities.

The societal information is  taken from this same database and other Group reporting (finance  and sustainable purchasing) or obtained from limited geographic or  business areas or from departments centralized at Group level. ■The indicators were chosen to monitor the following as a priority:  performance relating to the Group’s principal CSR challenges; ■effects of the Group’s CSR policy; ■regulatory obligations (Article R.225-105-1 of the French Commercial  Code; Article 173-IV of the energy transition law). REPORTING BOUNDARIES Social reporting covers all companies that are fully consolidated in the  Group’s financial statements and the companies included in the  financial statements which the Group manages operationally, and  which are located in all the countries where the Group has employees. As from 2018, all acquisitions of entities (outside of the Veolia Group)  made during year Y, are taken into account in the social scope starting  from January 1 of year Y+1. This rule allows for a better integration of  the Veolia human resources processes, safety standards and Group  commitments. Since 2016, to ensure consistency with the financial reporting scope,  the Chinese concessions are no longer included in the social reporting,  except for the indicators defined for sustainable development  commitments. Hence, injury frequency and severity rates, the rate of  employees who participated in at least one training course and the  rate of coverage by a social dialogue organization were calculated  including the Chinese concessions which represented 4,225 employees  as of December 31, 2023. Since 2017, employees absent during the entire year for reasons other  than occupational disease or following a workplace accident are  deducted in calculating the number of calendar days of absence. They  are also excluded from the calculation of the full-time equivalent (FTE)  workforce. Training hours cover the period from January 1 to December 31. The  sole exception involves Japan which records training hours between  the period from December 1, Y-1 to November 30, Y. This rule is  applicable until the end of 2023. The diversity multifaceted performance indicator refers to the Group’s  Top 500 senior executives. In Veolia Group, this encompasses  executive employees with a job position graded 16 and above  according to the Willis Towers Watson Global Grading System. Since 2020, to assess the potential impact of the health crisis on  employee data, an indicator was created to record absences in  calendar days relating to this period (self-isolation, furlough,  childcare). Environmental reporting covers activities linked to the operation of  public water and wastewater treatment services, waste collection,  transfer and processing activities, as well as industrial cleaning and  maintenance and energy services (heating and cooling systems,  industrial utilities and energy services for buildings). Within this scope,  the reporting covers all activities over which the Group exercises  operating control. Excluded activities in 2023 are estimated at  approximately 4% of total revenue and are split between a few  operational activities that still need to be integrated into the reporting  and low environmental impact activities (support functions, design  offices and in-house training centers). In 2023, the activities relating o  WTS (Veolia Water Technologies & Solutions) were included. Within this scope, environmental and social information taken from  the Group’s dedicated information system is fully consolidated  regardless of the consolidation rate in the financial statements. Societal reporting covers the same scope as that of the social and  environmental reporting for the data included in one of these reports,  as stated in the societal reporting guidelines. Societal reporting also  covers specific scopes due to the nature of the indicators and sources  from which the data originates. In this case, the specific nature of the  information is stated with the presentation of the indicator. In calculating the indicator monitoring commitment six (number of  people connected), people connected to water or wastewater  treatment networks by Veolia continue to be included in this indicator  after the termination of the related contracts. The data collected covers the period from January 1 to December 31,  2023. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Methodology 316 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 319 ===== GUIDELINES Where there is no recognized and relevant external reporting  reference framework, the Group has defined its own reporting  procedures, drawn from best practices and draft international  standards, that describe the methodology used for compiling,  measuring, calculating, checking, analyzing and consolidating data. The environmental and societal reporting guidelines are available in  French and English for the entities and on the Veolia website  (www.veolia.com). The social reporting reference framework is  available for the entities in French, English, German, Spanish and  Portuguese. CONSOLIDATIONS AND CONTROL The Group uses a software package to conduct automated checks on  entities. The data is consolidated and checked by the Group’s  Corporate Human Resources Department and Business Support and  Performance Department for the social and environmental indicators  respectively. The societal indicators that are not taken from the social  or environmental reporting are consolidated and checked by the  department/entity concerned (Finance, Purchasing, Foundation) and  subsequently by the Multifaceted Performance and Sustainable  Development Department. All the information published by the Group in Chapter  4 has been  subject to a specific external review. For fiscal year 2021, the indicators  noted by the symbol (V) were checked with a reasonable level of  assurance. METHODOLOGICAL LIMITS It is important to note that there may be methodological limits to the  indicators due to the following: ■lack of harmonization between national and international  legislation; ■heterogeneous nature of the data managed and the variety of  tools in the Group’s many subsidiaries; ■changes in definition that may affect the comparison of indicators; ■specific characteristics of labor laws in certain countries; ■practicalities of data collection; ■availability of source data on the reporting date. The indicators should be interpreted with caution, in particular  averages, since the figures comprise worldwide data that requires a  more detailed analysis at the level of the geographic zone, country or  business line in question. As methane production at landfill sites cannot be measured on site, it  is modeled using the IPCC Tier 2 methodology. The model is  recalculated annually based on the following parameters for each site:  historic tonnage (since the site’s opening if available), climate data  (rainfall, temperature, etc.) and the standard composition of incoming  waste (Modecom, Gas Sim, IPCC, etc.).

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France. For the year ended 31 December 2023 To the annual general meeting, In our capacity as Statutory Auditor of your company (hereinafter the “Entity”)  appointed as independent third party, and accredited by the French  Accreditation Committee (COFRAC) under number 3-1884 1, we have undertaken a limited assurance engagement on the historical  information  (actual or extrapolated) in the consolidated non-financial statement, prepared in accordance with the entity's procedures (hereinafter the  ''Guidelines''), for the year ended December  31, 2023 (hereinafter, the ''Information'' and the ''Statement respectively), presented in the Group's  management report pursuant to the legal and regulatory provisions of Articles L. 225-102-1, R. 225-105 and R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial  Code (code de commerce). At the request of the entity, we also performed work designed to express a reasonable assurance conclusion on the information selected by the  entity and identified by the sign √. LIMITED ASSURANCE CONCLUSION  Based on the procedures we performed as described under the ''Nature and scope of procedures'' paragraph and the evidence we obtained, nothing  has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the consolidated non-financial statement is not prepared in accordance with the applicable  regulatory provisions and that the Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly in accordance with the Guidelines, in all material respects. REASONABLE ASSURANCE CONCLUSION ON A SELECTION OF NON-FINANCIAL  INFORMATION  In our opinion, the information selected by the entity and identified with the symbol √ in the Statement has been prepared, in all material respects,  in accordance with the Guidelines. PREPARATION OF THE NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE STATEMENT The absence of a commonly used generally accepted reporting framework or of a significant body of established practices on which to draw to  evaluate and measure the Information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques that can affect comparability between  entities and over time. Consequently, the Information needs to be read and understood together with the Guidelines, summarized in the Statement and available on the  Entity’s website or on request from its headquarters. INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN PREPARING THE INFORMATION The Information may be subject to uncertainty inherent to the state of scientific and economic knowledge and the quality of external data used.  Some information is sensitive to the choice of methodology and the assumptions or estimates used for its preparation and presented in the  Statement. RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ENTITY Management of the entity is responsible for: ■selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the Information; ■preparing a Statement pursuant to legal and regulatory provisions, including a presentation of the business model, a description of the main  non-financial risks, a presentation of the policies implemented considering those risks and the outcomes of said policies, including key  performance indicators, and the information set out in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green Taxonomy); ■preparing the Statement by applying the entity’s “Guidelines” as referred above; and CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Report of one of the Statutory Auditors 318 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 (1) Accreditation Cofrac Inspection, number 3-1884, scope available at  www.cofrac.fr  ===== PAGE 321 ===== ■designing, implementing, and maintaining internal control over information relevant to the preparation of the Information that is free from  material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Statement has been prepared by the Management Board. RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATUTORY AUDITOR, APPOINTED AS INDEPENDENT  THIRD PARTY Based on our work, our responsibility is to provide a report expressing a limited assurance conclusion on: ■The compliance of the Statement with the requirements of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code; ■The fairness of the historical information (observed or extrapolated) provided pursuant to part 3 of sections I and II of Article R. 225-105 of the  French Commercial Code, i.e., the outcomes of policies, including key performance indicators, and measures relating to the main risks. As we are engaged to form an independent conclusion on the Information as prepared by management, we are not permitted to be involved in the  preparation of the Information as doing so may compromise our independence. At the request of the entity and outside of the scope of our accreditation, we may express reasonable assurance that the information selected by  the entity, presented in the Appendices, and identified by the symbol √ has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the  Guidelines. It is not our responsibility to report on: ■the entity's compliance with other applicable legal and regulatory provisions (particularly with regard to the information set-out in Article 8 of  Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green taxonomy), the French Duty of care law, and provisions against corruption and tax evasion law); ■the fairness of information set out in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green Taxonomy); ■the compliance of products and services with applicable regulations. APPLICABLE REGULATORY PROVISIONS AND PROFESSIONAL GUIDANCE We performed the work described below in accordance with Articles A. 225-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, the professional guidance  issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes) applicable to such engagements, in  particular the professional guidance issued by the Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes, “Intervention du commissaire aux  comptes - Intervention de l’OTI - Déclaration de performance extra-financière”, acting as the verification program, and with the international  standard ISAE 3000 (revised) 2. INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY CONTROL Our independence is defined by the provisions of Article L. 822-11 of the French Commercial Code and the French Code of Ethics for Statutory  Auditors (Code de déontologie) of our profession. In addition, we have implemented a system of quality control including documented policies and  procedures aimed at ensuring compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, ethical requirements and the professional guidance  issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes) relating to this engagement. MEANS AND RESOURCES Our work engaged the skills of twelve people between October 2023 and March 2024 and took a total of about twenty weeks. We were assisted in our work by our specialists in sustainable development and corporate social responsibility. We conducted twenty interviews  with the people responsible for preparing the Statement. NATURE AND SCOPE OF PROCEDURES We are required to plan and perform our work to address the areas where we have identified that a material misstatement of the Information is  likely to arise.  The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment. In carrying out our limited assurance engagement on the Information: ■we obtained an understanding of all the consolidated entities' activities, and the description of the main related risks; ■we assessed the suitability of the criteria of the Guidelines with respect to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and  understandability, taking into account, where appropriate, best practices within the sector; ■we verified that the Statement includes each category of social and environmental information set out in article L. 225-102-1 III of the French  Commercial Code as well as information regarding compliance with human rights, anti-corruption and tax avoidance legislation, and includes,  where applicable, an explanation for the absence of the information required under article L. 225-102-1 III, paragraph 2 of the French Commercial  Code; CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Report of one of the Statutory Auditors VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 319 (2) ISAE 3000 (Revised) - Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information  ===== PAGE 322 ===== ■we verified that the Statement provides the information required under article R. 225-105 II of the French Commercial Code, where relevant with  respect to the main risks; ■We verified that the Statement presents the business model and a description of main risks associated with all the consolidated entities'  activities, including where relevant and proportionate, the risks associated with their business relationships, products or services, as well as  policies, measures and the outcomes thereof, including key performance indicators related to the main risks; ■we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to: • assess the process used to identify and confirm the main risks as well as the consistency of the outcomes, including the key performance  indicators used, with respect to the main risks and the policies presented, • corroborate the qualitative information (measures and outcomes) that we considered to be the most important presented in the Appendices.  Concerning certain risks 3, our work was carried out on the consolidating entity, for the other risks, our work was carried out on the  consolidating entity and on a selection of entities 4, ■we verified that the Statement covers the consolidated scope, i.e. all the entities within the consolidation scope in accordance with Article L.  233-16 of the French Commercial Code within the limitations set out in the Statement; ■we obtained an understanding of internal control and risk management procedures the entity implemented, and assessed the data collection  process aimed at ensuring the completeness and fairness of the Information; ■for the key performance indicators and other quantitative outcomes that we considered to be the most important, presented in the Appendices,  we implemented: • analytical procedures to verify the proper consolidation of the data collected and the consistency of any changes in those data, • tests of details, using sampling techniques, in order to verify the proper application of definitions and procedures and reconcile the data with  supporting documents. This work was carried out on a selection of contributing entities4 and covers between 26% and 100% of the  consolidated data relating to the key performance indicators and outcomes selected for these tests, ■we assessed the overall consistency of the Statement based on our knowledge of all the consolidated entities' activities. The procedures performed in a limited assurance review are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance opinion in accordance with the  professional guidance of the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes), a higher level of  assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures. NATURE AND EXTENT OF ADDITIONAL WORK ON THE INFORMATION SELECTED  BY THE ENTITY AND IDENTIFIED BY THE SIGN √ With regard to the information selected by the entity, presented in the Appendices and identified by the symbol √ in the Statement, we conducted  the same work as described in the paragraph ''Nature and scope of our work'' above for the Information considered to be the most important, but in  a more in-depth manner, in particular with regard to the number of tests. The selected sample accounts for between 44% and 68% of the information identified by the symbol √. We believe that our work is sufficient to provide a basis for our reasonable assurance opinion on the information selected by the entity and  identified by the symbol √.

They reflect the strength of the Group’s business model and strategic choices, which have proved resilient  in a contrasted macroeconomic context. These results confirm the Group’s ability to deliver solid organic growth through a diversified and  complementary business portfolio and a balanced geographic footprint. 2023 also confirmed the success of the Suez merger, which is bearing fruit  faster than expected with synergies ahead of targets.  2023 / 2022 Change (€ million) 2022 2023 Δ at constant  exchange rates Δ at constant  exchange rates  & scope Revenue   42,885   45,351   8.5 %  9.0 % EBITDA   6,196   6,543   7.8 %  7.8 % Current EBIT (1)   3,062   3,346   11.6 %  13.7 % Net Financial Debt  (1)   -18,138   -17,903  (1) The indicators are defined in Section 5.2 below. 2023 results show strong growth in revenue, EBITDA, Current EBIT and free cash flow despite the economic climate in Europe and an unfavorable  weather effect.  2023 Revenue is €45,351 million, up significantly on 2022: +9.0% at  constant scope and exchange rates. Growth was recorded across all  businesses and is driven by excellent performance in Water, steady  growth in Waste despite lower recyclate prices and ongoing robust  growth in Energy boosted by higher energy prices.  ■Water activities recorded organic growth of +7.5% due to excellent  activity levels in Water technologies and tariff reviews, despite an  adverse weather effect that impacted volumes in certain regions;  ■Waste activities increased by +3.4% and +5.9% excluding the  change in recyclate prices, driven by hazardous waste processing  activities, particularly in the United States, commercial wins and  the effect of price reviews;  ■The Energy businesses grew significantly (19.9% organic growth),  benefiting from increases in heating tariffs and electricity selling  prices, reflecting the higher cost of purchased energy and  sustained commercial activity, notably in energy flexibility services. Revenue growth excluding the increase in energy prices was +4.4% at  constant scope and exchange rates.  2023 EBITDA is €6,543 million, up +7.8% at constant scope and  exchange rates. EBITDA growth outpaced revenue growth restated for  the increase in energy prices, reflecting excellent operating leverage.  In 2023, operating efficiency programs generated €389 million and the  Suez integration synergies plan €168 million, ahead of objectives.  Current EBIT is €3,346 million, up +13.7% at constant scope and  exchange rates year-on-year. Net financial debt is €17,903 million as of December 31, 2023, down  €235 million euros compared to 31 December 2022, in particular thanks  to strong free cash flow generation. Net free cash flow before  dividends and financial investments totaled +€1,143 million, up  compared to 2022 (+€111 million), primarily due to increased cash  generated by operations and lower restructuring costs.  Impact 2023 strategic program financial objectives met or exceeded  2023 marked the final year of the impact 2023 plan, with all financial objectives met or exceeded. The success of the program was founded on steady  growth over the period 2020-2023 (average annual growth of 5% excluding Suez) and net current income in excess of €1.3 billion in 2023, above target  (€1 billion), while maintaining leverage at below 3. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW Major events of the period 324 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 327 ===== 5.1.2  ESG ACHIEVEMENTS AS PART OF OUR MULTIFACETED PERFORMANCE As an ESG benchmark company, Veolia continued to roll out its multifaceted performance in 2023. Thanks to this approach, initiated at the  beginning of the Impact 2023 plan, the Group has improved its ESG performance. Based on the good results achieved at the end of the Impact 2023  program, this approach will be adjusted and strengthened in the new 2024-2027 strategic plan. Environmental Commitments Carbon Net Zero 2050 commitment: a 10-year reduction trajectory  already launched and being delivered  ■As part of its plan to phase out the use of coal in Europe, Veolia  undertook to invest in a massive €1.6 billion program over the  period to 2030, to reduce CO2 emissions by 2.7 million metric tons.  At the end of 2023, Veolia had invested a total of €529 million in  decarbonization projects in Central and Eastern Europe. ■At the COP 28 organized in Dubai (United Arab Emirates), Veolia  reaffirmed its commitment to phase out coal in Europe, by  continuing the conversion of coal-based power generation assets  to less carbon-intensive energies and local energies in particular.  The Group also reaffirmed its ambition to achieve Carbon Net Zero  by 2050. ■Veolia aims to decarbonize and reduce its greenhouse gas  emissions, while promoting access to locally sourced energy and  contributing to the decarbonization of its customers’ activities: • In Latin America, the Group has committed to a €70 million  investment plan to capture gas at landfill sites. These  investments will enable CO2 emissions to be reduced by  1.5 million metric tons per year.  • The new contract awarded in Hong Kong to design, build and  operate the extension to the West New Territories (WENT)  resource recovery site is expected to optimize methane capture  and avoid the emission of an estimated 10 million metric tons of  CO2 equivalent over twenty years.   • Veolia launched the roll-out of a residual cold recovery solution  at the Enagás LNG terminal in Barcelona. A world first, this  solution will generate 131 GWh of local, affordable and  environmentally-friendly energy annually. Commissioning is  scheduled for the second quarter of 2024. This solution allows  the emissions linked to energy production that would have  been necessary in the absence of recovered energy to be  avoided. This represents over 42,000 metric tons of CO2 avoided  per year. ''Net Zero Water'': sustainable management of water resources ■As part of its France “Net Zero Water'' ambition by 2033, Veolia  successfully renewed the Lille water distribution contract for a  period of ten years and combined revenue of €700 million.  Through an innovative contract focused on resource conservation,  65 million cubic meters of water will be saved over the duration of  the contract. The Group also launched the “Eco d’eau” initiative in  France to mobilize all players - citizens, public authorities,  companies, associations, etc. - around actions to be taken now to  preserve water resources. ■On November 16, 2023, Veolia inaugurated with Vendée Eau the  first unit in France for the reuse of treated wastewater for the  production of drinking water as part of the Jourdain program. This  complementary solution can produce 1.5 million m3 of drinking  water during the period from May to October for dry years in the  Vendée region. In addition, the installation program for compact  water recycling units (REUT boxes) launched by the Group in France  is a great success: nearly 55 municipalities have already expressed  interest in this solution. Environmental protection and biodiversity:  ■With an average deployment rate of 85% at the end of 2023 on the  action plans to protect the environment and biodiversity at  sensitive Group sites identified on the launch of the Impact 2023  strategic program, Veolia has exceeded its 75% objectives thanks to  the governance and management structures implemented, as well  as strong momentum within the Business Units. Social Commitments ■On September 11, 2023, Veolia announced the launch of its “Veolia  Cares” program, which aims to guarantee a common base level of  social protection for the Group’s 213,000 employees, even in countries  where there are no such legal requirements. The program provides all  Group employee; whether they have fixed-term or permanent  contracts, with access to parental leave, health and death cover,  support for carers, and the opportunity to dedicate one day a year to a  charity or an environmental protection project. This program  demonstrates the Company’s commitment to the professional and  personal well-being of its employees. It also demonstrates the Group’s  strong roots in the territories where it operates.  ■In line with measures implemented as part of the Group's  multifaceted performance, employee indicators have progressed  significantly. At the end of 2023, the gender balance among  Executive Resourcers had improved by 1.5 basis points compared to  December 31, 2022 to 26.7%.   ■In terms of health and safety, the lost time injury frequency rate  continued to fall, dropping below 5 at the end of 2023, the target  rate in the Impact 2023 plan (vs. 5.61 in 2022). ■The “Voice of Resources” annual commitment survey, addressed to  160,000 Group employees, was conducted in November 2023. It  confirmed the strong results achieved in previous years, with a  commitment rate of 89%.  ■In September, Veolia launched the YouTube channel Verso,  dedicated to analyzing, decoding and popularizing the backstage  of the ecological transformation, enabling the younger generation  to understand current environmental issues, as well as the Group’s  ecological transformation solutions proposed to the general public. Governance Commitments ■Following the Combined General Meeting of April 27, 2023 and as  of the date of this Universal Registration Document, 82% of  directors are independent and 54.5%( 1) are women. Since this  General Shareholders’ Meeting, the Board of Directors includes  three new independent directors with strong academic, corporate  and institutional skills and experience in key issues related to the  Company’s strategy and development. ■The Sequoia 2023 employee share ownership plan was a great  success. At the end of this operation, employees strengthened their  position as Veolia’s largest shareholder, holding approximately  7.5% of the Company’s share capital as of December 13, 2023.  Offered to 190,000 employees in 49 countries, the Sequoia 2023  plan was subscribed by nearly 79,000 employees, representing a  subscription rate of close to 42%. In the same way as the plans  performed annually since 2018, the Sequoia 2023 plan confirms  Veolia’s desire to involve its employees in the development of their  Company and its value creation.

The contract  has an initial term of seven years with options to extend to eighteen  years, which would represent around €500 million for the full  extended term of the contract. This new contract combines the  management of recovery and collection facilities and will optimize the  implementation of existing infrastructure across the entire waste  treatment value chain. It will also reduce carbon emissions by around  77,000 metric tons per year.  ■Decarbonization: Veolia operates the largest waste-to-energy  plant in Turkey On April 20, 2023, Veolia announced it had been awarded the contract  to operate and maintain Turkey's first waste-to-energy plant, the  largest in Europe, in Istanbul. With a processing capacity of around  1,1 million metric tons of non-recyclable household waste per year, the  plant will save nearly 1.5 million metric tons of carbon emissions  annually, thanks in particular to the production of 560,000 MWh of  electricity, equivalent to the consumption of 1.4 million inhabitants of  the metropolis.   ■Decarbonization: Successful start-up of the Braunschweig biomass  plant in Germany  In the first quarter of 2023, Veolia successfully launched operations at  the Braunschweig biomass plant, which will produce 800 GWh of heat  per year to supply 68,000 homes. This plant has allowed Veolia to  replace the use of coal with a mix of biomass and gas, generating 25%  green electricity and reducing the carbon footprint by 50%. ■Regeneration: Successful renewal of the Lille water distribution  contract in France In April 2023, Veolia successfully renewed the Lille water distribution  contract for a period of ten years and combined revenue of €700  million (see Section 1.2 for more information). ■Regeneration of water resources: Design of the MIRFA 2  desalination plant in Abu Dhabi  On June 14, 2023, Veolia announced that the Group will design one of  the world's largest energy-efficient desalination plants in Abu Dhabi.  With a capacity of 550,000 m3/day, this desalination plant will supply  drinking water to around 210,000 households. The project will  generate revenue of approximately €300 million for Veolia.  Construction commenced in 2023 with commissioning scheduled for  2025. ■Regeneration of water resources: Operation of the La Me drinking  water treatment plant in the Ivory Coast On June 21, 2023, Veolia announced that the Group and its Ivorian  partner, PFO Africa, will operate one of the largest drinking water  treatment plants in West Africa for a period of 15 years. The plant  addresses the water access issue by treating surface water rather than  drawing from groundwater. At full capacity, the plant will cover the  daily needs of 2.4 million Abidjan inhabitants. The contract represents  revenue of €390 million over fifteen years. ■Regeneration of water resources: Major contract wins with two  new innovative offerings to preserve water resources in France In July 2023, in Perpignan, Veolia was awarded the public service  delegation contract for water services by Perpignan Métropole  Méditerranée, representing revenue of €650 million over twelve years.  This contract provides for investment to preserve water resources with  a target reduction in leaks from 20% to 12%. In Strasbourg, the Group  also won the contract to operate a wastewater treatment plant,  representing €150 million over 8 years. ■Regeneration of water resources: 50 “Reut boxes” sold in less than  a year in France to reuse wastewater As a pioneer in wastewater reuse in France, Veolia contributes to  industrializing water reuse in France, in a context of increasing  drought and scarcity of resources. Around fifty Reut projects are currently in progress, with around half  installed and equipped with Reut boxes. The mid-term potential for  wastewater reuse as drinking water thanks to Reut projects is around 1  million m3/year, with greater potential in coastal regions. The coastal  regions have been prioritized in a bid to reuse treated wastewater that  is discharged into the sea and help reduce pressure on resources.  Project progress is subject to the pace of delivery of various  administrative authorizations, which notably take account of  economic, local environment and use factors. Regulations are  changing regularly to broaden the use of Reut-water and simplify its  access. ■Water technologies: Engineering & Equipment for a water  recovery facility for a Samsung semiconductor plant in the United  States In the second quarter of 2023, Samsung awarded the Group a contract  to design, equip, supply and supervise the commissioning of a water  recovery facility in the new semiconductor plant in Texas.

It will also reduce CO2 emissions by  around 111,000 metric tons per year.  ■Resource regeneration: Sludge incineration in St. Louis, USA Through its subsidiary, Veolia Water Technologies and Solutions,  Veolia signed a US$154 million contract with Kokosing/Plocher to  supply its state-of-the-art sludge incineration and air pollution control  technology to the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District.  ■ Decarbonization: New energy efficiency contracts in Italy In the third quarter of 2023, Veolia signed two major energy efficiency  contracts: a twelve-year contract covering health care buildings in  Cosenza worth €153 million, and a fifteen-year contract with the  Municipality of Trieste worth €130 million. In the fourth quarter of  2023, Veolia signed contracts with the Turin municipality totaling  €33 million, for the University of Turin and the Turin Court. Through  these contracts, Veolia will help its customers reduce their carbon  footprint by implementing alternative energy sources. ■Decarbonization: Installation of solar power plants To achieve the energy independence of its services in France, Veolia  relies in particular on the installation of solar panels at post-operation  landfill sites and plans to equip more than 40 facilities with a total  capacity of more than 300 MW of 100% local and renewable energy,  equivalent to the consumption of 130,000 inhabitants. 5.1.3.2  Changes in Group structure The main changes in scope in 2023 were as follows: ■Consolidation of Lydec (Morocco) On January 1, 2023, the local authorizations needed for the transfer of  the Lydec securities to New Suez could not be obtained, rendering the  sale provided for in the Share and Asset Purchase Agreement (SAPA)  null and void. The Lydec securities are therefore no longer classified  under IFRS 5 from January 1, 2023. At the same time there were a number of changes to Lydec’s  governance, with the resignation of the Suez (Consortium)  representatives, effective January 25, 2023. Pursuant to IFRS, this event  and the rights and obligations under the hold separate status led to  the consolidation of Lydec’s contribution from this date. On June 15, 2023, the Moroccan Competition Authorities notified the  Company of its grievances regarding, in particular, the aborted sale of  its stake to New Suez initially provided for in the Share and Asset  Purchase Agreement (SAPA). The Group addressed its written  observations in response to the Moroccan Competition Authorities on  July 18, 2023. On November 13, 2023, the Moroccan Competition Authorities  accepted Veolia’s request for a settlement procedure. This involves in  particular proposing a solution to the Authorities satisfying its  competition concerns before January 15, 2024. In this context, the Group is actively continuing its discussions with  the Moroccan Competition Authorities and the Delegating Authority  to examine various possible arrangements, including total or partial  divestment. The January 15 deadline was extended to allow the parties  to find a satisfactory solution. The analysis conducted by the Group and its advisors of the various  decisions issued does not call into question the analysis of control  pursuant to IFRS of Lydec by Veolia as of December 31, 2023. Accordingly, pursuant to IFRS 3, the purchase price allocation process  was finalized during the period resulting primarily in the recognition  of an intangible asset in respect of the concession arrangement  operated by Lydec in Casablanca. ■Acquisition of the subsidiaries Reciclados La Red and Banales III  (Spain) On January 10, 2023, the Group acquired the subsidiaries Reciclados La  Red S.LL and Banales III located in Madrid and Seville, respectively, for  a total of €54 million. These subsidiaries are active in plastic recovery  and recycling in Spain. ■Divestiture of Advanced Solutions (USA) Advanced Solutions provides water infrastructure and asset  management services to municipal and commercial customers across  the United States. On February 23, 2023, operating subsidiaries were  sold for a total of €84 million. This activity was recorded in assets and liabilities classified as held for  sale as of December 31, 2022. ■Completion of the divestiture of Suez hazardous waste activities  (France) Following the signature of a partnership agreement on January 27,  2023, the sale of the final activities by SARPI to Suez was completed for  a consideration of €49 million.  This activity was recorded in assets and liabilities classified as held for  sale as of December 31, 2022. This transaction completes the divestitures required under the  antitrust remedies agreed with the European Commission in the  context of the Veolia-Suez combination. ■Divestiture of WTS’s O&M activities (United Kingdom) The divestiture of Suez’s industrial water operations and maintenance  business in the United Kingdom to SAUR was completed on February  15, 2023 for €15 million.  ■Acquisition of Suez - Final payments under the Share and Asset  Purchase Agreement (SAPA) The final amounts in respect of the completion accounts and the  outstanding earn-outs for the 2022 transaction in accordance with the  SAPA, were finalized in the agreement between Suez and Veolia  Environnement dated March 3, 2023: • The net amount in respect of the completion accounts and closing  statements received on March 24, 2023 of €106 million.  • The final amount of the earn-out received on June 30, 2023 of €284  million.   ■Divestiture of Italian water concessions  On October 16, 2023, the Group completed the divestiture of Italian  water concessions in the Latium and Sicily regions for €74 million. ■Acquisition of U.S. Industrial Technologies (USA) On October 31, 2023, the Group finalized, via its subsidiary VES  Technical Solutions LLC in the United States, the acquisition of U.S.  Industrial Technologies, whose activity is the treatment of hazardous  waste, for €58 million.

The 2022  dividend was paid from May 11, 2023 for a total amount of €787  million. 5.1.5  FREE SHARE AND PERFORMANCE SHARE PLANS AND GROUP SAVINGS In accordance with the Group’s compensation policy and the  authorization granted by the Veolia Environnement Combined  General Meeting, the Board of Directors decided on May 3, 2023, at the  recommendation of the Compensation Committee, to grant 1,030,848  performance shares (representing approximately 0.2% of the share  capital out of a General Shareholders’ Meeting authorization of 0.35%)  to approximately 550 beneficiaries, made up of senior executives, high  potential employees and key contributors of the Group, including the  Chief Executive Officer. The vesting of these shares is subject to  presence and performance conditions. The detailed features of these  Plans can be found in Chapter 3, Section 3.4.3 of the 2023 Universal  Registration Document. In addition, during the Veolia Environnement Combined General  Meeting of April 27, 2023, the Company reaffirmed its wish to  associate ever closer employees, both in France and internationally,  with the Group’s development and performance by launching a new  employee share ownership program. On September 8, 2023, the Group  therefore announced the launch of an employee share ownership plan  open to around 190,000 Group employees. The subscription rate was  close to 42%, with nearly 79,000 employees choosing to subscribe.  This new plan enabled Group employees to strengthen their position  as Veolia’s largest shareholder, holding approximately 7.5% of the  Company’s share capital.  This plan led to a share capital increase of  nearly €222 million (including issue premiums). Settlement-delivery of  the new shares issued was performed on December 13, 2023.  As for the other plans performed annually since 2018, the Sequoia 2023  plan is fully consistent with Veolia’s “multifaceted performance”  approach, which seeks to associate employees as closely as possible  with the Group’s performance.

France and Special Waste Europe activities  posted moderate growth: ■Water technologies +12.1%; ■Europe excluding France +11.6%; ■Rest of the world +10.0%; and ■France and Special Waste Europe +1.4%.   Revenue for the France and Special Waste Europe segment totaled  €9,726 million, with organic growth of +1.4% compared with  December 31, 2022: ■Water France revenue increased +1.0% to €3,006 million, mainly  fueled by the +6.2% positive effect of tariff reviews, which offset  the return to public management of the Greater Lyon water  contract and a -2.8% contraction in volumes due to an unfavorable  weather effect. ■Waste France revenue increased +0.7% to €2,909 million:  the  decline in recyclate prices (-49% decrease in COPACEL compared to  2022) and the pressure on volumes were offset by tariff reviews  and higher electricity sales. Excluding recyclates prices, revenue  increased 5.4%. ■Special Waste Europe revenue declined slightly by -0.8% to  €2,125  million, mainly due to lower oil prices, offset by higher  contractual prices in hazardous waste processing and sanitation  maintenance activities. ■SADE reported growth of +5.2%, thanks to strong commercial  momentum in France. Revenue for the Europe excluding France segment totaled  €19,000 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, with organic  growth of +11.6%. ■In Central and Eastern Europe, revenue rose +19.1% to  €11,360 million. Momentum was strong during the period, driven  by higher electricity prices and heating tariff reviews (Poland,  Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Germany), despite an  unfavorable weather effect (-€159 million).  ■In Northern Europe, revenue rose +5.2% to €4,043 million. This  growth was mainly attributable to the United Kingdom, up +5.5%  at constant scope and exchange rates, due to tariff indexation and  the favorable impact of electricity prices on incineration and good  commercial development for waste collection.  ■In Iberia, revenue increased +6.6% to €2,603 million, driven  primarily by water activities in Spain, which benefited from strong  construction momentum and increased tariffs partially offset by a  slight fall in volumes (-0.8% compared to 2022), impacted by  unfavorable weather conditions.  ■Italy generated revenue of €994 million, down -12.5% mainly  following a drop in energy selling prices. Profitability was not,  however, affected due to a parallel decrease in energy purchase  costs. In the Rest of the world, revenue totaled €11,907 million, representing  organic growth of +10.0%, increasing across all geographies:  ■Revenue increased +30.3% to €1,832 million in Latin America, driven  by the impacts of hyperinflation in Argentina (offset by the  devaluation of the Argentinian peso), and Water activities in Chile  which benefited from tariff reviews.  ■In Africa Middle-East, revenue rose +10.0% to €2,213 million, mainly  driven by new contracts in waste activities (Istanbul in Turkey), the  start-up of new water facilities (Jeddah in Saudi Arabia), the  growth of energy services in the Middle East and the increase in  water contracts in Morocco due to slightly higher volumes. ■In North America, revenue rose +5.8% to €3,347 million. The  Hazardous waste business had a very good year, growing +6.4%,  with higher volumes and increased tariffs. The Water activity  enjoyed higher tariffs, which more than offset the -1.7% fall in  “regulated water” volumes, impacted by unfavorable weather  conditions (without impacting the margin).  ■Revenue in Asia increased +4.6% to €2,540 million, mainly driven  by Hong Kong (+16.1%), Taiwan (+11.9%) and Japan (+4.8%). China  revenue stabilized. ■In the Pacific, revenue increased +6.4% to €1,975 million, mainly  driven by tariff reviews and commercial wins in Waste (in  particular the Gold Coast contract), as well as a good commercial  performance in industrial maintenance.  The Water technologies activity reported an increase of +12.1% to  €4,707 million, driven by growth in WTS’s Engineering Systems and  Chemical Solutions activities and VWT’s Services and Technology  activities. Bookings by the Water technologies business totaled  €3,490 million as of December 31, 2023 1, up significantly by 31.1% on  December 31, 2022 (€2,662 million).  5.2.2.2  Revenues by business line Compared with the year ended December 31, 2022, revenue by  business rose +9.0% at constant scope and exchange rates, driven  mainly by:  ■strong growth in Energy of +19.9%, underpinned by higher  electricity prices and tariff reviews for heating sales, reflecting the  rise in the cost of purchased energies; ■growth in Water activities of +7.5%, due to contract tariff  indexation across all geographies, as well as growth in Technology  and Construction activities (+10.8%); ■growth in Waste activities of +3.4% due to favorable tariff reviews,  offsetting lower recyclate prices.

Water revenue Water revenue rose +7.5%. Water Operations revenue rose by +5.9%,  with tariff rises across all geographies, good commercial development  in Africa/Middle East and strong construction activity levels, despite  volumes impacted by unfavorable weather conditions in France, Spain  and the United States.  Technology and Construction revenue rose +10.8%, driven by Water  technologies activities.  Waste revenue Waste revenue increased +3.4% and +5.9% excluding changes in  recyclate prices, benefiting from favorable tariff reviews (+5.3%) which  offset lower recyclate prices (-2.5% in revenue) observed in France,  Germany and Northern Europe. The commercial/volumes/works effect  is slightly positive (+0.1%) marked by resilient volumes. The decline in  Europe (notably in France and Germany) is offset by the Rest of the  world and good commercial activity in Australia and the United  Kingdom.  Energy revenue Energy revenue rose +19.9%. The strong activity growth is founded on  positive price effects (+18.5%), mainly in Central and Eastern Europe, as  well as the start-up of new projects (biomass fueled cogeneration  facility in Germany, takeover of the Tashkent heating network in  Uzbekistan) and robust growth in electricity flexibility services  (network support).

The consolidation scope impact of -€217 million mainly comprises the  impact of the remedies imposed by the European Commission and the  UK Competition and Markets Authority, completed in 2022 in the  context of the Suez acquisition, as well as the impact of the divestiture  of Advanced Solutions (USA) on February 23, 2023. These negative  effects are mainly offset by the revenue adjustment for the first 17  days of 2022 for the Suez scope, prior to acquisition of control (+€400  million), as well as the entry into the consolidation scope of Lydec  (Morocco). The Commerce / Volumes / Works impact is +€774 million (+1.8%),  driven by good commercial momentum, progress with construction  work, the start-up of new projects (biomass fueled cogeneration  facility in Germany, takeover of the Tashkent heating network in  Uzbekistan), as well as growth in Water technologies activities. The weather impact of -€232 million (-0.5%) mainly concerns Central  and Eastern Europe, where energy activities were impacted by a  milder winter than in 2022, as well as unfavorable weather conditions  in France, Spain and the United States, which impacted water  consumption in the summer.  Energy and recyclate prices had an impact of +€1,579 million (+3.7%),  driven by higher heating and electricity tariffs (+€1,978 million),  mainly in Central and Eastern Europe. This increase was partially offset  by lower recyclate prices across all materials, mainly impacting  Northern Europe, France and Germany. Favorable price effects (+€1,749 million) are mainly tied to tariff  reviews estimated at +5.2% in waste and +4.4% in water. 5.2.3  GROUP EBITDA Group consolidated EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023 was €6,543 million, compared with €6,196 million for the year ended December  31, 2022.

France and Special Waste Europe reported an EBITDA of €1,338 million.  The -5.2% decline year-on-year at constant scope and exchange rates is  mainly due to lower recyclate prices and an unfavorable weather  effect on water volumes, partially offset by operational efficiency  action plans. Europe excluding France EBITDA is €2,599 million. The +13.7% organic  growth compared to 2022 was driven by high energy prices and gains  in energy flexibility and support services in Central and Eastern  Europe, as well as tariff increases in water.  The Rest of the world posted EBITDA of €1,925 million and organic  growth of +7.1% compared to December 31, 2022, attributable to the  North America, Africa-Middle East and Pacific regions.

The +€420 million increase (+13.7%) in Current EBIT at constant scope  and exchange rates year-on-year is mainly due to:  ■robust growth in EBITDA (+€485 million at constant scope and  exchange rates); ■an increase in depreciation and amortization 1, including principal  payments on operating financial assets (-€60 million at constant  scope and change rate). Excluding principal payments on operating  financial assets, depreciation and amortization is €2,827 million,  stable at constant scope and exchange rates;  ■a decrease in provisions net of capital gains on disposals (-€37  million at constant scope and exchange rates), mainly due to the  decrease in capital gains on disposals (-€71 million), partially offset  by the reversal of pension provisions, primarily due to pension  reforms in France; ■an increase in the Group’s share of net income of joint ventures of + €21 million at constant scope and exchange rates. This increase is  offset by a consolidation scope effect of -€20 million, mainly tied to  the divestiture of Suez activities in the United Kingdom. The foreign exchange impact on Current EBIT of -€72 million mainly  reflects fluctuations in the Argentinian (-€34 million), American (-€15  million), Australian (-€10 million), Chinese (-€7 million) and British (-€6  million) currencies, partially offset by an appreciation of the Hungarian  (+€6 million) and Czech (+€5 million) currencies.

This -€141 million increase is mainly due to the fall  in non-current financial income and expenses. ■The current net financial expense is -€966 million for the year  ended December 31, 2023, compared with -€1,023 million for the  year ended December 31, 2022.  The current cost of net financial  debt is down €81 million at -€626 million for the year ended  December 31, 2023, compared with -€707 million one year  previously. This decrease in the Group cost of net financial debt is  mainly due to an increase in income from cash and cash  equivalents and liquid assets following the rise in interests rates. The Group’s financing rate (excluding IFRS 16 impacts) was  therefore 3.68% at December 31, 2023, compared with 3.87% at  December 31, 2022 (3.59% vs. 3.70% including IFRS 16 impacts). Other current financial income and expenses total -€350 million  for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared with -€386 million  for the year ended December 31, 2022. The change in foreign  exchange gains and losses and fair value adjustments is mainly  due to the decrease in the inflation impact of the debt of the  subsidiary in Chile.  The “Other current financial income and expenses” item comprises  the unwinding of discounts on provisions, interest on concession  liabilities and interest on IFRS16 lease debt.  ■Non-current net financial income and expenses total -€12 million  and mainly comprise impairment of shareholder loans in Northern  Europe of -€44 million and costs relating to the legal restructuring  in Canada of -€32 million, as well as interest paid in respect of a  dispute in Lithuania of -€17 million, offset by the impact of the  remeasurement of financial liabilities for €78 million.  Non-current net financial income and expenses for the year ended  December 31, 2022 mainly consisted of the capital gain realized on  the sale of certain Hazardous waste activities in France as part of the  Suez acquisition remedies required by the European Commission. 5.2.4.3  Current income tax expense The current income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 is -€599 million, compared with -€514 million for the year ended  December 31, 2022.

Operating cash flow before changes in working capital, as presented  in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, is comprised of three  components: operating cash flow from operating activities (referred to  as “adjusted operating cash flow” and known in French as “capacité  d’autofinancement opérationnelle”) consisting of operating income  and expenses received and paid (“cash”), operating cash flow from  financing activities including cash financial items relating to other  financial income and expenses and operating cash flow from  discontinued operations composed of cash operating and financial  income and expense items classified in net income from discontinued  operations pursuant to IFRS 5. Adjusted operating cash flow does not  include the share of net income attributable to equity-accounted  entities. Net income (loss) from discontinued operations is the total of income  and expenses, net of tax, related to businesses divested or in the  course of divestiture, in accordance with IFRS 5. .  5.5.2.2  Non-Strictly accounting indicators (non GAAP) The expression “change at constant exchange rates” represents the  change resulting from the application of exchange rates of the prior  period to the current period, all other things being equal. EBITDA comprises the sum of all operating income and expenses  received and paid (excluding restructuring charges, non-current  working capital impairments, renewal expenses and share acquisition  and disposal costs) and principal payments on operating financial  assets.  The EBITDA margin is defined as the ratio of EBITDA to revenue.  To calculate Current EBIT (which includes the share of current net  income of joint ventures and associates), the following items are  deducted from Operating income:   ■impairment of goodwill of controlled subsidiaries and equity- accounted entities; ■restructuring charges; ■non-current provisions and impairment; ■non-current and/or significant impairment of non-current assets  (property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and operating  financial assets); ■depreciation of assets remeasured in the context of the Suez  purchase price allocation;  ■share acquisition costs. The current cost of net financial debt is equal to the cost of net  financial debt excluding amortization of the debt remeasured in the  context of the Suez purchase price allocation.  To calculate Current net income, Group share, the following items are  deducted from Net income, Group share:  ■non-current items of net income; ■amortization of assets remeasured in the context of the Suez  purchase price allocation, net of tax and non-controlling interests; ■amortization of the debt remeasured in the context of the Suez  purchase price allocation, net of tax and non-controlling interests. Current net income, Group share, per share is defined as the ratio of  Current net income, Group share (not restated for the cost of the  coupon attributable to hybrid debt holders) by the weighted average  number of outstanding shares during the year. Net industrial investments, as presented in the statement of changes  in net financial debt, include industrial investments (purchases of  intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, and operating  financial assets), net of industrial asset divestitures. The Group identifies three categories of investment: ■maintenance investments which reflect the replacement of  equipment and installations used by the Group; ■growth investments which include investments in new equipment  and installations embedded in existing contracts or in line with  contractual requirements; ■discretionary growth investments which reflect investments in  new equipment and installations linked to new projects, contract  wins or significant new developments and extensions to existing  projects or contracts. The last two categories are defined as growth investments. Net financial investments as presented in the statement of changes in  net financial debt include financial investments, net of financial  divestitures.  Financial investments include purchases of financial assets, including  the net financial debt of companies entering the scope of  consolidation, and partial purchases resulting from transactions with  shareholders where there is no change in control.  Financial divestitures include disposals of financial assets including  the net financial debt of companies leaving the scope of consolidation,  and partial divestitures resulting from transactions with shareholders  where there is no change in control, as well as issues of share capital  by non-controlling interests. Net free cash flow corresponds to free cash flow from continuing  operations, and is equal to the sum of EBITDA, dividends received,  changes in operating working capital and operating cash flow from  financing activities, less net interest expenses, net industrial  investments, taxes paid, renewal expenses, restructuring charges and  other non-current expenses. Net financial debt (NFD) represents gross financial debt (non-current  borrowings, current borrowings, bank overdrafts and other cash  position items) which includes IFRS 16 lease debt, net of cash and cash  equivalents, liquid assets and financing-related assets, including fair  value adjustments to derivatives hedging debt. Liquid assets are  financial assets composed of funds or securities with an initial  maturity of more than three months, easily convertible into cash, and  managed with respect to a liquidity objective while maintaining a low  capital risk.  Net financial debt excludes the net impact of the  OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW  Appendices VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 347  ===== PAGE 350 ===== remeasurement of debt in the context of the Suez purchase price  allocation.  The leverage ratio is the ratio of closing net financial debt including  IFRS 16 to EBITDA including IFRS 16.  The financing rate is defined as the ratio of the cost of net financial  debt (excluding IFRS  16 lease debt and fair value adjustments to  instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting) to average monthly  net financial debt excluding IFRS 16 lease debt for the period, including  the cost of net financial debt of discontinued operations. The post-tax return on capital employed (ROCE) is defined as the ratio of:  ■current EBIT as defined above, including the share of net income or  loss of equity-accounted entities, after tax. It is calculated by  subtracting the current tax expense from current EBIT, including  the share of net income or loss of equity-accounted entities. The  current tax expense is the tax expense in the income statement re- presented for tax effects on non-current items and tax effects of  the depreciation of assets remeasured in the context of the Suez  purchase price allocation; to ■average capital employed in the year, including operating financial  assets and investments in joint ventures and associates. Capital  employed used in the post-tax ROCE calculation is therefore equal  to the sum of net intangible assets and property, plant and  equipment, goodwill net of impairment, investments in joint  ventures and associates, operating financial assets, net operating  and non-operating working capital requirements and net  derivative instruments less provisions. It also includes the capital  employed of activities classified within assets and liabilities held  for sale, excluding discontinued operations.

The consolidated financial statements are presented on a historical  cost basis, with the exception of assets and liabilities held for sale  measured in accordance with IFRS  5 and assets and liabilities  recognized at fair value: derivatives, financial instruments held for  trading, financial instruments at fair value (in accordance with IFRS 9). The Veolia Environnement consolidated financial statements for the  year ended December 31, 2023 were adopted by the Board of Directors  on February 28, 2024 and will be presented for approval at the General  Shareholders’ Meeting on April 25, 2024. 1.2  Accounting standards  framework Pursuant to Regulation no. 1606/2002 of July 19, 2002, as amended by  European Regulation no. 297/2008 of March 11, 2008, the consolidated  financial statements are presented in accordance with IFRS  (International Financial Reporting Standards) as adopted by the  European Union. In the absence of IFRS standards or interpretations and in accordance  with IAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and  Errors, Veolia refers to other IFRS dealing with similar or related issues  and the conceptual framework. The consolidated financial statements are presented in millions of  euros, unless stated otherwise. Amounts are in millions of euros  rounded to the nearest whole number, unless stated otherwise in the  notes. Accordingly, the sum of rounded amounts may present non- material differences with total figures. The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial  statements of Veolia Environnement, the entities it controls (its  subsidiaries) and the entities equity accounted. The financial  statements of subsidiaries are drawn up for the same reference period  as those of the parent company, from January 1, to December 31, 2023,  in accordance with uniform accounting policies and methods. The accounting principles and valuation rules applied by the Group in  preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year ended  December 31, 2023 comprise those applied by the Group as of  December 31, 2022 and the standards, standard amendments and  interpretations adopted or in the course of adoption by the European  Union as of December 31, 2023: ■applicable from fiscal year 2023; or ■that the Group has elected to apply early as permitted by these  texts. Texts applicable as of January 1, 2023: ■ IFRS 17 and “Insurance contract” amendments ■Other amendments to the following standards: • IAS 1: disclosure of accounting policies; • IAS 8: definition of accounting estimates; • IAS 12: deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from  a single transaction; • IAS 12: temporary exemption to the recognition of deferred tax  resulting from the implementation of OECD Pillar Two rules and  related disclosures. The first-time application of these texts did not have a material  impact for the Group. Texts applicable after 2023: ■ Other amendments to the following standards: • IAS 1: classification of liabilities as current or non-current; • IAS 7: information on supplier financing agreements; • IAS 21: lack of exchangeability; • IFRS 16: lease liability in a sale and leaseback. The Group is currently assessing the potential impact of the first-time  application of these texts. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 359  ===== PAGE 362 ===== 1.3  Translation of foreign  subsidiaries’ financial  statements 1.3.1  Exchange rates Statements of financial position, income statements and cash flow  statements of subsidiaries whose functional currency is different from  the presentation currency of the Group are translated into the  presentation currency at the applicable rate of exchange (i.e. the year- end rate for statement of financial position items and the average  annual rate for income statement and cash flow items). Foreign exchange translation gains and losses are recorded in other  comprehensive income in equity. The exchange rates of the major  currencies of non-euro countries used in the preparation of the  consolidated financial statements were as follows: Period-end exchange rate (one foreign currency unit = €xx) December 31,  2022 December 31,  2023 US dollar 0.9376  0.9050  Pound sterling 1.1275  1.1506  Chinese renminbi  0.1359  0.1274  Australian dollar 0.6372  0.6149  Polish zloty 0.2136  0.2304  Hungarian forint 0.0025  0.0026  Argentinian peso 0.0053  0.0011  Mexican peso 0.0479  0.0534  Brazilian real 0.1773  0.1865  Czech koruna 0.0415  0.0404  Average exchange rate (one foreign currency unit = €xx) 2022 2023 US dollar 0.9487  0.9248  Pound sterling 1.1729  1.1495  Chinese renminbi  0.1413  0.1306  Australian dollar 0.6593  0.6141  Polish zloty 0.2135  0.2201  Hungarian forint 0.0026  0.0026  Argentinian peso 0.0053  0.0011  Mexican peso 0.0472  0.0521  Brazilian real 0.1838  0.1851  Czech koruna 0.0407  0.0417  1.3.2  Hyperinflation The market consensus is that Argentina is a hyperinflationary economy for all the periods presented. The Group has therefore applied the  provisions of IAS 29 since January 1, 2018 for its businesses in Argentina. 1.4  Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated into euro at the exchange  rate prevailing at the transaction date. At the year end, foreign  currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured  at year-end exchange rates. The resulting foreign exchange gains and  losses are recorded in net income for the period. Loans to a foreign subsidiary, the settlement of which is neither  planned nor probable in the foreseeable future represent, in  substance, a portion of the Group’s net investment in this foreign  operation. Foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary items  forming part of a net investment are recognized directly in other  comprehensive income in foreign exchange translation adjustments  and are released to net income on the disposal of the net investment. Exchange gains and losses on foreign currency-denominated  borrowings or on currency derivatives that qualify as hedges of a net  investment in a foreign operation, are recognized directly in other  comprehensive income as foreign exchange translation adjustments.  Amounts recognized in other comprehensive income are released to  income on the date of disposal of the relevant investment. Foreign currency-denominated non-monetary assets and liabilities  recognized at historical cost are translated using the exchange rate  prevailing as of the transaction date. Foreign currency-denominated  non-monetary assets and liabilities recognized at fair value are  translated using the exchange rate prevailing as of the date the fair  value is determined. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements 360 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 363 ===== Note 2 USE OF MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES IN THE APPLICATION  OF GROUP ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Veolia may be required to make estimates and assumptions that  affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and  expenses, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  Future results may be different from these estimates. Underlying estimates and assumptions are determined based on past  experience and other factors considered as reasonable given the  circumstances. They act as a basis for making judgments necessary to  the determination of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities,  which cannot be obtained directly from other sources. Future values  could differ from these estimates. All these estimates are based on organized procedures for the  collection of forecast information on future flows, validated by  operating management, and on expected market data based on  external indicators and used in accordance with consistent and  documented methodologies. The underlying estimates and assumptions are reviewed on a ongoing  basis by the Group. The impact of changes in accounting estimates is  recognized in the period the change is made if it affects this period  only and in the period the change is made and prior periods if they are  also affected by the change. This is notably the case for impairment testing of assets with an  indefinite useful life (goodwill). Note 7 presents the methodology and  main assumptions used in preparing the financial statements for the  year ended December 31, 2023 and particularly future flow and  discount rate assumptions underlying the recoverable amount of  these assets. The Group considered in particular the macroeconomic  environment, especially for raw materials. Sensitivity analyses were  also performed on the goodwill CGUs and certain of them are  presented in the aforementioned note.  The items that generally require Management to make estimates or  exercise judgment are as follows: ■classification and measurement of assets and liabilities covered by  IFRS 5: assessments leading to the application of the standard are  reviewed at each reporting date with regard to changes in facts  and circumstances (See Note 3);  ■measurement of intangible assets and property, plant and  equipment (see Notes 7.2 and 7.3); ■measurement  of  provisions  (including  for  employee  commitments), as well as contingent assets and liabilities (Notes 6,  10 and 12); ■fair value measurement of financial instruments (Note 8.3); ■the amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the tax  expense recognized (Note 11); ■methods used for determining the value of identifiable assets  acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations. The Group uses several discount rate calculation methodologies for  the purposes of these estimates. They are detailed in Notes 6, 7 and 10. In addition, given its activities in installations covered by the EU  Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), the Group paid close attention to  its exposure to greenhouse gas emission allowances.  Management policy, accounting treatment and issues are presented in  Note 8.3.1.3. Finally, Veolia must make assumptions and judgments when  assessing the level of control exercised over certain investments and  particularly when defining relevant activities and identifying  substantive rights. These judgments are reassessed when the facts  and circumstances change. Climate risk In the context of its Purpose and the Green Up  strategic program,  Veolia has committed to fighting pollution and accelerating ecological  transition (see Chapter  4, Section  4.2.4.2.2 below). This commitment  can be broken down into several objectives, including combating  climate change.  In addition, the Group’s activities and those of its customers, due to  their nature and geographic locations, may be exposed to risks related  to climate change, which are likely to increase the frequency and  magnitude of natural disasters. The Group has integrated the identification of the main climate risks   into its accounts closing process, to assess their potential impacts on  the financial statements and, in particular, on: ■the useful life of certain assets;  ■the value of certain non-current assets, particularly through cash  flow estimates incorporating, where appropriate, decarbonizing  plans validated by the governance bodies;  ■risk estimates to determine the amount of contingency provisions. These procedures are performed jointly with the Risk Department and  the Sustainable Development Department to ensure the consistency  of commitments given by the Group and their inclusion in the  financial statements.  The main risks identified concern:  ■risks related to the physical impacts of climate change (so-called  “physical risks”):  • increased frequency and severity of extreme events such as  floods, droughts, etc. and • long-term shifts in mean (or “chronic”) climate conditions, that  may cause sea levels to rise, higher average temperatures,  modified seasonal rain patterns, chronic water stress, etc. ■risks related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy (so-called  “transition risks”) of various types: regulatory, technological,  market, reputation. These risks may also generate significant  commercial opportunities for the Group. Through the Group’s climate policy, actions taken and the geographic  spread of its operations, Veolia limits the impacts of the risk of natural  disaster and the physical impacts of climate change on its results,  primarily through (i)  the choice of a site’s location in order to limit  exposure, (ii)  the implementation of tailored prevention plans and  (iii) the development of business continuity plans.  In addition, the residual risk of extreme weather events is usually  transferred to insurance companies via the damage program.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 361  ===== PAGE 364 ===== With regard to transition risks, the Group is particularly exposed to the  Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) introduced by the European Union  in 2005, due to the quantity of free allowances granted and the cost of  carbon on this market.  To manage this exposure, Veolia was very quick to adopt an active  strategy in order to manage its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and  allowances, by implementing an appropriate structure and creating a  special-purpose legal entity to purchase, sell and price different types  of greenhouse gas allowances. In addition, the Group also undertook  to (i) reduce its GHG emissions, and (ii) increase GHG emissions  avoided thanks to its activities, particularly by allocating a significant  share of its investment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Finally, the Group investment validation process includes a review of  the consistency of investments with the objectives set out in its  Purpose. At the COP 28 in Dubai, Veolia reaffirmed its commitment to  invest €1.6 billion by 2030 to phase out coal in Europe, by converting  coal-based power generation assets to less carbon-intensive energies  and local energies in particular. At the end of 2023, Veolia had already  invested €529 million to this end. This commitment is also taken into  account when drafting the long-term plans used in the impairment  testing of assets with an indefinite useful life (goodwill). Veolia considers the assessment of climate risks to be consistent with  the commitments given by the Group. The inclusion of climate risks  did not have a material impact on the financial statements of the  Group in 2023.  Note 3 CONSOLIDATION SCOPE 3.1  Accounting principles relating to the consolidation scope 3.1.1  Consolidation principles Consolidated entities Veolia Environnement fully consolidates all entities over which it  exercises control. Definition of control Control exists when the Group (i)  holds power over an entity, (ii)  is  exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with  the entity and (iii) has the ability to use its power over the entity to  effect the amount of its returns. The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an entity if facts and  circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the  elements of control. Full consolidation The Group consolidates a subsidiary in its consolidated financial  statements from the date it obtains control of the entity to the date it  ceases to control the entity. Interests that are not directly or indirectly attributable to the Group  are recorded in non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to owners of  the Company and to non-controlling interests, even if this results in  non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. Change in ownership interests in consolidated  subsidiaries Changes in the Group’s ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not  result in a change in control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as  equity transactions, as they are transactions performed by  shareholders acting in this capacity. The effects of these transactions are recognized in equity at their net- of-tax amount and do not therefore impact the Consolidated Income  Statement of the Group. These transactions are presented in financing activities in the  Consolidated Cash Flow Statement. Investments in joint ventures and associates Definition An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant  influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the  financial and operating policy decisions of the entity but is not control  or joint control of those policies. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have  joint control of the entity have rights to its net assets. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an  arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant  activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing  control. Accounting for joint ventures and associates The results and assets and liabilities of associates or joint ventures are  incorporated in the Group consolidated financial statements using the  equity method of accounting, except when the investment is classified  as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with  the provisions of IFRS  5, Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and  Discontinued Operations. Under the equity method, the investment in the associate or joint  venture is initially recognized at acquisition cost and subsequently  adjusted, notably to recognize the Group’s share of the net income  and other comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture. When a Group entity transacts with an associate or joint venture of  the Group, profits and losses resulting from the transaction with the  associate or joint venture are recognized in the Group consolidated  financial statements only to the extent of interests in the associate or  joint venture. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements 362 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 365 ===== The share of net income (loss) of equity-accounted entities is included  in the Group Consolidated Income Statement. Pursuant to  recommendation no. 2013-01 issued by the French Accounting  Standards Authority (Autorité des Normes Comptables, ANC) on  April  4, 2013, the share of net income (loss) of equity-accounted  entities must be included in “Operating income after share of net  income (loss) of equity-accounted entities” or presented in a separate  line “Share of net income (loss) of other equity-accounted entities”  depending on whether the activities of such entities represent an  extension of the Group’s businesses. Impairment tests When necessary, the carrying amount of the investment in associates  or joint-ventures (including goodwill) is tested for impairment in  accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of Assets. Loss of significant influence or joint control The equity method is discontinued from the date the investment  ceases to be an associate or a joint venture. Where the Group retains a  residual interest in the entity and that interest is a financial asset, the  financial asset is measured at fair value at the date the investment  ceases to be an associate or a joint venture. Where an investment in an associate becomes an investment in a joint  venture, or vice versa, the equity method continues to be applied and  the change in ownership interest does not trigger remeasurement to  fair value. Investments in joint operations Definition A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have  joint control of the arrangement have direct rights to the assets, and  obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Accounting for joint operations As a joint operator in a joint operation, the Group recognizes in  relation to its interest in the joint operation: ■its assets, including its share of any assets held jointly; ■its liabilities, including its share of any liabilities incurred jointly; ■its revenue from the sale of its share of the output arising from the  joint operation; ■its expenses, including its share of any expenses incurred jointly. 3.1.2  Transactions impacting  the consolidation scope Business combinations and goodwill Business combinations are recorded in accordance with the  acquisition method as defined in IFRS 3, revised. Under this method, identifiable assets acquired and liabilities  assumed of the acquiree are recorded at fair value at the acquisition  date. The goodwill arising from the business combination is measured as  the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the  amount of any non-controlling interest and, where applicable, the fair  value of any previously held interest, over the acquisition-date net  amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and  contingent liabilities assumed. This goodwill is measured in the functional currency of the company  acquired and recognized in assets in the Consolidated Statement of  Financial Position. The Group may elect, on an individual transaction basis, at the  acquisition date, to measure non-controlling interests either at fair  value (full goodwill) or at the share in the fair value of the identifiable  net assets of the company acquired (partial goodwill). Pursuant to IFRS, goodwill is not amortized but is subject to  impairment tests performed at least annually or, where appropriate,  more frequently where there is evidence calling into question the net  carrying amount recorded in assets in the Statement of Financial  Position. Where the terms and conditions of a business combination are  advantageous, negative goodwill arises. The corresponding profit is  recognized in net income at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed in the period in which the costs  are incurred and the services received. Pursuant to the provisions of IFRS 3 revised, the Group may finalize the  recognition of the business combination during the measurement  period. This period ends when all the necessary information has been  obtained and no later than one year after the acquisition date. Assets/liabilities classified as held for sale,  discontinued operations IFRS 5, Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations,  sets out the accounting treatment applicable to assets held for sale  and presentation and disclosure requirements for discontinued  operations. The standard notably requires the separate presentation of assets held  for sale in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at the  lower of net carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, where  the criteria set-out in the standard are satisfied. When the Group is committed to a sales process leading to the loss of  control of a subsidiary, all assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are  reclassified as held for sale where the standard classification criteria  are met, irrespective of whether the Group retains a residual interest  in the entity after sale. In addition, the standard requires the separate presentation in the  Consolidated Income Statement of the results of discontinued  operations for all comparative periods on a retrospective basis. A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that either has  been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and : ■represents a separate major line of business or geographic area of  operations; ■is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major  line of business or major geographic area of operations; or ■is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 363  ===== PAGE 366 ===== 3.2  Main changes in Group structure Entry into consolidation scope Consolidation of Lydec (Morocco) On January 1, 2023, the local authorizations needed for the transfer of  the Lydec securities to New Suez could not be obtained, rendering the  sale provided for in the Share and Asset Purchase Agreement (SAPA)  null and void. The Lydec securities are therefore no longer classified  under IFRS 5 from January 1, 2023. At the same time there were a number of changes to Lydec’s  governance, with the resignation of the Suez (Consortium)  representatives, effective January 25, 2023. Pursuant to IFRS, this event  and the rights and obligations under the Moroccan hold separate  status led to the consolidation of Lydec’s contribution from this date. On June 15, 2023, the Moroccan Competition Authorities notified the  Company of its grievances regarding, in particular, the aborted sale of  its stake to New Suez initially provided for in the Share and Asset  Purchase Agreement (SAPA). The Group addressed its written  observations in response to the Moroccan Competition Authorities on  July 18, 2023. On November 13, 2023, the Moroccan Competition Authorities  accepted Veolia’s request for a settlement procedure. This involves in  particular proposing a solution to the Authorities satisfying its  competition concerns before January 15, 2024. In this context, the Group is actively continuing its discussions with  the  Competition Authorities and the Delegating Authority to examine  various possible arrangements. The January 15 deadline was extended  to allow the parties to find a satisfactory solution. The analyses conducted by the Group and its advisors of the various  decisions issued do not call into question the analysis of control  pursuant to IFRS of Lydec by Veolia as of December 31, 2023.  Accordingly, pursuant to IFRS 3, the purchase price allocation process  was finalized during the period resulting primarily in the recognition  of an intangible asset in respect of the concession arrangement  operated by Lydec in Casablanca. Acquisitions Acquisition of the subsidiaries Reciclados La Red and  Banales III (Spain) On January 10, 2023, the Group acquired the subsidiaries Reciclados La  Red S.LL and Banales III located in Madrid and Seville, respectively, for  a total of €54 million.

Note 4 REPORTING BY OPERATING SEGMENT The operating segments are components of the Group that engage in  activities and whose operating results are reviewed by the Chief  Executive Officer (Chief Operating Decision Maker) to make decisions  about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its  performance. Information presented to the Chief Operating Decision  Maker is taken from the Group internal reporting system. Financial information by operating segment is prepared in accordance  with the same rules used to prepare the Consolidated Financial  Statements. In 2022, the Group reviewed its governance and management  structure due to the integration of the Suez scope and the separation  of the duties of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief  Executive Officer. This led to a managerial system based on eight  resized geographic zones. In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 8 on the identification of  operating segments and after taking account of regrouping criteria,  the operating segments presented are the following:  ■France and Special Waste Europe; ■Europe excluding France; ■Rest of the world; ■Water technologies, which groups together global water treatment  activities: Veolia Water Technologies and Water Technologies &  Solutions (WTS); ■Other, including Holding companies. The EBITDA indicator comprises the sum of all operating income and  expenses received and paid (excluding restructuring costs, non- current impairment losses, renewal expenses and share acquisition  and disposal costs) and principal payments on operating financial  assets. The main financial indicators by operating segment are as follows: 2023 (€ million)  France &  special waste  Europe Europe  excluding  France Rest of the  World Water  technologies  Other Total consolidated  financial statements Revenue 9,726  19,000  11,907  4,707  12  45,351  EBITDA 1,338  2,599  1,925  534  148  6,543  Operating income after share of net  income (loss) of equity-accounted entities 359  1,389  811  306  -18  2,847  Industrial investments net of subsidies -553  -1,201  -1,171  -162  -53  -3,140  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements 366 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 369 ===== 2022 (€ million)  France &  special waste  Europe Europe  excluding  France Rest of the  World Water  technologies  Other (*) Total consolidated  financial statements Revenue 9,666  17,850  11,196  4,561  -388  42,885  EBITDA 1,418  2,373  1,831  496  78  6,196  Operating income after share of net  income (loss) of equity-accounted entities 445  1,075  770  323  -280  2,333  Industrial investments net of subsidies -507  -966  -1,164  -179  33  -2,784  (*) Includes the restatement of the first 17 days in January of the contribution of Suez activities (pre-acquisition) in the amount of - €400 million in revenue, -€49 million in EBITDA and  -€11 million in operating income.

■waste: waste collection, product recovery and waste-to-energy  processing (including the sale of recycled products), dismantling  and hazardous waste processing; ■energy: heating and cooling networks, thermal and multi-technical  services, industrial utilities, installation and maintenance of  production  equipment,  and  integrated  services  for  the  comprehensive management of buildings. Environmental services also include the design, construction and,  where applicable, funding of necessary facilities to supply such  services which are provided to industrial and service sector companies,  public authorities and private individuals. The range of business models used by the Group results in a variety of  contractual forms specific to each business and adapted to local  jurisdiction constraints and the nature and needs of customers (public  or private). The Group primarily conducts its activities under concession,  construction (non-concession), lease and operation and maintenance  contracts. Concession arrangements (IFRIC 12) In the conduct of its activities, Veolia provides collective general  interest services (distribution of drinking water and heating,  household waste collection and/or processing, etc.). These services are  generally managed by Veolia under contracts entered into at the  request of public sector bodies, which retain control over these  collective services. Concession arrangements involve the transfer of operating rights for a  limited period, under the control of the local authority, using  dedicated facilities built by Veolia, or made available to it for or  without consideration: ■these contracts define “public service obligations” in return for  remuneration. The remuneration is based on operating conditions,  continuity of service, price rules and obligations with respect to the  maintenance/replacement  of  installations.  The  contract  determines the conditions for the transfer of installations to the  local authority or a successor at its term; ■Veolia can, in certain cases, be responsible for a given service as it  holds the service support network (water/heat distribution  network, wastewater treatment network). Such situations are the  result of full or partial privatizations. Provisions impose public  service obligations and the means by which the local authority may  recover control of the concession holder. These contracts generally include price review clauses. These clauses  are mainly based on cost trends, inflation, changes in tax and/or other  legislation and occasionally on changes in volumes and/or the  occurrence of specific events changing the profitability of the contract. In addition, the Group generally assumes a contractual obligation to  maintain and repair facilities managed under public service contracts. The nature and extent of the Group’s rights and obligations under  these different contracts differ according to the public services  rendered by the different Group businesses: Water, Waste, Energy. Water In France, these services are primarily rendered under public service  delegation “affermage” contracts with a term of 8 to 20 years. They  can use specific assets, such as distribution or wastewater treatment  networks and drinking water or wastewater treatment plants, which  are generally provided by the concession grantor and returned to it at  the end of the contract. Abroad, Veolia renders its services under contracts which reflect local  legislation, the economic situation of the country and the investment  needs of each partner. These contracts generally have a term of  between 7 and 40 years. Contracts can also be entered into with public  entities in which Veolia purchased an interest on their partial  privatization. The profitability of these contracts is not fundamentally  different from other contracts, but operations are based on a  partnership agreement with the local authority. Waste Both in France and abroad, the main concession arrangements entered  into by Veolia concern the processing and recovery of waste in sorting  units, landfills and incineration plants. These contracts have an  average term of 10 to 30 years. Energy The main contracts concern the management of heating and air- conditioning networks under urban concessions or on behalf of local  authorities. In Eastern Europe, Veolia provides services under mixed partial  privatizations or through public-private partnerships with public  authorities responsible for the production and distribution of thermal  energy. The characteristics of these contracts vary significantly depending on  the country and activities concerned. Financial asset model The Group applies the financial asset model for the accounting  recognition of these concession arrangements, independently of  service or infrastructure use by customers, when the concession  grantor contractually guarantees the payment of amounts specified or  determined in the contract or the shortfall, if any, between amounts  received from users of the public service and amounts specified or  determined in the contract. Financial assets resulting from the application of IFRIC 12 are recorded  in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position under the heading  “Operating financial assets” and recognized at amortized cost. Unless otherwise indicated in the contract, the effective interest rate  (EIR) is equal to the weighted average cost of capital of the entities  carrying the assets concerned. Cash flows relating to these operating financial assets are included in  Net cash from (used in) investing activities in the Consolidated Cash  Flow Statement. Pursuant to IFRS  9, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying  amount of these assets exceeds the present value of future cash flows  discounted at the initial EIR. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 369  ===== PAGE 372 ===== Revenue associated with this financial model includes: ■revenue recorded on a completion basis, in the case of construction  operating financial assets (in accordance with IFRS 15); ■the remuneration of the operating financial asset recorded in  revenue from operating financial assets (excluding principal  payments); ■service remuneration. Intangible asset model The intangible asset model applies when the Group is paid by users or  when the concession grantor has not provided a contractual  guarantee in respect of the recoverable amount, regardless of service  or infrastructure use by customers. The intangible asset corresponds  to the right granted by the concession grantor to the operator to  charge users of the public service in remuneration of concession  services provided by the operator under the concession arrangement. Intangible assets resulting from the application of IFRIC  12 are  recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position under  the heading “Concession intangible assets”, as described in Note 7.2.1,  and generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the  agreement. Cash outflows, that is disbursements, relating to the construction of  infrastructures under concession arrangements accounted using the  “intangible asset model” are presented in Net cash from (used in)  investing activities in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, while  cash inflows are presented in Net cash from operating activities. Under the intangible asset model, revenue includes: ■revenue recorded on a completion basis for assets and  infrastructure under construction (in accordance with IFRS 15); ■service remuneration. Mixed or bifurcation model The choice of the financial asset or intangible asset model depends on  the existence, or not, of payment guarantees granted by the  concession grantor, independently of service or infrastructure use by  customers. However, certain contracts may include a payment commitment on  the part of the concession grantor covering only part of the  investment, with the remaining balance covered by the remuneration  from services charged to users. Where this is the case, the investment amount guaranteed by the  concession grantor is recognized under the financial asset model and  the residual balance is recognized under the intangible asset model. Recognition of concession arrangements where  existing infrastructures are made available to the  Group by the concession authority in return for  payment of fees On  the  signature  of  certain  concession  arrangements,  the  infrastructures necessary to the operation of the concession already  exist and are owned by the delegating authority. In such cases, the  infrastructures are generally made available to the concession holder  for the term of the concession arrangement in return for payments to  the delegating authority for the right to use these infrastructures  under the concession. In July  2016, the IFRS  Interpretations Committee clarified the  appropriate accounting treatment when the concession holder is  required to make fixed payments to the delegating authority for the  provision of pre-existing infrastructure. These fixed payments give rise to: ■the recognition of a liability equal to the present value of payments  over the term of the concession arrangement; ■offset by the recognition of an intangible asset, where the  concession arrangement is recognized using the intangible asset  model, representing the right to charge users of the public service. Payments satisfying this definition within the Group mainly concern  concession arrangements recognized using the intangible asset model  in Central Europe. Public sector activities performed using  Veolia-owned infrastructure Veolia provides drinking water and/or wastewater systems and  heating network (production and/or distribution) public services in  certain jurisdictions where it owns production and/or distribution  assets. The tariffs charged to users by the Group are governed by the  competent authorities in accordance with methods specific to each  geography. This is particularly the case:  ■in the United States and Chile, in the water and wastewater  management sector where activities are highly capital intensive, a  factor incorporated into the remuneration mechanism granted to  the operator; ■in countries in Central and Eastern Europe, where Veolia is  responsible for the production and/or distribution of thermal  energy (heating networks) following full or partial privatizations,  but remains subject to local authority control when determining  heating tariffs.  Revenue from these activities is recognized progressively, as the  services are performed.  Construction contracts A construction contract is a contract specifically negotiated for the  construction of an asset or a combination of assets (complex sections  of installations, equipment) that are closely interrelated or  interdependent in terms of their design, technology and function or  their ultimate purpose. This type of contract is often used for design and build contracts for  infrastructure necessary for water treatment/distribution and  wastewater treatment activities. These contracts are entered into with  local authorities or private partners for the construction of  infrastructures. They are generally fixed-price contracts. The Group’s construction revenues are mainly recognized on a  completion basis. The percentage of completion is determined by comparing costs  incurred at the period end with total estimated costs under the  contract. Costs incurred comprise costs directly attributable to the  contract and borrowing costs incurred up to completion of the work.  However, prospection costs, costs incurred prior to contract signature,  and administrative and selling costs are expensed in the period  incurred and do not therefore contribute to contract completion. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements 370 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 373 ===== Where total contract costs exceed total contract revenue, the Group  recognizes a loss to completion as an expense of the period,  irrespective of the stage of completion and based on a best estimate  of forecast results including, where appropriate, rights to additional  income or compensation, where they are highly probable and can be  determined reliably. Provisions for losses to completion are recorded  as liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The amount of revenue recognized on a completion basis less  intermediary billings is determined on an individual contract basis.  Where positive, this amount is recognized in assets in “Amounts due  from customers for construction contract work” (in “Other operating  receivables” as a contract asset). Where negative, it is recognized in  liabilities in “Amounts due to customers for construction contract  work” (in “Other operating payables” as a contract liability). Any loss  to completion is recognized immediately through a provision. Partial payments received under construction contracts before the  corresponding work has been performed, are recognized as liabilities  in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position under “Other  operating payables”. Service contracts including a lease These contracts generally concern outsourcing services performed for  industrial/private customers either under BOT (Build, Operate and  Transfer) contracts, or incineration or cogeneration contracts under  which, notably, demand or volume risk is, in substance, transferred to  the prime contractor. Services include the design, construction and financing of the  construction of a specific asset/installation on behalf of the customer  and the operation of the asset concerned. These contracts are recognized in accordance with the principles set  out in IFRS 16 (see Note 5.4). Accordingly, construction revenue is recognized in accordance with  the percentage of completion method and, more generally, the  principles set out in IFRS 15. The service invoiced to the customer includes a component  representing the operation of the specific asset/installation concerned  and a second component representing the financing of the  construction. ■revenue relating to the operation of the asset is recognized on  delivery of the goods or performance of the service, in accordance  with IFRS 15; ■the financing of construction work involves finance costs that are  invoiced to the customer and recognized in revenue. This interest is  recognized in revenue from the start of construction work and  represents remuneration received by the builder/lender. Operation and maintenance contracts The services rendered by Veolia do not systematically require the  construction or acquisition of new infrastructure and can be provided  through a variety of contractual forms tailored to the objectives and  choices of customers. These services may particularly take the form of  contracts for the operation and/or maintenance of installations  already owned by the customer or service contracts aimed at  improving the performance of these installations. Accordingly, Veolia operates waste-to-energy plants, water production  and/or distribution installations and heating networks under this type  of contract recognized in accordance with IFRS 15. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 371  ===== PAGE 374 ===== 5.1  Revenue Group revenue is recognized for the amount the Group expects to receive in consideration for the transfer of control of goods and services. The following table presents the revenue recognition method, rate and unit for the main environmental services provided by the Group: Environmental  service Contract Revenue Concession Public sector  activities  performed  using Veolia- owned  infrastructure Construction Services  including  an asset  lease Operation &  maintenance Revenue  recognition  method Revenue  recognition  rate Revenue  measurement  unit Waste processing,  water distribution,  network operation,  thermal services • • • • Progressively When the  customer  receives the  benefit of the  service m3 of water,  metric ton of  waste  processed, Gwh,  etc. Sale of equipment,  sale of recycled  products • • • • At a point in  time On physical  delivery of the  goods Quantity sold Design and build of  infrastructures • • • Progressively As the  customer  obtains control  of the asset  being built Completion  basis Infrastructure maintenance  and renewal services Installation maintenance and renewal services rarely represent a  separate  performance  obligation.  Nonetheless,  a  separate  performance obligation may be identified in respect of maintenance  services in concession arrangements recognized using the financial  asset model or operating contract, depending on the obligations  contained in the contracts and the related remuneration terms. Services on behalf of third parties Few of the Group’s activities are concerned by this provision and  primarily combined energy purchase and distribution services. For this type of contract, the Group identifies whether it is acting on  its own behalf (principal: recognition of gross revenue) or on behalf of  a third party (agent: recognition of the margin), by analyzing in  particular whether the Group has primary responsibility for  performance of the service and whether it can freely set the price paid  by the end customer. Variable compensation Variable consideration provided in contracts with customers can take  several forms: rebates, discounts, penalties, incentives, performance  bonuses. They are assessed on contract inception to determine the  revenue amount to be recognized, applying either the expected value  method or the most probable amount method. Revenue by business As for other Income Statement headings, revenue does not include  amounts relating to discontinued operations in accordance with  IFRS 5, Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.  The results of these activities are presented in a separate line, “Net  income (loss) from discontinued operations”, for fiscal year 2023 and  fiscal year 2022 presented for comparison purposes (see Note 3.3).

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 373  ===== PAGE 376 ===== As of December 31, 2023, other expenses mainly concern: ■integration costs incurred in connection with the Suez combination of -€100 million; ■provision of asset impairment, particularly in China (-€20 million); ■costs  of -€18 million (excluding interest but compensated by a provision release of 19 millions d'euros) following the final arbitration decision  issued by the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (“SCC”) in respect of the Lithuania dispute; ■costs relating to the Flint dispute in the United States, of -€22 million, following a settlement agreement reached between the parties at the  beginning of February 2024 (see Note 12). 5.2.1  Breakdown of provisions and impairment losses on non-current assets The carrying amount of non-financial assets, other than inventory and  deferred tax assets is reviewed at each period end in order to assess  the existence of any indication of loss in value (non-performance of a  significant long-term contract under the terms laid down in the  contract, technical operating issues, and counterparty default for  operating financial assets, etc.). Where such indication exists, the  recoverable amount of the asset or group of assets is estimated. The need to recognize impairment is assessed by comparing the net  carrying amount of these assets with their recoverable amount.  Unless there are future prospects for the sale of these assets, the  recoverable amount corresponds to their value in use, generally equal  to the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived  from the asset or group of assets, taking account of any residual value.  The value in use of these assets is determined based on assumptions  consistent with those adopted for impairment testing of goodwill and  other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life (see Note 7.1.2). Goodwill and other assets with an indefinite useful life are subject to  systematic annual impairment tests following the update of the long- term plan and more frequent tests where there is an indication of loss  in value. Where the resulting recoverable amount is less than the net carrying  amount of the asset or group of assets, an impairment is recorded. Impairment losses on non-current assets can be reversed, with the  exception of those relating to goodwill. Other expenses, impairment losses and charges to non-current  provisions in 2023 break down as follows: ■impairment losses on intangible assets, property, plant and  equipment and operating financial assets of -€135  million,  recognized particularly in the Europe excluding France segment for   -€63 million and the Rest of the world segment for -€62 million; ■other expenses and charges to non-current provisions of   -€162  million, recognized particularly in the Rest of the World  segment for -€57  million and the  Other segment for  -€77  million. Other expenses, impairment losses and charges to non-current  provisions in 2022 primarily comprise: ■impairment losses on intangible assets, property, plant and  equipment and operating financial assets of -€171  million,  recognized particularly in the Rest of the world segment for   -€138 million; ■other expenses and non-current provisions of -€273  million,  recognized particularly in the Other segment for -€127 million.

Summarized financial information (at 100%) in respect of the Chinese  concessions is set out below. This information reflects amounts  presented in the joint ventures’ financial statements prepared in  accordance with IFRS, adjusted to reflect fair value adjustments  performed on acquisition and adjustments recorded to comply with  Group accounting principles when applying the equity method.

The average rate used for the reconciliation of the different elements  takes into account the Group’s holdings in these different concessions,  weighted by the relative importance of each of the entities to the  whole. This rate is therefore adjusted each year and is sensitive to  variations in the weight of the contributions to the results of each of  the joint ventures within the presented set. The increase in the weighted average rate between 2022 and 2023 is  due to a change in the weightings of the contributions. Accordingly, the “Other adjustments” line in the reconciliation of the  summarized financial information on the Chinese concessions as a  whole, to their carrying amount in the Consolidated Statement of  Financial Position, represents the adjustment between the share in net  assets obtained by applying the weighted average percentage interest  for all Chinese concessions and the share in net assets recognized in  the financial statements, calculated using the effective interest held in  each of the Chinese concessions individually.

The long-term plans of the Chinese Water concessions were  extended to 2029, in order to identify standard flows for the  calculation of the terminal value, as Water activities in China follow a  specific business model, with extremely long contract terms (between  thirty and fifty years) and high investment flows during the initial  contract years. Given the models used and the time frame adopted, the recoverable  amounts are closely monitored. They are based on a certain number of  structuring operating assumptions such as price increases, volume  trends, construction activity levels and margins and efficiency and  productivity measures integrated in future cash flows, as well as on  the macro-economic assumptions (discount and inflation rates)  underlying the business plans. Other joint ventures The Group also holds interests in other joint ventures that are not  individually material, with a total net carrying amount of €181 million  as of December 31, 2023, including primarily €71 million in the Middle  East. Unrecognized share of losses of joint ventures As all the Group joint ventures are partnerships in which the Group  exercises joint control, the share of any losses is recognized in full at  the year end.  Transactions with joint ventures (related parties) The Group grants loans to joint ventures. These loans are recorded in  assets in the Group Consolidated Statement of Financial Position (see  Note 8.1.2. “Other non-current and current financial assets”). FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements 376 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 379 ===== As of December 31, 2023, non-current and current loans granted to all  these entities totaled €36  million, including €22  million recorded in  non-current loans (see Note 8.1.2.2) and €14 million recorded in current  loans. The change compared with December 31, 2022 is mainly due to  the impairment of shareholder loans of €44 million in Northern  Europe. As of December 31, 2022, non-current and current loans granted to all  these entities totaled €132 million, including €85 million recorded in  non-current loans and €47 million recorded in current loans.  In addition, given the Group’s activities, operating flows between  companies are generally limited to companies operating in the same  country. As such, the level of operating transactions between the  Group and equity-accounted companies is not material. However, certain contractual agreements in the Group’s businesses,  impose the existence of a holding company (generally equity- accounted) and companies carrying the operating agreement  (generally fully consolidated). 5.2.4.2  Investments in associates Movements in investments in associates in 2023 break down as follows: (€ million) December 31,  2022 Net  income Dividend  distribution Changes in  consolidation  scope Foreign  exchange  translation Other movements As of  December  31, 2023 Investments in associates 787  67  -115  -125  5  -15  603  Changes in consolidation scope mainly reflect the divestiture of Fovarosi CsatornazasiI Muvek Reszvenytar in Hungary (-€64 million) and the exit  from the consolidation scope of Siciliacque (for a total of -€60 million) following the divestiture of Italian water concessions.

In accordance with IAS  2 “Inventories”, inventories are stated at the  lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the  estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the  estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to  make the sale. Commercial receivables and payables are recognized at nominal value,  unless discounting at the market rate has a material impact. The  Group applies the simplified approach to the impairment of  commercial receivables, in accordance with the option available in  IFRS  9. The Group uses a provision matrix that takes account of the  business, geographic region and customer category in question.  When preparing this matrix, the Group considered late payment and  default rates observed in the past, as well as the macroeconomic  environment.  The matrix is also updated to reflect changes in  economic factors. Trade payables are recognized as liabilities at amortized cost in  accordance with IFRS  9 for accounting purposes. Short-term  commercial payables without a declared interest rate are recognized  at nominal value, unless discounting at the market rate has a material  impact. The Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights  to the cash flows from the asset expire or when it transfers the  contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset in a  transaction under which substantially all the risks and rewards  inherent to ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any  interest created or retained by the Group in a financial asset is  recognized separately as an asset or liability.

Factoring Under these programs, certain subsidiaries have agreed to assign, on a  renewable basis, trade receivables by contractual subrogation or  assignment of receivables (such as Dailly programs in France) without  recourse against the risk of default by the debtor. The analysis of the  risks and rewards as defined by IFRS 9 led the Group to derecognize  almost all the receivables assigned under these factoring programs. In  addition, the transferor subsidiaries remain, in certain cases,  responsible for invoicing and debt recovery, for which they receive  remuneration but do not retain control. Accordingly, receivables totaling €5,716  million were assigned under  these programs in 2023, compared with €5,760  million in 2022.  Receivables derecognized as of December 31, 2023 total €1,094 million,  compared with €1,142 million as of December 31, 2022. Reverse factoring Some group entities implemented reverse factoring programs,  allowing Group suppliers, by assigning their trade receivables, to  benefit from advance payments.  After analysis, as their characteristics  had not been substantially modified,  these liabilities have been  maintained as payables. The receivables assigned by suppliers under these reverse factoring  programs and presented as payables, total €260 million as of  December 2023. Discounting and assignment by way of security Under Public-Private partnerships, Veolia subsidiaries can assign the  fraction of future payments guaranteed by public authorities/private  customers (recognized in financial receivables pursuant to IFRIC 12 or  IFRS  16) to the bodies funding the project, through discounting or  assignment by way of security programs (such as Dailly programs in  France). For the majority of partnerships concerned by these financial  receivable assignments, the assignment agreements negotiated and  the contractual clauses agreed between the stakeholders are  sufficient to satisfy the derecognition criteria set out in IFRS  9. The  residual risk retained by the companies (considered immaterial) is  generally tied solely to late customer payment due to late/deferred  invoicing of services by Group subsidiaries. Group subsidiaries are  mandated by the financial institutions to manage the invoicing and  recovery of the receivables covered by these programs. Veolia  analyzed the management and recovery procedures falling to Group  subsidiaries and concluded that these services did not constitute  continuing involvement. 5.4  Non-current and current  operating financial assets Operating financial assets comprise financial assets resulting from the  application of IFRIC 12 on accounting for concession arrangements and  from the application of IFRS 16 on accounting for leases. Concession arrangements Pursuant to IFRIC 12, when the operator has an unconditional right to  receive cash or another financial asset from the grantor in  remuneration for concession services, the financial asset model  applies. In this context, the infrastructures managed under these  contracts cannot be recorded in assets of the operator as property,  plant and equipment, but are recorded as financial assets. Investment grants received in respect of concession arrangements are  generally definitively earned and, therefore, are not repayable. In  accordance with the option offered by IAS  20, these grants are  presented as a deduction from intangible assets or financial assets  depending on the applicable model following an analysis of each  concession arrangement (IFRIC  12). Under the financial asset model,  investment grants are equated to a means of repaying the operating  financial asset. During the construction phase, a financial receivable is recognized in  the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and revenue is  recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement, in accordance with  the percentage of completion method laid down in IFRS  15 on  construction contracts. Financial receivables are initially measured at the lower of fair value  and the sum of discounted future cash flows and subsequently  recognized at amortized cost using the effective interest method, as,  in accordance with IFRS  9, they represent the right to receive  contractual cash flows and have the characteristics of a loan. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements 380 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 383 ===== After a review of the contract and its financing, the implied interest  rate on the financial receivable is notably based on either the Group  financing rate and/or the borrowing rate associated with the contract. Leases IFRS 16 requires the identification of contractual terms and conditions  of agreements which, without taking the legal form of a lease, convey  a right to use a group of assets in return for payments included in the  overall contract (right of use analyzed as a transfer of control of a  group of assets during the contract term). A lease component is  thereby identified in these agreements, which is then analyzed and  recognized in accordance with the criteria laid out in this standard. The contract operator (Veolia) therefore becomes the lessor with  respect to its customers. On contract signature, Veolia now  determines whether the terms of the contract constitute a finance  lease or an operating lease. To this end, Veolia performs a comprehensive analysis to determine  whether the lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards  inherent to ownership of the underlying asset to the customer (the  lessee). The following indicators in particular are considered when performing  this analysis: (i)  the lease transfers ownership of the asset to the  customer by the end of the lease term, (ii)  the lease term is for the  major part of the economic life of the underlying asset, (iii) the present  value of the lease payments amounts to at least substantially all of  the fair value of the asset, or (iv)  the asset is of such a specialized  nature that only the customer can use it without major modifications. If this analysis leads to the conclusion that the lease is a finance lease,  Veolia does not recognize a tangible asset but an operating financial  asset to reflect the corresponding financing.

Commodity risks are described in Note 8.3.1.3. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 383  ===== PAGE 386 ===== 5.8  Commitments relating  to operating activities 5.8.1  Commitments given relating  to operating activities Commitments given relating to operating activities comprise  operating guarantees and purchase commitments. Operational or operating guarantees encompass all commitments not  relating to the financing of operations, required in respect of contracts  or markets and generally given in respect of the operations and  activities of Group companies. Such guarantees include bid bonds  accompanying tender offers, advance payment bonds and completion  or performance bonds given on the signature of contracts or  concession arrangements. The main categories of commitments include: ■Commitments related to site rehabilitation. Pursuant to environmental texts and legislation concerning the  operation of landfill sites, the Group is obliged to provide financial  guarantees to local authorities/government agencies. These  guarantees notably encompass the rehabilitation and supervision of  the site during 30 years or more, depending on national legislation  (currently 60 years in the United Kingdom), following its operation. In this context, performance bonds and letters of credit are issued to  local authorities and other public bodies. Depending on the contract, these guarantees cover the costs  necessary for the supervision and rehabilitation of all or part of the  site. These guarantees are quantified in accordance with legal or  contractually-defined procedures. These guarantees, which are given  in their total amount from the start of operations, expire at the end  of the commitment (termination of rehabilitation work and site  supervision). Therefore, the amount of our commitment for the rehabilitation and  supervision of landfill sites is in general different from the amount of  the provision recorded in the Group accounts (see Note  10).  Provisions calculated by the Group are based on different valuations  (based on internal policies regarding site security and designed for  optimal environmental protection), which take into account the  progressive nature of the obligation: operation of the landfill sites  results in progressive damage to the site and, as such, a related  liability is recognized as the facility is operated (see Note 10). If the amount of the commitment is less than the provision at the  balance sheet date, an off-balance sheet commitment is not  disclosed. Conversely, if the amount of the commitment is greater  than the provision, an off-balance sheet commitment is disclosed in  the amount not provided. ■Commitments related to engineering and construction activities. In the context of its business activities the Group gives (and receives)  commitments which can take several forms (deposits on  construction work and performance guarantees, etc.). Issued in favor  of customers or banking institutions, they are subject to individual  follow-up by site and their maturity depends on their contractual  characteristics. ■Commitments relating to concession arrangements. Pursuant to public service contracts with a public entity, the Group  may be called on/obliged to invest in infrastructures that will then  be operated and remunerated in accordance with contractual terms  and conditions. The contractual commitment may concern both the financing of  installations and infrastructures to be used in operations and also  the maintenance and replacement of infrastructures necessary to  operations. Expenditure relating to the replacement or rehabilitation of  installations is monitored and recognized through any timing  differences between the total contractual commitment over the  contract term and its realization, in accordance with IAS  37 on  Provisions. Expenditure relating to the construction, maintenance and  restoration of concession assets is reviewed with respect to IFRIC 12  and detailed in Note 5.4. ■Firm commodity purchase and sale commitments. As part of supply management and cost optimization, certain Group  subsidiaries may be required, depending on their activities, to set-up  derivatives to fix the cost of commodity supplies where the contracts  do not offer appropriate protection or contract forward purchases or  sales of commodities. Commodity risks are described in Note 8.3.1.3. Firm commodity purchase commitments, excluding derivatives,  mainly concern: ■gas in Energy activities (mainly in Central Europe) and Water  activities. Most commitments mature in less than 5 years; ■electricity in Energy activities (purchase commitments mature in  less than 3 years due to poor liquidity in the electricity market for  longer maturities); ■biomass and coal in Energy activities. In parallel, firm electricity sales contracts, excluding derivatives, are  entered into to secure selling prices over a period of less than 3 years.  These commitments concern production activities exposed to the  electricity wholesale market and primarily Waste activities in the UK  (electricity produced by waste incineration) and Energy activities in  Central Europe. Off-balance sheet commitments given break down as follows: (€ million) Maturing in As of December  31, 2022 As of December  31, 2023 Less than  1 year 1 to 5  years More than  5 years Operational guarantees including performance bonds 12,016  11,329  4,320  3,625  3,384  Purchase commitments 700  344  181  135  28  TOTAL COMMITMENTS RELATING TO OPERATING ACTIVITIES 12,716  11,673  4,501  3,760  3,412  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements 384 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 387 ===== Commitments given break down by operating segment as follows: (€ million) As of December  31, 2022 As of December  31, 2023 France & special waste Europe 931  820  Europe excluding France 3,334  2,974  Rest of the World 3,028  2,634  Water technologies  1,988  2,046  Other 3,435  3,199  TOTAL COMMITMENTS RELATING TO OPERATING ACTIVITIES 12,716  11,673  The decrease in commitments given between December 31, 2022 and  December 31, 2023 (-€1,043  million) is mainly due to the lifting of  performance guarantees given of €258 million by VE CGE to Delfuent  BV on behalf of OTV and of €174 million by VWT as part of the Umm Al  Quwain desalination project. Furthermore, a new guarantee has been  issued by VE SA to EDF Energy UK on behalf of Veolia UK LTD in the  context of the electricity sales contract of €345 million  Total commitments given in respect of Veolia Water Technologies’  activities amount to €1,302 million as of December 31, 2023, compared  with €1,378 million as of December 31, 2022.  In addition to the commitments given quantified above, Veolia has  also granted commitments of an unlimited amount in respect of  completion or performance bonds and a waste construction and  processing contract in Hong Kong, in the Waste and Water businesses.  This commitment, of an unlimited amount, is tied to the contract  duration (37 months of construction and 15 years of operation) and has  a residual duration of 5 years as of December 31, 2023. These commitments are limited to the duration of the related  contracts and were approved in advance by the Board of Directors of  Veolia Environnement. Commitments given in respect of joint ventures total €274 million (at  100%) as of December 31, 2023 compared with €272  million as of  December 31, 2022. They mainly consist of performance bonds given to  Kilpilahti Power Plant Ltd for the renovation of the combined heat and  power plant in Porvoo, Finland in the amount of €100 million and to  Glen Water Holding in the amount of €77  million for a water  treatment facility. 5.8.2  Commitments received relating  to operating activities These commitments mainly consist of commitments received from  our partners in respect of construction contracts. They total €860  million as of December 31, 2023, compared with  €962 million as of December 31, 2022. The decrease in commitments received is mainly due to the expiry of  electricity payment guarantees received by Bert in Hungary for €78  million. Total commitments received in respect of Veolia Water Technologies  activities amount to €122 million as of December 31, 2023, compared  with €72 million as of December 31, 2022.

Shares subscribed by employees under these  plans are subject to certain restrictions regarding their sale or transfer. In 2023, Veolia proposed a new Group employee share ownership  transaction, rolled-out across 49 countries. Under this transaction, shares were subscribed with a 15% discount on  the average closing price of the share during the 20 trading days  preceding the date the subscription price was set by the Chief  Executive Officer. The subscription price was set at €22.13. Under the so-called secure format, employees benefit from: ■a gross contribution from the Group equal to 100% of the  employee’s investment up to a maximum of €300; ■a leveraged system supplementing their personal investment in  the event of an increase in the share price. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements 386 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 389 ===== This personal investment and the net contribution from the Group are  guaranteed in the event of a fall in the share price and receive a  guaranteed minimum return. In certain countries, in order to adapt to  local legislation, a Share Appreciation Rights plan is offered. A financial institution is appointed by Veolia to hedge the transaction. In the United Kingdom, a Share Incentive Plan (SIP) was offered as an  alternative to the standard plan, enabling employees to subscribe at  the lower of the share price on November 1, 2023 and the share price  on March 31, 2024, while benefiting from a contribution from the  Group capped at GBP 250. This plan is still ongoing as of December 31,  2023. On December 13, 2023, Veolia Environnement issued 10,027,792 new  shares under the Group Savings Plan, representing a share capital  increase of €222 million. In 2023, an expense of €27 million is recorded in operating income. 6.2.2.2  2023 Performance Share Grant Plans In 2023, the Group granted 1,006,109 performance shares (PS) to  executives and employees of the Group, subject to the beneficiary’s  presence in the Group on May 3, 2026 and performance conditions  based on the following criteria: ■financial criteria (average increase in Current net income  attributable to owners of the Company and relative performance  of the total shareholder return (TSR) of the Veolia Environnement  share compared with the Stoxx 600 Utilities (Price) SX6P index); ■quantitative non-financial criteria relating to the Company’s  Purpose. Taking account of these characteristics and market conditions at the  plan implementation date, the fair value of the instruments was  estimated at €21.52. The performance and presence conditions are taken into account in  estimating the compensation expense. An expense of €5 million is recorded in operating income in 2023. 6.2.2.3  Plans implemented before 2023 Veolia implemented the following plans in previous years: ■2022 Employee Savings Plan: in 2022, Veolia proposed a Group  employee share ownership transaction, rolled-out across 45  countries. This plan had expired as of December 31, 2022, with the  exception of the SIP in the United Kingdom for which an additional  expense of €0.2  million was recognized in operating income in  2023; ■2020, 2021 and 2022 performance share grant plans: the Group set- up performance share grant plans (PSP) in 2020, 2021 and 2022  subject to the beneficiary’s presence in the Group at the vesting  date on May 5, 2023, May 4, 2024 and August 2, 2025, respectively,  and performance conditions. An expense of €26 million is recorded  in operating income in 2023 in respect of these three plans; ■2022 Free Share Grant Plan: the Group granted 145,200 free shares  subject to the beneficiary’s presence in the Group on June 15, 2025.   An expense of €2 million is recorded in operating income in 2023 in  respect of this plan. 6.3  Pension plans and other post- employment benefits The following disclosures relate to the pension plans offered by fully  consolidated entities. 6.3.1  Accounting policies Veolia Environnement and its subsidiaries have several pension plans: Defined contribution plans: plans under which the Group (or a Group  entity) pays an agreed contribution to a separate entity, relieving it of  any liability for future payments. These obligations are expensed in the Consolidated Income Statement  when due. Defined benefit plans: all plans which do not meet the definition of a  defined contribution plan. The net obligations of each Group entity are  calculated for each plan based on an estimate of the amount  employees will receive in exchange for services rendered during the  current and past periods. The amount of the obligation is discounted  to present value and the fair value of plan assets is deducted. Where the calculation shows a plan surplus, the asset recognized is  capped at the total of the discounted present value of profits, in the  form of future repayments or reductions in plan contributions. The  plan surplus is recognized in non-current financial assets. Certain obligations of the Group or Group entities may enjoy a right to  reimbursement, corresponding to a commitment by a third party to  repay in full or in part the expenses relating to these obligations. This  right to reimbursement is recognized in non-current financial assets. The financing of defined benefit pension plans may lead the Group to  make voluntary contributions to pension funds. Where applicable,  these voluntary contributions are presented in Net cash from  operating activities in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, in the  same way as other employer contributions. Employee obligations of the Group are calculated using the projected  unit credit method. This method is based on the probability of  personnel remaining with companies in the Group until retirement,  the foreseeable changes in future compensation, and the appropriate  discount rate. Specific discount rates are adopted for each monetary  area. They are determined based on the yield offered by bonds issued  by leading companies (rated AA) or treasury bonds where the market  is not liquid, with maturities equivalent to the average term of the  plans valued in the relevant region. This results in the recognition of  pension-related assets or provisions in the Consolidated Statement of  Financial Position and the recognition of the related net expenses. Pursuant to IAS 19, Employee Benefits, actuarial gains and losses are  recognized in other comprehensive income. 6.3.2  Description of plans In accordance with the regulatory environment and collective  agreements, the Group has established defined benefit and defined  contribution pension plans (company or multi-employer) in favour of  employees and other post-employment benefits. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 387  ===== PAGE 390 ===== Defined contribution plans Supplemental pension defined contribution plans have been set up in  certain subsidiaries. Expenses incurred by the Group under these plans  totaled €183 million in 2023 and €186 million in 2022. Defined benefit plans The tables in Note 6.3.3 present the obligations in respect of defined  benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits. The measurement of these obligations is reflected by the DBO  (Defined Benefit Obligation). These future outflow commitments may  be partially or fully funded (“plan assets”). The most significant obligations are located in the United Kingdom,  the United States and France. United Kingdom The defined benefit obligation in the United Kingdom is €773 million  as of December 31, 2023 (compared with €746 million as of December  31, 2022) and is funded by plan assets of €814  million at this date  (compared with €804 million as of December 31, 2021). The increase in  the defined benefit obligation is presented in the table below in  Note 6.3.3. The average duration of these plans is approximately 12 years. In the United Kingdom, defined benefit pension plans are mainly final  salary plans. Most of these plans are closed to new employees and the  majority are also closed to the accrual of new rights. These plans are  financed by employer contributions, or even employee contributions,  paid to an independent pension fund (managed by a Trustee). Local  regulations ensure the independence of the pension funds, which  have nine members (including five employer representatives, three  representatives of active and retired employees and one independent  member). Plan rules authorize the employer to recover excess funds paid at the  end of the plans. These plans allow retirees to take part of the benefit as a lump-sum  and the balance as a pension. In the case of a pension, the related risk  is tied to the longevity of beneficiaries. France In France, the defined benefit obligation for all plans totaled  €388 million as of December 31, 2023 (€395 million as of December 31,  2022) and is funded by plan assets of €78  million at this date  (€77  million as of December 31, 2022). The decrease in the defined  benefit obligation is presented in the table below in Note 6.3.3. Nearly 87% of the obligation relates to retirement indemnities (legally  required payments) paid in a lump sum. These indemnities represent a  number of months’ salary based on seniority and are legally required  by the applicable collective-bargaining agreement to be paid on an  employee’s retirement. A portion of these obligations is covered by  insurance contracts, but this funding is at the discretion of the  employer. The average duration of these plans is approximately  10 years. The risk associated with this type of plan is linked to the renegotiation  of  collective  bargaining  agreements  which  could  generate  adjustments to the indemnities granted. United States The defined benefit obligation in the United States is €541 million as of  December 31, 2023 (compared with €550  million as of December 31,  2022) and is funded by plan assets of €483  million at this date  (compared with €463 million as of December 31, 2022). The decrease in  the defined benefit obligation is presented in the table below in  Note 6.3.3. The average duration of these plans is approximately 10 years. In the United States, defined benefit plans are mainly average salary  pension plans.  The main defined benefit plans are the Suez Water  Resources Retirement Plan, the Suez Water Environmental Services  Pension Plan and the Ionics Incorporated Retirement Plan. The Suez  Water Resources plan is closed to new entrants and the Suez Water  Environmental Services plan and the Ionics Incorporated Retirement  Plan are closed to the accrual of new rights. Suez Water Inc.  undertakes to cover a portion of employee healthcare costs; this plan  is closed to new entrants. Financing is assured by the payment of  employer contributions to these funds. Multi-employer plans Under collective agreements, some Group companies participate in  multi-employer defined benefit pension plans. However, these plans  are unable to provide a consistent and reliable basis for the allocation  of the obligation, assets and costs between the different participating  entities. They are therefore recorded as defined contribution plans in  accordance with IAS  19. The multi-employer plans concern  approximately 4,000  employees in 2023 and are mainly located in  Germany, where such plans are generally funded by redistribution and  in the United States. The corresponding expense recorded in the Consolidated Income  Statement is equal to annual contributions and totals €9  million in  2023 compared with €10  million in 2022.  The Group plans to pay  contributions of €9 million in 2024 under its multi-employer plans.

A 1% increase in the discount rate would decrease the defined benefit  obligation by approximately €205 million and the current service cost  of the next year by €4  million. A 1% decrease in the discount rate  would increase the defined benefit obligation by €232 million and the  current service cost of the next year by €4 million. Conversely, a 1% increase in the inflation rate would increase the  defined benefit obligation by approximately €139  million and the  current service cost by €4 million. A 1% decrease in the inflation rate  would decrease the defined benefit obligation by €126 million and the  current service cost by €4 million.

Funding levels and the contribution payment schedule  are negotiated by the employer and the Trustee, based on triennial  actuarial valuations. Contributions include both the funding of the  shortfall in relation to past rights and service costs for future years. United Kingdom pension funds aim to attain 100% technical coverage  of liabilities within 10 years, while maintaining a risk level considered  as acceptable by all parties (Trustees and employers). In order to  achieve that goal, plan assets are allocated within two portfolios: ■a liability-driven investment portfolio comprising financial  instruments (where flows best match liabilities and the value  fluctuates in line with the liability value). This portfolio mainly  includes inflation-linked bonds issued or guaranteed by the UK  government and derivatives with leading banking counterparties,  with which collateralization contracts have been signed in order to  minimize counterparty risk; ■a portfolio of growth assets invested in a diverse range of asset  classes (equities, bonds, diversified funds, etc.) and seeking to  outperform the liabilities. Portfolio management was delegated to  an external manager in January 2017. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements 390 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 393 ===== A hedging policy covering some financial risks (particularly foreign  exchange, inflation and interest rate) was implemented, in order to  reduce the fund’s exposure to these risks and therefore reduce the risk  of increased contributions. These hedges were implemented using  derivatives (currency forwards, total return swaps on gilts, interest  rate swaps, etc.). In France, the Group’s assets are placed primarily with insurance  companies and invested in the general insurance fund. The French  General Insurance Code (Code général des assurances) requires  insurance companies to provide a minimum rate of return on these  funds, calculated primarily based on the rate offered by government  bonds. In the United States, the investment policy is defined by the pension  fund and funding levels are set by the employer. For the entire Group, the actual rate of return on plan assets reflects  market performance based on the asset investment profiles.  The Group plans to make contributions of €25  million to defined  benefit plans in 2024, compared with €36 million in 2023.  Investment and return on assets On average, Group pension plan assets were invested as follows: 2022 2023 Unquoted assets  11.4 %  11.3 % Liquid unquoted assets - Investment funds (general insurance fund)  7.7 %  9.2 % Non-liquid unquoted assets - Investment funds  (1)  0.5 %  0.5 % Unquoted assets - Other  3.2 %  1.6 % Quoted assets (liquid)  86.2 %  85.3 % Government bonds  (2)  13.4 %  12.4 % Corporate bonds  7.1 %  8.0 % Shares  13.3 %  17.7 % Diversified Investment funds  38.4 %  36.1 % Liquid quoted assets - Other  14.0 %  11.0 % Liquid assets  2.4 %  3.4 % TOTAL  100.0 %  100.0 % (1) The line “Non-liquid unquoted assets – Investment funds” consists of funds without guaranteed monthly liquidity (e.g. real estate funds, infrastructure funds).

More frequent tests are performed where there is indication that the  cash-generating unit may have suffered a loss in value. Changes in the general economic and financial context, worsening of  local economic environments, or changes in the Group’s economic  performance or stock market capitalization represent, in particular,  external indicators of impairment that are analyzed by the Group to  determine whether it is appropriate to perform more frequent  impairment tests. Impairment testing was performed on all cash-generating units as of  December 31, 2023. Goodwill impairment is recognized in operating income and is  definitive. Key assumptions underlying the determination  of recoverable amounts The need to recognize an impairment is assessed by comparing the  net carrying amount of the assets and liabilities of the CGU or group of  CGUs with their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is the higher of its  fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Fair value less costs to sell is determined based on available  information enabling the best estimate of the amount obtainable  from the sale of the cash-generating unit in an arm’s length  transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, less the costs of  disposal. The value in use determined by the Group is generally equal to the  present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the  CGU or group of CGUs, taking account of their residual value and  based on the following: ■cash flow projections are taken from the Long-Term Plan prepared  each year and reflect changes in volumes, prices, direct costs and  investment in the period, determined based on contracts and  activities and in line with past data and expected changes over the  period covered by the Long-Term Plan; ■this plan covers the year in progress and the next six years. This  period is representative of the average duration of the Group’s  long-term contract portfolio and its short-term activities; ■terminal values are calculated based on discounted forecast flows  for the last year of the long-term plan (2029). These flows are  determined for each CGU or group of CGUs based on a perpetual  growth rate mainly founded on long-term inflation; ■these terminal values are calculated based on discount rates and  perpetual growth rates reflecting the country or the geographic  area of the cash-generating unit; ■a discount rate (weighted average cost of capital) is determined for  each asset, cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units:  it is equal to the risk-free rate plus a risk premium weighted for  country-specific risks (see Note 2). A risk premium is included in the  calculation of the weighted average cost of capital of entities  located in countries outside the euro zone and the following euro  zone countries: Spain, Italy, Slovakia. The discount rates estimated  by management for each cash-generating unit therefore reflect  current market assessments of the time value of money and the  country specific risks to which the CGU or group of CGUs is  exposed, with the other risks reflected in the expected future cash  flows from the assets. These rates were updated by an  independent expert in the second half of 2023, and take into  account the increase in inflation rates and in financing conditions; ■investments included in forecast future cash flows are those  investments that enable the level of economic benefits expected to  arise from the assets to be maintained in their current condition. It  should be noted that these investment forecasts used as a basis for  computing projections of future cash flow include Veolia  commitments to phase-out coal in Europe reflected through  assets  decarbonisation plan, Restructuring plans to which the Group is  not committed are not included in forecast cash flows used to  determine values in use. Changes in the economic and financial context, as well as changes in  the competitive or regulatory environment may impact estimates of  recoverable amounts, as may unforeseen changes in the political,  economic or legal systems of certain countries. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements 394 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 397 ===== The assumptions underlying the impairment tests on Group cash-generating units with material goodwill balances are as follows: Cash Generating Unit Recoverable amount  determination method Discount rate Perpetual growth  rate France & Special Waste Europe Value in use  5.9 %  1.9 % Central & Eastern Europe Value in use  8.0 %  2.8 % Northern Europe Value in use  6.4 %  2.0 % Pacific Value in use  6.7 %  2.9 % North America Value in use  6.7 %  2.0 % Water Technologies Value in use  6.7 %  2.2 % 7.1.2.1  Impairment test results Impairment tests were performed on all cash-generating units. No  impairment losses were recognized in 2023. 7.1.2.2  Sensitivity of recoverable amounts Recoverable amounts determined for impairment testing purposes  were tested for their sensitivity to a 1% increase in discount rates, a 1%  decrease in perpetual growth rates and a 5% decrease in operating  cash flows. The changes in operating cash flows taken into account for the  purpose of these sensitivity tests include EBITDA, less investments net  of divestitures, plus changes in working capital.  They also include the impact of Efficiency and Convergence plans  launched by each cash-generating unit at the date of preparation of  the Long-Term Plan. These assumptions are considered reasonable given the Group’s  activities and the geographic areas of its operations. In line with the Groups’ new organization, impairment tests were  performed on new goodwill CGUs  and material joint ventures. Some goodwill CGUs generate cash flows in more than one country.  For these CGUs, discount rates, perpetual growth rates and tax rates  taken into account at CGU level were calculated by weighting the  flows of each constituent country. The cash-generating units are not sensitive to changes in  macroeconomic and operating assumptions as of December 31, 2022 or  December 31, 2023. 7.2  Intangible assets Intangible assets are identifiable non-monetary assets without  physical substance. They mainly consist of certain assets recognized in  respect of concession arrangements (IFRIC 12). Intangible assets purchased separately are initially measured at cost in  accordance with IAS  38. Intangible assets acquired through business  combinations are recognized at fair value separately from goodwill.  Subsequently,  intangible  assets  are  measured  at  cost  less  accumulated amortization and impairment losses. They are tested for  impairment where there is indication of loss in value (non- performance of a significant long-term contract under the terms laid  down in the contract, technical operating issues, etc.). 7.2.1  Concession intangible assets Concession intangible assets include entry fees paid to local  authorities for public service contracts. They correspond to the right of  the concession holder to bill users of a public service in return for  construction services provided by it to the concession grantor under  public service contracts in accordance with IFRIC 12, Service Concession  arrangements. This concession holder right is equal to the fair value of the  construction of the concession infrastructure plus borrowings costs  recognized during the construction period. It is amortized over the  contract term in accordance with an appropriate method reflecting  the rate of consumption of the concession asset’s economic benefits  as from the date the infrastructure is brought into service. Investment grants received in respect of concession arrangements are  generally definitively earned and, therefore, are not repayable. In  accordance with the option offered by IAS  20, these grants are  presented as a deduction from intangible assets and reduce the  amortization charge in respect of the concession intangible asset over  the residual term of the concession arrangement.

In  substance, it is necessary to determine whether the agreement  conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period  of time in exchange for consideration. Where these characteristics exist, the Group recognizes, at the time  the asset is made available: ■a new asset, the “Right of use”, which represents the right to use  the leased asset during the term of the lease; ■a liability, the “IFRS  16 lease debt”, which represents the lease  payment commitment. The Group applies a single recognition method for all leases, excluding  short-term leases (duration of 12 months or less) and leases of assets  with a low value. The Group adopted a threshold of US $5,000 for low  value assets. Lease payments on contracts excluded from the scope of IFRS  16, as  well as variable payments, continue to be recognized as operating  expenses.

The lease debt is equal to the present value of: ■future lease payments (fixed payments and in-substance fixed  payments, as well as variable lease payments that depend on an  index or a rate); ■incentives receivable; ■amounts that Veolia expects to pay under residual value  guarantees; ■the exercise price of a purchase option if Veolia is reasonably  certain to exercise it; as well as ■any penalties for terminating the lease. The right of use asset is depreciated or amortized on a straight-line  over the shorter of the expected useful life of the asset and the lease  term. Impairment tests are performed in accordance with the method  described in Note 7.1.2 Lease term The lease term is determined based on the provisions of the contract  and reflects:  ■the non-cancellable period, that is the period of time during which  the Group does not have the opportunity to cancel the contract;  ■plus any optional cancellation periods, if the Group is reasonably  assured not to exercise the cancellation option ; ■plus any optional extension periods, if the Group is reasonably  assured to exercise the extension option. Discount rate When calculating the present value of future lease payments, the  Group has elected not to use the rate implicit in the lease as the  discount rate, and has developed a calculation method to determine  the incremental borrowing rate that would apply to the financing of  these leased assets. This methodology is based on a rate schedule  calculated by currency and maturity based on the following  parameters: reference rate of the relevant currency and the Veolia  credit spread, the Group satisfying, through access to the bond  market, the majority of the financing requirements of its subsidiaries.

Financial assets are initially recognized at fair value plus transaction  costs, where the assets concerned are not subsequently measured at  fair value through profit or loss. Where the assets are measured at fair  value through profit or loss, transaction costs are expensed directly to  net income. The Group classifies financial assets in one of the categories identified  by IFRS  9 on the acquisition date, based on the instrument’s  characteristics and the business model. Assets at amortized cost Financial assets are valued at amortized cost where they are recovered  by collecting contractual cash flows (payments of principal and  interest on the principal amount outstanding). These assets comprise loans to non-consolidated investments,  operating financial assets, other loans and receivables and trade  receivables. After initial recognition at fair value, they are recognized  and measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. In accordance with IFRS 9, these assets are impaired in the amount of  expected credit losses. Impairment losses are recorded in other  financial income and expenses. Assets at fair value through other comprehensive  income subsequently released to net income This category includes financial assets recovered by collecting  contractual cash flows (payments of principal and interest on the  principal amount outstanding) or selling the assets. Changes in the fair value of these assets are recognized directly in  other comprehensive income, with the exception of interest income  and dividends recognized in other financial income and expenses. Fair  value gains and losses are released to net income on the sale of the  assets. Assets at fair value through other comprehensive  income not subsequently released to net income This category includes equity instruments not held for trading. It  relates primarily to non-consolidated investments. Changes in the fair value of these assets are recognized directly in  other comprehensive income, with the exception of interest income  and dividends recognized in other financial income and expenses. Fair  value gains and losses are not released to net income on the sale of  the assets. Fair value is equal to market value in the case of quoted securities and  to an estimate of the fair value in the case of unquoted securities,  determined based on financial criteria most appropriate to the specific  situation of each security. Financial investments which are not quoted  in an active market and for which the fair value cannot be measured  reliably, are recorded by the Group at historical cost less any  accumulated impairment losses. Assets at fair value through profit or loss This category includes: ■financial assets that are not held either to collect contractual cash  flows or to sell the assets and whose contractual conditions do not  solely give rise to payments of principal and interest on the  principal amount outstanding; ■assets designated at fair value  and primarily the cash UCITS  portfolio whose performance and management is based on fair  value. Fair value gains and losses are recognized in other financial income  and expenses. Net gains and losses on derivatives entered into for trading purposes  consist of swapped flows and the change in the value of the  instrument.

(**) Reinsurers’ share. As of December 31, 2023, liquid assets and financing financial assets  primarily comprise investments with an initial maturity of more than  three months, easily convertible into cash, and managed with respect  to a liquidity objective while maintaining a low capital risk. Movements in 2023 mainly concern the optimization of the Group’s  cash management. The accounting treatment of other current financial assets relating to  loans and receivables complies with the required treatment of assets  at amortized cost. Other financial assets are classified as “Assets at fair  value through profit or loss” in accordance with the principles set out  in Note 8.1.2. 8.1.3  Cash and cash equivalents, bank  overdrafts and other cash position  items Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances, certain term  deposit accounts, negotiable debt instruments and monetary UCITS. Cash equivalents are held to meet short-term cash commitments.  In order to be considered a cash equivalent, an investment must be  readily convertible to a known amount of cash and subject to a  negligible risk of change in value, thereby satisfying the requirements  of IAS 7. Term deposit accounts and negotiable debt instruments present  characteristics satisfying the requirements of IAS 7 when their yield is  based on short-term money-market rates (such as Eonia) and their  maturity is less than 3 months (contractually or due to an early exit  option exercisable at least every 3 months and held at a low or nil cost,  without loss of capital or remuneration received net of the early exit  penalty of less than the yield on short-term investments). UCITS classified in “cash equivalents” comply with Regulation (EU)  2017/1131 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June  14,  2017 on money market funds and are presumed to satisfy the cash  equivalent criteria defined by IAS 7. These UCITS can be sold daily on demand, conferring on them the  characteristics of short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily  convertible to known amounts of cash. These instruments are not  intended to be held more than three months and offer a yield similar  to the Eonia (European Overnight Index Average) interbank rate,  thereby limiting sensitivity to interest rates. The regularity of  performance trends does not expose them to a material risk of change  in value. Bank overdrafts repayable on demand which form an integral part of  the Group’s cash management policy represent a component of cash  and cash equivalents for the purposes of the Consolidated Cash Flow  Statement. Cash and cash equivalents are valued at fair value through profit or  loss. Note  8.2.1 sets out the method of determining fair value. Cash  and cash equivalents belong to fair value levels 1 and 2: ■instruments with a quoted price in an active market in level 1; ■other instruments that are not quoted but the fair value of which is  determined using valuation techniques involving standard  mathematical calculation methods integrating observable market  data, in level 2.

Cash and cash equivalents decreased by €481 million in 2023, mainly  reflecting the redemption of bond issues at maturity for €1.3 billion,  partially offset by proceeds from the issue of commercial paper of  €747 million. As of December 31, 2023,  the Europe excluding France segment held  cash of €519 million, the Rest of the world segment held cash of  €717  million, the Water technologies segment held cash of  €451 million , France and special waste Europe segment held cash of  €80 million and the Other segment held cash of €314 million  (including mainly Veolia Environnement). Surplus cash balances of other Group subsidiaries, not pooled at Veolia  Environnement level, are invested in accordance with procedures  defined by the Group. Note  8.3.2, “Management of liquidity risk”,  presents a breakdown of investments by nature. As of December 31, 2023, cash equivalents were primarily held by  Veolia Environnement in the amount of €6,138 million, including  monetary UCITS of €3,514 million and term deposit accounts of €2,624  million. Bank overdrafts and other cash position items consist of credit  balances on bank accounts and related accrued interest payable,  corresponding to brief overdrafts. 8.1.3.2  Management of equity risk As part of its cash management strategy, Veolia Environnement holds  UCITS. These UCITS have the characteristics of monetary UCITS and are  not subject to equity risk. 8.2  Fair value of financial assets  and liabilities 8.2.1  Fair value of financial assets  and liabilities The recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities is  governed by IFRS  9. Fair value measurement incorporates, in  particular, the risk of non-performance by the Group or its  counterparties, determined based on default probabilities taken from  rating agency tables. The fair value of all financial assets and liabilities is determined at the  reporting date, either for recognition in the accounts or disclosure in  the Notes to the financial statements. Fair value is determined: i. based on quoted prices in an active market (level 1); or ii. using  internal  valuation  techniques  involving  standard  mathematical calculation methods integrating observable market  data (forward rates, interest rate curves, etc.). Valuations produced  by these models are adjusted to take account of a reasonable  change in the credit risk of the Group or the counterparty (level 2);  or iii. using internal valuation techniques integrating factors estimated  by the Group in the absence of observable market data (level 3). Quoted prices in an active market (level 1) When quoted prices in an active market are available, they are used in  priority to determine the market value. Marketable securities and  certain quoted bond issues are valued in this way. Fair values determined using models integrating  observable market data (level 2) The majority of derivative instruments (swaps, caps, floors, etc.) are  traded over the counter and, as such, there are no quoted prices.  Valuations are therefore determined using models commonly used by  market participants to value such financial instruments. Valuations calculated internally for derivative instruments are tested  every six months for consistency with valuations issued by our  counterparties. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 409  ===== PAGE 412 ===== The fair value of unquoted borrowings is calculated by discounting  contractual flows at the market rate of interest. The net carrying amount of receivables and payables falling due  within less than one year and certain floating-rate receivables and  payables is considered a reasonable estimate of their fair value, due to  the short payment and settlement periods applied by the Group. The fair value of fixed-rate loans and receivables depends on  movements in interest rates and the credit risk of the counterparty. Valuations produced by these models are adjusted to take account of  changes in Group credit risk. Fair values determined using models integrating  certain non-observable data (level 3) Derivative instruments valued using internal models integrating  certain non-observable data include certain electricity derivative  instruments for which there are no quoted prices in an active market  (notably for electricity purchase options with extremely long maturity)  or observable market data (forward prices for component materials,  interest-rate curves, etc.), in particular for distant maturities. 8.2.2  Financial assets The following table presents the net carrying amount and fair value of Group financial assets as of December 31, 2023, grouped together in  accordance with IFRS 9 categories.

These instruments may  only be offset in the event of default by one of the parties to the  agreement. They are not therefore offset in the accounts. Such derivatives are recognized in assets in the amount of €259  million and in liabilities in the amount of €746 million in the  Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2023. 8.3  Market risks and financial  instruments As a result of its operational and financial activities, the Group is  exposed to various financial risks, for which it has implemented  management rules: ■market risks: interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and  commodity risk; ■liquidity risk; ■credit risk. Equity risk is presented in Notes 8.1.3.2 and 9.2.2.2. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 411  ===== PAGE 414 ===== Derivative instruments To manage its exposure to market risks, Veolia uses derivatives, the  majority of which are classified as hedging instruments. Derivative instruments are recognized at fair value in the Consolidated  Statement of Financial Position. Other than the exceptions detailed  below, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded  through profit or loss. The fair value of derivatives is estimated using  standard valuation models which take into account active market  data. Net gains and losses on instruments at fair value through profit or loss  consist of swapped flows and changes in the value of the instrument. Hedge accounting is applicable if: ■the hedging relationship is precisely defined and documented at  the inception date; ■the effectiveness of the hedge is demonstrated at inception and by  regular verification of the offsetting nature of movements in the  market value of the hedging instrument and the hedged item. The  ineffective portion of the hedge is systematically recognized in the  Consolidated Income Statement. Hedge accounting relationships currently used by the Group meet the  requirements of IFRS  9 and are aligned with the Group’s risk  management strategy and objectives. The effectiveness of derivatives in these hedging relationships is  assessed using the hypothetical derivative method: the designated  derivative in each hedging relationship must enable changes in cash  flows of the hedged item to be offset. The main sources of ineffectiveness are: ■the impact of Group and counterparty credit risk on the fair value  of hedging instruments, not reflected by fluctuations in the fair  value of the hedged item (foreign exchange, interest rate and  commodities). Pursuant to IFRS  13, the impact of credit risk on  derivatives is regularly assessed. In the absence of materiality, an  adjustment has never been recognized; ■changes to the timing and amount of expected cash flows from  hedged transactions, in the case of transaction foreign exchange  risk. The recognition of period-on-period fair value gains and losses  depends on the type of hedge accounting applied. A fair value hedge is a hedge of exposure to changes in the fair value  of all or a portion of a recognized asset or liability impacting net  income for the period. Fair value gains and losses on hedging  instruments are recognized in net income for the period. Changes in  the value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are also  recorded in the Consolidated Income Statement for the period, to  match these gains and losses (and adjust the value of the hedged  item). These two remeasurements offset each other in the income  statement headings, with the exception of any “ineffective portion” of  the hedge. A cash flow hedge is a hedge of exposure to variability in cash flows of  an asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction impacting  net income for the period. In the case of cash flow hedges, the portion  of the gain or loss on the fair value remeasurement of the hedging  instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognized  directly in other comprehensive income, while the gain or loss on the  fair value remeasurement of the underlying item is not recognized in  the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The ineffective  portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized in  profit or loss. Gains or losses recognized in other comprehensive  income are reclassified to profit or loss in the same period or periods in  which the asset acquired or liability issued affects profit or loss. A hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation hedges the  exposure to foreign exchange risk of the net assets of a foreign  operation including loans considered part of the investment (IAS  21,  The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates). For this type of  hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging  instrument  is  recognized  in  translation  reserves  in  other  comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognized in  the Consolidated Income Statement. Gains and losses recognized in  foreign exchange translation reserves are reclassified to profit or loss  when the foreign investment is sold. Certain transactions performed in accordance with the Group interest  rate and foreign exchange risk management policy, but that do not  satisfy hedge accounting criteria, are recorded as trading/non- qualifying instruments. In the case of currency hedges, the Group only designates the “spot”  component of derivatives as hedging its foreign exchange risk. As the  “hedging cost” option is not applied, the premium/discount on  hedging contracts is excluded from the hedging relationship and  recognized separately in the financing cost. In the case of commodities, purchase/sales contracts are generally  recognized outside the scope of IFRS 9 (“own use” exemption), except  for certain specific transactions in electricity, coal and gas. For these  specific transactions, cash flow hedge accounting is systematically  preferred. The “own use” classification is applicable when the following  conditions are satisfied: ■the volumes purchased or sold under the contracts reflect the  operating requirements of the subsidiary; ■the contracts are not subject to net settlement as defined by IFRS 9  and, in particular, physical delivery is systematic; ■the contracts are not equivalent to sales of options, as defined by  IFRS 9. Commodity hedging instruments falling within the application scope  of IFRS  9 are derivative instruments and are measured at fair value,  calculated using models mostly based on observable data. Fair value  gains and losses and the net impact of unwinding these transactions  are recognized in operating income. 8.3.1  Management of market risk The Group uses derivatives to manage and reduce its risk exposure:  the Veolia Environnement Financing and Treasury Department is  directly responsible for implementing and monitoring these hedges,  while the Middle and Back Office teams in the Finance Department  verify transactions and monitor limits, ensuring the security of  transactions processed.

As such, the cash and cash equivalents position  covers floating-rate debt which impacts future financial results  according to fluctuations in interest rates. Short-term debt is primarily indexed to short-term indexes (Eonia for  the treasury note program and Euribor/Libor for the main short-term  credit lines). Medium and long-term debt comprises both fixed and  floating-rate debt. Veolia manages a fixed/floating rate position in each currency in order  to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on its net income and  to optimize the cost of debt. For this purpose, it uses interest rate  swap and swaption instruments. The Group determines the existence  of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the  hedged item taking account of reference interest rates, the frequency  of coupons, the currency and the nominal amount. These swaps may be classified as fair value hedges or cash flow  hedges. The following table shows the interest-rate exposure of gross debt  (defined as the sum of non-current financial liabilities, current  financial liabilities and bank overdrafts and other cash position items)  before and after hedging.

The decrease in fixed-rate debt and the increase in floating-rate debt  before hedging is mainly due to the redemption of fixed-rate euro  bond issues in the amount of €976 million and the increase in  commercial paper of €742 million during the year. As of December 31, 2023, the Group has cash and cash equivalents of  €8,696 million, the majority of which bears interest at floating rates. The Group manages its exposure to interest rate fluctuations based on  floating-rate gross financial debt net of cash. The Group’s net floating-rate position after hedging (liability position)  is -€215  million, maturing €4,923  million in less than one year,  -€2,638 million in 1 to 5 years and -€2,500 million after 5 years. Interest rate fair value hedges The risk of volatility in the value of debt is hedged by fixed-rate  receiver/floating-rate payer swaps which change bond issues to  floating-rate debt (see Note 8.1.1.1) recorded in non-current and current  financial liabilities. Fair value hedging swaps represent a notional outstanding amount of  €4,500 million as of December 31, 2023, stable on December 31, 2022,  with a net fair value in the Consolidated Statement of Financial  Position of -€428  million as of December 31, 2023, compared with  -€634 million as of December 31, 2022, as follows: Fixed-rate receiver /  floating-rate payer swaps (€ million) Notional contract amount by maturity Fair value of derivatives Total < 1 year 1 to 5 years > 5 years Total assets Total liabilities As of December 31, 2023 4,500  -  3,000  1,500  -  428  As of December 31, 2022 4,500  - 2,600  1,900  - 634  As of December 31, 2023, accumulated fair value hedging adjustments  to bond issues included in their net carrying amount totaled  + €15.6 million. The +€206 million increase in fair value is due to the decrease in euro  forward rates as of December 31, 2023 compared with the end of 2022.  It is offset by the fair value remeasurement of the debt relating to the  hedged risk in the amount of -€206  million. A review of the  inefficiency of these hedging instruments did not give rise to any  material impacts. Interest rate cash flow hedges The Group has entered into interest rate swaps to fix the cost of  existing floating-rate debt or the cost of future debt issues. Cash flow hedging swaps represent a notional outstanding amount of  €1,268 million as of December 31, 2023, compared with €271 million as  of December 31, 2022, with a net fair value of +€35  million as of  December 31, 2023, compared with +€69  million as of December 31,  2022. The increase in notional outstanding is due to the implementation of  new hedges for €1,000 million.  The -€34 million decrease in the portfolio value is mainly due to the  fall in euro forward rates during the period, as new transactions were  performed at the end of 2023 and had little impact on the total fair  value. The efficiency of these hedging instruments was measured but did not  give rise to any material impacts.

The Group’s central treasury department manages foreign exchange  risk centrally within limits set by the Chief Financial Officer. Foreign exchange risk, as defined by IFRS 7, mainly results from: ■foreign currency-denominated purchases and sales of goods and  services relating to operating activities and the related hedges (e.g.  currency forwards). The Group has no significant exposure to  foreign exchange transaction risk. Indeed, the activities of the  Group are performed by subsidiaries operating in their own  country and their own currency. Exposure to foreign exchange risk  is therefore naturally limited; ■foreign currency-denominated financial assets and liabilities  including foreign currency-denominated loans/borrowings and  related hedges (e.g. forex swaps). With many operations  worldwide, Veolia organizes financing in local currencies. In the  case of inter-company financing, these credit lines can generate  foreign exchange risk. In order to limit the impact of this risk,  Veolia has developed a policy which seeks to back foreign-currency  financing and foreign currency derivatives with inter-company  receivables denominated in the same currency. The asset exposure  hedging strategy primarily involves hedging certain net foreign  investments and ensuring that Group companies do not have a  material balance sheet foreign exchange position that could  generate significant volatility in foreign exchange gains and losses; ■investments in foreign subsidiaries reflected by the translation of  accounts impacting the translation reserves. The Group determines  the economic relationship between the hedging instrument and  the hedged item by comparing changes in the value of the hedging  instrument attributable to a change in the spot foreign exchange  rate with the impact of changes in this same rate on the hedged  instrument. It is Group policy to align the key characteristics of  hedging instruments (currency, nominal amount, maturity, etc.)  with the hedged item. Foreign exchange risk with regard to the net finance cost With many operations worldwide, Veolia organizes financing in local  currencies. The foreign currency debt borne by the parent company, Veolia  Environnement  SA, is generally hedged using either derivative  instruments or assets in the same currency. The Group’s net finance cost, i.e. a euro-equivalent of -€539 million in  2023, is primarily denominated in EUR (46%), USD (19%), GBP (3%), CZK  (2%), CNY (7%), PLN (4%), BRL (1%), HUF (4%) and CLP (6%). A 10% appreciation in the main currencies to which the Group is  exposed (GBP, USD, PLN, CZK and CNY) against the euro would  generate a €21 million increase in the net finance cost, while a 10%  depreciation in these currencies would generate a €17 million decrease  in the net finance cost. Translation risk Due to its international presence, the translation of the income  statements of the Group’s foreign subsidiaries is sensitive to exchange  rate fluctuations. The following table summarizes the sensitivity of certain Group  Consolidated Income Statement aggregates to a 10% increase or  decrease in foreign exchange rates against the euro, with regard to  the translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries.

A  fluctuation in the euro impacts the translation of subsidiary foreign  currency denominated assets in the Consolidated Statement of  Financial Position. For its most significant assets, the Group has issued debt in the  relevant currencies. The main net assets of the Group are located in  the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Poland, Australia, Chile  and the Czech Republic. A 10% appreciation in the currencies of the  above countries would increase net assets by €1,542 million, while a  10% depreciation in these currencies would reduce net assets by  -€1,261 million. Hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation Financial instruments designated as net investment hedges break down as follows: Financial instrument (€ million) Notional amount as of December 31, 2023 by maturity Fair value of derivatives Amount < 1 year 1 to 5 years > 5 years Total assets Total liabilities Currency payer swaps 308  308  -  -  10  -  Currency receiver swaps 295  295  -  -  -  7  Options 3,338  3,274  64  -  43  15  Cross currency swaps 60  -  60  -  1  20  TOTAL 4,001  3,877  124  -  54  42  The above currency swaps are short-term but are generally renewed at  maturity, until financing of an appropriate term is secured in the  currency of the related country. Options are mainly hedging strategies using collars. It is Group policy to hedge the net investment only in the nominal  amount of the foreign currency debt financing the securities. Inter-company loans and receivables forming part of a foreign  investment (IAS  21) are nearly systematically hedged by foreign  currency external financing or foreign currency derivatives (cross  currency swaps, currency forwards, collars) meeting IFRS 9 criteria for  hedge accounting.  Foreign exchange gains and losses recorded in foreign exchange  translation reserves in respect of hedging instruments are  systematically offset by foreign exchange gains and losses recognized  in foreign exchange translation reserves on loans forming part of the  net investment, unless: ■the inter-company loan forming part of the net investment in a  foreign operation is not hedged; ■the hedge is partially ineffective due to a difference between the  nominal amount of the hedge and the amount of the hedged net  asset; ■only the net assets of the foreign subsidiary (excluding the loan  forming part of the net investment) are hedged.

The Group is therefore  exposed to fluctuations in their price. The long-term contracts entered into by Veolia generally include price  review and/or indexation clauses which enable it to pass on the  majority of any increases in commodity or fuel prices to the price of  services sold to customers, even if this may be performed with a time  delay. Nonetheless, as part of supply management and cost optimization  measures or to hedge future production, certain Group subsidiaries  may be required, depending on their activities, to contract forward  purchases or sales of commodities and set-up derivatives to fix the  cost of commodities supply or the selling price of commodities  produced (electricity). The majority of these commitments are  reciprocal; the third parties concerned are obliged to deliver the  quantities negotiated in these contracts and the Group is obliged to  take them. These transactions form part of the Group’s commodity risk  management policy, which seeks to establish a progressive hedge over  three years (where possible) in order to limit results volatility. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of commodity derivatives is  recorded €20 million in assets and €81 million in liabilities.

Greenhouse gases Regulatory constraints and management policy As a combustion plant operator, the Group is exposed to the risks  inherent to the Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) introduced by the  European Union in 2005.  To accelerate the rate of emission reductions, Phase  4 (2021-2030)  provides for a 2,2% annual decrease in the total number of emission  allowances (free grant of allowances). In December 2022, the Council  and European Parliament reached a provisional agreement providing  for an increase in the annual reduction rate of the emission cap by  4.3% per year from 2024 to 2027 and 4.4% from 2028 to 2030.  The  Council formally adopted this new trajectory in April 2023. Under European regulations, the actual emissions position is  determined each year and the corresponding rights surrendered. In  addition to the Group’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction policy,  Veolia is therefore required to purchase or sell emission rights,  depending on whether actual emissions are greater or lesser than  emission rights allocated under the hedging policy described above.  In addition, China also officially launched a country-wide Emissions  Trading Scheme in 2021, focusing initially on electricity producers. The  impacts are not material at this stage for the Group. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements 418 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 421 ===== Accounting treatment adopted by the Group In the absence of specific IFRS provisions, the Group has adopted the  “net liability approach,” which involves the recognition of a liability at  the period end if actual emissions exceed allowances held, in  accordance with IAS 37. Allowances are managed as a production cost and, in this respect, are  recognized in inventories at: ■nil value, when they are received free of charge; ■acquisition cost, if purchased for valuable consideration on the  market. Transactions in these allowances performed on the forward market  are generally recognized outside the application scope of IFRS 9 (“own  use” exemption). The position in 2023 is as follows: Volumes (in thousands of metric tons) As of January  1st, 2023 Changes in  consolidation scope Granted Purchased/  Sold/ Cancelled Used As of December  31, 2023 TOTAL 435 163 2,466 5,767 -7,960 871 The inventory of 871 thousand metric tons is equivalent to approximately €67 million as of December 31, 2023, based on a spot price of €77.25 per  metric ton. 8.3.2  Management of liquidity risk The operational management of liquidity and financing is managed by the Treasury and Financing Department. This management involves the  centralization of major financing in order to optimize liquidity and cash. The Group secures financing on international bond markets, international private placement markets, the treasury note market and the bank  lending market (see Note 8.1.1.4 – Non-current and current financial liabilities). 8.3.2.1  Maturity of financial liabilities As of December 31, 2023, undiscounted contractual flows on net financial debt (nominal value) break down by maturity date as follows: (€ million) As of December 31, 2023 Maturity of undiscounted contractual flows Carrying  amount Total  undiscounted  contractual  flows 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Beyond  5 years Bond issues (1) 18,081  18,391 1,288 1,804 1,472 2,596 2,051 9,181 Other liabilities 8,269  8,269  6,287  218  361  211  164  1,028  Gross financial liabilities excluding IFRS 16 and  the impact of amortized cost and hedging  derivatives 26,350  26,659  7,574  2,022  1,833  2,807  2,214  10,209  IFRS 16 lease debt 2,000  2,311 495 378 295 217 196 730 Gross financial liabilities excluding the impact  of amortized cost and hedging derivatives 28,350  28,970  8,070  2,400  2,128  3,024  2,410  10,939  Impact of derivatives hedging debt 414  Gross financial liabilities 28,764  28,970  8,070 2,400 2,128 3,024 2,410 10,939 Cash and cash equivalents -8,696  Liquid assets and financing financial assets -1,892  Net financial debt 18,176  28,970  8,070  2,400  2,128  3,024  2,410  10,939  (1) Excluding the impact of amortized cost and derivatives hedging debt.

Credit risk on operating  financial assets is appraised via the rating of primarily public  customers. Credit risk on other operating receivables is appraised  through an analysis of late payment and/or default by customers  taking account of their nature (public/private) as detailed below.

Credit risk corresponds to the  loss that the Group may incur should a counterparty default on its  contractual obligations. In the case of derivative financial instruments,  this risk corresponds to the fair value of all the instruments contracted  with a counterparty insofar as this value is positive. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 421  ===== PAGE 424 ===== The Group minimizes counterparty risk through internal control  procedures limiting the choice of banking counterparties to leading  banks and financial institutions (banks and financial institutions with  a minimum Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s or Fitch’s rating of A3/P3/F3  respectively for transactions with a term of less than one year and of  A2/A/A respectively for transactions with a term of more than one  year, unless justified). Limits are determined for each counterparty  based primarily on the rating awarded by the rating agencies, the size  of their equity and commitments given to the Group and are reviewed  regularly. In addition, the Group has set-up Credit Support Annexes  with its main counterparties limiting counterparty risk using margin  call mechanisms. Counterparty risk on financial transactions is monitored on an  ongoing basis by the middle-office within the Group Finance  Department. The Group is not exposed to any risk as a result of  material concentration. Veolia Environnement cash surpluses are managed with a profitability  objective close to that of the money market, avoiding exposure to  capital risk and maintaining a low level of volatility. 8.4  Financial income and expenses 8.4.1  Cost of net financial debt Finance costs consist of interest payable on borrowings calculated  using the amortized cost method and losses on interest rate  derivatives, both qualifying and not qualifying as hedges. Interest costs included in payments under lease finance contracts are  recorded using the effective interest method. Finance income consists of gains on interest rate derivatives, both  qualifying and not qualifying as hedges and income from cash  investments and equivalents. Interest income is recognized in profit or loss when earned, using the  effective interest method. Finance costs and finance income represent the cost of financial  liabilities net of income from cash and cash equivalents. In addition,  the cost of net financial debt includes net gains and losses on  derivatives allocated to debt, irrespective of whether they qualify for  hedge accounting. Finance income totals €585  million, while finance expenses total   -€1,124 million in 2023. The cost of net financial debt presented in the Consolidated Cash Flow  Statement reflects the cost of net financial debt of continuing  operations presented above and the cost of net financial debt of  discontinued operations of nil for the year ended December 31, 2023. The heading “Interest paid” in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement  reflects the cost of net financial debt of continuing and discontinued  operations adjusted for accrued interest of €9 million and fair value  adjustments to hedging derivatives of €8 million in 2023.

This decrease in the Group cost of net  financial debt is mainly due to an increase in income from cash and  cash equivalents and liquid assets following the rise in interest rates. Net gains and losses on derivative instruments, hedging relationships  and other mainly include the following amounts in the year ended  December 31, 2023: ■a net interest expense on hedging relationships (fair value hedges  and cash flow hedges) of -€251 million; ■net losses on derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting of  -€26 million, mainly on foreign currency derivatives.

On May 28, 2019, Veolia Environnement entered into a liquidity  contract with Kepler Cheuvreux, effective June 1, 2019, for an initial  period expiring on December 31, 2019, tacitly renewable thereafter for  periods of one year. 9.2  Equity attributable to owners  of the Company 9.2.1  Share capital The share capital is fully paid-up. 9.2.1.1  share capital increase dedicated  to employees In 2023, Veolia Environment carried out an initial share capital increase  on May 9, 2023 of approximately €4 million deducted from additional  paid-in capital, following the vesting to beneficiaries of rights to  performance shares granted by decision of the Board of Directors on  May 5, 2020, increasing the share capital to €3,576,919,375. On December 13, 2023, Veolia Environnement performed a second  share capital increase of approximately €222 million, including issue  premiums, as part of the 2023 Sequoia employee share ownership  plan, using the delegation of authority granted by the Combined  General Meeting of April 27, 2023, increasing the share capital to  €3,627,058,335. The expenses relating to this transaction were  deducted from additional paid-in capital for approximately €1 million. In 2022, Veolia Environment carried out an initial share capital  increase on May 2, 2022 of €4 million deducted from additional paid- in capital, following the vesting to beneficiaries of rights to  performance shares granted by decision of the Board of Directors on  April 30, 2019, increasing the share capital to €3,502,858,580.

The  expenses relating to this transaction have been deducted from  additional paid-in capital for €1 million. 9.2.1.2  Number of shares outstanding and par value The number of shares outstanding was 714,574,367 as of December 31,  2022 and 725,411,667 as of December 31, 2023. The par value of each  share is €5. 9.2.1.3  Authorized but unissued shares For the financial management of Veolia Environnement, resolutions  authorizing share capital increases approved every two years by Veolia  Environnement’s General Shareholders' Meeting are intended to  authorize the Board of Directors to increase the share capital subject  to certain conditions and limits. They allow the nature of financial  instruments issued to be adapted in line with financing requirements  and the situation of the French and international capital markets. These resolutions, approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting of  June 15, 2022, are broadly divided into two categories and subject to  the following share capital increase ceilings: ■resolutions authorizing share capital increases with preferential  subscription rights (PSR) subject to a maximum par value amount  capped at app€1.0 billion (i.e. approximately 30% of the Company’s  share capital on the date of the General Shareholders’ Meeting  that approved these resolutions); and ■resolutions authorizing share capital increases without PSR subject  to an overall maximum par value amount capped at €350 million  (i.e. approximately 10% of the Company’s share capital on the date  of the General Shareholders’ Meeting that approved these  resolutions). The use of these resolutions may not lead to share capital increase  transactions with or without PSR exceeding a second overall ceiling of  a par value amount of €1.0  billion (approximately 30% of the  Company’s share capital on the date of the General Shareholders’  Meeting that approved these resolutions). All these authorizations are suspended during a Public Tender Offer  filed by a third party and aimed at taking control of the Company. Fiscal years 2022 and 2023 210,171,514 shares could be issued pursuant to the share increase  authorizations granted by the General Shareholders’ Meeting of June  15, 2022, based on 700,571,716 shares comprising the share capital as of  June 15, 2022. 14,849,101  shares were issued in 2022 from among the 210,171,514  above-mentioned authorized shares. 10,837,300  shares were issued in 2023 from among the 210,171,514  above-mentioned authorized shares. 9.2.2  Offset of treasury shares  against equity Treasury shares are deducted from equity.

Pursuant to IAS  33, the weighted average number of shares  outstanding taken into account for the calculation of net income per  share is adjusted for the distribution of scrip dividends during the year.  Pursuant to IAS 33.9 and IAS 12, net income attributable to owners of  the Company has been adjusted to take into account the cost of the  coupon payable to holders of deeply subordinated securities issued by  Veolia Environnement.

Note 10 PROVISIONS Pursuant to IAS  37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent  Assets, a provision is recorded when, at the year end, the Group has a  current legal or implicit obligation to a third party as a result of a past  event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic  benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of  the obligation can be reliably estimated. Provisions cover all losses that are considered probable, and that relate  to litigation (taxation other than income tax, employee or other)  arising in the normal course of Veolia’s business operations, including  adjustments on uncertain tax positions identified but not yet  adjusted. As part of its obligations under public services contracts, Veolia  generally has contractual obligations for the maintenance and repair  of the installations it manages. The resulting maintenance and repair  costs are analyzed in accordance with IAS 37 on provisions and, where  necessary, a provision for contractual commitments is recorded where  there are delays in work to be performed. In the event of a restructuring, an obligation exists if, prior to the  period end, the restructuring has been announced and a detailed plan  produced or implementation has commenced. Future operating costs  are not provided. Provisions for closure and post-closure costs encompass the legal and  contractual obligations of the Group on the completion of operating  activities at a site (primarily site rehabilitation provisions) and, more  generally, expenditure associated with environmental protection  (provision for environmental risks).  In the case of provisions for rehabilitation of landfill facilities, Veolia  accounts for the obligation to restore a site as waste is deposited,  recording a non-current asset component. This asset is amortized  during the fiscal year based on its depletion. The costs included take  account of the technical and operating characteristics of the sites, as  well as applicable regulatory requirements. The monitoring period  following the closure of a landfill site depends on the country where  the Group operates (France: 30 years; UK: 60 years). Inflation is taken  into account in the total cost calculation and, depending on the  projected expenditure schedule, a discount rate is applied (based on  the country and flow maturities). Provisions are calculated, by site, at  the reporting date, taking account of the landfill site fill rate, total  estimated costs per year, the scheduled closure date and the discount  rate and are recorded progressively over the operating period. Provisions giving rise to an outflow after more than one year are  discounted if the impact is material. Discount rates reflect current  assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the  liability. The unwinding of the discount is recorded in the Consolidated  Income Statement in “Other financial income and expenses”.

Deferred tax assets arising from timing differences are only  recognized when it is probable that: ■there are sufficient taxable timing differences within the same tax  group or tax entity that are expected to reverse in the same periods  as the expected reversal of such deductible timing differences or in  the periods when the deferred tax assets arising from tax losses  can be carried back or forward; or ■the Group is likely to generate sufficient future taxable profits  against which the asset can be offset. At each reporting date, the Group reviews the recoverable amount of  deferred tax assets arising from material tax losses carried-forward. Deferred tax assets arising from these tax losses are no longer  recognized or are reduced when required by the specific facts and  circumstances of each company or tax group concerned, and  particularly when: ■the forecast period and uncertainties regarding the economic  environment no longer enable the probability of utilization to be  assessed; ■the companies have not started utilizing the losses; ■the forecast utilization period exceeds the carry forward period  authorized by tax legislation; or ■offset against future taxable profits is uncertain due to the risk of  different interpretations of the application of tax legislation. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of  changes in prevailing tax laws and rates at the year end. Deferred tax  balances are not discounted.

The Group assesses income tax risks in accordance with IFRIC  23,  notably by considering that the tax authorities will conduct an audit  and will have full knowledge of all relevant information. The tax authorities have carried out various tax audits in respect of  both consolidated tax groups and individual entities. To date, none of  these reviews have led to liabilities to the tax authorities materially in  excess of amounts estimated during the review of tax risks.  In estimating the risk as of December 31, 2023, the Group took account  of the expenses that could arise as a consequence of these audits,  based on a technical analysis of the positions defended by the Group  before the tax authorities. The Group periodically reviews the risk  estimate in view of developments in the audits and legal proceedings. 11.4  Pillar 2 Directive The 2024 Finance Act (Article 33 of Law no. 2023-1322 of December 29,  2023) enacted the Pillar 2 Directive (Council Directive (EU) 2022/2523 of  December 14, 2022) which aims to introduce a global minimum tax.  Due to the amount of its revenue, the Group falls within the scope of  this new legislation. A methodology analysis was performed to determine the resulting  financial impacts. As the Group’s effective tax rate was 29.3% in 2023, the financial  impact of this legislation is not material and should not have a  material negative effect on the Group’s income statement. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements 434 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 437 ===== Note 12 CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES In accordance with IAS 37 criteria, management does not consider it  appropriate to record a provision or, as the case  may be, an additional  provision, or to recognize deferred income with respect to the  following legal, administrative or arbitration proceedings as of  December 31, 2023, due to the uncertain nature of their outcome.  The main contingent assets and liabilities relating to legal,  administrative or arbitration proceedings are presented below:  North America United States – Water – Flint  In November 2011, the Governor of Michigan declared the City of Flint,  Michigan (“Flint”) to be in financial difficulty and appointed an  emergency manager (“Emergency Manager”) for Flint. In an attempt  to save money, the Emergency Manager decided in 2013 to switch the  city’s water supply source (previously provided by Detroit) to the Flint  River on an interim basis as part of a long-term plan to switch to water  from Lake Huron. In 2013, Flint hired the engineering firm Lockwood, Andrews &  Newman (“LAN”) to prepare the Flint water plant to switch water  sources. In April 2014, the Flint water plant began treating Flint River  water for distribution to its residents. Following the switch to Flint River water, Flint residents began to  complain about its odor, taste and appearance.  Between August and  December 2014, Flint experienced a number of water quality issues  resulting in violations of National Primary Drinking Water Regulations,  including “Total Trihalomethanes” (“TTHM”) (which are disinfection  byproducts) maximum contaminant level violations. In February 2015, Flint hired a US subsidiary of the Company, Veolia  Water North America Operating Services, LLC (“VWNAOS”), to produce  a report, which included a discussion of residual effects of the  chlorination process, discoloration and taste and odor issues. This one- time review (invoiced at USD $40,000) was completed by VWNAOS in  approximately four weeks. Throughout that time, and subsequently,  Flint continued to retain LAN as its primary water engineering  consultant. In December 2014 and during 2015, LAN developed a  treatment plan for the Flint River water and submitted reports to Flint  that addressed compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act. In its  plan and reports, LAN did not raise or address any concerns that Flint’s  new water supply could create problems with lead levels in the  drinking water. On February 18, 2015, VWNAOS issued an interim report based, among  other things, on tests performed exclusively by Flint, which showed  that the city was in compliance with the Lead & Copper rule. This  report included a statement that the drinking water was “safe” in that  it complied “with state and federal standards and required testing”.  During that evening’s public meeting, which was organized by the  Flint City Council Public Works Committee, VWNAOS employees  communicated to the public the results of VWNAOS’ interim report. In parallel, Flint conducted lead tests at the home of a Flint resident  which revealed high levels of lead in the water but did not share these  results with VWNAOS. On March 12, 2015, VWNAOS delivered its final report to Flint, which  was subsequently made available to the public. In its report, VWNAOS  issued a broad set of recommendations to address TTHM compliance  and improve water quality related to taste, odor and discoloration. The  report also recommended that Flint work with the State regulators  and Flint’s engineering firm to establish a corrosion control plan. Most  of these recommendations were ignored by Flint until late 2015, when  the government ordered certain measures be taken in response to  reports of lead in Flint’s water.   On June 24, 2015, an employee of the U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency issued a memorandum summarizing the available information  regarding measures taken by Flint and several governmental agencies  in response to high lead levels in Flint’s drinking water reported by a  Flint resident in February 2015. On September 25, 2015, Flint issued a lead advisory to the residents of  Flint regarding the presence of lead in the drinking water. On October 16, 2015, Flint switched its water supply source back to the  Detroit water system. On October 21, 2015, the office of the Governor of the State of  Michigan commissioned the Flint Water Advisory Task Force, a group  of experts from a variety of disciplines, to conduct an independent  review of the Flint water crisis, including lead contamination of the  water. On March 21, 2016, the Flint Water Advisory Task Force issued its final  report, drafted after interviewing numerous individuals and reviewing  many documents. The report concluded that the responsibility for the  Flint water crisis rested largely with several governmental agencies  and Flint. The report concluded that the Michigan Department of  Environmental Quality and the City of Flint did not require the  implementation of corrosion control when the source of the water  supply was changed to the Flint River, which the Task Force found was  contrary to requirements imposed by a federal law known as the Lead  & Copper Rule.Since February 2016, numerous individual complaints  and putative class actions have been filed in Michigan state and  federal courts by Flint residents against a number of defendants,  including the State of Michigan, the Michigan Department of  Environmental Quality, Flint, LAN and three of the US subsidiaries of  the Company, Veolia North America Inc., VWNAOS and Veolia North  America LLC (collectively “VNA”). Although the Company has been named in several actions mentioned  above, it has not been served and is not an active party to any of these  actions. Only the three U.S. subsidiaries of the Company are active  parties in these actions. In November 2020, the plaintiffs in the putative class actions and  individual actions (both state and federal) reached a settlement with  some defendants in these actions, including the State of Michigan and  Flint, but not VNA, nor the engineering firm, LAN. This settlement was  approved by the federal judge in the amount of $626.25 million. In July  2023, LAN informed the federal and state courts that it had reached a  settlement agreement in principle with the plaintiffs, without  specifying the details of such agreement. Proceedings against LAN  were subsequently stayed. The proceedings will, however, continue with regard to those who are  not parties to the settlement, including VNA. The cause of action in  the federal and state proceedings is professional negligence. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 435  ===== PAGE 438 ===== Civil Actions in the United States District Court for  the Eastern District of Michigan (Federal Court)  Individual actions: Actions brought by individually represented  plaintiffs have been organized into a bellwether process, under which  a series of trials brought by a small number of representative plaintiffs  will be held. The first of these began in February 2022. On 11 August  2022, after the jury informed the court that it was unable to reach a  unanimous verdict, the Federal Magistrate Judge overseeing the  deliberations declared a mistrial. This first bellwether trial was initially  scheduled for a retrial, it was subsequently adjourned sine die at the  request of the plaintiffs. Further bellwether trials with new groups of  plaintiffs are planned, beginning in October 2024. Issues class action: In August 2021, the court certified an issues class  action with respect to VNA. The issues class action only addressed  some specific common questions regarding elements of VNA’s alleged  liability. The trial for the issues class action was scheduled for several  weeks starting in mid-February 2024. In early February, VNA and the  attorneys representing the class requested a suspension of the issues  class proceedings, as an agreement in principle for settlement had  been  reached  between  the  parties.  The  proceedings  were  subsequently stayed by the federal court. This settlement provides for: (i) a payment of $25 million to the plaintiffs in the issues class action,  which will result in the termination of the issues class action as well as  the putative class action before the state court; and (ii) a payment of $1.5 million to individual minor plaintiffs represented  by the lawyer representing the class, within a limit of 1,000 plaintiffs,  equalling $1,500 for each. This settlement agreement is subject to the final approval of the  federal court, which is likely to take several months’ time. Civil Actions in Circuit Court for the Seventh  Judicial Circuit, Genesee County, Michigan  (State Court)  Individual actions and putative class action: In parallel to the actions in  federal court, claims filed by individual plaintiffs and a putative class  are pending in state court. No trial date has been set for any of these  state court cases. The putative class action will also be subject to  termination if the above-mentioned settlement agreement is  approved by the federal court. Civil action brought by the Michigan Attorney General: In June 2016,  the State of Michigan’s Attorney General filed a “parens patriae” civil  action in state court against several corporations, including VNA and  the Company itself, alleging certain acts and omissions related to the  Flint water crisis. After unilaterally dismissing that action, the  Attorney General filed a new action in August 2016. The Attorney  General then agreed to dismiss the Company without prejudice from  that action. After the 2018 election of a new state Governor and  Attorney General, the Attorney General filed an amended complaint  against the Company and VNA, among others. The Company has not  been served with that complaint and is not currently an active party in  this action, but VNA is. Following motions to dismiss, the only  remaining causes of action brought by the Attorney General against  VNA are professional negligence and unjust enrichment. No trial date  has been set. The Group strongly contests the merits of claims in all of these civil  proceedings. Criminal actions  Criminal proceedings were initiated by the former Attorney General  against fifteen employees of the State of Michigan and the City of  Flint for their conduct related to the water crisis in Flint. Of these  fifteen employees, seven pleaded guilty. On June 13, 2019, the new  Attorney General dropped all charges against the remaining eight  employees.  In mid-January 2021, new criminal indictments were issued against  nine former Flint and state officials. In June 2022, the Michigan  Supreme Court ruled that the prosecution’s use of the “one-man  grand jury” method of indictment violated Michigan law. As a  consequence of this ruling, the indictments against these nine former  officials have been dismissed. Insurance  These lawsuits have been reported to the insurers. Some of the  insurers, relying on an exclusion clause contained in their policies,  have made it known that they do not intend on covering the financial  consequences of VNA’s liability, if this were to be established, for  damages resulting from lead.  The Group strongly contests this position, arguing that this exclusion  clause is not applicable in the current situation and that, in any case,  the clause is void as it is contrary to both the mandatory rule of article  L.113-1 of the French Insurance Code, requiring that the exclusion shall  be “formal and limited” and contrary to its interpretation by the  courts. In June 2023, the Company and VNA filed a request for arbitration in  order to resolve their dispute with their insurers. The arbitration  proceedings are ongoing. Central and Eastern Europe  Lithuania - Energy  Between 2000 and 2003, the Lithuanian subsidiaries of the Group,  UAB Vilniaus Energija (“UVE”) and UAB Litesko (“Litesko”), signed a  number of contracts with Lithuanian cities, of which the most  significant was with the city of Vilnius (“Vilnius”) in 2002 to rent,  operate and modernize the heating and electricity production and  distribution infrastructure.  The Group made significant investments  over the years for which it expects the cost incurred to be taken into  account and a return on its investment. Since 2009, the government publicly, and on numerous occasions,  accused the Group of being responsible for high heating prices by  waging a sustained campaign against it.  Several steps were thus  taken by the public authorities against the Lithuanian subsidiaries of  the Group, among others: ■a €19 million fine imposed on UVE by the Competition Council; ■the transfer of ownership without compensation of the individual  heat exchange sub-stations invested by UVE;  ■the unilateral reduction of the heating prices to capture the  savings realized with the help of a smoke condenser invested by  UVE;  ■the retroactive annulment of the heating prices applied by UVE for  the period 2011-2015. ■the annulment of the amendments extending the duration of the  contract concluded between Litesko and the city of Alytus and the  transfer to Alytus of the assets invested by Litesko. All the harmful decisions taken against the Lithuanian subsidiaries of  the Group are subject to pending challenges or appeals before the  local courts. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements 436 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 439 ===== In this context, the Company and its subsidiaries also had to initiate  the arbitral proceedings described below. ICSID arbitration In January 2016, the Company, Veolia Energie International (successor  in law to Veolia Baltics and Eastern Europe), UVE and Litesko  (collectively “the Companies”) filed a request for arbitration against  Lithuania before the International Center for Settlement of  Investment Disputes (“ICSID”). To date, the Companies’ claim amounts to circa €91M (not including  interest). For its part, Lithuania withdrew its €150M counterclaim.  This  procedure is still pending. In June 2018, Lithuania filed an objection to the arbitral tribunal’s  jurisdiction, based on a decision rendered by the European Court of  Justice on March 6, 2018 in the Achmea case, in which the Court ruled  that investor-state arbitration provisions in intra-EU bilateral  investment treaties are incompatible with European Union law.  In a  declaration dated January 15, 2019, the EU Member States indicated  their intention to terminate the intra-EU bilateral investment treaties  by December 2019. On May 5th 2020, a vast majority of Member states  – including France and Lithuania – signed a plurilateral treaty  organizing the termination of the intra-EU bilateral investment  treaties. The treaty came into effect in France on August 28, 2021 and  in Lithuania on September 4, 2021. These developments may have an  impact on the ICSID arbitration and, as the case may be, on the  enforcement of the future award as well as on the proceedings  described hereafter. In July 2020, Lithuania initiated a legal action against the Companies  and other respondents before the Vilnius regional court, by which it  seeks compensation for damages worth over € 240 million. Lithuania  has indicated that this action is a transfer of the counterclaims it  previously withdrew from the ICSID arbitration, following the Achmea  decision. At that time, only VEI, UVE and Litesko had been served with  Lithuania’s writ of summons. The Company was later served in May  2023. The Companies vigorously contest Lithuania’s claims. Following  several divergent rulings by the Lithuanian courts,Lithuania’s claim  was finally declared admissible in October 2023. In November 2023,  the Vilnius court, following a request submitted by the Companies,  stayed the proceedings pending the awards in the ICSID and SCC  arbitrations (see below). Lithuania has filed an appeal against this  stay. In February 2024, the Vilnius court of appeal confirmed the stay  of the proceedings pending the ICSID award. SCC arbitration In November 2016, in the context of the Vilnius agreement which  expiration date was nearly reached (March 2017), the Company and  UVE filed a request for arbitration before the Stockholm Chamber of  Commerce (“SCC”) to secure the appointment of an independent  expert to evaluate the condition of the assets.  That SCC arbitration  has since expanded in scope to address claims by the Company, UVE,  Vilnius and municipal company VST (“VST”) in connection with the  Vilnius lease. In this arbitration, the Company and UVE filed a claim for an  indemnity of circa €22 million.  For their part, Vilnius and VST  submitted counterclaims quantified to date at circa €660M. On  November 30, 2023, the SCC tribunal unanimously rendered an award  rejecting 95% of Vilnius' and VST's counterclaims and upholding more  than 50% of the claims made by the Company and UVE. As a result,  the latter have paid Vilnius and VST a net amount after compensation  of approximately €34.7 million, inclusive of interest. This decision is  now final, as no petition to set aside the award was filed. Italy / Africa Middle East  Veolia Propreté vs. Republic of Italy   In October 2007, Veolia Propreté made very significant investments in  Italy through long-term concession contracts for the construction and  management of waste recovery and power generation facilities in the  regions of Calabria and Tuscany.  The Italian subsidiaries of Veolia  Propreté were unable to execute the concession contracts due to the  serious failures of the Italian authorities. In 2014, these actions caused  subsidiaries’ bankruptcy and the destruction of Veolia Propreté’s  investment. In June 2018, Veolia Propreté commenced an against the Republic of  Italy arbitration before the International Center for Settlement of  Investment Disputes alleging breaches of the Energy Charter Treaty.  The tribunal was constituted in January 2019. To date, Veolia Propreté  claims amounts to circa €400M plus interests. The arbitration is  underway. In September 2021, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled  that the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism provided for in  the Energy Charter Treaty is incompatible with EU Law and does not  apply to intra-EU disputes.  This development may affect the  enforcement of the future award. Water technologies  VWT v. K+S Potash  On December 1, 2012, Veolia Water Technologies, Inc. (“VWT”) signed a  $324.5MUSD contract with K + S Potash Canada GP (“KSPC”) for the  design, supply and commissioning of a evaporation and crystallization  system, which includes 14 large evaporators and crystallizers (the  “Tanks”), for a potash mine then under construction by KSPC in the  province of Saskatchewan, Canada.  In this framework, a letter of  guarantee at first request was issued by VWT to the benefit of KSPC in  the amount of $14.6MUSD. On July 17, 2016, during the process of commissioning the Tanks, one  tank collapsed (the “Incident”).  A new replacement tank had to be  manufactured and installed.  The Incident also damaged other Tanks  and plant equipment, which had to be removed and replaced.  VWT  cooperated with KSPC to determine the cause of the incident.  The first  investigation, conducted by KSPC, identified a defect in the design of  the metal structure supporting the Tanks, for which VWT and one of  its subcontractors were responsible.  A second investigation conducted  by VWT, however, found a defect in the production of the concrete  bases to which the metal structure supporting the Tanks was affixed.   These concrete bases were in turn built by a subcontractor of KSPC.   VWT has repaired the damaged Tanks.  These repairs resulted in  significant contractual changes and additional costs.  Mid-June, 2017, a  second letter of guarantee at first request was issued by VWT to KSPC  in the amount of $15MUSD. Several procedures are currently in progress. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 437  ===== PAGE 440 ===== ADRIC Arbitration Procedure (ADR Institute  of Canada) On August 18, 2017, VWT filed a complaint with the ADRIC seeking  KSPC's reimbursement of the costs incurred by the contractual  modifications made to carry out repairs linked to the Incident, i.e.  $19MUSD.  Mid-January 2019, the arbitral tribunal accepted  jurisdiction over only some claims (approximately $13.6MUSD).  This  procedure is stayed due to proceedings initiated by KSCP before the  Court of Queen’s Bench for Saskatchewan (see below). Legal Proceedings (the Court of Queen’s Bench  for Saskatchewan and Paris Commercial Court)  On April 11, 2018, KSPC brought claims against VWT before the Court of  Queen’s Bench for Saskatchewan in the amount of $180MCAD  (approximately €119M) for consequential damages and additional  costs of repair in relation to the Incident. On January 18 2019, VWT  made a settlement offer to KSPC who refused the offer. On May 28, 2018, one of KSPC's subcontractors, AECON, sued KSPC  before the Court of Queen’s Bench for various claims for damages.  On  June 28, 2018, KSPC joined VWT as a third party to the proceedings in  an attempt to require VWT to indemnify KSPC for a minimum of  $466MCAD (approximately €318M) as well as for reimbursement of   sums already paid by KSPC to other subcontractors (the “Delay  Claim”). On March 25, 2020, KSPC brought claims against VWT before the Court  of Queen’s Bench for Saskatchewan for an amount quantified to date  at $4,6MCAD (approximately €3M). These new claims include an  equipment failure that occurred in November 2018 and alleged  corrosion in specific materials of the plant. In June 2020, VWT filed a  statement of defense before this court and contested these new  claims. In November 2019 and 2020, respectively, KSPC received payment  under the letters of guarantee. The Group strongly contests the merits of all these legal proceedings. These lawsuits have been notified to professional liability insurance  companies. After initially agreeing to cover the legal costs associated  with the Delay Claim, Lexington Insurance Company has initiated  arbitration proceedings seeking to avoid coverage and future defense  costs for the Delay Claim and for reimbursement of defense costs paid  to date on the Delay Claim. The arbitration hearing is currently  scheduled for the spring 2024 and we expect a final ruling from the  arbitration panel by the end of that year. VWT vigorously disputes  Lexington’s position. VWT v. Antero  In August 2015, Veolia Water Technologies Inc. (“VWT”) and Antero  Resources Corporation (“Antero”) entered into a Design Build  Agreement (“DBA”) for a revised contract sum of USD $255.8 million  for the treatment of water associated with the drilling, production and  general development of shale gas at the Clearwater facility located in  Pennsboro West Virginia (“Facility”).   VWT achieved the substantial completion of the Facility on March 15,  2019. The Facility was fine-tuned over the following months. The final  performance test was scheduled to begin on September 16, 2019 but,  by a letter dated  September 12, 2019, Antero terminated the DBA. VWT  considers this termination to have been made without proper  contractual notice or a valid reason. On March 13, 2020 VWT filed suit against Antero in the State  District  Court, City and County of Denver, Colorado, in the United States,  alleging breach of contract and seeking damages of USD $118 million.  On the same day and in front of the same tribunal, Antero filed suit  against VWT and claimed that VWT breached its contractual  obligations under the DBA. In this lawsuit, Antero asserts claims under  theories of fraud and breach of contract. It claims alternatively USD  $451 million or USD $367 million in damages based on different  valuation methods.  VWT’s claims have been consolidated with Antero’s claims.  By a final  judgment dated January 27, 2023, the State District Court, City and  County of Denver, Colorado ordered VWT to pay to Antero on the  grounds of fraud and breach of contract, a principal amount of USD  $242 million, plus interests (such interests including USD $67 million of  pre-judgment interests) and Antero’s fees and costs. By a revised  judgment dated May 3, 2023, reflecting the outcome of a post-trial  motion successfully filed by VWT, the principal amount of the  judgment was reduced to USD $215 million and the pre-judgment  interests were reduced to USD $65 million. The effects of the  judgment are stayed.  VWT vigorously contests all of the tribunal’s findings that led the  tribunal to rule in favor of Antero and appealed the decision before the  Colorado Court of Appeals at the end of May 2023. In June 2023,  Antero filed a cross appeal. The appellate proceedings are ongoing. This dispute has been reported to the insurers. After initially accepting  to cover the legal expenses in connection with those proceedings, one  of the insurers ultimately disputed its coverage obligation and  initiated arbitral proceedings to that end in October 2021. On July 10,  2023, the arbitral tribunal dismissed the insurer’s claim and ruled that  the insurer’s dispute of its coverage obligation was ill-grounded.

This statutory auditors’ report includes information required by French law, such as  information about the appointment of the Statutory Auditors. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with,  French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. Year ended December 31, 2023 To the Shareholders’ Meeting of Veolia Environnement, Opinion In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your  Shareholders’ Meetings, we have audited the accompanying  consolidated financial statements of Veolia Environnement for the  year ended December 31, 2023. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and  fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of  the Group as of December 31, 2023 and of the results of its operations  for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial  Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. The audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the  Audit Committee. Basis for opinion Audit framework We conducted our work in accordance with professional standards  applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have  obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our  opinion. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the  “Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated  Financial Statements” section of our report. Independence We  conducted  our  audit  engagement  in  compliance  with  independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (code de  commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (code de déontologie) for  statutory auditors, for the period from January 1, 2023 to the date of  our report, and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non- audit services referred to in Article 5 (1) of Regulation (EU) no. 537/2014. Justification of Assessments - Key Audit  Matters In accordance with the requirements of Articles L.  821-53 and  R.  821-180 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce)  relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the  key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in  our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of  the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as  how we addressed those risks. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the  consolidated financial statements as a whole, approved in the  conditions mentioned above, and in forming our opinion thereon, and  we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the  consolidated financial statements. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements 444 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 447 ===== Assessment of the recoverable amount of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and operating  financial assets Risk identified As of December 31, 2023, the net carrying amount of your Group’s intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and  operating financial assets is €8,500 million, €17,134 million and €1,393 million, respectively. These assets primarily consist  of intangible assets and operating financial assets under concession arrangements (IFRIC 12) and the production and  distribution assets necessary for the performance of contacts in your Group’s three businesses. These assets are tested for  impairment by your Group where there is indication that they may have suffered a loss in value (non-performance of a major long-term contract under the conditions provided, operating technical difficulties, default by a counterparty for  operating financial assets, etc.) as disclosed in Notes 7.2, 7.3 and 5.2.1 to the consolidated financial statements. The  recoverable amount generally corresponds to the value in use, which is equal to the present value of future cash flows  expected to be derived from these assets or groups of assets as disclosed in Notes 5.2.1 and 5.4 to the consolidated  financial statements. Determining value in use requires your Group to make significant judgments; we have therefore  considered the valuation of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and operating financial assets to be a key  audit matter. Our response We assessed the compliance of the methodology adopted by your Group with prevailing accounting standards. We also  performed a critical review of the implementation of this methodology and notably assessed the assets identified with  regard to: • changes in economic performance; • the justification of differences between forecast and actual results for prior periods; • where appropriate, the reasonableness of forecast cash flows given the economic and financial context in which the  contracts are performed, in particular by analyzing the main data and assumptions underlying the estimates  (assumptions regarding changes in volumes, prices, direct costs and investment) and the reasonableness of discount  rates adopted with respect to long-term growth rates and market data for each geographic zone. Contingent liabilities relating to litigation in the United States (Flint), K+S Potash and Antero, in Lithuania Risk identified Your Group is regularly involved in major litigation with its customers and third parties during the course of its activities.  The disputes relating to legal, administration or arbitration proceedings disclosed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial  statements, represent a greater exposure for your Group due to their amount or the parties involved. As disclosed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, a provision is recognized at the reporting date if the  Group has a current legal or implicit obligation to a third party as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of  resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be  reliably estimated. In the context of these disputes, estimates made by your Group when determining any provisions were  made in a context of uncertainty surrounding the outcome. Where the outcome of legal, administration or arbitration proceedings is uncertain, the Group considers that in  accordance with IAS 37 criteria, a provision, or where applicable an additional provision, should not be recognized in  respect of these proceedings, and they should be disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as indicated in Note 12. We considered the contingent liabilities relating to this litigation to be a key audit matter due to the amounts concerned  and the management judgment involved in assessing the uncertain outcome of these litigation. Our response As part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our work consisted in: • assessing the procedures implemented by the Company to identify and inventory all risks; • obtaining an understanding of the risk analysis performed by your Group, of the corresponding documentation and  the written consultations from external advisors; • analyzing the information on the ongoing proceedings and the probable financial consequences communicated to us  by your Group’s external advisors in response to our circularization letters; • assessing the main risks identified and the assumptions adopted by your Group and their accounting treatment; • assessing the information regarding these risks disclosed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 445  ===== PAGE 448 ===== Specific verifications We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards  applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and  regulations of the information pertaining to the Group presented in  the management report of the Board of Directors. We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its  consistency with the consolidated financial statements. We attest that the consolidated non-financial performance statement  required by Article L.225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de  commerce) is included in the information relating to the Group in the  management report, it being specified that, in accordance with the  provisions of Article L. 823-10 of this Code, we have verified neither the  fair presentation nor the consistency with the consolidated financial  statements of the information contained therein. This information  should be reported on by an independent third party. Other Legal and Regulatory Verifications  or Information Format of presentation of the consolidated  financial statements intended to be included  in the annual financial report We have also verified, in accordance with the professional standard  applicable in France relating to the procedures performed by the  statutory auditor relating to the annual and consolidated financial  statements presented in the European single electronic format, that  the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to  be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article  L.451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code (code monétaire  et financier), prepared under the responsibility of the Chief Executive  Officer, complies with the single electronic format defined in the  European Delegated Regulation No 2019/815 of December 17, 2018. As  it relates to consolidated financial statements, our work includes  verifying that the tagging of these consolidated financial statements  complies with the format defined in the above delegated regulation. Based on the work we have performed, we conclude that the  presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be  included in the annual financial report complies, in all material  respects, with the European single electronic format. Due to the technical limits inherent to the macro-tagging of  consolidated financial statements in accordance with the European  single electronic format, it is possible that the content of certain tags  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are not  presented in an identical manner to the accompanying consolidated  financial statements. Moreover, we have no responsibility to verify that the consolidated  financial statements that will ultimately be included by your Company  in the annual financial report filed with the AMF are in agreement  with those on which we have performed our work. Appointment of the Statutory Auditors We were appointed as Statutory Auditors of Veolia Environnement by  the Shareholders’ Meetings of December 18, 1995 for KPMG S.A. and  December 23, 1999 for Ernst & Young et Autres. As of December 31, 2023, KPMG S.A. was in the twenty-ninth year of  total uninterrupted engagement and Ernst & Young et Autres was in  the twenty-fifth year. Responsibilities of Management and  Those Charged with Governance for  the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation  of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with  International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the  European Union, and for such internal control as management  determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated  financial statements that are free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is  responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going  concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern  and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected  to liquidate the Company or to cease its operations. The Accounts and Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the  financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control  and risk management systems and, where applicable, its internal  audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures. The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of  Directors. Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities  for the Audit of the Consolidated  Financial Statements Objectives and audit approach Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements.  Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the  consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material  misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but  is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with  professional standards will always detect a material misstatement  when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are  considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could  reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users  taken on the basis of these financial statements. As specified in Article L. 821-55 of the French Commercial Code (code  de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the  viability of the Company or the quality with which the Company’s  management has conducted or will conduct the affairs of the entity. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional  standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises  professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: ■identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the  consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error,  designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks,  and obtains audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to  provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material  misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting  from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional  omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; ■obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit  in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on  the effectiveness of the internal control; ■evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the  reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures  made by management in the financial statements; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements/ Notes to the consolidated financial statements 446 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 449 ===== ■assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going  concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence  obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events  or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s  ability to continue as a going concern.     These conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to  the date of his audit report.     However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to  cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor  concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement  to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in  the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not  provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein; ■evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial  statements and assesses whether these statements represent the  underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair  presentation; ■obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the  financial information of the entities or business activities within  the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial  statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction,  supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated  financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these  consolidated financial statements. Report to the Accounts and Audit Committee We submit a report to the Accounts and Audit Committee which  includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the  audit program implemented, as well as significant audit findings. We  also bring to its attention any significant deficiencies in internal  control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures  that we have identified. Our report to the Accounts and Audit Committee includes the risks of  material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of  most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements  of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters.  We describe these matters in the audit report. We also provide the Accounts and Audit Committee with the  declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) no. 537/2014,  confirming our independence pursuant to the rules applicable in  France as defined in particular by Articles L.821-27 to L.821-34 of the  French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and in the French Code  of Ethics (code de déontologie) for Statutory Auditors. Where  appropriate, we discuss with the Accounts and Audit Committee the  risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence,  and the related safeguards.

An initial payment was received in respect of the transaction balance  on March 24, 2023 of €106 million. The final amount of the earn-out was received on June 30, 2023 for  €284 million.  In addition, following the Public Tender Offer, legal and financial  restructuring transactions led to a review of inter-company financing.. 1.2  Treasury shares Due to the increase in the share price, Veolia Environnement  recognized a financial impairment reversal of €69 million in 2023,  based on an average share price of €29.28 in December 2023,  compared with €24.51 in December 2022. The gross value of the 10,362,269 treasury shares held as of December  31, 2023 was €289 million, impaired in the amount of €16 million,  giving a net carrying amount of €273 million. NOTE 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODS 2.1  Basis of preparation The Company financial statements for the year ended December 31,  2023 are prepared and presented in accordance with general  accounting principles applicable in France, as set-out in Regulation no.  2014-03 issued by the French Accounting Standards Authority (Autorité  des Normes Comptables, ANC). Amounts recorded in the accounts are valued on a historical cost basis  in accordance with the true and fair principle. The accounting period ends on December 31, 2023 and has a duration  of 12 months. Veolia Environnement, whose registered office is located at 21, rue La  Boétie, 75008 Paris, prepared Group consolidated financial statement  under the number: 403 210 032 RCS Paris. A copy of the financial statements may be obtained at the Company’s  administrative headquarters at 30, rue Madeleine Vionnet, 93300  Aubervilliers. 2.2  Main accounting policies 2.2.1  Non-current assets Non-current assets: on initial recognition in the accounts, non-current  assets are recorded at acquisition cost if acquired for valuable  consideration, at market value if acquired for nil consideration or at  production cost if produced by the Company. Intangible assets: in the course of major IT projects, the Company  incurs project costs which it capitalizes when they satisfy certain  criteria. These costs are not amortized prior to asset commissioning. Technical merger losses are recognized according to the nature of the  underlying asset to facilitate monitoring over time, in accordance with  the new rules defined by ANC Regulation no. 2015-06. Technical  merger losses are amortized on the same basis as the underlying asset  to which the unrealized capital loss relates. The share of the loss  allocated to non-depreciable assets is not amortized but is impaired,  where appropriate, in accordance with Article 745-8 of the French  General Chart of Accounts. Property, plant and equipment: depreciation is calculated over the  expected period of use. More specifically, fixtures and fittings and  installations are depreciated on a straight-line basis over periods of 6  to 10 years. Furniture and office equipment are depreciated on a  straight-line basis over periods of between five and ten years. Finally,  vehicles are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 5 years. Equity investments: this heading records the acquisition cost of  securities held by Veolia Environnement in companies over which it  exercises control or significant influence, directly or indirectly. At the date of entry into Company assets, the gross value of “Equity  investments” is their acquisition cost. The Company has elected to  capitalize costs relating to the acquisition of equity investments. At  the closing date, the value in use of equity investments is determined  by the Company based on criteria encompassing profitability, growth  perspectives, the net assets of the Company held and the stock market  value of the securities acquired, where applicable. Where the net  carrying amount of an equity investment exceeds its value in use, an  impairment is recorded in the amount of the difference. Pursuant to the change in tax regime applicable to equity investment  acquisition costs introduced by Article 21 of the 2007 Finance Act and  completed by Article 209 of the French General Tax Code and based on  Opinion no. 2007-C of June 15, 2007 issued by the Urgent Issues  Taskforce of the French National Accounting Institute (Conseil  National de la Comptabilité), Veolia Environnement has recognized  the tax deferral of security acquisition costs over a period of 5 years in  the accelerated depreciation account since January 1, 2007. Other long-term loans and investments: treasury shares are recorded  in long-term investment securities when earmarked for external  growth operations. They are recognized at acquisition cost and an  impairment is recorded if their market value is less than their net  carrying amount. Term accounts not classified as cash equivalents are recorded in  “Other long-term loans and investments”. Merger losses relating to financial assets are recognized in “Other  long-term loans and investments” and are considered to have an  unlimited duration. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Company financial statements/ Notes to the company financial statements VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 457  ===== PAGE 460 ===== Pursuant to Articles 214-15, 214-17 and 745-8 of ANC Regulation no.  2015-06, Veolia Environnement performs an impairment test at each  period end to assess the net carrying amount of the asset compared  with its current value. Where the current value of the asset is less than  its net carrying amount, an impairment is recognized in the amount of  the difference and offset in priority against the share of the merger  loss. Where the current value of the asset cannot be determined separately,  the current value of the group of assets is determined. 2.2.2  Marketable securities and Cash  at bank and In hand Marketable securities: marketable securities comprise treasury shares  held in respect of Group savings plans, share option plans and other  highly liquid investment securities. Treasury shares are classified as  marketable securities when purchased for presentation to employees  under share option plans and employee savings plans benefiting  certain employees. Shares acquired and sold under the liquidity  contract generate movements in the “marketable securities” account.  Marketable securities are recognized at acquisition cost and an  impairment provision is recorded if their market value is less than  their net carrying amount. Cash at bank and in hand: term accounts classified as cash equivalents  are recorded in Cash at bank and in hand. 2.2.3  Foreign currency-denominated  transactions During the year, foreign currency-denominated transactions are  translated into euro at the spot exchange rate. Liabilities, receivables and cash balances denominated in currencies  other than the euro are recorded in the balance sheet at their euro  equivalent determined using year-end exchange rates. Gains and  losses resulting from the translation of foreign currency liabilities and  receivables at year-end exchange rates are recorded in “Unrealized  foreign exchange gains and losses”. In accordance with Article 420-7  of the French General Chart of Accounts, unrealized foreign exchange  gains and losses on foreign currency cash accounts are recognized  directly in foreign exchange gains and losses. Similarly, foreign  exchange gains and losses on subsidiary current accounts equivalent  in nature to cash accounts are recognized directly in foreign exchange  gains and losses, except where hedge accounting principles are  applied. Pursuant to ANC Regulation no. 2015-05, Veolia Environnement  applies hedge accounting to clearly identified and documented  matching foreign exchange positions, which seek to reduce the risk  associated with currency fluctuations. Accordingly, all foreign  exchange gains and losses calculated on liabilities and receivables and  related hedging transactions included in these matching positions are  recorded in dedicated unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses –  matching positions accounts. The corresponding increase or decrease in the value of treasury  instruments is recorded in the Treasury instruments – Assets or  Treasury instruments – Liabilities accounts. Furthermore, in order to comply with the matching settlement  principle, foreign exchange gains and losses realized on instruments  hedging underlying items not yet matured are recorded in new  balance sheet accounts in the French General Chart of Accounts:  Change in the value of treasury instruments – Assets and Change in  the value of treasury instruments – Liabilities. On maturity of the  underlying items, the foreign exchange gains and losses realized on  the corresponding hedging instruments are released to profit or loss. Pursuant to Article 628-11 of ANC Regulation no. 2014-03, when the  underlying is unwound, the gains/loss on the hedging instrument is  presented in the same section of the income statement (operating,  financial) as the hedged item. Hedge accounting is also applied to equity investments acquired in  foreign currency and hedged by borrowings or foreign exchange  derivatives in accordance with Article 628-8 of ANC Regulation no.  2014-03. Other liabilities, receivables and foreign currency derivatives not  forming part of matching hedge relationships are included in the  overall foreign exchange position per currency, as provided in Article  420-6 of the French General Chart of Accounts. For those transactions  with sufficiently close terms and conditions, the provision amount is  determined by limiting the excess of unrealized losses over unrealized  gains. This provision is calculated individually for each currency on  realizable items maturing in the same fiscal year. In the case of isolated open positions, a provision for foreign exchange  losses is only recorded in respect of unrealized losses at the accounts  closing. Finally, pursuant to Articles 946-65 and 947-75 of ANC Regulation no.  2015-05, foreign exchange gains and losses on commercial receivables  and payables and related hedging gains and losses are recorded in the  accounts: Foreign exchange gains or Foreign exchange losses on  commercial receivables and payables. Foreign exchange gains and losses on financial transactions and  related hedging gains and losses continue to be recorded in the  accounts, Foreign exchange gains or Foreign exchange losses on  financial items. 2.2.4  Recognition of financial  transactions Financial transactions (loans, borrowings, derivatives, etc.) are  recognized at the value date, with the exception of cash pooling  transactions with subsidiaries which are recognized at the trade date. Deeply-subordinated perpetual securities (TSSDI): these securities  represent perpetual bonds and are classified in equity equivalents.  Issue premiums are recognized in balance sheet assets. Accrued  interest is expensed in the accounting period to which it relates  through an accrued interest on bond issues account. Accrued interest  is recognized as a financial expense in the Income Statement. TSSDI  issue costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated  debt repayment period by Veolia Environnement, that is the period  from the debt issue date to the first reset date. Derivatives: Veolia Environnement hedges asset risks (acquisition of  securities in foreign currencies), balance sheet risks (financing of  subsidiaries in their local currency) and transaction risks (hedging of  commercial flows on its own account and for all its operating  subsidiaries). The Company has therefore adopted a strategy that  consists in backing foreign currency-denominated borrowings with  either assets denominated in the same currency or using foreign  exchange derivatives (forex swaps, currency forward contracts,  hedging options, cross currency swaps). All transaction flows are hedged, primarily by currency forward  contracts and forex swaps. Finally, market risks relating to interest  rate fluctuations are hedged by interest rate swaps or interest rate  caps and floors. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Company financial statements/ Notes to the company financial statements 458 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 461 ===== Interest rate derivatives: pursuant to ANC Regulation no. 2015-05,  income and expenses relating to the use of these instruments are  recognized in the income statement to match income and expenses  on the hedged transactions. These transactions are recognized as follows: ■transactions qualifying as hedges: • a provision for unrealized losses is not recognized as changes in  the value of the underlying item reduce the related risk; ■open-isolated positions: • unrealized losses, calculated individually for each instrument,  are provided in full, • unrealized gains on instruments are recognized in income on  the unwinding of the transaction only. Foreign currency derivatives: for hedging transactions, currency  financial instruments are valued by comparison with the closing  exchange rate defined by the European Central Bank. The difference  between the spot rate of the instrument and the closing rate is  recorded in the dedicated unrealized foreign exchange gains and  losses – matching position accounts and the difference between the  forward rate and the spot rate of the instrument is recorded in a  specific financial instruments account entitled “premium/discount”.  This distinguishes the interest rate impact from the currency impact.  The premium/discount is spread on a straight-line over the hedge  period and is classified in net financial expense. Realized gains and losses on currency transactions are recorded to  match the gains and losses on the hedged transactions. If the  underlying item has not matured, realized gains and losses on hedging  instruments are recorded in accounts created in the French Chart of  Accounts – Change in the value of treasury instruments – Assets and  Change in the value of treasury instruments – Liabilities. Where transactions do not qualify as hedges, the foreign exchange  derivatives are included in the overall foreign exchange position. 2.2.5  Valuation of provisions Provisions for contingencies and losses These provisions are valued at the best estimate of the outflow of  resources necessary to settle the obligation. When valuing a single  obligation in the presence of several valuation assumptions  concerning the outflow of resources necessary, the best estimate is  the most probable assumption. 2.2.6  Accrued expenses method  for personnel costs Accrued expense for incentives schemes The unit amount of incentive payments is defined: ■based on the results of Group subsidiaries for the following criteria: • current net income (Group share) compared to the 2023 budget, • 2023 purchase expenditure, excluding taxes, recorded for the  sheltered employment sector (France scope); ■based on the results and performance of Veolia Environnement for  the following criteria: • average number of training hours per employee in Veolia  Environnement for 2023, • participation rate in the Veolia Environnement employee  engagement survey in 2023, • employee engagement rate under the Veolia Environnement  engagement survey, • employee subscription rate to the Veolia Environnement  employee share ownership transaction in 2023. Based on the observed growth rate and other criteria, the level of  incentive payments is determined using a contractually defined chart.  The total amount of incentive payments provided is equal to the  individual amount determined above multiplied by the number of  beneficiaries communicated by the Human Resources Department. The maximum amount of the incentive scheme accrued expense  cannot exceed €5,000 gross per beneficiary and per fiscal year. Accrued expense for bonuses The accrued expense is determined based on the amount of bonuses  awarded in the previous year multiplied by an estimated percentage  change and changes in employee numbers. Accrued expense for paid leave  Entitlement to paid leave is earned and consumed in Veolia  Environnement in the calendar year. The new regulation concerning entitlement to paid leave earned  during periods of sick leave was taken into account from the date of  the Court of Appeal ruling of September 13, 2023, with the individual  counter of the relevant employees updated. Provisions  for  paid  leave  (including  related  social  security  contributions) are not recognized as they are not material in the  accounts at the end of December 2023. 2.2.7  Income from ordinary activities  and exceptional income Items concerning the ordinary activities of the Company, even if  exceptional in amount or frequency, are included in income from  ordinary activities. Only those items that do not concern the ordinary  activities of the Company are recognized in exceptional items. 2.2.8  Valuation of employee-related  commitments Pursuant to Article L.123-13 of the French Commercial Code, Veolia  Environnement has elected not to recognize a provision for retirement  benefits and other employee commitments. This information is  presented in off-balance sheet commitments in the notes to the  financial statements.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Company financial statements/ Notes to the company financial statements VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 469  ===== PAGE 472 ===== 6.3  Income tax and the  consolidated tax group Within  the  framework  of  a  tax  group  agreement,  Veolia  Environnement forms a tax group with those subsidiaries at least 95%  owned that have elected to adopt this regime. Veolia Environnement  is liable for the full income tax charge due by the resulting tax group. The income tax expense is allocated to the different entities  comprising the tax group according to the “neutrality” method. Each  subsidiary bears the tax charge to which it would have been liable if it  were not a member of the tax group. The parent company records its  own tax charge and the tax saving or additional charge resulting from  application of the tax group regime. The tax group election came into force on January 1, 2001 for a period  of five years and benefits from tacit renewal failing explicit  termination by Veolia Environnement at the end of the five-year  period. The application of the tax group regime in 2023 is reflected in the  Veolia Environnement financial statements by a tax saving in respect  of the subsidiaries of €170 million. A tax charge of €47 million corresponding to income tax and tax  credits not offset against current income tax was also recognized. 6.4  Net income Veolia Environnement reported net income of €155 million for fiscal  year 2023.

The commitment given takes into account the extension of the  legal retirement age following the pension reform. Veolia Environnement is required to grant the following types of  endorsement and guarantee: ■Operational or operating guarantees of €2.3 billion. These are commitments not relating to the financing of operations,  required in respect of contracts and markets and generally in respect  of the operations and activities of Group companies (bid bonds  accompanying tender offers, completion or performance bonds given  on the signature of contracts or concession arrangements and  counter-guarantees granted by Veolia Environnement to insurance  companies that issue bonds on behalf of its subsidiaries). This type of  guarantee also includes letters of credit delivered by financial  institutions to Group creditors, customers and suppliers for their  business requirements or to guarantee various commitments such as  the payment of leases or reinsurance obligations. ■Financial guarantees of €0.8 billion. These primarily relate to guarantees given to financial institutions in  connection with the borrowings of subsidiaries, including project  financing, and Veolia Environnement’s joint and several commitments  regarding divestments by subsidiaries or direct Veolia Environnement  warranties on asset divestitures.

The economic assumptions underlying the actuarial valuation of  employee-related commitments as of December 31, 2023 are a  discount rate of 4% and an inflation rate of 2.00%. Note 3 : Other commitments given In  addition  to  commitments  given  of  €3.1  billion,  Veolia  Environnement also granted commitments of an unlimited amount in  respect of: ■completion or performance bonds; ■a sludge incineration plant construction contract and waste  processing contracts in Hong Kong in the Water and Waste  businesses; ■a Hong Kong landfill contract. These commitments are limited to the duration of the related  contracts and were approved in advance by the Board of Directors of  Veolia Environnement. 7.2  Specific contractual  commitments The financial management of maintenance and repair costs for  installations provided by delegating authorities, for certain French  subsidiaries, was mutualized and centralized until December 31, 2003  within Veolia Environnement and, partially, since January 1, 2004  within Veolia Eau-Compagnie Générale des Eaux. Therefore, Veolia Environnement, as an active partner of certain  subsidiaries of Veolia Eau-Compagnie Générale des Eaux, has  undertaken to repay all maintenance and repair costs resulting from  contractual obligations to local authorities under public service  delegation contracts. In return, the subsidiaries pay an indemnity in  full and final settlement to Veolia Environnement,  the amount of  which is approved annually by the Supervisory Board of each  subsidiary benefiting from this guarantee. 7.3  Derivative financial  instruments and  counterparty risk Veolia Environnement is exposed to the following financial risks in the  course of its business: Market risk ■Interest rate risk (interest rate hedges, cash flow hedges). The financing structure of Veolia Environnement exposes it naturally  to the risk of interest rate fluctuations. As such, floating-rate debt  impacts future financial results in line with changes in interest rates.  Veolia Environnement manages a fixed/floating rate position in each  currency in order to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on its  net income and to optimize the cost of debt. For this purpose, it uses  interest rate swap and swaption instruments. ■Foreign exchange risk (hedges of balance sheet foreign exchange  exposure and overall foreign exchange risk exposure). Foreign exchange risk is primarily managed using foreign-currency  denominated financial assets and liabilities including foreign-currency  denominated loans/borrowings and related hedges (e.g. currency  swaps). With many offices worldwide, Veolia Environnement  organizes financing in local currencies. In the case of inter-company  financing, these credit lines can generate foreign exchange risk. To  limit the impact of this risk, Veolia Environnement has developed a  policy which seeks to back foreign-currency financing and foreign  currency derivatives with inter-company receivables denominated in  the same currency. Equity risk As of December 31, 2023, Veolia Environnement held 10,362,269  treasury shares, of which 6,370,621 were allocated to external growth  operations and 3,991,648 were acquired for allocation to employees  under employee savings plans. As part of its cash management  strategy, Veolia Environnement holds UCITS. These UCITS have the  characteristics of monetary UCITS and are not subject to equity risk. Liquidity risk Liquidity management involves the pooling of financing in order to  optimize liquidity and cash. Veolia Environnement secures financing  on international bond markets, international private placement  markets, the treasury note market and the bank lending market. Credit risk Veolia Environnement is exposed to credit risk on the investment of its  surplus cash and on its use of derivative instruments to manage  interest rate and foreign exchange risk. Credit risk reflects the loss  that Veolia Environnement may incur should a counterparty default  on its contractual obligations. Veolia Environnement minimizes  counterparty risk through internal control procedures limiting the  choice of counterparties to leading banks and financial institutions.  Veolia Environnement does not expect the default of any  counterparties which could have a material impact on transaction  positions or results.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Company financial statements/ Notes to the company financial statements 476 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 479 =====   6.2.6  STATUTORY AUDITORS' REPORT ON THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS This is a translation into English of the Statutory Auditors’ report on the financial statements of the Company issued in French and it is provided solely  for the convenience of English-speaking users. This Statutory Auditors’ report includes information required by European regulation and French law,  such as information about the appointment of the Statutory Auditors or verification of the management report and other documents provided to the  shareholders. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards  applicable in France. Year ended December 31, 2023 To the Shareholders’ Meeting of Veolia Environnement S.A., Opinion In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your  Shareholders’ Meeting, we have audited the accompanying annual  financial statements of Veolia Environnement S.A. for the year ended  December 31, 2023. In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the  assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as of  December 31, 2023 and of the results of its operations for the year then  ended in accordance with French accounting principles. The audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the  Audit Committee. Basis for opinion Audit framework We conducted our work in accordance with professional standards  applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have  obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our  opinion. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the  “Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial  Statements” section of our report. Independence We  conducted  our  audit  engagement  in  compliance  with  independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (code de  commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (code de déontologie) for  statutory auditors, for the period from January 1, 2023 to the date of  our report, and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non- audit services referred to in Article 5 (1) of Regulation (EU) no. 537/2014. Justification of Assessments-  Key Audit Matters In accordance with the requirements of Articles L.821-53 and R.821-180  of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to the  justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit  matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our  professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the  financial statements of the current period, as well as how we  addressed those risks. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the  financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon,  and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific elements,  accounts or items of the financial statements. Measurement of equity investments and loans to equity  investments Risk identified As of December 31, 2023, equity investments and loans to equity  investments are recorded in the balance sheet at a net carrying amount  of €37,028 million and represent 67% of total assets. At their date of  entry into Company assets, they are recorded at acquisition cost. As disclosed in Note 2.2.1 to the financial statements, the value in use  of equity investments is determined by your Company based on  criteria encompassing profitability, growth perspectives, the net  assets of the Company held and the stock market value of the  securities acquired, where applicable. If the value in use of  investments is lower than their net carrying amount, an impairment is  recognized in the amount of the difference.Given the amount of  equity investments in the balance sheet and the sensitivity of the  value in use to changes in assumptions, we considered the  measurement of the value in use of equity investments and loans to  equity investments to be a key audit matter. Our response Our procedures primarily consisted in: ■assessing the compliance of the methodology used to determine  the values in use applied by your Company with prevailing  accounting standards and its consistency with the methodology  applied last year for the relevant equity investments; ■assessing the methodology and data used by the Company to  estimate the values in use and examining the implementation of  this methodology and particularly, where applicable: • assessing the consistency of forecast cash flows with the most  recent Company estimates used in the budget process and with  respect to the economic and financial context in which the  entities operate by inspecting the source of any differences  between forecast and actual cash flows of prior periods; • assessing the multiples used and, in particular, the reference  panel and transactions adopted to determine these multiples. Besides assessing the value in use of equity investments, our  procedures also consisted in: ■assessing the recoverable amount of loans to equity investments  with respect to analyses of the equity investments performed; ■controlling the recognition of a contingency provision where the  Company is committed to bearing the losses of a subsidiary with  negative equity. Specific verifications We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards  applicable in France, the specific verifications required by French law. Information given in the management report and in the  other documents addressed to shareholders with respect to  the financial position and the financial statements We have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the  consistency with the financial statements of the information given in  the Board of Directors’ management report and in the other  documents provided to shareholders with respect to the financial  position and the financial statements. We attest the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial  statements of the information relating to payment deadlines  mentioned in Article D.441-6 of the French Commercial Code (code de  commerce). Information relating to corporate governance We attest the inclusion in the section of the Board of Directors’  management report on corporate governance of the information  required by Articles L.225-37-4, L.22-10-10 and L.22-10-9 of the French  Commercial Code (code de commerce). FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Company financial statements/ Statutory auditors' report on the annual financial statements VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 477  ===== PAGE 480 ===== Concerning  the  information  given  in  accordance  with  the  requirements of Article L.22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code (code  de commerce) relating to remunerations and benefits paid or awarded  to Directors and any other commitments made in their favor, we have  verified its consistency with the financial statements and, where  applicable, with the information obtained by your Company from  companies controlled by it and included in the scope of consolidation.  Based on this work, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of  this information. Other disclosures In accordance with French law, we have verified that the required  information concerning the purchase of investments and controlling  interests and the identity of the shareholders and holders of the  voting rights has been properly disclosed in the management report. Other Legal and Regulatory Verifications  or Information Format of presentation of the annual financial statements  intended to be included in the annual financial report We have also verified, in accordance with the professional standard  applicable in France relating to the procedures performed by the  statutory auditor relating to the annual and consolidated financial  statements presented in the European single electronic format, that  the presentation of the annual financial statements intended to be  included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L.451-1-2, I  of the French Monetary and Financial Code (code monétaire et  financier), prepared under the responsibility of the Chief Executive  Officer, complies with the single electronic format defined in the  European Delegated Regulation No 2019/815 of December 17, 2018. Based on the work we have performed, we conclude that the  presentation of the annual financial statements intended to be  included in the annual financial report complies, in all material  respects, with the European single electronic format. We have no responsibility to verify that the annual financial  statements that will ultimately be included by your Company in the  annual financial report filed with the AMF are in agreement with  those on which we have performed our work. Appointment of the Statutory Auditors We were appointed as Statutory Auditors of Veolia Environnement  S.A. by the Shareholders’ Meetings of December 18, 1995 for KPMG S.A.  and December 23, 1999 for Ernst & Young et Autres. As of December 31, 2023, KPMG SA was in the twenty-ninth year of  total uninterrupted engagement and Ernst & Young et Autres the  twenty-fifth year, including twenty-four years since securities of the  Company were admitted to trading on a regulated market,  respectively. Responsibilities of Management and Those  Charged with Governance for the Financial  Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation  of the financial statements in accordance with French accounting  principles, and for such internal control as management determines is  necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are  free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for  assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern,  disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using  the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate  the Company or to cease its operations. The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial  reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risk  management systems and, where applicable, its internal audit,  regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures. The financial statements have been approved by the Board of  Directors. Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities  for the Audit of the Financial Statements Objectives and audit approach Our role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objectives  are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial  statements as a whole are free from material misstatement.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a  guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional  standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered  material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be  expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the  basis of these financial statements. As specified in Article L. 821-55 of the French Commercial Code (code  de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the  viability of the Company or the quality with which the Company’s  management has conducted or will conduct the affairs of the entity. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional  standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises  professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: ■identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the  financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and  performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains  audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis  for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement  resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as  fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,  misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; ■obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit  in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on  the effectiveness of the internal control; ■evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the  reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures  made by management in the financial statements; ■assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going  concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence  obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events  or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s  ability to continue as a going concern. These conclusions are based  on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to  cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor  concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement  to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in   ifinancial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or  inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein; ■evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and  assesses whether these statements represent the underlying  transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair  presentation. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Company financial statements/ Statutory auditors' report on the annual financial statements 478 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 481 ===== Report to the Audit Committee We submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in  particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit  program implemented, as well as significant audit findings. We also  bring to its attention any significant deficiencies in internal control  regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we  have identified. Our report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material  misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most  significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current  period and which are therefore the key audit matters. We describe  these matters in the audit report. We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided  for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) no. 537-2014, confirming our  independence pursuant to the rules applicable in France as defined in  particular by Articles L.821-27 to L.821-34 of the French Commercial  Code (code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (code de  déontologie) for Statutory Auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss  with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to  bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.

In such a  case, the Company will inform its shareholders by way of a press  release; ■purchases of the Company’s shares may relate to a number of  shares such that: • at the date of each repurchase, the number of shares purchased  by the Company since the beginning of the share repurchase  plan (including the current repurchase) does not exceed 10% of  the shares comprising the Company’s share capital at that date  (this percentage will apply to the share capital, as adjusted in  light of transactions affecting it after this General Shareholders’  Meeting), i.e. 72,541,166  shares as of the date of filing of this  Universal Registration Document, it being specified that (i) the  number of shares purchased for retention and subsequent  delivery as part of a merger, spin-off or contribution may not  exceed 5% of the share capital; and (ii) when shares are bought  to increase liquidity under the conditions defined by the AMF’s  general regulations, the total number of shares taken into  account for the calculation of the aforementioned limit of 10%  is the number of shares purchased, after deduction of the  number of shares sold during the period of the authorization, • the number of shares that the Company holds at any given time  whatsoever does not exceed 10% of the shares comprising the  Company’s share capital on the date in question; ■shares may be purchased, sold or transferred at any time, within  the limits authorized by prevailing legal and regulatory provisions,  except during a public offer for the Company’s shares, and by any  means, particularly on regulated markets, multilateral trading  systems, with systematic internalizers or over-the-counter,  including by block purchases or sales, by public offers to purchase  or exchange shares, or through the use of options or other forward  financial instruments traded on regulated markets, multilateral  trading systems, with systematic internalizers or over the counter  or through delivery of shares following the issue of securities  granting access to the Company’s share capital by conversion,  exchange, redemption, exercise of a warrant or otherwise.

The ex- dividend date was set at May 9, 2023 and the dividend was paid from  May 11, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the share capital comprised  714,571,367  shares, including 12,619,170 treasury shares. The total  dividend distribution was adjusted to take account of the number of  treasury shares held by Veolia Environnement at the payment date, as  treasury shares are stripped of dividend rights. A dividend of €1.25 per share for 2023, payable in cash, will be  proposed to the General Shareholders’ Meeting of April 25, 2024. The  ex-dividend date has been set at May 8, 2024 and the 2023 dividend  will be paid from May 10, 2024.  For individual shareholders who are French tax residents, a mandatory  flat-rate levy of 12.8% will be deducted as payment on account for  income tax due in 2024 on 2023 income. This levy will however not be  applied to taxpayers whose reference taxable income for the year  before last is less than €50,000 for a single person or €75,000 for  couples, if they request exemption in advance. Social security contributions on dividends paid to private individual  shareholders tax resident in France are subject to withholding tax  deducted by the paying agent at a rate of 17.2%. The definitive tax liability for dividends paid by Veolia Environnement  will be determined based on information reported in the income tax  return filed by the taxpayer in the year following receipt of the  dividends. Whether paid in cash or shares, dividends (1) are liable to a flat-rate tax  of 12.8% (giving a total tax rate of 30% including social security  contributions). Social security contributions are not deductible from  income tax. A taxpayer may make a global election to include dividends in income  taxable at the progressive income tax scale. They will therefore be  taxed after a 40% deduction. Under this option, social security  contributions are deductible from taxable income in the amount of  6.8%. For beneficiaries who are not tax residents in France, dividends are  subject to withholding tax at a rate dependent on the country of tax  residence. 7.3.2  DIVIDEND POLICY The Company’s dividend policy is determined by the Board of Directors which may consider a number of factors, such as net income and financial  position, as well as the dividends paid by the Company’s other French and international companies in the same sector. 7.3.3  PERIOD DURING WHICH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS MUST BE CLAIMED Dividends that are not claimed within five years from the date on which they are made available for payment revert to the French government.

The distributable earnings are made up of the net income for the fiscal  year, minus any accumulated losses and the various deductions  provided for by law, plus any retained earnings. The General Shareholders’ Meeting may decide to distribute amounts  drawn from the reserves of which it may freely dispose, by expressly  stating the reserve items from which the amounts are drawn. After approving the financial statements and recording the existence  of amounts that are eligible for distribution (including the  distributable earnings and, if any, the amounts drawn from reserves  referred to above), the General Shareholders’ Meeting may decide to  distribute all or part of such amounts to the shareholders as dividends,  to allocate them to reserve items, or to carry them forward. The General Shareholders’ Meeting has the option of granting  shareholders, for all or part of the dividends paid out or interim  dividends, an option of payment in cash or payment in shares under  the conditions laid down by the law. Furthermore, the General  Shareholders’ Meeting may decide, for all or part of the dividend,  interim dividends, distributed reserves or premiums, or for any capital  reduction, that such distribution or such capital reduction will be  carried out in kind by delivery of Company assets. The Board of Directors has the option of distributing interim dividends  prior to the approval of the annual financial statements pursuant to  the terms and conditions provided for by law. 8.1.3  GENERAL SHAREHOLDERS’ MEETINGS 8.1.3.1  Notice of meetings General Shareholders’ Meetings are convened and deliberate under  the terms and conditions provided for by law. Meetings are held at the  Company’s registered office or at any other location stated in the  notice. Shareholders’ decisions are made at ordinary, extraordinary, special or  combined meetings, depending on the nature of the decisions that  shareholders are called upon to make. 8.1.3.2  Participation in and attendance  at Meetings Conditions All shareholders, regardless of the number of shares they hold, are  entitled to attend meetings in accordance with the laws and regulations  in force, either by attending them in person, by being represented at  them, by voting pursuant to the ballot-by-mail process, (also known as  “by mail”), or by giving a proxy to the Chairman of the meeting. In accordance with Article R.22-10-28 of the French Commercial Code,  the only shareholders permitted to attend meetings are those who  can provide proof of their legal status through the recording of the  securities in their name, or in the name of the intermediary registered  as acting on their behalf, no later than the second business day prior  to the meeting at midnight, Paris time (hereafter, D-2), either in  registered securities accounts, or in bearer securities accounts held by  their authorized intermediary. For registered shareholders, this accounting recognition in the  registered securities accounts on D-2 is sufficient for them to be able  to attend. For holders of bearer shares, it is the responsibility of the authorized  intermediaries that hold the bearer securities accounts to provide  proof of the legal status as shareholder of their clients to the clearing  institution for the meeting appointed by Veolia Environnement, by  providing a certificate of shareholding which they append to the  ballot-by-mail voting form or proxy form or to the admission card  request drawn up in the name of the shareholder or on behalf of  shareholders represented by the registered intermediary. Procedures Shareholders wishing to attend the General Shareholders’ Meeting in  person must apply for an admission card: ■registered shareholders should apply directly to the clearing  institution for the meeting appointed by Veolia Environnement  (hereinafter “the clearing institution”); ■holders of bearer shares should apply to their financial  intermediary. If a holder of bearer shares wishing to attend the meeting in person  has not received their admission card by D-2, they must submit a  request to their financial intermediary to issue them with a certificate  of shareholding enabling them to provide evidence of their position as  a shareholder as of D-2 in order to be admitted. A notice of the meeting, including a ballot-by-mail voting, proxy or  admission card request form, is automatically sent to all registered  shareholders. Holders of bearer shares must contact the financial  intermediary with whom their shares are recorded in order to obtain  the ballot-by-mail voting, proxy or admission card request form. Remote voting Shareholders who are unable to attend the General Shareholders’  Meeting in person may choose from one of the following options: ■give a written proxy to another shareholder, to their spouse or  partner or any other natural or legal person of their choice; ■give a proxy to the Chairman of the meeting; ■vote by mail; ■vote electronically prior to the General Shareholders’ Meeting. Shareholders can access a dedicated voting website provided by the  Company prior to meetings (Votaccess). This site allows each  shareholder to access meeting documents, submit voting instructions  electronically or request an admission card. Remote and proxy votes can only be taken into account if the forms,  duly completed and signed (and accompanied by the certificate of  shareholding for bearer shares) are received by the clearing institution  no later than the third business day prior to the meeting. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Main provisions pursuant to the law and the Articles of Association concerning Veolia Environnement VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023 499  ===== PAGE 502 ===== In accordance with the provisions of Article R.225-79 and R.22-10-24 of  the French Commercial Code, notification of the appointment and  dismissal of a proxy holder may also be made by electronic means. Only notifications of appointment to or dismissal from positions duly  signed, completed and received no later than two days before the date  of the meeting may be taken into account. In accordance with the provisions of Article  R.22-10-28 of the French  Commercial Code, any shareholder who has already voted by mail, or  sent a proxy or an admission card request is no longer able to choose  another method of participation in the meeting, but may,  nonetheless, sell all or some of their shares. However, if the sale takes  place before D-2, the Company will cancel or amend accordingly, as  appropriate, the remote vote cast, the proxy, the admission card or the  certificate of shareholding. To this end, the authorized intermediary  holding the account notifies the Company or its proxy holder of the  sale and provides it with the necessary information. No sale or any  other transaction made after D-2, regardless of the method used, is  notified by the authorized intermediary holding the account or taken  into consideration by the Company, notwithstanding any agreement  to the contrary. It is noted that if a shareholder does not name a proxy  holder in a proxy form, the Chairman of the General Shareholders’  Meeting shall register a vote in favor of adopting draft resolutions  submitted or approved by the Board of Directors, and shall register a  vote against the adoption of all other draft resolutions. In order to  issue any other vote, the shareholder must choose a proxy holder who  agrees to vote as directed by the shareholder. Under the terms of Article 22, paragraph 4 of the Company’s Articles of  Association, the Board of Directors may decide that shareholders may  attend the General Shareholders’ Meeting via videoconference or by  telecommunication or electronic means, including via the Internet,  under the conditions provided for by the applicable regulations at the  time of use. In this case, the shareholders concerned will be deemed to  be present for the purposes of calculating quorum and majority at the  meeting in question. This option has not yet been used by the  Company as of the date of filing of this Universal Registration  Document. 8.1.3.3  Main powers and quorum  required for General  Shareholders’ Meetings Ordinary General Meetings The Ordinary General Meeting is called to make all decisions that do  not amend the Articles of Association. It is held at least once a year,  within six months of the end of each fiscal year, in order to approve  the accounts for that fiscal year. It may only proceed, when it is  convened for the first time, if the shareholders present, represented or  having voted remotely hold at least one-fifth of the shares with voting  rights. When it is convened for the second time, no quorum is  required. The decisions of the Ordinary General Meeting are made by a  simple majority of the votes of the shareholders present, represented  or having voted remotely. Extraordinary General Meetings The Extraordinary General Meeting is the only meeting authorized to  amend the provisions of the Articles of Association. It may not,  however, increase the commitments of shareholders, with the  exception of reverse stock splits, duly and properly carried out. It may  only proceed, when it is convened for the first time, if the shareholders  present, represented or having voted remotely hold at least one- quarter, and, when it is convened for the second time, one-fifth of the  shares with voting rights. The decisions of the Extraordinary General  Meeting are made by a majority of two-thirds of the votes of the  shareholders present, represented or having voted remotely. 8.1.3.4  Shareholders’ rights Inclusion of points or draft resolutions  on the agenda Requests for the inclusion of points or draft resolutions on the agenda  must reach 30, rue Madeleine Vionnet – 93300 Aubervilliers – France  (Veolia Environnement, Office of the General Counsel) by registered  letter  with  acknowledgement  of  receipt  or  by  e-mail  to:  AGveolieaenvironnement.ve@veolia.com, no later than twenty-five  days prior to the date of the meeting, and may not be sent more than  20 days after publication of the notice of the meeting in the “Bulletin  des Annonces Légales et Obligatoires” (French Legal Gazette of  Mandatory Legal Announcements). The request for the inclusion of a point on the agenda must be  justified. The request for the inclusion of draft resolutions must be  accompanied by the text of the draft resolutions, which may include a  brief explanatory statement. Such requests from shareholders must  include a certificate providing proof of their legal status as  shareholders, either in the registered securities accounts or in the  bearer securities accounts held by a financial intermediary, as well as  the percentage of share capital required by the regulations. Review of  the point or draft resolution filed in line with the regulations is subject  to the submission, by the authors of the request, of a new certificate  evidencing the recording of the securities in the same accounts on D-2. Written questions In accordance with the provisions of Article  R.225-84 of the French  Commercial Code, any shareholder wishing to submit written  questions must address them to the Chairman of the Board of  Directors, 30, rue Madeleine Vionnet, 93300 Aubervilliers - France  (Veolia Environnement, Office of the General Counsel) by registered  letter with acknowledgment of receipt, no later than four business  days prior to the meeting.

Consultation of the documents made available Documents and information relating to General Shareholders’  Meetings are made available to shareholders in accordance with  prevailing laws and regulations and, in particular, the information  referred to in Article  R.22-10-23 of the French Commercial Code is  published on the Company’s website: http://www.veolia.com/en/ veolia-group/finance-area, in the “General Shareholders’ Meetings”  section, no later than twenty-one days prior to the meeting. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Main provisions pursuant to the law and the Articles of Association concerning Veolia Environnement 500 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2023  ===== PAGE 503 ===== 8.1.4  DOUBLE VOTING RIGHTS The voting rights attached to shares are proportional to the  percentage of share capital that such shares represent, and each share  carries the right to cast one vote. However, in accordance with the provisions of Articles  L.225-123 and  L.22-10-46 of the French Commercial Code, a double voting right (1) is  granted to all fully paid-up shares registered in the name of the same  shareholder for at least two years, as well as to new registered shares  which would be granted without consideration to a shareholder in the  event of a share capital increase by capitalization of reserves, profits or  additional paid-up capital, in respect of shares enjoying this right. In accordance with the provisions of Article L 225-124 of the French  Commercial Code, double voting rights cease for all shares converted  to bearer form or sold. Nonetheless, transfers as a result of succession,  the liquidation of joint property between spouses or an inter vivos gift  to a spouse or relative entitled to inherit, does not result in the loss of  this right or interrupt the two-year vesting period. This also applies in  the event of a transfer as a result of a merger or spin-off of a  shareholder company. The voting right attached to shares subject to beneficial ownership is  exercised by the income beneficiary at Ordinary General Meetings and  by the bare title owner at Extraordinary General Meetings. 8.1.5  IDENTIFICATION OF SHAREHOLDERS When shares are fully paid up, they may be held in registered or bearer  form, at the discretion of the shareholder, subject to provisions of the  laws and regulations in force and the Company’s Articles of  Association. Until the shares are fully paid up, they must be held in  registered form. Company shares are registered in an account under the conditions and  in accordance with the terms provided for by the laws and regulations  in force. However, where the owner of the shares does not reside in  France or French Overseas Territories, within the meaning of  Article  102 of the French Civil Code, any intermediary may be  registered on behalf of such owner, in accordance with the provisions  of Article L.228-1 of the French Commercial Code. Furthermore, the Company’s Articles of Association provide that the  Company may seek to identify all holders of securities that grant an  immediate or deferred right to vote at its meetings, in accordance  with the procedures set forth in Articles 228-2 et seq. of the French  Commercial Code. Pursuant to these provisions, the Company reviews  its share ownership four times per year on average. Failure by the holders of securities or their intermediaries to comply  with their data disclosure obligations set forth in Articles L.228-2 et seq.  of the French Commercial Code results, pursuant to the conditions  provided for by law, in the temporary loss of voting rights and, under  certain circumstances, the suspension of the right to dividend  payments attached to the shares. 8.1.6  CROSSING OF THRESHOLDS In addition to the thresholds provided by the laws and regulations in  force, the Company’s Articles of Association provide that all  individuals or legal entities, acting alone or in concert with others, that  enter into possession of or that no longer hold, either directly or  indirectly, a fraction of the share capital, voting rights or securities  granting future access to the share capital equal to 1% or more of the  Company’s share capital, or any multiple thereof, must inform the  Company, by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt within  a period of fifteen days from crossing this threshold, of his/her/its  identity and any parties acting in concert with him/her/it, together  with the total number of shares, voting rights, or securities granting  future access to the share capital owned alone, either directly or  indirectly, or in concert. Failure to comply with the above provisions will be penalized by the  loss of voting rights for the shares that exceed the threshold that  should have been declared, for all General Shareholders’ Meetings  that are held until the expiry of a two-year period following the date  on which the aforementioned notification is brought into compliance,  if the application of this penalty is requested by one or more  shareholders who together hold at least 1% of the Company’s shares.

NORTH AMERICA United States - Flint See chapter 6, section 6.1, note 12 of the consolidated financial  statements above. United States – WASCO and Aqua Alliance Several current and former indirect subsidiaries of Veolia Eau in the  United States 2  are defendants in lawsuits in the United States, in  which the plaintiffs seek recovery for personal injuries and other  damages allegedly due to exposure to asbestos, silica and other  potentially hazardous substances.  With respect to the lawsuits  against Veolia Eau’s former subsidiaries, certain of Veolia Eau’s current  subsidiaries retain liability and in certain cases manage the defense of  the lawsuits.  In addition, in certain instances, the acquirers of the  former subsidiaries benefit from indemnification obligations provided  by Veolia Eau or the Company in respect of these lawsuits. These  lawsuits typically allege that the plaintiffs’ injuries resulted from the  use of products manufactured or sold by Veolia Eau’s current or  former subsidiaries or their predecessors. There are generally  numerous other defendants, in addition to Veolia Eau’s current or  former subsidiaries, which are accused of having contributed to the  injuries alleged.  Reserves have been booked for the possible liability of current  subsidiaries in these cases, based on the nexus between the injuries  claimed and the products manufactured or sold by these subsidiaries  or their predecessors, the extent of the injuries allegedly sustained by  the plaintiffs, the involvement of other defendants and the settlement  history in similar cases. These reserves are booked at the time such  liability becomes probable and can be reasonably assessed, and do not  include reserves for possible liability in lawsuits that have not been  initiated. As of the date of this Universal Registration Document, a number of  such claims have been resolved either through settlement or  dismissal.  To date, none of the claims has resulted in a finding of  liability. During the ten-year period ended December 31, 2023, the average  annual costs that the Group has incurred with respect to these claims,  including amounts paid to plaintiffs, legal fees and expenses, have  been $982,698 after reimbursements by insurance companies.

Our stakeholders 3.   Our commitments 2.   Our performance 4.   Our goals This second edition of the Veolia  ESG Report, presents the Group’s  2023-2024 strategy and its  outcomes concerning  the company’s main challenges  in environmental, social and  governance terms. These are  the three pillars of responsible  management that drive our  multifaceted performance  (see diagram opposite). The objective is to deliver  transparent information with  which to measure the materiality  of sustainability issues and their  impact on our performance,  to share it with our stakeholders   – in particular, investors and  analysts – and to identify areas  for improvement in regard  to these issues. With preparation for the CSRD  (Corporate Sustainability Reporting  Directive) – the successor   to the NFRD – looming large,   the business year 2024 demands  a higher level of control over how  the governance of our non-financial  information is structured. This  is about more than reporting.   It is, more than ever, a question  of communicating about  the strategies that commit  us to our stakeholders.

A leading player in the R&D of environmental  solutions, with 14 research centers worldwide,  more than 600  dedicaded employees, and  almost 5,000 patents, the Group will signifi- cantly boost its investments in the disruptive  technologies of the future with an additional  €200 million over the course of the program.  This may be to decarbonize: creating value  from biogenic carbon; to regenerate resources:  working on recycling and recovering strategic  metals from used batteries; or to incorporate  artificial intelligence into its operations to  detect leaks or to optimize energy production  and consumption.

Overall, these countries represent almost 60% of the world’s population,   67% of worldwide GHG emissions, and 77% of global GDP. Just a year ago, Veolia published its first ESG  report, illustrating the progress made on max- imizing the Group’s positive impact for all its  stakeholders, in line with its purpose, since the  Impact 2023 program launched in 2020. One year on, I am delighted to be introducing  this second edition, which highlights the  Group’s most recent achievements and com- mitments and outlines its ESG ambitions for  the new strategic program, GreenUp. Driven  by the momentum of its multifaceted perfor- mance approach, Veolia’s ESG policy is insep- arable from its strategy, its economic and  financial model, and its sustainability. The beginning of 2024 was marked by the  launch of GreenUp, whose ambition is clear:  to accelerate, transform, and provide tangi- ble, affordable, replicable decarbonization,  depollution and resource regeneration solu- tions. In a world suffering a climate and bio- diversity crisis, destabilized by geopolitical  uncertainties, and where universal access to  essential services remains a challenge, Veolia  is proposing an ecological approach to trans- form and protect human health and the envi- ronment, in answer to the concerns being  voiced by people all over the world. According  to the second edition of the Ecological  Transformation Barometer(1), 68% of the  world’s population feel exposed and vulner- able to a decline in their quality of life, and  64% to health risks. GreenUp sets out the Group’s strategic priorities  of making Veolia a sustainable and prosperous  business in a livable world by continuing the  pioneering multifaceted performance approach  launched in 2020. As the operational manifes- tation of Veolia’s purpose, which holds that its  “prosperity is founded upon its usefulness to all  its stakeholders in the various regions where [it]  operates – whether customers, shareholders,  employees, suppliers, current populations or  future generations”, multifaceted performance  enables the Group to anticipate the require- ments of the CSRD (Corporate Sustainability  Reporting Directive). Our performance and our  ESG commitments emphasize the positive  impact of Veolia’s activities for its stakeholders,  and the exacting standards the Group has set  for conducting business, everywhere in the  world. At the same time, our business model is  built on solid foundations (operational excel- lence, geographical and sectoral balance, resil- ience, and protection against inflation) for  implementing a sustainable, self-financed eco- nomic model that creates long-term financial  value for our shareholders and the regions  where the Group is active. By establishing itself as integral to successful  ecological transformation, Veolia is emphasizing  more than ever what sets it apart: the richness  of its interactions with its stakeholders.  Ecological transformation requires collective  momentum within the company and with our  customers and end users, our suppliers, our  shareholders, and civil society. Our updated mul- tifaceted performance is testament to this, with  ever-higher targets for health, safety, and  well-being at work, customer satisfaction, and  our employee engagement rate. Among the achievements of the past year, three  in particular stand out: • Publication of our Net Zero 2050 strategy.  Detailed in our Climate Report, it shows that  it is possible to pursue growth in our busi- nesses while also reducing our greenhouse gas  emissions in a trajectory compatible with lim- iting warming to +1.5 °C. • The implementation of Veolia Cares, a social  benefits program for all our employees. This  unprecedented program ensures social pro- tection for our employees, even where none  is legally required (a minimum 10 weeks   of parental leave, health cover, insurance   coverage, support for employees who are  carers, etc.). • The success of our Sequoia 2023 employee  share ownership plan. Almost 79,000 employ- ees took part, consolidating their position as  the Group’s leading shareholder and showing  their confidence in the company’s vision. These accomplishments are a source of pride  that drives our success and long-term commit- ment. With GreenUp, Veolia is accelerating its  efforts to become the champion of decarbon- ization, depollution, and resource regeneration.  In terms of impact, the Group intends to  ­eliminate 18 Mt CO2 eq. (scope 4), treat 10 mil- lion metric tons of hazardous waste, and save  1.5 billion m3 of fresh water in 2027. Our ambition for Veolia is equal to the  world’s  challenges. We are determined to  show, everywhere the Group operates, that  it  is  possible to reconcile environmental  ­protection, human progress, and economic  and financial performance. “Veolia’s ESG policy  is inseparable from  its GreenUp strategy.” “The beginning of 2024  was marked by the launch  of GreenUp, whose  ambition is clear:  to accelerate, transform,  and provide tangible,  affordable, replicable  decarbonization,  depollution and resource  regeneration solutions.” 6 — 2024 ESG REPORT VEOLIA — 7  ===== PAGE 6 ===== OUR STRATEGY ROOTED IN ESG RECONCILING HUMAN PROGRESS AND ENVIRONMENTAL  PROTECTION Ecological transformation, that is our Purpose. Ecological transformation means acting to reconcile human progress   and environmental protection. We develop and implement locally solutions   to depollute our vital resources and preserve them from depletion, solutions   to decarbonize our ways of living and producing and adapt them to the   consequences of climate change. All over the world, attuned to local cultures,   we strive to improve the health and quality of life of communities.   At Veolia, we tackle economic, social and environmental issues as an inseparable   whole to the benefit of the largest number of people. Find the full version of our Purpose at veolia.com Read more  about our   2023 results Veolia firmly believes that businesses can use- fully contribute to meeting society’s expecta- tions and, in 2019, was one of the first French  groups to define and adopt a purpose. Four years later, Veolia decided to complement  the initial text with a shorter version to make it  easier for employees to take ownership, more  clearly highlight its key elements for all stake- holders, and accelerate its take-up. Today, 70%  of employees are familiar with the Group’s pur- pose (up 11 points compared with 2022) and  93% believe they contribute to it on a daily basis  (Voice of Resourcers 2023 internal survey). Our purpose guides   our multifaceted performance In its Purpose, Veolia expresses an ambition to  meet the expectations of its stakeholders in  creating and sharing value. To do so, the Group  is committed to delivering multifaceted perfor- mance that places the same level of attention  and the same exacting demands on its eco- nomic, financial, commercial, human resources,  social, and environmental performance. The  same rigor is applied to all Group processes, to  ensure that our multifaceted performance  objectives guide the management of all our  activities. The related progress indicators, which  are approved by the Board of Directors and its  committees, and regularly audited and meas- ured by independent third parties, are factored  into the variable compensation of Veolia’s senior  executives and corporate officers. For the Impact 2023 program, 19 progress indi- cators for 2023 had been defined, and 17 were  achieved. This near-complete success illustrates  the impressive conclusion to the Impact 2023  strategic program. With GreenUp, Veolia is positioning itself as the most decarbonizing,  depolluting and regenerating company in the world and the benchmark  for ecological transformation. An innovative group that forms alliances  with its stakeholders to co-build high-impact initiatives – innovative  models for relationships and value creation. 8 — 2024 ESG REPORT VEOLIA — 9  ===== PAGE 7 ===== In the fast-growing ecological transformation markets, Veolia is operating its three essential services  businesses (water, waste and energy) to meet three major ecological challenges: decarbonization,  depollution, and resource preservation and regeneration. The Group is leveraging its three strong posi- tions in ​municipal water, district heating and cooling networks, and solid waste management, and its  three ​boosters (bioenergies, flexibility and energy efficiency, water technologies and new solutions,  hazardous waste treatment), into which it intends to channel half its investments, to target accelerated  development potential for all its stakeholders.

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SDGs 10 — 2024 ESG REPORT VEOLIA — 11  ===== PAGE 8 ===== The Board of Directors, which validated the pur- pose statement and the multifaceted perfor- mance objectives and related indicators, must  now ensure its proper application. For this, it  relies in large part on the Purpose Committee. The day-to-day implementation of Veolia’s pur- pose is the responsibility of the Executive  Committee, each member of which is also the  sponsor of a multifaceted performance objec- tive. The Management Committee also plays a  role in monitoring this performance. ESG commitment monitoring   by the Board of Directors 1. The Purpose Committee monitors the Group’s  progress and guides its decisions in this area. For  example, it was asked to review the multifac- eted performance indicators for the GreenUp  strategic program. 2. The Nominations Committee makes recom- mendations on the future composition of the  Group’s governing bodies and assists the Board  in its periodic evaluation work. 3. The Compensation Committee makes propos- als to the Board on the overall compensation  awarded to company directors and the terms of  performance-related compensation. It defines  quantitative financial and non-financial criteria  based on the Group’s multifaceted performance  and determines the objectives used to calculate  annual variable compensation and long-term  compensation for senior executives. 4. The Accounts and Audit Committee scruti- nizes the interim and annual accounts before  they are submitted to the Board and periodically  assesses its own work. It monitors the effective- ness of internal control and risk management  systems, which include the risk mapping and  materiality matrix (incorporating CSR issues)  and the Group’s insurance plan. It is also respon- sible for reviewing the strategic program, the  action plan in regard to the Group’s compliance  system, and the Ethics Committee’s annual  report on its activities. 5. The Research, Innovation and Sustainable  Development Committee evaluates Veolia’s  strategy and policies in relation to its purpose.  In 2023, it focused on decarbonization and  innovation strategies for tackling pollution,   climate change, and the increasing scarcity of  natural resources. GOVERNANCE THE EMBODIMENT OF OUR PURPOSE Since its creation, Veolia’s purpose has been supported and steered at the highest level  of the business. Having been a source of inspiration and vital management tool for the  previous Impact 2023 strategic program, it has also served to guide the creation of the  new strategic program, GreenUp. AND ESG NOW HAS ITS OWN COMMITTEE Veolia established an ESG Committee in 2023. Co-chaired  by the Group General Counsel, the Senior Executive Vice  President for Strategy and Innovation and the Senior Executive  Vice President for Human Resources, it brings together the  functional departments in charge of environmental, human  resources, social, compliance, and governance matters and  ensures their coordination. It defines the Company’s strategic  priorities and approves its environmental policy, objectives,   and management system.

In a world rocked by crises (climate, energy, the natural world, etc.) and systemic changes,  ecological transformation demands a change in our methods of production and   consumption. Veolia is uniquely positioned to seize the opportunities in this market,  estimated to be worth €2,500 billion. Biodiversity 75%(1) of the Earth’s surface has been  significantly altered by multiple human  factors, 66% of its oceans are subjected   to increasingly significant cumulative impacts,  and more than 85% of wetlands by area   are at risk of disappearing. Adaptation   to climate change(2) Between 3.3 and 3.6 billion people live  in regions extremely vulnerable to climate  change. They are 15 times more likely to be  killed by flooding, droughts or storms than  people living in less vulnerable regions  (measured over the period 2010-2020). Climate change mitigation +1.1 °C, is how much the global surface  temperature increased over the period 2011- 2020 compared with 1850-1900. To limit  global warming to 1.5 °C by 2100(3), it would  be necessary to reduce CO2 emissions 48%   by 2030, 65% by 2035, and 99% by 2050. Natural resource scarcity 50% at least of the world’s population  – almost four billion people – live in conditions  of high water stress at least once a year(3). 50 billion metric tons of sand were extracted  in 2022, according to an alert from   the United Nations Environment Program.   This overconsumption is having major  environmental impacts(4). Health and environment 75% of the world’s population are certain   that “climate change is the biggest health  threat facing humanity(5).” Strategic independence   and reindustrialization Massive investment programs are being  introduced around the world to support local  installations in strategic industries (US Chips  Act, European Chips Act, Made in China  2025, etc.) and green investments (Inflation  Reduction Act, NextGenerationEU, etc.). Affordability 74% of the world’s population are certain that  “climate change is an acute threat for the world’s  poorest people, with the potential to plunge  more than 130 million into poverty by 2030(5).” (1) Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, IPBES, 2019.

The countries   were selected for their demographic and GHG emissions weightings, and to ensure the inclusion of diverse political histories and ecological cultures.  Overall, these countries represent almost 60% of the world’s population, 67% of worldwide GHG emissions, and 77% of global GDP. Veolia has identified five categories of stake- holders with whom it interacts: customers,  employees, shareholders, planet, and society.  The Group has developed a sustainable trust  relationship, which it has named “Resourcing  Together.” It is organized into three areas: listen- ing and dialogue; cooperation and seeking solu- tions; and commitment and honesty about the  impacts created. Listening and dialogue Stakeholder needs and expectations are   identified through a range of surveys and con- stant dialogue with each of them, to provide  Veolia with a more detailed view of ecological  transformation issues and the best ways to  address them. Cooperation   and seeking solutions To extract the benefits from listening and dia- logue, Veolia and its stakeholders have estab- lished a number of cooperative bodies, which  are a real driving force for ecological transforma- tion. This helps the Group understand the dif- ferent points of view involved and provides a full  and fair overview for making informed trade- offs and arriving at appropriate solutions. Commitment and honesty   about the impacts created Through its multifaceted performance, Veolia is  committed to its stakeholders and reports back  to them on the multiple impacts of its activities.

Solutions that  enable them to reduce their carbon footprints  but also help them adapt to the already visible  consequences of climate change – especially in  regard to water resources; protect public health;  and harness new local resources to boost sover- eignty and autonomy. Veolia is focused on becoming the vital link in  this ecological transformation in order to meet  growing demand in what has always been a  demand-led market: decarbonization, mitiga- tion of and adaptation to climate change, man- agement of scarce resources, preservation of  people’s health and quality of life, and the pur- suit of competitiveness and sovereignty for  organizations and regions. With its unique solutions across the entire value  chain of businesses vital to ecological transfor- mation, the Group has never been stronger or so  well positioned to support its customers in their  response to these various challenges. This is the  context in which Veolia launched GreenUp, its  new strategic program for 2024-2027. With GreenUp, Veolia can take effective action  for ecological transformation, expediting and  offering practical, affordable and replicable solu- tions. But it can also stimulate profitable growth  in its activities worldwide. To achieve this, the  Group will consolidate its position as a world  and European leader in its main markets  – municipal water, solid waste recycling and  recovery, and heat networks – and activate its  most effective high-impact boosters: new tech- nologies and solutions for water, hazardous  waste treatment and bioenergy, electricity flex- ibility, and energy efficiency. To achieve this growth and help its customers  decarbonize, depollute, and regenerate  resources in the 57 countries(1) where it oper- ates, Veolia acts as a solutions integrator, com- bining its different businesses: Water, Waste,  and Energy. GreenUp ACCELERATING   ECOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATION The increasingly tangible effects of global warming mean that the demand for ecological  transformation – and for the solutions to make it happen – has never been so strong. ONE YEAR OF   THE “+1” COLLECTIVE TO INSPIRE GREENUP Developed by Veolia, “+1, for an ecology  in action”, the innovative methodology for  stronger dialogue between stakeholders, was  used to enhance the new GreenUp strategic  program by incorporating their main priorities.  From Japan to the United States, via Colombia,  Australia, the Czech Republic, Italy, the United  Kingdom and France, Veolia spent a year  talking with more than 200 stakeholders  around the world. The main priorities  expressed were: regulations and economic  models moving toward greater frugality, the  strong local roots of our solutions and support  for cooperation between stakeholders, and  raising awareness and mobilizing different  players. One example of a project that emerged  directly from this consultation was the Éco  d’Eau initiative in France, which has brought  together 600 players committed to preserving  water resources. Following the same principle,  employee representatives were consulted  during the creation of GreenUp, and employees  were able to give their views and make  suggestions through a dedicated survey.

To manage this new program, Veolia will be using its monitoring instrument – multifaceted per- formance – and its 15 objectives. To unite all our employees around this ambition, these 15 indi- cators will be taken into account in the compensation of at least 16,000 Group managers. Each of  the indicators associated with these objectives is measured and published regularly throughout  the program to help monitor our progress. They are all verified by an independent external third  party. A member of the Executive Committee has been appointed as a sponsor to support each  objective and ensure it is achieved. 20 — 2024 ESG REPORT VEOLIA — 21  ===== PAGE 13 ===== (1) Results from the second Veolia x Elabe Barometer of Ecological Transformation (April 2024). The onus is therefore on companies to adapt their  business models to making positive contributions  to ecological transformation. To help them, the  green taxonomy defines the sustainable activities  that make such contributions. For Veolia, this clas- sification brings standardized recognition of the  positive impacts its activities generate. In 2023, close to 58% of Veolia’s revenue was  eligible for the European taxonomy and more  than two-thirds of this was aligned with the  2023 TAXONOMY   RESULTS: 75% OF CAPEX ELIGIBLE Expectations are high in terms of investments in ecological transformation, with a size- able majority of public opinion (66% of the world’s population) fearing that the costs of  inaction will be far harder to bear than the financial costs of action on decarbonization  and depollution(1). extremely stringent environmental criteria   associated with each activity, highlighting   the excellent performance of the Group’s oper- ations worldwide. In the same period, 75.1% of Group Capex was  eligible and 44.5% aligned, higher than the  rates for revenue: this demonstrates the Group’s  priority focus investments expanding its sus- tainable activities. 24.9%  NON-ELIGIBLE 42.1%  NON-ELIGIBLE 44.5%  ELIGIBLE AND  ALIGNED 40.2%  ELIGIBLE AND  ALIGNED 30.6%  ELIGIBLE AND  NON-ALIGNED 17.7%  ELIGIBLE AND  NON-ALIGNED REVENUE CAPEX The list of eligible activities defined by the  European Union is likely to expand and will  hopefully include other Veolia activities, such  as pre-discharge treatment of industrial waste- water, some types of hazardous waste landfill,  and energy recovery from non-recyclable  refuse-derived fuel (RDF). Of the 42.1% of non-eligible activities, 23.2%  are currently considered “neutral”, i.e. with no  major direct environmental impact covered by  the taxonomy. This notably includes basic ser- vices that Veolia provides to its municipal and  industrial water customers, for example, when  Veolia provides services on behalf of third-party  operators but is not itself a network or treat- ment plant operator. The remaining non-eligible activities include in  particular non-selective waste collection, energy  recovery from non-hazardous waste, and  non-hazardous waste landfills. Though they are  excluded from priority ecological transforma- tion finance, these activities are nevertheless an  investment priority in some countries world- wide that remain under-equipped. This stance,  which the EU justifies in terms of a need to  invest selectively in best practice, excludes activ- ities that are nonetheless helpful to the smooth  operation of environmental services and whose  operational performance levels have a direct  impact on levers for combating climate change  and protecting the environment. 44.5%   OF INVESTMENTS 14.4% IN THE  WATER BUSINESS 8.5% IN SOLID  WASTE (separate  collection,   material sorting  and recycling) 8.1%   IN HAZARDOUS  WASTE 13.5% IN THE  ENERGY BUSINESS (phasing out carbon  in Europe, renewable  energies) THE 44.5% OF ALIGNED INVESTMENTS   FOR 2023 BREAK DOWN AS FOLLOWS: 22 — 2024 ESG REPORT VEOLIA — 23  ===== PAGE 14 ===== OUR ESG  AIMS AND CHALLENGES With its commitments and environmental and social performance  underpinned by robust, engaged governance, Veolia aims to speed up  ecological transformation by fostering dialogue and cooperation   with and for its stakeholders. From the 2024 business year onward, Veolia is  preparing to adopt the CSRD (Corporate  Sustainability Reporting Directive), the new sus- tainability reporting framework, which will  replace the current Non-Financial Performance  Statement (NFPS) in 2025. This new chapter in  reporting is an opportunity for the Group to bet- ter communicate about the impacts, risks, and  opportunities arising from its various busi- nesses, based on a principle of double material- ity: identifying the Group’s positive and negative  impacts on the outside world; and recognizing  the financial risks and opportunities created for  Veolia by external factors. It serves as a reminder  that reducing environmental impacts is central  to Veolia’s activities and purpose. Double materiality:   the foundation of the CSRD Double materiality analysis has allowed the  Group to confirm the crucial material challenges  it faces. These are grouped into six action areas:  decarbonize to limit climate disruption; depol- lute and preserve the nature; spare and regen- erate resources; provide safe and resilient  essential services to territories; be an attractive,  safe and fair company; and engage our   stakeholders in ecological transformation.   This analysis identified 43 impacts, risks and  opportunities (IRO) associated with these chal- lenges, which are also at the heart of the  GreenUp program. It serves as a reminder that  reducing environmental impacts is central to  Veolia’s activities and purpose. This approach includes listening attentively to  the stakeholders we consulted on the Group’s  environmental, social, and governance commit- ments. It is designed to provide stakeholders  with an even clearer picture both of our positive  contribution for the environment through our  policies and action plans and of the levers they  themselves hold: ecological transformation  requires all our stakeholders to mobilize. It also  aligns naturally with the multifaceted perfor- mance approach the Group has followed since  2020 and is continuing in the new GreenUp  strategic program. “At Veolia, we attach the same importance  to our corporate non-financial performance  – environmental, social and governance –  as to economic, financial and commercial  performance, and have done so since 2020,  through our multifaceted performance policy.  This pioneering approach, which includes  the concept of impact on our stakeholders,  is now giving us a head start on meeting  the requirements of the CSRD.” Claude Laruelle Deputy CEO Finance, Digital and Purchasing CONTRIBUTING TO A MORE SUSTAINABLE AND DESIRABLE FUTURE 24 — 2024 ESG REPORT VEOLIA — 25  ===== PAGE 15 ===== DOUBLE MATERIALITY ANALYSIS: OUR IMPACTS, RISKS, AND OPPORTUNITIES (1) Decarbonize to limit climate disruption Align Veolia’s greenhouse gas emissions trajectory with the 1.5 °C goal.

DECARBONIZING TO LIMIT CLIMATE CHANGE ENVIRONMENT Our commitment:   to combat pollution and accelerate   ecological transformation. Sources: IEA Net Zero scenario; BU data; work by O. Wyman; Veolia analysis. (1) The pro forma 2021 emissions presented here are the sum of Veolia’s emissions published in 2021 and the 2021 emissions   from the Suez businesses acquired and still held on the publication date of this document. “Veolia’s activities contribute positively  to protecting nature, by decarbonizing,  depolluting, and regenerating resources.  The GreenUp strategy will propel the Group  toward its short-term emissions reduction  target (–50% by 2032) validated by  the Science-based target initiative.” Sébastien Daziano Senior Executive Vice President, Strategy and Innovation Aligning our greenhouse   gas emissions trajectory with   the 1.5 °C target Veolia has set out its Net Zero 2050 trajectory  compatible with limiting global warming to  +1.5 °C. Details of this are provided in the  Climate Report published by the Group on  February 29, 2024. In July 2024, the Science-Based Targets initiative  (SBTi) validated Veolia’s short-term emissions  reduction target (–50% by 2032) and registered  the Group’s commitment to reduce its long- term emissions to achieve the target of net zero  emissions by 2050. The international rating  agency Moody's also analyzed and recognized  the quality of Veolia's transition plan, awarding  the company an overall score of NZ-2, praising  in particular the ambition and solidity of its  short-term implementation. This is based in  particular on the mobilization of technologies  proven by the Group and above-average profit- ability of transition investments. With this trajectory, the Group has further stepped  up the efforts it has been making for many years  to decarbonize its activities, in particular with its  plan to phase out coal in Europe, an investment  program of €1.6 billion between 2019 and 2030. The trajectory includes strategic milestones for  2032: a 50% reduction in scopes 1 and 2 emis- sions compared with 2021, and a 30% reduction  in scope 3 emissions(1). Veolia’s commitments to invest in decarboniza- tion have increased from €400 million over the  2020-2023 duration of the Impact 2023 pro- gram to €600 million over the 2024-2027 period  spanned by GreenUp. The decarbonization of business activity relies  in the short and medium term on clearly iden- tified projects and action levers to which the  Group can apply proven experience in each of  its businesses:  ̎ methane capture at landfill sites;  ̎ alternatives to coal for powering urban heat  networks: an energy mix comprising  refuse-derived fuel, biomass, natural gas, bio- gas, recovered heat, geothermal energy, etc.;  ̎ energy efficiency;  ̎ on-site renewable energy generation and  self-consumption;  ̎ green energy supply (scope 2). On scope 3, Veolia will reinforce its purchas- ing policy with its largest suppliers: by 2032,  suppliers representing 30% of purchasing-­ related  emissions will have to sign an  SBTi commitment. To fulfill its Net Zero 2050 ambition, the Group  is also banking on further development and  deployment of innovations currently on the  drawing board or in their pilot phases, such as  carbon capture, utilization, and storage. The Group’s climate governance, which ensures  that its commitments are honored, manages  its carbon trajectory in a process similar to that  used for financial commitments.

In other words,  fair consideration of all efforts in favor of  decarbonization, which will encourage those  best placed to pursue ecological transformation  to play their part. Scope 4 is an appropriate  tool for tackling those emissions that are most  difficult to eliminate, since it measures the  positive impact of decarbonization actions  made possible by the Groups’ solutions. Veolia  is initiating dialogue with businesses, academic  institutions, the financial sector, and NGOs  to advance the development of scope 4,  and raise awareness among decision-makers  of its important role in a successful   ecological transformation. WATER THE FIRST MARKER   OF CLIMATE CHANGE Water is the first marker of climate change,  with the symptoms already visible. Veolia’s  businesses are at the forefront of the urgent  need to adapt. Thanks to its numerous  completed projects around the world  (wastewater reuse, desalination, nature- based solutions, etc.), the Group is already  supporting its customers and rolling  out solutions to help them adapt and boost  their resilience. Eliminating more emissions   from our value chain (scope 4) Alongside a reduction in its own emissions,  Veolia is targeting a 50% increase in emissions  eliminated for its customers by 2030, with  an interim objective of 30% (18 Mt CO2 eq.)  by 2027. Emissions eliminated (scope 4) on behalf of  the Group’s customers are effectively the  result of solutions rolled out across its energy  businesses (energy efficiency, biogas produc- tion, energy recovery from waste in countries  with a high-carbon energy mix) and waste  recycling operations. Adapting to climate change In addition to its efforts to reduce greenhouse  gas emissions, the Group is working tirelessly to  adapt its own and its customers’ sites to the  effects of climate change. The idea is to study  the exposure and vulnerability of different activ- ities in order to prepare for the impacts of cli- mate change on doing business. A climate  exposure analysis of 2,000 sites has enabled the  Group to prepare dedicated action plans.

In France, in 2023, the Veolia Group  launched a national campaign to measure PFASs  (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) as soon  as reliable analysis protocols became available.  In mid-April 2024, having analyzed, in just five  months, two-thirds of the production points  managed by Veolia, affecting 15 million French  people, the Group announced that drinking  water was compliant with new PFAS standards  for 99% of these contracts. Through its waste and water businesses, Veolia  has numerous depollution solutions available  for protecting natural environments (water, air,  soil), biodiversity, and human health. GreenUp  will enhance this contribution, accelerating the  priority rollout of activities with a strong posi- tive impact: technologies and new solutions for  water and the treatment of hazardous waste. Another priority for the Group’s innovation pro- gram is the development of nature-based solu- tions for managing the large water cycle, such  as artificial wetlands. Lastly, in conducting business and operating  its own and its customers’ sites, the Group  strives to limit any residual pollution from   its operations. Scaling up   depollution solutions The world leader in technologies and new solu- tions for water, with its revenue in this area  increasing from €1.5 billion in 2019 to €4.9 bil- lion in 2023, Veolia offers solutions for achieving  the following three objectives:  ̎ To meet the challenges of preserving the qual- ity of aquatic environments: – Monitoring, measuring, analyzing and fore- casting pollution with support from artificial  intelligence and smart sensors on the infra- structure that we manage. – Purifying wastewater using membrane tech- nologies and biological process intensification  – which can be coupled with nature-  based solutions – and accelerating the rollout  of wastewater reuse solutions.  ̎ To treat micropollutants in drinking water by  creating treatment processes combining  proven solutions (such as activated charcoal)  and proprietary cutting-edge technology  (membranes, ozonation, UV, etc.)  ̎ To supply industrial processes and produce  ultrapure water for cutting-edge technologies  (semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, etc.). With more than 4,400 patents in water technol- ogies to its name already, Veolia is pursuing an  ambitious innovation policy underpinned by a  network of 14 R&D centers and its partnerships  with external ecosystems. Expanding and improving   hazardous waste treatment As the world leader in the liquid and hazardous  waste treatment segment, with revenue of  €2.5 million in 2019, rising to €4.2 billion in 2023,  Veolia is aiming to treat 12 million metric tons by  2030 and increase its revenue by 50% in the same  timeframe. To this end, the Group continues to  expand its network of hazardous waste manage- ment and treatment infrastructure on every con- tinent. The eight assets currently under  construction (in Germany, France, the United  Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Taiwan, Saudi  Arabia, and the United States) will further boost  its treatment capacities. To treat pollutants, and recycle them where pos- sible, Veolia is rolling out a range of proven solu- tions (physico-chemical treatment, high-  temperature incineration, solvent regeneration,  and vitrification) to protect ecosystems and  human health. The Group is also innovating in  the management of hazardous and complex  waste, such as electric vehicle batteries (see box  on page 39). In synergy with its water technology activities,  Veolia is developing integrated solutions for  treating the most complex pollutants, such as  PFASs (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances). ENVIRONMENT DEPOLLUTING AND PROTECTING NATURE Find out more 32 — 2024 ESG REPORT VEOLIA — 33  ===== PAGE 19 ===== Protecting biodiversity on our sites   and across our value chain Since 2019, the Group has been implementing  action plans on more than a hundred of its sites  worldwide identified as the most sensitive in  terms of the richness of local ecosystems or the  type of activity. An integral part of the Group’s  multifaceted performance indicators, the pro- gress rate of these action plans was 85% in  2023, well above the target of 75% set in 2020.  This approach will be continued and expanded  between now and 2027, and will include new  sites acquired in the merger with Suez. In 2023, the Group rounded out this initiative by  assessing the impacts and dependencies of its own  activities and value chain on biodiversity using the  LEAP (Locate, Evaluate, Assess and Prepare) method  recommended by the TNFD(1). Following this  assessment, dialogue was initiated with the main  suppliers in the most-affected purchasing catego- ries. This should ultimately result in the inclusion  of criteria related to biodiversity protection in the  selection and assessment of these suppliers. RENEWED  COMMITMENT WITH ACT4NATURE INTERNATIONAL The renewal in May 2024 of Veolia’s  Act4nature international(1) commitment   for the period 2024-2027 aligns the Group  with the recommendations of COP15   and the requirements of the CSRD. It also  consolidates the actions already being  implemented worldwide in relation to: • operational excellence in on-site   biodiversity protection, including a rollout  target for ecological management   solutions across 95% of sites by 2027; • accelerated deployment of solutions   acquired through the Group’s innovation  policy, such as nature-based solutions   and biomonitoring; • more prominence for biodiversity   in the Group’s governance and in its   dialogue with stakeholders across   its value chain. THE TNFD A COMMON LANGUAGE FOR  ASSESSING BIODIVERSITY POLICIES In its Universal Registration Document 2023,  Veolia adopted the recommendations  for identifying nature-related risks and  opportunities published by the TNFD  in September 2023. In a similar vein to the TCFD  for climate issues, this framework provides  issuers and investors with common guidelines  for assessing company policies on biodiversity.  At the Davos Forum in 2024, Veolia was  recognized as one of 19 French companies  and financial organizations to have been  “early adopters” of the TNFD.

Since then, the collective movement  to promote the preservation of water resources  continues unabated: hundreds of partners  – regional authorities, federations, nonprofits  and charities, NGOs, schools, and media  organizations – and increasing numbers  of businesses are joining the cause.  Water frugality is also integral to the water  distribution contract that Veolia secured  in 2023 with the European Métropole of Lille  in France: Veolia has committed to saving  65 million m3 of extracted water over 10 years,  the equivalent of a year’s consumption. Enabling sustainable use   of water resources The world leader in water management for  public authorities and in water technologies,  the Group generated €18.4 billion (41% of the  Group’s revenue) in its Water businesses in  2023. It produced 8,137 billion m3 of drinking  water in the 3,809 Group-operated production  plants and operated 386,218 km of distribution  networks. By 2030, the Group aims to save 2 billion m3 of  fresh water with the implementation of its  desalination, wastewater reuse, and network  performance improvement solutions.  Worldwide, Veolia estimates the potential for  fresh water savings from the application of  existing network performance, treated waste- water reuse and desalination solutions alone  to be 50 billion m3. Veolia offers its municipal and industrial cus- tomers, especially those in water stress con- texts, specific solutions for preserving  resources, including water treatment and  wastewater recovery. More generally, every Veolia business plays a  role in the preservation and sustainable man- agement of water resources. For example:  ̎ leak reduction in drinking water networks  and raising awareness around efficient and  responsible water use, including through the  use of smart meters and the introduction of  progressive tariffs, will reduce extraction;  ̎ wastewater collection and treatment encour- ages other uses downstream of the discharge  point and, in some cases, sustains river flows  during low-water periods;  ̎ recycling and reuse of treated wastewater  and the desalination of seawater can help  safeguard access to water in locations where  tensions are high and contribute to the pres- ervation of precious fresh water resources;  ̎ the treatment of industrial wastewater and  leachates, collection and treatment of haz- ardous liquid waste, sludge recovery, and soil  decontamination all contribute to considera- ble reductions in discharges and pollutant  transfer into water resources;  ̎ the collection, management, and recovery of  solid waste helps make the environment  healthier, avoids the diffusion of waste  into the environment, and protects water  resources;  ̎ the energy savings achieved by Veolia help  reduce its customers’ fuel consumption and,  indirectly, preserve water resources. Under its innovation policy, Veolia is developing  technological and nature-based solutions to  address issues of water quality and availability.  The Group is also innovating in contractual  terms: it promotes “performance-based”  ­contracts, which attach value to efforts made  to reduce water consumption.

To achieve these, the Group works upstream to  shape the sorting and recycling streams, in  partnership with regions and manufacturers.  Veolia operates high-performance sorting  centers for common industrial waste and  waste from selective collection, ensuring recov- ery rates of over 50%, and has developed TSA2  (auto-adaptive sequential sorting). This pat- ented process, currently in the industrial appli- cation phase, offers a number of benefits:  improved sorting performance; the production  of high-quality secondary raw materials; and  recovery rates in excess of 95% thanks to  remotely operated sorting, which refines the  operation further still. Downstream, Veolia is consulting with manu- facturers on eco-design solutions (such as  CIRCPACK) and recycling plastics (PE, PET,  PP, etc.) to supply its PlastiLoop solution (see  box on page 39). A key player in the production  of recycled polymers to meet the higher perfor- mance levels required by the market for  mechanical recycling processes, the Group pro- duced 465,000 metric tons of recycled plastics  in its transformation plants in 2023. Veolia also  provides recycling of complex waste, such as  electrical appliances, electronics, and fluores- cent lights. The energy recovery solutions for waste on  offer from Veolia provide decarbonized local  energy, which contributes to regional energy  autonomy:  ̎ non-recyclable common waste is transported  to incinerators or landfill facilities. The inciner- ation process produces energy in the form of  steam, which can power urban heat networks  or industrial heat plants, or be transformed into  electricity. In its landfill facilities, the Group cap- tures the biogas released by the fermentation  of organic waste. This can be injected directly  into the distribution network, used to generate  electricity, or become fuel for vehicles;  ̎ Veolia is also working on the transforma- tion of residual non-recyclable waste into  refuse-derived fuel (RDF) to power fur- naces and other combustion or energy  production processes for local authorities  and manufacturers;  ̎ in 2023, Veolia’s Waste businesses produced  10.7 TWh of renewable or recovered energy. PLASTILOOP GLOBAL PLASTICS   RECYCLING SOLUTION In 2022, Veolia launched the innovative  integrated platform PlastiLoop, a network  of more than 30 factories, to enable its  customers all around the world to procure  recycled plastic resins. Its range of polymers  organized by application enables the Group  to meet every specific need. In March 2024,  the new Circular PET plant in Tsuyama, Japan,  joined the PlastiLoop network. INNOVATING TO RECYCLE BATTERIES A historical player in the treatment of batteries  and accumulators, Veolia has unequalled  expertise in every stage of the recycling  process. Its experience in managing hazardous  waste flows and the associated risks have  enabled the Group to develop safe and highly  effective dedicated processes. Also a pioneer  in recycling electrical vehicle batteries, Veolia  is striving to create a circular loop around all   the materials used in batteries, and strategic  metals in particular. The Group operates four  sites with the capacity to treat 30,000 metric  tons of batteries, corresponding to around  100,000 EV batteries. A chemical separation  site (using a hydrometallurgical process)  is currently under construction in France.

The Group has a strong local  focus and works with all stakeholders  to reinforce access to essential services for all,  contribute to local, responsible economic  development, and commit to sustainably  improving living conditions and health  in communities and regions.” Isabelle Calvez Senior Executive Vice President, Human Resources Veolia’s global performance depends on its  power to attract and retain customers. This is  why the Group is particularly concerned with  cohesion, social dialogue, and promoting pro- fessional gender equality. Now more than ever,  Veolia spares no effort to be an employer of  choice for its talented people. Taking care of employees   in a safe and secure  work environment Veolia is responsible for the physical and men- tal health of its employees and contractors,  and for the continuous improvement of their  working conditions. Health and safety are  therefore considered “non-negotiable”, and  “zero accidents” is both an objective and a per- formance lever. As part of its multifaceted performance, Veolia  monitors its lost time injury frequency rate, with  a target of under 4.1 by 2027. In 2023, the Group  achieved a rate of 4.95 (compared with 6.6 in  2020), in line with the target set. This success can largely be attributed to the  deployment of significant resources for an acci- dent prevention, health, and safety policy built  on five main pillars:  ̎ involvement of the entire management chain:  150,000 safety visits made in 2023 (up 15.4%  from 2022);  ̎ health and safety risk management: imple- mentation of the 12 life-saving rules and the  10 management standards for high-risk activ- ities; systematic feedback on serious accidents  and potentially unsafe situations;  ̎ communication and dialogue: organization of  an annual health and safety week; enhanced  dialogue around health and safety arrange- ments, including with social partners, tempo- rary workers, and contractors;  ̎ training and engaging with all employees: – launch of a new international OHS Leadership  training program, – continuing rollout of the Paths (Prevention  and training on health and safety) program,  with 75% of teams covered as of the end of  2023 (up 13 points compared with 2022) and  a target of 90% for the end of 2024, – health and safety training module delivered  to 83% of Veolia employees in 2023, and 42.3%  of training hours devoted to health and safety, – 94% of employees consider health and safety  to be extremely important in their field of work;  ̎ monitoring and control of health and safety  performance: the 55 health and safety perfor- mance contracts signed with the Group’s BUs  and Zones are managed by the Health and  Safety Center of Excellence, which comprises  around 30 international experts from the Group. Veolia has also implemented safety manage- ment systems (SMS) based on standards such  as ISO  45001, ILO  OSH  2001 and/or  OHSAS 18001. Every year, Group entities are  certified, awarded labels, or otherwise  rewarded for their progress in terms of pre- vention, health, and safety. At the end of  2023, the percentage of Veolia’s revenue cov- ered by an SMS was 57.7%. BEING AN  ATTRACTIVE,  DEPENDABLE,  AND FAIR  COMPANY EMPLOYEES AND SOCIETY Our commitments:  to give meaning to our   employees’ commitment and  support regional development   in a responsible way. The Group prioritizes well-being and support for  employees, with specific measures in place:  ̎ medical check-ups; prevention of occupational  diseases and psychosocial risks, including  mental health issues, with best practice iden- tified within entities to be replicated else- where (for example, the implementation of a  training course on “Responding to Mental  Health and Psycho-social Hazards at Work”  initially provided to managers in Australia);  ̎ So’well program to promote best practice   and incorporate well-being into employees’  daily lives;  ̎ Veolia Cares, a worldwide social benefits pro- gram (see box);  ̎ exemplary Corporate Sport scheme with WAC  (Workplace Active Certification) certification;  ̎ well-being at work indicator included in the  2022 Voice of Resourcers engagement survey.

Fully  deployed in all the Group’s geographies  since September 1, 2023, the Veolia  Cares program is based on five pillars: • parental leave: basic salary maintained  over 10 weeks for the first parent   and 1 week for the second parent; • death cover: capital equivalent   to a least 6 months’ salary paid   to beneficiaries; • health cover: guaranteed access   to medical care for all our employees,  whatever local organizational methods  exist (legal health insurance and  corporate schemes); • support for employees who are carers; • community volunteer work: every  employee is entitled to devote one  paid day off a year to a charity or  environmental protection organization. 40 — 2024 ESG REPORT VEOLIA — 41  ===== PAGE 23 ===== Being the employer of choice in   ecological transformation professions Veolia gives meaning to its employees’ commit- ment. It provides them with opportunities  throughout their professional lives to train and  develop their skills to help them enjoy a reward- ing career:  ̎ between 2020 and 2023, the average number  of annual training hours per employee  increased from 17 hours to 29 hours, surpass- ing the target for 2023 of 23 hours. This repre- sents an investment of 5.9 million employee  training hours, which the Group intends to  continue over the long term;  ̎ according to the 2023 Voice of Resourcers sur- vey, 84% of respondents consider that they  have enhanced their skills (up 2 points com- pared with 2022). Veolia introduced the Veolia Academy, which  supports the Group’s transversal training offer,  to address a number of priorities: the dissemi- nation of Veolia’s shared management culture;  the assimilation on the part of all employees of  ecological transformation issues; the develop- ment of new training programs on the strategic  skills required to make the GreenUp program a  success; and the acceleration of digital learning  in support of a learning culture for all  (the  Learning@Veolia platform welcomed  100,000 users in 2023). To secure the expertise required to fulfill its  missions and strategic ambition, Veolia fol- lows a dedicated policy for recognizing and  valuing its experts. The objective is to identify,  train, suggest career paths, and ensure knowl- edge transfer. Particular attention is paid to career manage- ment and to retaining older people in the  workforce, through a global strategy covering  health, training, and retraining in the local  employment market. Promoting inclusion and diversity   with a responsible social policy Because it encourages employees to adopt  our collective project as their own, Veolia con- siders social dialogue, particularly in staff  representative bodies, to be an important per- formance lever. This dialogue takes place at  the highest level of the organization and is led  by the two directors representing employees  and a non-voting member, who sit on the  Board of Directors. Veolia takes care to create a working environ- ment where every employee feels valued,  respected and included, regardless of their  ­ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age, disa- bility, or any other personal characteristics. The  Group’s diversity and inclusion policy is based  on three guarantees:  ̎ air, non-discriminatory HR processes,   from induction to retirement, for all emp­ loyee categories;  ̎ non-discriminatory access to employment  at Veolia. VOICE OF RESOURCERS, EVERYONE COMMITTED Every year since 2019, Veolia’s employees have  had the opportunity to voice their opinions by  responding to the anonymous online survey Voice  of Resourcers, which is available in 29 languages.  For the 2023 survey, a panel of 155,000 employees  from 55 countries was invited to participate,  representing 75% of the workforce. With 122,000 responses (compared with 114,000  in 2022), the participation rate reached a record  high level of 79%, seven points higher than in  2022. This reinforces our employee engagement  rate, which stands at an impressive 89%.   The Voice of Resourcers survey also highlights  increases in two important indicators: • “Quality of life and working conditions”  received 75% positive responses in 2023   (up 1 point from 2022); • “Diversity and inclusion”, which measures  how employees view the subject, achieved  82% in 2023 (up 1 point from 2022). The Voice of Resourcers survey is also a useful  way to measure how broadly employees have  assimilated Veolia’s purpose. In 2023, no fewer  than 70% were familiar with it (up 10 points  compared with 2022), and 93% of those employees  felt that they contributed to it through their work  (up 1 point from 2022).  ̎ Social dialogue and freedom of expression  for employees (1,713 new collective agree- ments signed in 2023, with more than  86.2% of employees covered by a social dia- logue scheme). The Group continues to implement action  plans to promote diversity and gender equal- ity (recruiting and retaining, reducing salary  gaps, furthering and supporting women’s  careers, and fighting against sexism and  sexual harassment):  ̎ between 2016 and 2023, the proportion of  female Executive Resourcers increased from  15% to 26.7%; the next target is 40% by 2029;  ̎ the target for 2027 is to reach 30% women on  the Group Management Committee. A signatory in 2022 to the ILO Global Business  and Disability Charter, Veolia designs inclusion  programs for the employees concerned: induc- tion and integration, keeping disabled people in  the workforce, improved accessibility, a partner- ship-based policy, and raising awareness among  non-disabled employees. The Group is also  working to promote inclusion for its LGBT+  employees worldwide, in compliance with local  legislation. Numerous action plans are in place  to promote social and cultural diversity, ranging  Veolia is a signatory   to the ILO’s 2008 Seoul  Declaration, which recognizes  the fundamental human right  to a safe and healthy working  environment. In 2022, Veolia  also signed the Global Business  and Disability Charter,  which commits the Group   to 10 undertakings. from improved access to employment for the  people most exposed to discrimination to the  creation of social promotion conditions and  combating racial discrimination. In addition, Veolia launched a decent salary  pilot scheme in six countries representing a sig- nificant proportion of the Group’s workforce  and covering all the main operating regions:  France, United States, United Kingdom, Japan,  Colombia, and Poland. Work was initiated at the  end of 2023, during meetings organized with  local HR officers.

Additionally, 43 million people benefited  from a household waste collection service on  behalf of local authorities, and 8.2 from heating  services. In support of the objectives set by the  UN Water Conference in March 2023, Veolia  committed to investing $1.5 billion in access to  water and sanitation worldwide. Protecting   vulnerable populations Veolia promotes schemes to help the most vul- nerable populations gain access to essential  services. Its regional network and proximity to  local issues are an opportunity for the Group to  develop services adapted to specific contexts.  More broadly, it is able to engage in develop- ment aid or emergency assistance activities for  vulnerable populations. These inclusive measures can be financial (social  tariffs, bill payment assistance, etc.) to support  consumers in difficulty, or technical (standpipes,  water kiosks, distribution using tanker trucks,  social connection programs, etc.) to promote  access to water infrastructure. In 2023, around  7.27 million people benefited from improved  access to services through the Group’s water  and sanitation contracts. Veolia also promotes reasonable and responsi- ble use of water resources through communi- cation campaigns and the implementation of  technical measures and incentives, such as  smart meters and progressive tariffs based on  quantities consumed. Creating   regional value Veolia’s activities make it a contributor to eco- nomic and social vitality in the regions where it  operates. As a force for solidarity, the Group  fights against exclusion, especially through the  efforts of the Veolia Foundation, and strives to  build long-term responsible relationships with  its suppliers. To understand and explain its impact, every  year, Veolia measures its worldwide socio-eco- nomic footprint, quantifying the impact of its  activities. In addition to the Group’s direct  impacts (jobs and added value), the study  includes indirect impacts in connection with its  supply chain and the use of its solutions by  households and public authorities. The results  obtained in 2023, based on 2022 data, show  that for every €1 of added value created by  Veolia, the local economy generates another  €2.40. And the economy supports seven addi- tional jobs for every direct job with Veolia. In  total, more than 90% of the Group’s expendi- ture was reinvested locally in 2023. Dialogue with   local communities As it conducts its activities, Veolia implements  initiatives to encourage dialogue with commu- nities and residents in a region: distribution of  information through neighborhood gatherings,  meetings with elected representatives and local  nonprofits, site visits, public open days, and  ­volunteer  programs with local nonprofits  and charities. In 2023, the Group organized  7,675 sessions to raise awareness of sustainable  development during visits to sites that it oper- ates. These involved more than 550,000 people,  including 120,000 young people and students. Another initiative designed to facilitate Group  employees’ direct engagement with local non- profits is the citizen mobilization program,  EMPLOYEES AND SOCIETY BRINGING DEPENDABLE   AND RESILIENT ESSENTIAL   SERVICES TO LOCAL  COMMUNITIES THE VEOLIA  FOUNDATION CELEBRATES 20 YEARS Celebrating its 20th anniversary in 2024,  the Foundation is a long-term fixture   on the international humanitarian scene,   with its three priority action areas:  humanitarian emergencies and  development aid; social inclusion   through work and social links;   and environmental conservation and  biodiversity. As well as Group employees,  the Veolia Foundation mobilizes sponsors  for supported projects (financial  sponsorship) and volunteers from   the Veoliaforce network (skills-based  sponsorship provided in the field or  remotely). In 2023, it provided increased  financial support of €821,310 to  31 new or ongoing projects. Of these,  10 involved development aid   or humanitarian emergencies, such   as the earthquake that struck   Southeast Turkey on February 6, 2023. 2023  ANNUAL REPORT See the Veolia  Foundation’s 2023  Activity Report for  more information. 44 — 2024 ESG REPORT VEOLIA — 45  ===== PAGE 25 ===== THE EIMS DEPLOYMENT AT 99.2% Veolia’s environmental and industrial  management system (EIMS) enables   it to measure its impacts, with the ultimate   aim of reducing them, but also to manage  environmental risks and opportunities   in line with its strategic objectives.   With a deployment rate of 99.2% in 2023   (in % of revenue covered), this EIMS is based  on a continuous improvement approach   in operational entities. This framework, common to all Group BUs,  is strengthened locally by externally  recognized environmental and industrial  management systems: ISO 14001 and   ISO 50001, Process Safety Management,  labelling, honoring contractual  commitments, etc. Resourcers for Communities. Trialed in several  pilot entities in France (including the Group’s  headquarters in Aubervilliers) and in Morocco,  it equated in 2023 to 3,500 full-time equivalent  personnel mobilized for 1,400 actions with  more than 700 partners. And this does not  reflect the boost provided by Veolia Cares, a key  guarantee of which is that every employee in  every Group BU can devote one paid day off a  year to these projects. In addition, in 2024, Veolia renewed a partner- ship agreement with the French National Guard  to support its reservist employees in France. Property security and   personal data protection Due to the nature of Veolia’s businesses, and the  extent and diversity of its installations, the  Group pays particular attention to the security  of its tangible and intangible property and its  information systems. The Security Department  is responsible for managing security breaches  and preventing threats to the Group (tangible  and intangible property, including information  systems) and its employees. It also coordinates  alerting and crisis management systems. It fur- ther contains the organization that ensures the  security of information systems (ISS, cyber­ security) in line with the Group’s cybersecurity  strategy, which is focused on risk reduction and  business resilience. Implemented across all Veolia entities, informa- tion system security policies, including in the  industrial domain, are the responsibility of the  Cybersecurity Director and local security man- agers. For this reason, several Group entities  have ISO 27001 or equivalent certification. For  the most at-risk, and the most exposed systems,  specialist external partners using international  standards (e.g. NIST) provide auditing and assis- tance. The cybersecurity roadmap is enhanced  with awareness-raising campaigns and training,  which include regular cyber crisis exercises. In the area of data protection, Veolia is commit- ted to applying national provisions as well as  the European regulation covering the processing  of personal data (GDPR). It has therefore drawn  up a Group policy and defined minimum stand- ards in this area. Reporting to the Group  Compliance Director, the Global Data Protection  Officer manages the implementation of these  standards, coordinating a network of DPOs and  working with the Information Systems, Legal,  and Security Departments Through its businesses, relationships forged with local communities, and strong regional roots,  Veolia contributes to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, in particular SDGs 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 and 17.

Its objective is to build a  community that acts as one to build and deploy  useful, sustainable solutions with a strong pos- itive impact: ecosystems of alliances. Always listening Veolia’s principal tools for identifying stake- holder expectations are the Ecological  Transformation Barometer – the innovative  annual opinion survey that samples over 60%  of the world’s population across five continents;  Voice of Customers – the program that meas- ures customer satisfaction in every business  unit; and Voice of Resourcers – the employee  engagement survey. Not forgetting the  Shareholder Advisory Committee, an advisory  and consultative body and source of proposals  for enhancing discussions with shareholders  and the information communicated to them. Debating, cooperating,  engaging Veolia’s pursuit of dialogue and cooperation  with its ecosystem is based on regular inter- actions with academic, scientific and techni- cal partners, meetings with high-level experts,  and participation in working groups, confer- ences, and international events. Various  spaces have been formalized for interaction  with its stakeholders: • The Critical Friends committee For more than 10 years, this committee has pre- sented Veolia’s senior management with the  opinions of external observers on strategic sub- jects in connection with corporate responsibility.  It comprises around a dozen independent  experts in CSR issues, drawn from institutions,  the academic community, non-profits, and com- pany partners. MAKING  DIALOGUE  A POWERFUL  PERFORMANCE  LEVER GOVERNANCE Our commitment:   to accelerate ecological transformation   by acting together with our stakeholders. “The Group is aware that it cannot by itself  bring about the ecological transformation being  called for by a large part of the world’s population,  and so is committed to seeking dialogue  wherever it operates, and also cooperation  with its stakeholders, some of whom  go on to become allies.” Helman le Pas de Sécheval General Counsel and Director of the Italy Zone • The “+1, for an ecology in action”   consultation process This is an innovative method devised by Veolia  to unite and engage its stakeholders in acceler- ating ecological transformation, in the form of: – A +1 members’ collective: a panel of stakeholders  working to identify concrete actions for ecologi- cal transformation across eight business units. – An open-source method that works in numer- ous contexts – at BU, contract or project level. – “+1 Actions”: efforts to address specific issues,  and the inspiration behind new collectives such  as: “+1 Arianeo” – an unprecedented open- ing-up of contract governance to stakeholders  in Nice; “+1 Employee Representatives” – sup- porting social dialogue; and “+1 Inspire  24-27” – dedicated to the GreenUp strategic  program (see box on page 19). • The Veolia Institute This foresight body is a platform for high level dis- cussions on key social and environmental issues  through its publications and conferences. It main- tains an ongoing dialogue with the scientific and  research community and more broadly with civil  society and various experts in their fields. • Terra Academia Initiated by Veolia and backed by a coalition of com- mitted supporters – economic, academic, public,  and non-profit partners – this school for ecological  transformation is organized in a regional network  of campuses, the first two of which opened at the  beginning of 2024 in Arras and Paris, France. Terra  Academia is aimed at young people, active or  retraining professionals, entrepreneurs, executives,  elected officials, and local public service directors,  and delivers qualification-based, introductory, and  continuous training. The objective is to train more  than 60,000  people by 2030 and introduce  100,000 young people to discovery programs  for future-proof careers, thanks to a network of  15 regional campuses. OUR STAKEHOLDERS ON THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AGENDA Testament to a willingness to play a greater   role in society and undertake a transformation  of decision-making methods toward a new form  of governance, the subject of stakeholders has  been specifically assigned to a member of the  Executive Committee. The idea is to innovate in  stakeholder engagement strategies and support  BUs in their interactions with their ecosystems  and local stakeholders. More than 9 in 10 of the world’s population believe that companies  have a role to play in seeking  out and implementing  practical, effective solutions  for successful ecological  transformation. Economic  players are essentially  placed level with citizens,  local authorities,  governments, and  international bodies(1). SEQUOIA EMPLOYEES: THE GROUP’S   LEADING SHAREHOLDER With the Sequoia 2023 operation, employees  consolidated their position as the Group’s  leading shareholder, holding 7.5% of the  capital as of December 13, 2023. More than  190,000 employees in 49 countries took  advantage of the so-called “leveraged” offer   in addition to the standard offer. The General  Shareholders’ Meeting on April 25, 2024,   was an opportunity to confirm that employee  share ownership could reach 10% of  the company’s capital, making it possible  to associate even more employees with  the value creation generated by the Group.

These purchases  are made from small local suppliers (30%  of expenditure).  ̎ Industrial equipment and hardware and  mobile equipment central to business opera- tions carried out for the Group’s key custom- ers, representing a significant proportion   of the Group’s energy consumption (17%  of expenditure). These are therefore subject to  full life cycle costing. Veolia’s responsible purchasing policy is based  on five pillars, each relating to a key theme,  and a sixth transverse pillar supporting  change management:  ̎ Decarbonizing the supply chain through  the implementation in 2024 of a Group  engagement strategy, the result of a  detailed study of Purchasing Scope 3 emis- sions and the identification of around  300 high-emitting suppliers.  ̎ Promoting the circular economy by encourag- ing the consideration of impacts and services  purchased throughout the life cycle and sup- porting internal and external reuse, repurpos- ing, and recycling solutions.  ̎ Deploying the compliance program and pro- tecting human rights, based on identifying  risks, engaging and assessing suppliers, and  managing continuous improvement.  ̎ Creating value in our territories and  encouraging inclusive sourcing. In 2023, in  France, Veolia spent €10.4 million, exclud- ing tax, on purchases from the protected  workers sector.  ̎ Supporting and working with our suppliers and  partners: the “Purchasing Compliance and CSR”  e-learning course was used to train 989 buyer  and compliance managers across the Group in  2022 (61.5% of the emp­loyees concerned). In order to improve supplier performance, an  online learning platform and training courses  relating to CSR are available to all Group suppli- ers. In 2023, 526 of them successfully completed  at least one online training course. SATISFYING  CUSTOMERS  AND END   USERS GOVERNANCE ESTABLISHING  RESPONSIBLE  RELATIONSHIPS  WITH THE  GROUP’S  SUPPLIERS (1) A strategic supplier contributes directly to the Group’s strategy and plays a critical role  in Veolia’s industrial processes (industrial equipment, production energies, chemical products,  rolling stock, and major telecoms and IT operators). It represents a recurring expense   at Group or BU level. Veolia purchases supported a total of 460,200 indirect jobs   in the supply chain and generated €21 billion in GDP.  An average of 87% of purchases are locally sourced.

In the same vein, Veolia has developed a  unique program known as “Voice of  Customers” to monitor the commercial perfor- mance of all Group BUs. In its relations with its public and private cus- tomers and the people who benefit from the  services the Group provides, Veolia strives above  all to meet its legal and contractual obligations.  The Group is committed to implementing solu- tions that meet the needs and expectations of  its customers and end users.

Its mission is to  ensure the proper application of the values set  out in Veolia’s Ethics Guide and its appendix  – the Anti-corruption Code of Conduct. These  list Veolia’s specific values and the rules of con- duct derived from them, which form the basis  of its multifaceted performance. The Group also has an ethics whistleblowing  solution, which enables any employee or third  party to alert the Ethics Committee directly if  they suspect any contravention of the values  and rules of conduct set out in the Ethics Guide  or Anti-corruption Code of Conduct. Preventing corruption,   anti-competitive practices,   and fraud The Compliance Department operates a net- work of officers covering the whole Group; its  mission is to instill a compliance culture. As  part of this, it contributes to the Group’s map- ping of corruption risks, and oversees the  application of internal standards designed to  prevent practices contrary to Veolia’s compli- ance values. The department also provides employees with  training on the prevention of corruption, anti-­ competitive practices, and fraud: 36,200 emp­ loyees completed the mandatory online training  in 2023 (up from 29,700 in 2022). Promoting respect  for human rights Veolia’s human rights policy is centered on eight  priority issues – three relating to the rights of  people impacted by the Group’s activities and  five relating to fundamental labor rights. Its  Human Rights and Duty of Care Committee,  which met twice in 2023, is charged with over- seeing the policy’s implementation across the  Group. A human rights e-learning course devel- oped in 2022 was taken by 60% of Group  employees in 2023. GOVERNANCE BEING VIGILANT ON ETHICS AND PROPER BUSINESS CONDUCT ASSESSMENT  AND IMPROVEMENT OF OUR SUPPLIERS’ CSR  PERFORMANCE Veolia identifies supplier risks at the call for  tender stage, using a risk mapping organized  by purchasing category. During these  consultations, they are automatically sent  a supplier charter to be signed by them.  In addition, specific sustainable development  and anti-corruption clauses are systematically  included in new contracts and renewed/ amended contracts, along with Veolia’s   Purpose and the Group’s health and safety  commitments. For purchasers, a compliance/ CSR questionnaire is available for calls for  tender in connection with supplier contracts  in global risk categories three to five (based  on the risk mapping). They use an assessment  system to measure the performance of  strategic and high-risk suppliers during calls for  tender and also as part of an annual campaign.  A supplier’s CSR performance is taken into  account when assessing their bid, assigned  a weighting of between 5% and 20%.  Where the resulting score does not meet  Veolia’s requirements, the supplier is asked  to implement a corrective action plan  and is then reassessed. It should be noted that suppliers and   partners also have access to the Group’s  whistleblowing solution. VEOLIA:   WINNER OF THE 2023 SUSTAINABLE GOVERNANCE AWARD Veolia won the Sustainable Governance Award  at the 2023 Sustainable Business & Finance  Awards organized by the magazine AGEFI.   This award recognizes the best-performing   SBF 120 company in terms of sustainability,  based on the core components of the Ethics   & Boards Sustainable Governance scoring  (more than 80 corporate governance   data points and indicators and their   ESG materiality).

To facilitate access to quantitative non-financial data, a history of the Group’s main ESG performance indicators can be found at the end of the report. These indicators  are aligned with the most commonly used European or international benchmarks (GRI, SASB, Principle Adverse Impact indicators).  ===== PAGE 3 ===== 2023 • THE HEART OF VEOLIA’S MULTIFACETED PERFOR M ANCE 2 - 3 FOREWORD In its 170-year history, the Group has  helped reshape the way we use resources  to be more respectful of ecosystems  and meet everyone’s basic needs. Decarbonizing, saving and regenerating  resources, and depolluting: this trio of  ecological transformation is enshrined in our  Purpose and sets a clear goal: to improve  health and quality of life for human  communities. This is a huge ambition that  motivates the 220,000 employees in   our water, waste management and recovery,   and energy businesses. And we have the results to prove it! In 2022,  14 million metric tons of CO2 were eliminated  from our customers’ carbon trajectories, and  more than 320 million cubic meters of water  saved, equivalent to the annual consumption  of Singapore. In terms of social responsibility  and governance, the Group launched  numerous initiatives: basic package of social  benefits for all employees worldwide;  a purchasing policy of spending 85% in the  places where we operate; gender balance  on the Board of Directors; and a policy  to encourage employee share ownership  which has made them the Group’s leading  shareholder in January 2022. In 2020, with the launch of our strategic  plan Impact 2023, we made environmental,  social and governance (ESG) criteria central  to the Group’s operations through  multifaceted performance. More than  a simple reporting method and more than  just a communication plan, this is a genuine  tool for steering and transforming the Group.  This multifaceted performance is second  nature to Veolia, which defines its success  by its usefulness, and views economic,  social and environmental concerns as  an indivisible whole. We therefore devote equal attention  to all our stakeholders by setting ourselves  clear performance targets in five areas:  commercial, economic/financial,  environmental, human resources,  and social, all underpinned by robust,  proactive governance. This multifaceted performance guides  not only our development choices but also  the way in which we run our businesses.  These are just a few of many examples: → We made the responsible rather than  the easy choice by investing significantly  to eliminate coal from our heat networks  in Central and Eastern Europe, resisting  the temptation to simply divest these  businesses, and we are investing in biogas  capture at our landfill sites in Latin America; → We increased the proportion of our  business engaged in the circular economy  (€8.4 billion in 2022), especially in plastics  recycling (490,000 t of plastics recycled   in 2022); → In our historically rather male- dominated business areas, we are now  showing strong growth in female  representation in our teams (25.2% in 2022  vs. 18.2% in 2019) and 30% female managers; → We are pursuing an ambitious  policy regarding top management  compensation, with a bonus that is 50%  based on quantitative criteria, with  50% relating to non-financial criteria. And we’ll keep building on this  momentum! But we will also continue  to explain the unique features of our business  models and activities, as Veolia has become  a unique company in the world, the first  to achieve top-tier status simultaneously  in water, waste and energy. Our strength  is derived from the combination of our  business areas, which allows us to offer  our customers groundbreaking solutions  for ecological transformation. Committed to working tirelessly   to support our customers in their ecological  transformation, we are also acting to reduce  our own environmental footprint: – by intensifying our efforts towards  Net Zero Carbon by 2050, while explaining  how some of the activities that inflate our  carbon figures – converting assets on behalf  of our customers, eliminating hazardous waste,  etc. – are actually good news for the planet, “Everywhere Veolia operates,  our stakeholders must see  a ‘before’ and an ‘after’ thanks  to our solutions, our standards  of excellence, and our multifaceted  performance approach.” ESG – the heart of Veolia’s  multifaceted performance ESTELLE BRACHLIANOFF Chief Executive Officer of Veolia – by advocating for recognition of the  emissions we reduce, avoid or eliminate  for our customers, – by restating that our role is to provide  drinking water for people in regions often  subject to water stress; that we lead the way  in identifying and anticipating risks to our  own and our customers’ infrastructure;  and above all, that we are there to provide  solutions (efficient networks, wastewater  reuse, etc.) to help improve their resilience. When it comes to assessing companies’  ESG performance, the co-benefits of their  activities for their own value chains and  those of their customers are not given  sufficient recognition. For Veolia, these  co-benefits come in the form of emissions  avoided, resources untapped, and water  not extracted. The purpose of this document is to  highlight Veolia’s ESG achievements since  2020. Since our strategic plan launched  in 2020, we have constantly pursued our  ESG targets to ensure the consistency and  success of our multifaceted performance.  And we will introduce our strategic plan  for 2024-2027 at the beginning of next year  with renewed determination. A simple message to end on: everywhere  Veolia operates, our stakeholders must  see a “before” and an “after” thanks to  our solutions, our standards of excellence,  and our multifaceted performance approach,  which combines ESG and corporate strategy.  ===== PAGE 4 ===== 2023 • THE HEART OF VEOLIA’S MULTIFACETED PERFOR M ANCE 4 - 5 WITH NEARLY 220,000 EMPLOYEES working in water, waste, and energy on five continents,  the Group designs and provides solutions to decarbonize, save and regenerate resources and  depollute that are useful and practical for local authorities, industry, and the commercial sector.

As a source of inspiration  and management tool for the Impact 2023  strategic plan, it is widely distributed  and shared throughout the Group. The Board of Directors validated the  text and the multifaceted performance  objectives and related indicators, and controls  its proper application, in particular through  a dedicated Purpose Committee. The Group Executive Committee  and Management Committee oversee its  effective implementation. In 2022, a member  of the Executive Committee was tasked  specifically with stakeholder issues.  The aim is to innovate in this area and  support Business Units in its application. The Critical Friends Committee of high- level independent experts is regularly asked  for its opinion, with the aim of challenging  the company and helping it stay on course. The Purpose Steering Committee, made up  of Executive Committee members and  representatives of functional departments,  is responsible for coordinating and promoting  the initiative within the Group. The Strategy and Innovation department  steers Veolia’s strategy with a view to  achieving a multifaceted performance  in line with the company’s Purpose. Together with staff representative bodies,  Veolia has set up a Purpose monitoring  committee to encourage all employees  to take ownership of the Purpose. THE FIVE BOARD  STEERING COMMITTEES Corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues are  addressed at the highest level of Veolia’s governance  through several dedicated Board committees. 1. The Purpose Committee  monitors the Group’s  progress and guides  its decisions with reference  to its Purpose and to  multifaceted performance. 2. The Research,  Innovation and Sustainable  Development Committee  focused its efforts in 2022  on Veolia’s stance in terms  of carbon neutrality,  the Group’s CSR and  non‑financial ratings  performance, and the roll- out status of its sustainable  development commitments.  It received an annual  progress report on Veolia’s  plan to phase out energy  production from coal. 3. The Compensation  Committee validates the  compensation awarded  to company directors,  ensuring in particular that  it is consistent with the  Group’s multifaceted  performance commitments 4. The Accounts and  Audit Committee includes  in its work the review  of the risk management  system, including the risk  mapping and materiality  matrix (incorporating CSR  issues) and the Group’s  insurance plan. 5. The Nominations  Committee is responsible   for making recommendations  on the future composition  of the company’s governing  bodies and assists the Board  in its periodic evaluation work. In addition, certain multifaceted performance indicators   form part of the annual variable compensation policy for over 16,000 employees. (2) (2) Estimated, data not audited 15% Profitability (CNIGS)  10% Investment capacity  (free cash flow)   15% Group growth (revenue)  10% Capital return (ROCE) 5% Health and safety  5% Ethics and compliance  5% Climate  5% Hazardous waste treatment  and recovery  5% Employee commitment  5% Training Strategic dimension   Management performance Quantitative  (financial)  50% Quantitative  (non- financial)  30% Qualitative  20%  ===== PAGE 7 ===== acc ele ra te t he  ec olo gic al t ran sfo rm ati on Su pp or t r eg io nal  de vel op me nt Co mb at  pol luti on  an d Gu ara nte e r esu lts  ov er  th e l on g t er m thr ou gh i nno vat iv e s er vic es th ro ug h r es po nsi ble  m ea ns and  re sult s o ver  tim e In cre ase  pr os per ity Giv e  me ani ng  to  ou r e mp loy ee s’ w ork  an d hel p th em  wit h c are er d eve lop me nt a nd  en gag em ent OU R S OC IA L P ERF OR MA NC E OU R E NV IR ON ME NT AL  PE RF OR MA NC E OU R C OM ME RCI AL  PE RF OR MA NC E OU R E CO NO MI C A ND  FI NA NC IA L P ER FO RM AN CE OU R H UM AN  RE SO UR CE S P ERF OR MA NC E EM PL OY EE S PL AN ET CL IE NT S SO CI ET Y SH A RE H O LD ER S 2. 3. 4. 1.

The Group has therefore committed  to multifaceted performance organized  around 18 objectives for 2023 as part of  the Impact 2023 plan. In pursuit of an impact  balanced between its five main categories  of stakeholders, the Group applies the same  level of attention and rigor to its economic  and financial, commercial, human resources,  social, and environmental performance. Each of the indicators associated  with these objectives is measured and  audited annually by independent third-party  bodies to help monitor our progress.  They will also be used to calculate the  variable compensation of Veolia’s senior  executives. This requirement is applied  to all Group processes, to ensure that our  multifaceted performance objectives guide  the management of all our activities. A COMMITMENT  TO MULTIFACETED PERFORMANCE To implement its Purpose, Veolia has developed a fundamental lever   for transformation: multifaceted performance. IMPLEMENTATION  AT LOCAL LEVEL Each multifaceted and indicator  performance objective is co-managed   by two people – an Executive Committee  sponsor and a Group Objective key expert: → Executive Committee sponsors  are appointed to support the objectives  at the highest level within the Group. → Group Objective key experts: – define an objective attainment strategy  for the Group, – propose ways to cascade this strategy  through the different operational and  functional entities concerned, – participate in the design and  analysis of action plans, monitoring  and supporting performance, – consolidate the Group multifaceted  performance indicators at global level.

Veolia’s approach to stakeholder relations  focuses on three areas: listening and  exchanging, co-construction and seeking  solutions, and commitment and sincerity  with regard to the impact created. This is an opportunity for Veolia to  ascertain the expectations of all its different  local, national and international stakeholders  (employees, customers, suppliers, investors,  public authorities, civil society, international  organizations, multi-stakeholder platforms,  local communities, consumers, etc.).  The aim is to establish the Group locally,  co-create useful solutions with a strong  positive impact for all, and roll these out  as widely as possible. AN APPROACH  OF SHARED PROGRESS  WITH AND FOR OUR STAKEHOLDERS Given the scale and urgency of the ecological challenges we all face,   Veolia is making use of collective intelligence through dialogue between   stakeholders from different backgrounds. This search for constant dialogue  with its ecosystem is based on voluntary  and regular Group exchanges,   particularly between its leadership   bodies, via various discussion forums:   the Critical Friends Committee, the Veolia  Institute Foresight Committee, the “+1,   the ecology turned into actions” consultation  process, working groups, conferences,   and international events. THE CRITICAL  FRIENDS COMMITTEE Since 2013, Veolia’s Executive  Management has been supported by  the Critical Friends Committee, a collective  discussion forum. External observers  offer their viewpoints on strategic topics  in relation to the Group’s corporate  responsibility, to foster and support its drive  for continuous progress. Chaired by   Jean-Michel Severino, CEO of the ethical   fund Investisseurs & Partenaires,  the committee is today made up of about  twelve independent experts in human  resources and social and environmental  issues, from institutions, the academic  community, non-profit organizations,  and company partners, including  a representative of young climate activists.  Committees in China and Japan are   following this model to discuss Veolia’s  strategic direction with experts in their  own countries. To combine corporate social responsibility  (CSR) and commercial challenges, and to  suggest a shared goal for collective action:  these are the challenges facing the  “+1, the ecology turned into actions” initiative.  Half think-tank, half do-tank, this Veolia  initiative, launched in 2021, brings together  Group stakeholders from different  backgrounds – employees, customers,  shareholders, society, and planet – to hold  frank discussions and foster new interactions.  This is a way of amplifying cooperation  and ideas to create more concerted solutions  for ecological transformation. Based on collective intelligence, the “+1”  method is available in open-source format  and can be applied to a range of contexts,  Over 250 VEOLIA STAKEHOLDERS  HAVE EXPERIMENTED   THE “+1” METHOD 12  COLLECTIVES FORMED  SINCE 2021 8  GEOGRAPHICAL ZONES  MOBILIZED (Australia and New Zealand,  Colombia, Czech Republic,  France, Italy, Japan,   United Kingdom,   United States) geographical zones, and subjects. Any willing  participant, from inside or outside Veolia,  can therefore take ownership of the process.  Indeed, it has already been applied to a  Group contract – Arianeo for Nice Côte d’Azur.  It is also currently being employed for  a Group Business Unit in Ireland, and  the Group partner Cercle français de l’eau  (French water circle), with the objective to  engage local stakeholders with a new water  narrative. As for creating Veolia’s next  strategic plan (2024-2027), the “+1” method  offers the opportunity for a consultation  with Group stakeholders in all its  geographical zones and underpins dialogue  with employee representatives from the  French and European organizations. “+1, THE ECOLOGY  TURNED INTO ACTIONS”  ===== PAGE 10 ===== 2023 • THE HEART OF VEOLIA’S MULTIFACETED PERFOR M ANCE 16 - 17 SUCCESSFUL ECOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATION ON A PLANETARY SCALE requires Veolia to provide  responses to three major issues: decarbonization, saving and regeneration of resources, and  depollution.

With the green taxonomy’s  implementation, the Group is now able  to analyze financial flows according  to ESG criteria, at the level of its 20,000 local  operations. The nearly €43 billion in revenue  from 2022 was therefore sifted through  using a digital application called GreenGrideo,  which places this complex system within  the reach of operational teams. The result: 33% of 2022 revenue is  sustainable according to the taxonomy’s  climate requirements, i.e. more than   two-thirds of eligible climate activities.  The extension of company auditing to  cover the taxonomy’s other environmental  topics is pending.

All this is underpinned by robust governance, respect for human rights, and  control of our risks.  ===== PAGE 15 ===== 2023 • THE HEART OF VEOLIA’S MULTIFACETED PERFOR M ANCE 26 - 27 ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE Energy  activity   30% (1) Wastewater  purification   27% Drinking water  production  and  distribution   41% Heat and  electricity  production  (energy  activity)   45% Waste  storage  (methane  emissions)   33% Waste incineration  18% TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE  EMERGENCY AND ITS IMPACTS  ON HUMAN ACTIVITY CHALLENGES  AND AMBITIONS Veolia has committed itself and its  customers to rolling out solutions for  reducing greenhouse gas emissions across   a number of action areas: → Reducing GHG emissions across the  entire value chain of the Group’s activities  (Scopes 1, 2 and 3). This notably includes  major investment in the Group’s own  production assets in line with its  commitment to eliminate coal from its  European operations by 2030, at an  estimated cost of €1.5 billion (€382 million  already invested as of 2022) and to ramp up  methane capture in its non-hazardous   waste storage facilities. are water stress and flooding. These risks are  included in the Group’s corporate risk  management process. In its 2020-2023  environmental plan, Veolia identified all its  sites at high risk of water stress, with the aim  of performing a full analysis over the duration  of the plan. In its sixth assessment report,(1) the IPCC  estimates that global warming will reach 1.5°C  by the early 2030s. The rapid reduction of   net global CO2 emissions to zero is one of its  priority solutions for limiting warming   to 1.5°C. Efforts to adapt infrastructure   and lifestyles to new climate conditions must  continue at the same time. Climate change  demands that business transitions more  quickly to a low-carbon economy and poses  physical risks to which Veolia and its  customers must now adapt. However, these  conditions also present a wealth of business  opportunities for the Group. To reduce our total GHG emissions   across Scopes 1, 2 and 3: → Phasing out coal in Europe by 2030; → Increasing methane capture: target   of 55% by 2023; → Net Zero trajectory: definition   of a trajectory for 2050 in the 2024-2027  strategic plan; → 30% reduction in carbon intensity   of Veolia activities since 2018. To help our customers avoid GHG  emissions through the circular economy   and the recovery of waste energy: → From 12.1 MtCO2 eq. avoided in 2019   to 14 MtCO2 eq. avoided in 2022 – target of   15 MtCO2 eq. avoided in 2023. To reduce our own and our customers’  energy consumption; to produce more  renewable and recovered energy: → 1.1 million MWh in 2022, up 13.4%  since 2019; → Target of energy self-sufficiency   in France by 2027. To innovate to capture CO2: in our  installations, in new material loops,   and through nature-based solutions. OUR COMMITMENTS IN THE FIGHT  AGAINST GLOBAL WARMING Our action levers → Planned massive  investment to phase out   coal by 2030: €1.5 billion,   -2.7 MtCO2; → Methane capture  investment plan: €70 million  in Latin America, -1.5 MtCO2  eq.; → ReSource plan:   €150 million investment   in two years to reduce   our energy consumption   by 5% and increase our   energy production by 5%. Decarbonization solutions  in all our businesses → Support to reduce consumption; → Efficiency and energy performance; → Electricity flexibility; → Recovery of waste energy; → Local production of low-carbon energy  (biogas, refuse-derived fuel, heat pumps,  decentralized solar, energy recovery from waste,  hydrogen, etc.); → Reclamation of materials from waste:  recycling (plastic, paper/card, metal, waste  electrical and electronic equipment), solvent  reclamation, compost/fertilizer production  from organic waste; → Energy recovery from water and  sanitation networks (micro-turbines and waste  heat recovery); → Nature-based water technologies that  are less energy intensive.

RECOGNITION OF A FOURTH SCOPE OF EMISSIONS To more accurately evaluate its climate action and support decarbonization  solutions, Veolia advocates changes to ESG rating criteria and the inclusion   of a Scope 4: emissions avoided compared with other existing solutions,  currently a blind spot in environmental ratings. This scope would allow  recognition of the efforts some organizations are making to decarbonize   the economy. → Developing solutions to enable its  customers to avoid emissions, which need   (to be recognized as part of a future Scope 4),  through wider application of its circular  economy solutions (production of secondary  raw materials and renewable energy from  waste and wastewater) and the recovery of  waste energy; → CO2 capture and voluntary offsetting  will ultimately be introduced during  implementation of the Group’s trajectory  toward carbon neutrality. When it comes to adapting to climate  change, the two main evolving physical risks  likely to negatively impact Veolia’s activities   ===== PAGE 16 ===== 2023 • THE HEART OF VEOLIA’S MULTIFACETED PERFOR M ANCE 28 - 29 ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE Our goals To prepare ourselves and support the  regions by offering adaptation solutions   to increase their resilience and protect   their water resources. Our approach → Mapping the natural risks and  associated impacts on activities (water stress  and flooding) in the short, medium, and   long-term, and assessing the financial impact  of doing nothing; → Analysis of exposure and vulnerabilities  affecting activities;  → Defining solutions for adapting   our activities.   Adaptation solutions  to protect water resources → Promote the conservation and efficient  use of water; → Protect the resource through sustainable  management of the large water cycle and by  combating leaks for the small water cycle;   → Create suitable uses and business models  for reusing treated wastewater;  CHALLENGES  AND AMBITIONS The worldwide explosion in consumption  of natural resources is causing depletion of,  and pressure on, strategic supplies for the  digital and energy transitions.   In addition, the intensive use of these  resources is having major environmental  impacts, including excessive water use,   harm to biodiversity, and greenhouse   gas emissions. The very essence of Veolia’s business is  to preserve natural resources. That is why  the Group is offering its customers a range  of solutions to achieve exactly that: → Production of “secondary raw materials”  from waste (recycled plastics, rare metals  from electronic waste, reclaimed solvents,  compost, etc.); → Production of renewable and recovered  energy from waste and wastewater, and  recovery of waste energy; → Reuse of treated wastewater; → Energy efficiency in buildings and  industrial facilities; → Synergies from multi-client sites (local  industrial ecology, biomass heat networks). Veolia is also contributing to the  mobilization of all public and private  stakeholders to accelerate the  implementation of circular economy  solutions, for example, the debate around   the anti-waste and circular economy law   in France, and the European Union Green  Deal and circular economy action plan. TO GROW THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY  AND SAVE AND REGENERATE  WATER RESOURCES VEOLIA’S ADAPTATION GOALS  AND SOLUTIONS In particular, Veolia’s proven expertise   in the sustainable management of water  resources enables it to make ambitious  commitments on behalf of its municipal   and industrial customers in relation   to preventing water risks and meeting public  expectations. This is based on a range   of technical, business and behavioral  solutions across the entire value chain.

CHALLENGES  AND AMBITIONS Worldwide, only 56% of domestic  wastewater is safely treated.(1) Reliable  sanitation services are key to public health,  but are lacking for 4.2 billion people, more  than half the world’s population.(2)   UNICEF and the WHO estimate that 80%   of wastewater worldwide is discharged  untreated into the environment.(3) Soil  quality and the chemical and ecological  status of watercourses continue   to deteriorate. Veolia’s activities help to preserve natural  environments and reduce a number of  pressures on biodiversity (climate change,  pollution, and overuse of natural resources  including water). Sanitation activities ensure  that high-quality water is discharged into   the natural environment, helping maintain  watercourses (flow-rate support and the  creation of good ecological conditions)   and protecting water resources against  pollution. The development of centralized  urban heat networks, constantly monitored  and subject to strict regulation, and the  selection of certified biomass streams   to power them, also reduce environmental  impacts compared with more polluting  systems. Collecting and treating waste limits  the spread of urban and industrial pollution  into soils, bodies of water and the  atmosphere. Veolia’s activities prevent   and repair the harm caused by toxic pollution,  treating and recovering toxic waste to protect  health and the environment, activities that  require a high level of expertise. Industrial activities taking place on   Group-operated sites can have direct   or indirect negative local environmental  impacts, though these are minuscule  compared with the reduction in its  customers’ impacts.

TO DEPOLLUTE TO PROTECT  ENVIRONMENTS AND BIODIVERSITY These include the consumption of natural  resources through site activities, the residual  pollution contained in operational discharges,  the sites’ greenhouse gas emissions, and  the potential impact of their footprint on  habitats. Control of these risks, which are  classed as operational risks, is an integral part  of the Group’s environmental policy. Each of Veolia’s activities is dependent  on ecosystem services: → Drinking water production correlates  directly with correct functioning of the large  water cycle and the capacity of natural  environments to purify themselves; → Sanitation activities depend on  ecological factors: microbial activity and   the capacity of aquatic environments  to assimilate residual loads are critical to  wastewater purification; → For energy, biomass activity requires   a sustainable supply of fuelwood or   plant waste.

CHALLENGES  AND AMBITIONS The Group contributes on many levels  to employment and development in  the regions where it operates, through  its management, its local facilities,  its human resources and purchasing  policies, the Veolia Foundation’s activities,  its policy of permanent dialogue with  local and institutional stakeholders,  and its business partnerships, plus its  schemes supporting innovation and  entrepreneurship and facilitating wider  access to services. Through these activities, Veolia   contributes to: → Economic and social vitality in the  regions where it operates; → Local resilience and adaptation to   new challenges; → Continuous dialogue with local  communities and the co-construction   of innovative services tailored to   local contexts; → Solidarity and the fight against  exclusion, especially through the  Veolia Foundation; → Building responsible relationships  with its suppliers. As part of its Purpose and the Impact   2023 strategic plan, Veolia committed   to amplifying this support for local  development, especially in terms of job  creation. To illustrate this commitment,   each year the Group uses the Local   Footprint method to evaluate its   socioeconomic impact in terms   of employment in all the countries  where it operates. TO CREATE  WEALTH LOCALLY Sustainable Development Goals SOCIAL PERFORMANCE Veolia manages all the sites where it  operates in such a way as to mitigate all   their local impacts, even transforming   them into biodiversity reservoirs.   Within the multifaceted performance  framework, more than a hundred “priority”  sites have been identified worldwide due to  their sensitive location and/or the type of  activity carried out there, and specific action  plans have been assigned to them.  Additionally, the Group is in the process of  extending its ecological soil management  and “zero pesticide” policies to all its facilities.  Lastly, in line with TNFD recommendations,  the Group has reviewed all its value chain’s  impacts and nature dependencies. It is now  incorporating the results into its processes,  particularly its environmental risk management  and purchasing policy.

This AEMR covers the period from the 15th January 2022 to 14th January 2023 (reporting period). Veolia has prepared this AEMR in accordance with Consent Condition 58 and 59 of the Development Consent DA 205-08-01 (the Consent) and subsequent modifications, as well as relevant legislative requirements and industry best practices. This AEMR provides a summary of environmental monitoring conducted at the Terminal and any non-compliances identified against the Consent during the reporting period, as well as the corrective actions, where implemented, to address such non-compliances. An Independent Environmental Audit (IEA), undertaken in accordance with Condition 60 of the Consent, identified 3 non-compliances against the Conditions of the Consent (hereby referred to as Consent Conditions) during this reporting period which are as  follows: ● Condition 50, did not include all the required content of the development consent. ● Condition 66, the Waste Management Plan (WMP) does not specifically include detail for asbestos identification and disposal. ● Condition 114, no specific training program for rail operators to minimise potential noise nuisance was observed. TEM-41-1 Review Period: Annual Uncontrolled when printed Page 5 of 40  ===== PAGE 7 ===== NSW Resource Recovery Annual Environmental Management Report - Clyde Transfer Terminal Issue Date 14/03/2023 1. Introduction 1.1 Site Background The Terminal is located within a portion of the Clyde Rail Yard at 322 Parramatta Road and forms part of Lot 21 of DP10076683 in the Cumberland City Council area (Council). A site layout and location plan is provided in Appendix A. The Terminal was granted ministerial approval in 2003 to operate under the Clyde Waste Transfer Terminal (Special Provisions) Act 2003 (assented 8 December 2003). The Consent was modified (29 April 2019) to permit the Terminal to receive up to 600,000 tonnes per annum (TPA) of mixed waste. Clyde Waste Transfer Terminal commenced operations in 2004, accepting putrescible waste from the Sydney metropolitan area, which is containerised and loaded onto rail wagons for transportation in the Southern Tablelands (approximately 250 kilometres southwest of Sydney) for treatment, recycling and energy recovery. 1.2 Legislative Requirements The key environmental legislation for the Terminal includes the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (EP&A Act) regulated by the DPE, and the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (POEO Act) regulated by the NSW Environment Protection Authority (EPA), as well as their respective associated regulations. Legislative instruments governing the environmental performance for the Terminal include the Consent, under the Clyde Waste Transfer Terminal (Special Provisions) Act 2003 and an Environment Protection Licence (EPL) 11763 issued by the EPA,  under the POEO Act.

Environmental Monitoring and Management 2.1 Monitoring Requirements The following sections detail the monitoring undertaken throughout the reporting period in accordance with the Environmental Monitoring Program proposed within the Operational Environmental Management Plan (OEMP). The Environmental Monitoring Program provides details on all monitoring requirements of the Consent and other appropriate regulations to measure and assess the continuing suitability, adequacy and effectiveness of on-site environmental management measures. Table 2.1 summarises the environmental monitoring program for the Terminal and a monitoring location plan is provided in Appendix C. Table 2.1 - Summary of the environmental monitoring program for the Terminal Consent Condition Type of Monitoring Frequency Commentary 48 (f) Odour Audits Biannual Condition satisfied, monitoring conducted on 8 June and 21 December 2022 49 Dust monitoring Following receipt of dust complaint, as required Not triggered 50 Traffic Monitoring Monthly Ongoing basis 60 Independent Environmental Audit Annual Condition satisfied, audit conducted in December 2022 91 Meteorological monitoring Continuous (15 minute intervals) Ongoing basis 117 Pest and Vermin Inspections Quarterly Ongoing basis TEM-41-1 Review Period: Annual Uncontrolled when printed Page 9 of 40  ===== PAGE 11 ===== NSW Resource Recovery Annual Environmental Management Report - Clyde Transfer Terminal Issue Date 14/03/2023 2.1.1 Meteorology Veolia operates an automated onsite weather station (Campbell Scientific Model CR800) to continuously log meteorological data, in accordance with Consent Condition 91. This allows sampling and analysis of the parameters specified in Table 2.2 below, along with standards and statutory requirements to collect and record this data. Table 2.2 - Meteorological data parameters and performance measures Parameter Performance Measure Standards Statutory Requirement Wind Speed Data correlated with other environmental monitoring results for Terminal operations and complaint resolution AM-2 & AM-4 Consent Condition 91 Wind Direction AM-2 & AM-4 Sigma Theta AM-2 & AM-4 Temperature AM-4 Rainfall AM-4 Solar Radiation AM-4 Evaporation Penman-Monteith method Captured meteorological data provides a general understanding of the ambient air conditions at the Terminal, which in turn allows us to use this data within investigations of potential odour and dust complaints as well as other environmental incidents. Justification for the collection of specific meteorological data is provided below. Wind Speed, Wind Direction and Sigma Theta Wind speed, direction and sigma theta (which are used to calibrate turbulence) are logged at 15-minute intervals, the data from which is used to respond to odour and noise complaints, on receipt. Temperature and Solar Radiation In combination with wind speed, temperature and sunlight (solar radiation) play an important role in odour and dust emission modelling to predict airflow patterns and atmospheric stability. In the event that a complaint is received, these parameters would be used to conduct assessments to identify whether adverse air quality impacts can be attributed to operations at the Terminal. TEM-41-1 Review Period: Annual Uncontrolled when printed Page 10 of 40  ===== PAGE 12 ===== NSW Resource Recovery Annual Environmental Management Report - Clyde Transfer Terminal Issue Date 14/03/2023 Evaporation Evaporation measures the extent of vaporisation of a liquid into gaseous phase. Water molecules are small and highly polar which can bind to many substances including odorous gases and dust particles. Therefore, evaporation can be used to conduct dispersion modelling in the event of an odour/or dust complaint. Rainfall Rainfall data is measured and recorded at 15-minute intervals at the Terminal to provide an understanding of rainfall patterns and to highlight significant rainfall events. Rainfall generally affects the emissions of dust and odours, as it is able to wash particulate matter and dissolves gaseous pollutants out of the atmosphere. Given this, rainfall data is utilised within responses to odour and/or dust complaints. In addition, the intensity and duration of stormwater events at the Terminal can be used to assess the performance of the stormwater management system. A summary of monthly rainfall and evaporation rates, as well as minimum and maximum monthly temperatures at the Terminal during this reporting period is presented below in Figures 2.1 and 2.2 respectively. Overall, the average rainfall for the Terminal during this reporting period was recorded at 137 mm per month.

During the reporting period, no non-compliances relating to the collection of meteorological data occurred. Servicing and calibration of the meteorological station was carried out by Hydrometric Consulting Services (HCS). Calibration records for the months of April 2022, July 2022, October 2022 and January 2023 can be found in Appendix D1. 2.2 Air Quality In accordance with the Consent, the Terminal has adopted performance criteria pertaining to dust and odour emissions, which are summarised in Section 2.2.1 and Section 2.2.2 respectively. Air quality monitoring was carried out as required to determine whether activities conducted at the Terminal impacted ambient air quality. Further details regarding air quality monitoring and management practices undertaken at the Terminal are provided in the following sections. TEM-41-1 Review Period: Annual Uncontrolled when printed Page 12 of 40  ===== PAGE 14 ===== NSW Resource Recovery Annual Environmental Management Report - Clyde Transfer Terminal Issue Date 14/03/2023 2.2.1 Dust To manage dust, Veolia utilises and maintains a dust suppression system in the waste shed. Further controls for areas within close proximity of the waste shed are regularly maintained with the use of the road sweeper and general housekeeping. In accordance with Consent Condition 49, following the receipt of any dust related complaints, investigations would be undertaken to monitor or implement additional measures aimed to mitigate identified dust impacts on residential or commercial areas, associated with the operation of the Terminal. The NSW EPA (2007 and 2017) air quality parameters that would be measured to determine dust emissions, are provided in Table 2.3. Table 2.3 - NSW EPA air quality impact Dust assessment criteria Parameters Performance Measure Standards Statutory Requirement Total Suspended Particulates (TSP) - Annual Average 90μg/m3 Approved Methods for the Sampling and Analysis of Air Pollutants in NSW Consent Condition 49 Deposited Dust (DD) - Incremental 2 g/m2/month Deposited Dust (DD) - Cumulative 4 g/m2/month The EIS prediction expected some minor air quality impacts during operation (Maunsell McIntyre, 2001). The level of impact is minimised through effective site control measures so that residents and commercial industries surrounding the site are not impacted at a level likely to cause nuisance. No dust complaints were received during this reporting period therefore monitoring requirements were not triggered. 2.2.2 Odour The requirements of Consent Conditions 48(e) and 77 are to ensure site operations meet the EPA’s odour goal of less than 2 odour units (OU) at the nearest sensitive receiver (Refer to Table 2.4). Table 2.4 - Odour Emission Performance Criteria Parameter Performance Measure Standards Statutory Requirement Odour Emissions 2 OU German Standard VDI 3940 “Determination of Odorants in Ambient Air Consent Condition 48E TEM-41-1 Review Period: Annual Uncontrolled when printed Page 13 of 40  ===== PAGE 15 ===== NSW Resource Recovery Annual Environmental Management Report - Clyde Transfer Terminal Issue Date 14/03/2023 by Field Inspections” To achieve this goal, the Terminal operates an air extraction system within the Terminal’s building, which was designed to both ventilate the building, and capture and disperse odour emissions from within the building. In addition, containers used for the transportation of waste are fitted with activated carbon filtration systems on the air exhaust vents. In accordance with Consent Condition 48, the performance of odour control and ventilation equipment is assessed in biannual odour audits which were conducted by the Odour Unit PTY LTD. Records of the May and December 2022 odour audits are provided in Appendix D2. Table 2.5 below provides a summary of the odour audit results. The odour audits were conducted using the ranking scale stipulated within the German Standard VDI 3940 “Determination of Odorants in Ambient Air by Field Inspections”. The standard ranking system is based on the following seven-point intensity scale, as follows: VDI 3940 Intensity Scale 0 Not Detectable 1 Very Weak 2 Weak 3 Distinct 4 Strong 5 Very Strong 6 Extremely Strong Table 2.5 - Summary of Odour Audit Results 2022 Assessment Location Wind Direction 08/06/2022 Assessment Location Wind Direction 21/12/2022 1 -  Onsite (North-West) NW 0 1 - Onsite (North-West) ESE 0 2 - Onsite (South-East) NW 0 2 - Onsite (South-East) ESE 0 3 - Onsite (South-East) NW 0 3 - Onsite (South-East) ESE 0 TEM-41-1 Review Period: Annual Uncontrolled when printed Page 14 of 40  ===== PAGE 16 ===== NSW Resource Recovery Annual Environmental Management Report - Clyde Transfer Terminal Issue Date 14/03/2023 4 - Offsite (Auburn Residential) NW 0 4 - Offsite (Clyde/Auburn Residential) E 0 5 - Offsite (Auburn Residential) NW 0 5 - Offsite (Auburn Residential) ESE 0 6 - Offsite (Auburn Residential) NW 0 6 - Offsite (Auburn Residential) SE 0 Odour audits undertaken on the 8th of June and 21st of December 2022, detected 0 odorants in the Field Ambient Odour-Assessments. The results of the two odour audits indicate the Terminal complies with Consent Condition 48(e), which states that odour at the Terminal shall not exceed 2OU at the nearest receiver. The Terminal continues to meet the requirements of the Technical framework: assessment and management of odour from stationary sources in NSW (DEC, November 2006). Veolia also maintains a thorough housekeeping regime, combined with odour management controls, which help to minimise the likelihood of odour impacts on surrounding neighbours/receivers. No odour complaints were received during this reporting period. 2.3 Noise Monitoring Table 2.6 lists the parameters, respective performance measures, standards and statutory requirements for background noise levels and vehicle emissions limits.

All waste received at the Terminal is recorded and maintained in the Systems, Applications and Products in Data Processing (SAP) software. The program records vehicle registration, date and time of entry and exit, the gross and tare weight of the vehicle, as well as the nature and origin of waste received by each contractor. Procedures are in place to reject or separate non-conforming waste upon arrival at the site. These procedures include visual assessments of incoming wastes by weighbridge operators assisted by closed circuit television (CCTV), as well as inspecting the waste as it is unloaded onto the tip floor.  No records of non-conforming waste were reported during this reporting period. Furthermore, data is recorded and tracked for the containers and includes container status, container weight comparisons and carbon filter replacement. This information is maintained daily by Terminal personnel. 2.5.1 Waste Volume Monitoring The amount of waste accepted at the Terminal in the 2022 calendar year totalled 457,332 tonnes as summarised in Table 2.8 below.

This demonstrates the Terminal operated within the annual waste limit as stipulated within Consent Condition 10. 2.6 Pests and Vermin Pests and vermin management is undertaken at the Terminal to ensure that the control measures implemented to minimise the potential for birds, rodents, flies and other pests, remain effective. The primary means of controlling pest and vermin activity is through good housekeeping measures, daily inspections, and quarterly pest control services. Table 2.9 below identifies the housekeeping undertaken at the Terminal to manage pests and vermin. Table 2.9 - Pest and Vermin Management Parameter Performance Measure Standard Statutory Requirement Litter and Odour Control Visual Inspection and housekeeping Veolia Business Management System Vermin and Pest Control Plan- Consent Conditions 51, 115-117 Vermin Habitat Pest control was undertaken by Expert throughout this reporting period. In addition, inspections are undertaken on a routine basis by the Terminal’s operators, as part of general housekeeping and recorded on relevant housekeeping and inspection checklists. The checklists provide a record of the visual monitoring undertaken at the Terminal and provide opportunity to identify where additional corrective actions may need to be applied. During the quarterly pest and vermin control services this reporting period, the external contractor inspected and treated all internal, external areas of the waste shed and site facilities for cockroaches, ants, spiders and rodents. These areas were treated with Roban rodent bait and Cislin 25 spray respectively. The reports can be found in Appendix D4.

Environmental Performance The environmental performance of the Terminal is assessed through the results of environmental monitoring, internal inspections, as well as external environmental audits. An IEA of the Terminal’s environmental performance was undertaken on 13 December 2022 by Epic Environmental. The objective of this IEA was to assess the environmental performance of the Terminal and identify any non-compliances against environmental approval issued to the Terminal, as required by Condition 6 of the Consent. The status of each condition of the consent can be found in the Development of Consent table provided in Appendix B. A discussion of the non-compliances identified by the IEA, as well as the corrective actions, where implemented, is provided within this section. A comparison is also made to the non-compliances/regulatory actions and corrective actions implemented in the previous reporting period to present the changes to the environmental performance of the Terminal. 3.1 Previous Non-Compliances Two non-compliances were identified during the 2021 reporting period and the status of corrective actions to resolve/manage the non-compliances are detailed in Table 3.1 below.

The visit was undertaken on 8 June 2022 and is part of an on-going six-monthly  odour audit surveillance program that has been completed since the commissioning of  the forced air extraction system at the Site.  1.1 ODOUR AUDIT PERIOD  Odour Audit XXXIX covers the period between 25 November 2022 and 8 June 2022  (the Odour Audit).   1.2 ODOUR AUDIT REQUIREMENTS  The Odour Audit requirements originate from the Conditions of Consent – 48(f) and are  outlined as follows:    “48. The Odour Management Plan must address, but is not necessarily  limited to, the following issues:    (f) An odour audit program which provides for a comprehensive odour  audit of the premises and nearby commercial and residential areas, by  an independent, appropriately qualified and experienced person, to be  conducted 3-monthly for the initial 24 months of receiving un- containerised waste at the terminal, 3-monthly for the 12 months  following commissioning the odour control system subject to MOD-133- 11-2006, and 6-monthly thereafter, unless otherwise approved in writing  by the Director-General.”  As with previous odour audits, Odour Audit XXXIX focused on issues relating to general  housekeeping, fugitive odour emissions from the transfer building, ground level odour  impacts, meteorological monitoring, complaints handling, and actions on past odour  audit recommendations.  Specifically, the Odour Audit approach included:   ▪ A general inspection and smoke testing of the transfer building;   ▪ The inspection of the container packing area and site access roads;   ▪ The examination of the complaint register;   ▪ The review of the on-site meteorological data log and equipment maintenance/  calibration;   ▪ The analysis of relevant documentation relating to odour management; and  ▪ The undertaking of an off-site downwind Field Ambient Odour Assessment  (FAOA) survey.    ===== PAGE 71 =====                                                       THE ODOUR UNIT     VEOLIA (AUSTRALIA) PTY LTD  CLYDE WASTE TRANSFER TERMINAL –   ODOUR AUDIT XXXIX  2    1.3 PREVAILING WEATHER CONDITIONS  At the time of the Odour Audit visit, the prevailing weather conditions were light (1.0 –  3.0 metres per second (m/s)) wind speeds with the local wind direction blowing  predominantly from the northwest.  The skies were clear and the ambient temperature  during the Odour Audit visit was between 13 and 18 degrees Celsius (°C) during the  Odour Audit visit.  No rainfall was observed during the Odour Audit visit.       ===== PAGE 72 =====                                                       THE ODOUR UNIT     VEOLIA (AUSTRALIA) PTY LTD  CLYDE WASTE TRANSFER TERMINAL –   ODOUR AUDIT XXXIX  3    2 ODOUR AUDIT FINDINGS  2.1 ASSESSMENT OF GENERAL HOUSEKEEPING   Transfer Terminal Building  During the Odour Audit visit, there were approximately 130-160 tonnes of waste on the  floor.  This tonnage is within the normal operating range of the Transfer Terminal  Building (TTB).  The TTB floor area not covered by waste material was observed to be  reasonably clean, with little evidence of leachate or aged material.  General  housekeeping procedures of the TTB were good, as found during several truck- unloading sequences.  It was also observed that the TTB’s front-end loaders cleared  the floor area of waste on a regular basis, minimising the exposed area of waste.   As with previous audits, and consistent with TOU’s experience at other waste transfer  stations, there was a weak to distinct level of odour observed within the TTB.  A photo  of the waste on the floor as found during the Odour Audit visit is shown in Photo 2.1.          Photo 2.1 – TTB waste on-floor as found on 8 June 2022 (during a smoke test)   Container Packing Area and Site Roadways  The container packing area and site roadways were found to be clean and well  managed with no evidence of waste or exposed leachate.  Like previous odour audits,  the container compacting/train packing area had a weak to distinct odour that was  intermittently detectable but was confined to this area only (refer to Appendix B for  FAOA results).  TOU was advised by a Veolia personnel that one of the two compactors   ===== PAGE 73 =====                                                       THE ODOUR UNIT     VEOLIA (AUSTRALIA) PTY LTD  CLYDE WASTE TRANSFER TERMINAL –   ODOUR AUDIT XXXIX  4    were in operation at the time of the Odour Audit visit.  The general housekeeping around  this area was observed to be of high quality, with no evidence to suggest otherwise.  As with previous Odour Audits, the containers are cleaned off-site at Veolia’s Woodlawn  Bioreactor Facility before being returned to the Site.  The weight of each container is  monitored to determine if there is any waste that has not been removed completely from  each container, which in turn reduces the likelihood of the containers contributing to the  Site’s odour levels.  2.1.2.1 Container Management and Maintenance  Based on previous verbal discussions with the Veolia team and observations made  during the visit, the Odour Audit finds that Veolia continues to implement the policies  and procedures as outlined in the following documents:  ▪ The container management and maintenance procedures titled NSW Resource  Recovery – Container Maintenance dated 15 September 2017 (the September  2017 NSW RR Container Document), which details the following:   o The design of the containers;  o The maintenance and management of the activated carbon filter retrofitted  to the containers;  o The container management procedure; and  o The container maintenance procedure.  ▪ The waste container preparation requirements for the Site (the September 2017  Container Preparation Document), which details the following:  o The inspections and actions to be undertaken by operators to enable  containers to be prepared to an acceptable standard;  o The steps to be undertaken should a damaged container be identified;  and  o The steps to be undertaken should a leaking container be identified.   Odour Management Plan  As per the Odour Management Plan dated February 2010 (the February 2010 OMP)  for the Site, following the compaction of waste, all filled containers are entirely sealed  and remain so while at the Site.  All containers used are required to be in good condition,  and unused/returned containers adequately clean.  The Odour Audit finds that this  continues to be current practice at the Site.  A view of the condition of the container area  as found on 8 June 2022 is shown in Photo 2.2.           ===== PAGE 74 =====                                                       THE ODOUR UNIT     VEOLIA (AUSTRALIA) PTY LTD  CLYDE WASTE TRANSFER TERMINAL –   ODOUR AUDIT XXXIX  5          Photo 2.2 – A view of the container area as found on 8 June 2022   Odour Extraction System Maintenance  The service documentation for the maintenance of the odour extraction system was  supplied and reviewed as part of the Odour Audit (refer to Appendix A).  The service  logs were provided covering the period between November 2021 to May 2022.  Each service log provided to the Odour Audit indicated that the required inspection and  maintenance works were taking place by a suitable service contractor, and the odour  extraction system overall was operating efficiently.  The service logs during this period  noted that all the necessary support works such as checking the fan belts and unit  operations, greasing bearings, component replacement, and other routine preventative  maintenance works were being inspected and undertaken.  It is noted that the variable  speed drive (VSD) on Fan 2 experienced an earth fault on 14 April 2021.  This was  rectified on 21 April 2022.    Given the above and based on the positive results obtained for the smoke testing, odour  complaints register, and the FAOA survey conducted as part of the Odour Audit visit, it  appears that the current operation of the odour extraction system is satisfactory.     Odour Management Procedures/Plan  The Odour Management Procedures (formerly known as the Odour Minimising  Procedures) continue to be regularly reviewed at toolbox meetings, and contemporary  issues/recommendations are raised with all staff members at these meetings.    Veolia has advised The Odour Audit that the February 2010 OMP is still in the process  of being reviewed and updated. However, TOU was provided a copy of the draft   ===== PAGE 75 =====                                                       THE ODOUR UNIT     VEOLIA (AUSTRALIA) PTY LTD  CLYDE WASTE TRANSFER TERMINAL –   ODOUR AUDIT XXXIX  6    Operational Environmental Management Plan for the Site dated 6 November 2020 (the  Draft OEMP).  Upon finalisation of the Draft OEMP and consolidation of all referenced  documents, the Odour Audit will review this document in its entirety.  Nevertheless, the  annual review and commitment to continuous improvement to the operational and  environmental management procedures and practices at the Site is endorsed by the  Odour Audit.   Transfer Terminal Building   The Odour Audit inspected the fixed metal plates retrofitted along the TTB breezeways  in December 2013.  All metal plates were found to be intact and in good condition around  the TTB.  All doors and roller shutters of the TTB were found to be shut at the time of  the Odour Audit, reducing the likelihood of odour impacts detected off-site.  The louvres  on the end walls of the TTB were observed to be permanently shut.   Truck Entrance Plastic Strips  The truck entrance plastic strips of the TTB, used to reduce odour escaping through the  opening, were found to be intact and in good condition (refer to Photo 2.3).          Photo 2.3 – A view of the truck entrance plastic strips as found on 8 June 2022   Smoke Testing  As per previous audits, smoke testing was carried out within the TTB to assist in  determining the effectiveness of the forced air extraction system, as well as the extent  to which the TTB has been sealed from leaks.  As per previous audits, smoke was  released from within the TTB at three points within the TTB.  Figure 2.1 shows the three  points where the smoke was released within the TTB.  Photo 2.4 shows smoke testing   ===== PAGE 76 =====                                                       THE ODOUR UNIT     VEOLIA (AUSTRALIA) PTY LTD  CLYDE WASTE TRANSFER TERMINAL –   ODOUR AUDIT XXXIX  7    at the truck entrance of the TTB, which reflects an additional test location to the normal  smoke testing release points shown in Figure 2.1.

Visible smoke extraction at the overhead capture  points was evident during the smoke testing at this point.  Smoke Testing Point #2  The smoke released at this point initially moved similarly to smoke testing point #1, but  the flow pattern changed such that it moved away from the extraction system at ground  level.  As it travelled to the truck entrance-side wall, the smoke began to rise towards  the roof and then towards the extraction system.  Smoke Testing Point #3  The smoke released at this point revealed a similar result to that documented for smoke  testing point #1.  2.2 ODOUR COMPLAINTS HANDLING AND METEOROLOGICAL DATA   Odour Complaints Handling  As advised by Veolia personnel, there have been no complaints recorded in the Site’s  complaints register since March 2012.   Meteorological Data  The meteorological data provided to the Odour Audit, covering the period of between  November 2021 and June 2022, was inspected and found to be in good order.  As found  in previous Odour Audits, the observations were provided in daily 15-minute intervals  and included all parameters necessary to develop a meteorological dataset for odour  dispersion modelling.    As indicated via service records completed by Hydrometric Consulting Services (HCS)  supplied by Veolia to the Odour Audit, the weather station continues to remain located  in an accessible area with the solar panel and components regularly cleaned, and  installation sprayed periodically for insects and trimming of nearby vegetation as  required to ensure no overgrowth immediately around the weather station pole.  Overall,  HCS indicated that the weather stations were operating well, and any identified issues  were rectified. The weather data calibration and service reports by HCS are appended  as Appendix B.    2.3 FIELD AMBIENT ODOUR ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY  At present, no Australian Standard exists for field-based ambient odour assessment  surveys.  Consequently, TOU utilises a method for assessing the ground-level impacts  of odour emissions using a modified version of the German Standard VDI 3940 (1993)  – ‘Determination of Odorants in Ambient Air by Field Inspections’.    Field-based ambient odour surveys are considered a valuable odour impact  assessment tool as previous experience with ambient odour sampling and subsequent   ===== PAGE 78 =====                                                       THE ODOUR UNIT     VEOLIA (AUSTRALIA) PTY LTD  CLYDE WASTE TRANSFER TERMINAL –   ODOUR AUDIT XXXIX  9    olfactometry testing suggests that accurate and useful ambient odour concentration  data is difficult to obtain.  Therefore, TOU has adopted a more practical approach based  on the field measurement of odour intensity.  With this method, calibrated and  experienced odour specialists traverse the downwind surrounds of odour sources in a  strategically mapped pattern, assessing the presence, character and intensity of any  odours encountered and recording these observations along with wind speed and  direction.   An ambient odour assessment was performed on 8 June 2022 between 1155 hrs and  1253 hrs.  The FAOA survey was undertaken at strategic locations, both on-site and off- site.  The ambient odour assessment focus was off-site, as required by the Conditions  of Consent on “……nearby commercial and residential areas……” (Section 48 (f)).  The  TOU assessor firstly determined the wind direction using a Kestrel 4500 Pocket  Weather Tracker Anemometer and then assessed upwind and downwind locations of  the TTB.  The assessors spent approximately five minutes at each assessment location to gauge  the effects of any odour impact.  If an odour was detected at a location, the assessors  attempted to characterise it.  The general aim was to determine the extent of the impact  of odours off-site and rank their intensity.  The ranking scale for the German Standard  VDI 3940 ‘Determination of Odorants in Ambient Air by Field Inspections’ was used for  the intensity assessments.  The standard’s ranking system is based on the following  seven-point intensity scale, as shown in Table 2.1.    Table 2.1 – VDI 3882 Odour Intensity Categories   Odour Strength  Intensity Rank  (code)  TOU Interpretation  (meaning)  Not detectable  0  No odour detected  Very weak  1  Odour detected but not strong enough to be  characterised  Weak  2  Odour is weak but just able to be  characterised  Distinct  3  Odour is distinct and easily characterised  Strong  4  Strong odour detectable  Very Strong  5  If offensive, the observer may consider  moving from the area  Extremely Strong  6  Odour is sufficiently over-powering that  assessor moves from the area     Field Ambient Odour Assessment - Results  The results of the FAOA survey conducted during the Odour Audit found that whilst  intermittent odours were detected on-site, no odours were detectable off-site that could  be linked back to the Site and its activities. This is a good outcome and reflects the   ===== PAGE 79 =====                                                       THE ODOUR UNIT     VEOLIA (AUSTRALIA) PTY LTD  CLYDE WASTE TRANSFER TERMINAL –   ODOUR AUDIT XXXIX  10    findings from previous odour audits.  The field log sheets, and visual survey plot are  appended as Appendix C.     ===== PAGE 80 =====                                                       THE ODOUR UNIT     VEOLIA (AUSTRALIA) PTY LTD  CLYDE WASTE TRANSFER TERMINAL –   ODOUR AUDIT XXXIX  11    3 RECOMMENDATIONS/FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS  3.1 PREVIOUS AUDIT ACTIONS  The following list provides an outline of the last November 2021 odour audit actions and  status as of the Odour Audit:    ▪ Previous Audit Action 1: Action 1 – Continue with the on-going review and  commitment to continuous improvement of the Draft OEMP and referenced  documents.    ▪ Status: On-going and will be reassessed in the next odour audit.  3.2 TRANSFER TERMINAL BUILDING  All metal plates were found to be intact and in good condition around the TTB.  All doors  and roller shutters of the TTB were found to be shut at the time of the Odour Audit,  reducing the likelihood of odour impacts detected off-site.  The louvres on the end walls  of the TTB were observed to be permanently shut.  Overall, the TTB was found to be  well managed.  Based on the findings in the Odour Audit, the following action is recommended:  ▪ No further action is required at this stage.  3.3 COMPACTOR AREA  The general housekeeping around the compactor area was observed to be of high  quality, with no evidence to suggest otherwise.  As with previous Odour Audits, the  container compacting/train packing area had a weak to distinct odour that was  intermittently detectable but was found to be confined to this area only.   Based on the findings in this Odour Audit, the following action is recommended:  ▪ No further action is required at this stage.  3.4 ODOUR EXTRACTION SYSTEM  The service logs indicate that all required maintenance works on the odour extraction  system since the previous November 2021 odour audit have been adequately  undertaken, and the odour extraction system is operating in a satisfactory condition.  Based on the findings in the Odour Audit, the following action is recommended:  ▪ No further action is required at this stage.  3.5 WEATHER STATION  The dataset obtained from the weather station was found to be adequate.  Moreover,  the calibration and service reports from HCS indicate that all maintenance to the  weather station and required calibrations were carried out as needed.    Based on the findings in the Odour Audit, the following action is recommended:   ===== PAGE 81 =====                                                       THE ODOUR UNIT     VEOLIA (AUSTRALIA) PTY LTD  CLYDE WASTE TRANSFER TERMINAL –   ODOUR AUDIT XXXIX  12    ▪ No further action is required at this stage.  3.6 OFF-SITE ODOUR IMPACTS  The results of the FAOA survey conducted during the Odour Audit found that no odours  were detectable off-site that could be linked back to the Site and its activities.    Based on the findings in the Odour Audit, the following action is recommended:  ▪ No further action is required at this stage.  3.7 ODOUR MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES/PLAN  At the timing of the writing of the Odour Audit, the February 2010 OMP was last updated  over eight years ago.  Given the previous update, it is suggested that as part of good  practice that Veolia reviews and update the February 2010 OMP to ensure it continues  to reflect the odour management procedures implemented and followed at the Site.   TOU was provided a copy of the Draft OEMP.  Upon finalisation of the Draft OEMP and  consolidation of all referenced documents, the Odour Audit will review this document in  its entirety.  Nevertheless, the annual review and commitment to continuous  improvement to the operational and environmental management procedures and  practices at the Site is endorsed by the Odour Audit.

commissioned by Veolia (Australia) Pty Ltd (Veolia)  to undertake the fortieth (XXXX) Odour Audit at the Clyde Transfer Terminal (the Site).   The visit was undertaken on 21 December 2022 and is part of an on-going six-monthly  odour audit surveillance program that has been completed since the commissioning of  the forced air extraction system at the Site.  1.1 ODOUR AUDIT PERIOD  Odour Audit XXXX covers the period between 8 June 2022 and 21 December 2022 (the  Odour Audit).   1.2 ODOUR AUDIT REQUIREMENTS  The Odour Audit requirements originate from the Conditions of Consent – 48(f) and are  outlined as follows:    “48. The Odour Management Plan must address, but is not necessarily  limited to, the following issues:    (f) An odour audit program which provides for a comprehensive odour  audit of the premises and nearby commercial and residential areas, by  an independent, appropriately qualified and experienced person, to be  conducted 3-monthly for the initial 24 months of receiving un- containerised waste at the terminal, 3-monthly for the 12 months  following commissioning the odour control system subject to MOD-133- 11-2006, and 6-monthly thereafter, unless otherwise approved in writing  by the Director-General.”  As with previous odour audits, Odour Audit XXXX focused on issues relating to general  housekeeping, fugitive odour emissions from the transfer building, ground level odour  impacts, meteorological monitoring, complaints handling, and actions on past odour  audit recommendations.  Specifically, the Odour Audit approach included:   ▪ A general inspection and smoke testing of the transfer building;   ▪ The inspection of the container packing area and site access roads;   ▪ The examination of the complaint register;   ▪ The review of the on-site meteorological data log and equipment maintenance/  calibration;   ▪ The analysis of relevant documentation relating to odour management; and  ▪ The undertaking of an off-site downwind Field Ambient Odour Assessment  (FAOA) survey.    ===== PAGE 122 =====                                                       THE ODOUR UNIT     VEOLIA (AUSTRALIA) PTY LTD  CLYDE WASTE TRANSFER TERMINAL –   ODOUR AUDIT XXXX  2    1.3 PREVAILING WEATHER CONDITIONS  At the time of the Odour Audit visit, the prevailing weather conditions were light to  moderate (2.0 – 4.0 metres per second (m/s)) wind speeds with the local wind direction  blowing predominantly from the southeast.  The skies were clear and the ambient  temperature during the Odour Audit visit was between 17 and 21 degrees Celsius (°C)  during the Odour Audit visit.  No rainfall was observed during the Odour Audit visit.       ===== PAGE 123 =====                                                       THE ODOUR UNIT     VEOLIA (AUSTRALIA) PTY LTD  CLYDE WASTE TRANSFER TERMINAL –   ODOUR AUDIT XXXX  3    2 ODOUR AUDIT FINDINGS  2.1 ASSESSMENT OF GENERAL HOUSEKEEPING   Transfer Terminal Building  During the Odour Audit visit, there were approximately 140 tonnes of waste on the floor.   This tonnage is within the normal operating range of the Transfer Terminal Building  (TTB).  The TTB floor area not covered by waste material was observed to be  reasonably clean, with little evidence of leachate or aged material.  The general  housekeeping procedures of the TTB were good, as found during several truck- unloading sequences.  It was also observed that the TTB’s front-end loaders cleared  the floor area of waste on a regular basis, minimising the exposed area of waste.   As with previous audits, and consistent with TOU’s experience at other waste transfer  stations, there was a weak to distinct level of odour observed within the TTB.  A photo  of the waste on the floor as found during the Odour Audit visit is shown in Photo 2.1.          Photo 2.1 – TTB waste on-floor as found on 21 December 2022 (during a smoke test)   Container Packing Area and Site Roadways  The container packing area and site roadways were found to be clean and well  managed with no evidence of waste or exposed leachate.  Like previous odour audits,  the container compacting/train packing area had a weak to distinct odour that was   ===== PAGE 124 =====                                                       THE ODOUR UNIT     VEOLIA (AUSTRALIA) PTY LTD  CLYDE WASTE TRANSFER TERMINAL –   ODOUR AUDIT XXXX  4    intermittently detectable but was confined to this area only (refer to Appendix B for  FAOA results).  TOU was advised by a Veolia personnel that one of the two compactors  were in operation at the time of the Odour Audit visit.  The general housekeeping around  this area was observed to be maintained to a high quality, with no evidence to suggest  otherwise.  As with previous Odour Audits, the containers are cleaned off-site at Veolia’s Woodlawn  Bioreactor Facility before being returned to the Site.  The weight of each container is  monitored to determine if there is any waste that has not been removed completely from  each container, which in turn reduces the likelihood of the containers contributing to the  Site’s odour levels.  2.1.2.1 Container Management and Maintenance  Based on previous discussions with the Veolia team and observations made during the  visit, the Odour Audit finds that Veolia continues to implement the policies and  procedures as outlined in the following documents:  ▪ The container management and maintenance procedures titled NSW Resource  Recovery – Container Maintenance dated 15 September 2017 (the September  2017 NSW RR Container Document), which details the following:   o The design of the containers;  o The maintenance and management of the activated carbon filter retrofitted  to the containers;  o The container management procedure; and  o The container maintenance procedure.  ▪ The waste container preparation requirements for the Site (the September 2017  Container Preparation Document), which details the following:  o The inspections and actions to be undertaken by operators to enable  containers to be prepared to an acceptable standard;  o The steps to be undertaken should a damaged container be identified;  and  o The steps to be undertaken should a leaking container be identified.   Odour Management Plan  As per the Odour Management Plan dated February 2010 (the February 2010 OMP)  for the Site, following the compaction of waste, all filled containers are entirely sealed  and remain so while at the Site.  All containers used are required to be in good condition,  and unused/returned containers adequately clean.  The Odour Audit finds that this  continues to be current practice at the Site.  A view of the condition of the container area  as found on 21 December 2022 is shown in Photo 2.2.       ===== PAGE 125 =====                                                       THE ODOUR UNIT     VEOLIA (AUSTRALIA) PTY LTD  CLYDE WASTE TRANSFER TERMINAL –   ODOUR AUDIT XXXX  5          Photo 2.2 – A view of the container area as found on 21 December 2022   Odour Extraction System Maintenance  The service documentation for the maintenance of the odour extraction system was  supplied and reviewed as part of the Odour Audit (refer to Appendix A).  The service  logs were provided covering the period between June 2022 to December 2022.  Each service log provided to the Odour Audit indicated that the required inspection and  maintenance works were taking place by a suitable service contractor, and the odour  extraction system overall was operating efficiently.  The service logs during this period  noted that all the necessary support works such as checking the fan belts and unit  operations, greasing bearings, component replacement, and other routine preventative  maintenance works were being inspected and undertaken.    Given the above and based on the positive results obtained for the smoke testing, odour  complaints register, and the FAOA survey conducted as part of the Odour Audit visit, it  appears that the current operation of the odour extraction system is satisfactory.     Odour Management Procedures/Plan  The Odour Management Procedures (formerly known as the Odour Minimising  Procedures) continue to be regularly reviewed at toolbox meetings, and contemporary  issues/recommendations are raised with all staff members at these meetings.    Veolia has advised The Odour Audit that the February 2010 OMP is still in the process  of being reviewed and updated. However, TOU was provided a copy of the draft   ===== PAGE 126 =====                                                       THE ODOUR UNIT     VEOLIA (AUSTRALIA) PTY LTD  CLYDE WASTE TRANSFER TERMINAL –   ODOUR AUDIT XXXX  6    Operational Environmental Management Plan for the Site dated 6 November 2020 (the  Draft OEMP).  Upon finalisation of the Draft OEMP and consolidation of all referenced  documents, the Odour Audit will review this document in its entirety.  Nevertheless, the  annual review and commitment to continuous improvement to the operational and  environmental management procedures and practices at the Site is endorsed by the  Odour Audit.   Transfer Terminal Building   The Odour Audit inspected the fixed metal plates retrofitted along the TTB breezeways  in December 2013.  All metal plates were found to be intact and in good condition around  the TTB.  All doors and roller shutters of the TTB were found to be shut at the time of  the Odour Audit, reducing the likelihood of odour impacts detected off-site.  The louvres  on the end walls of the TTB were observed to be permanently shut.   Truck Entrance Plastic Strips  The truck entrance plastic strips of the TTB, used to reduce odour escaping through the  opening, were found to be superficially damaged and in a state to function and  effectively reduce air movement at the top section of the truck entrance (refer to Photo  2.3).          Photo 2.3 – A view of the truck entrance plastic strips as found on 21 December 2022   ===== PAGE 127 =====                                                       THE ODOUR UNIT     VEOLIA (AUSTRALIA) PTY LTD  CLYDE WASTE TRANSFER TERMINAL –   ODOUR AUDIT XXXX  7     Smoke Testing  As per previous audits, smoke testing was carried out within the TTB to assist in  determining the effectiveness of the forced air extraction system, as well as the extent  to which the TTB has been sealed from leaks.  As per previous audits, smoke was  released from within the TTB at three points within the TTB.  Figure 2.1 shows the three  points where the smoke was released within the TTB.  Photo 2.4 shows smoke testing  at the truck entrance of the TTB, which reflects an additional test location to the normal  smoke testing release points shown in Figure 2.1.

Visible smoke extraction at the overhead capture points  was evident during the smoke testing at this point.  Smoke Testing Point #2  The smoke released at this point gradually rose towards the roof and then towards the  extraction system.  Smoke Testing Point #3  The smoke released at this point revealed a similar result to that documented for smoke  testing point #2.  2.2 ODOUR COMPLAINTS HANDLING AND METEOROLOGICAL DATA   Odour Complaints Handling  As advised by Veolia personnel, there continue to have been no complaints recorded in  the Site’s complaints register since March 2012.   Meteorological Data  The meteorological data provided to the Odour Audit, covering the period of between  June 2022 and December 2022, was inspected and found to be in good order.  As found  in previous Odour Audits, the observations were provided in daily 15-minute intervals  and included all parameters necessary to develop a meteorological dataset for odour  dispersion modelling.    As indicated via service records completed by Hydrometric Consulting Services (HCS)  supplied by Veolia to the Odour Audit, the weather station continues to remain located  in an accessible area with the solar panel and components regularly cleaned, and  installation sprayed periodically for insects and trimming of nearby vegetation as  required to ensure no overgrowth immediately around the weather station pole.  Overall,  HCS indicated that the weather stations were operating well, and any identified issues  were rectified. The weather data calibration and service reports by HCS are appended  as Appendix B.    2.3 FIELD AMBIENT ODOUR ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY  At present, no Australian Standard exists for field-based ambient odour assessment  surveys.  Consequently, TOU utilises a method for assessing the ground-level impacts  of odour emissions using a modified version of the German Standard VDI 3940 (1993)  – ‘Determination of Odorants in Ambient Air by Field Inspections’.    Field-based ambient odour surveys are considered a valuable odour impact  assessment tool as previous experience with ambient odour sampling and subsequent  olfactometry testing suggests that accurate and useful ambient odour concentration  data is difficult to obtain.  Therefore, TOU has adopted a more practical approach based   ===== PAGE 130 =====                                                       THE ODOUR UNIT     VEOLIA (AUSTRALIA) PTY LTD  CLYDE WASTE TRANSFER TERMINAL –   ODOUR AUDIT XXXX  10    on the field measurement of odour intensity.  With this method, calibrated and  experienced odour specialists traverse the downwind surrounds of odour sources in a  strategically mapped pattern, assessing the presence, character and intensity of any  odours encountered and recording these observations along with wind speed and  direction.   An ambient odour assessment was performed on 21 December 2022 between 1411 hrs  and 1453 hrs.  The FAOA survey was undertaken at strategic off-site locations during  the Odour Audit due to prevailing meteorological conditions.  The ambient odour  assessment focus was off-site, as required by the Conditions of Consent on “……nearby  commercial and residential areas……” (Section 48 (f)).  The TOU assessor firstly  determined the wind direction using a Kestrel 4500 Pocket Weather Tracker  Anemometer and then assessed upwind and downwind locations of the TTB.  The assessors spent approximately five minutes at each assessment location to gauge  the effects of any odour impact.  If an odour was detected at a location, the assessors  attempted to characterise it.  The general aim was to determine the extent of the impact  of odours off-site and rank their intensity.  The ranking scale for the German Standard  VDI 3940 ‘Determination of Odorants in Ambient Air by Field Inspections’ was used for  the intensity assessments.  The standard’s ranking system is based on the following  seven-point intensity scale, as shown in Table 2.1.    Table 2.1 – VDI 3882 Odour Intensity Categories   Odour Strength  Intensity Rank  (code)  TOU Interpretation  (meaning)  Not detectable  0  No odour detected  Very weak  1  Odour detected but not strong enough to be  characterised  Weak  2  Odour is weak but just able to be  characterised  Distinct  3  Odour is distinct and easily characterised  Strong  4  Strong odour detectable  Very Strong  5  If offensive, the observer may consider  moving from the area  Extremely Strong  6  Odour is sufficiently over-powering that  assessor moves from the area     Field Ambient Odour Assessment – Results  The results of the FAOA survey conducted during the Odour Audit found that whilst  intermittent odours were detected on-site, no odours were detectable off-site that could  be linked back to the Site and its activities. This is a good outcome and reflects the  findings from previous odour audits.  The field log sheets, and visual survey plot are  appended as Appendix C.     ===== PAGE 131 =====                                                       THE ODOUR UNIT     VEOLIA (AUSTRALIA) PTY LTD  CLYDE WASTE TRANSFER TERMINAL –   ODOUR AUDIT XXXX  11    3 RECOMMENDATIONS/FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS  3.1 PREVIOUS AUDIT ACTIONS  The following list provides an outline of the last June 2022 odour audit actions and status  as of the Odour Audit:    ▪ Previous Audit Action 1: Action 1 – Continue with the on-going review and  commitment to continuous improvement of the Draft OEMP and referenced  documents.    ▪ Status: On-going and will be reassessed in the next odour audit.  3.2 TRANSFER TERMINAL BUILDING  All metal plates were found to be intact and in good condition around the TTB.  All doors  and roller shutters of the TTB were found to be shut at the time of the Odour Audit,  reducing the likelihood of odour impacts detected off-site.  The louvres on the end walls  of the TTB were observed to be permanently shut.  The truck entrance plastic strips  were superficially damaged, but functional and effective.  Overall, the TTB was found to  be well managed.  Based on the findings in the Odour Audit, the following action is recommended:  ▪ No further action is required at this stage.  3.3 COMPACTOR AREA  The general housekeeping around the compactor area was observed to be of high  quality, with no evidence to suggest otherwise.  As with previous Odour Audits, the  container compacting/train packing area had a weak to distinct odour that was  intermittently detectable but was found to be confined to this area only.   Based on the findings in this Odour Audit, the following action is recommended:  ▪ No further action is required at this stage.  3.4 ODOUR EXTRACTION SYSTEM  The service logs indicate that all required maintenance works on the odour extraction  system since the previous June 2022 odour audit have been adequately undertaken,  and the odour extraction system is operating in a satisfactory condition.  Based on the findings in the Odour Audit, the following action is recommended:  ▪ No further action is required at this stage.  3.5 WEATHER STATION  The dataset obtained from the weather station was found to be adequate.  Moreover,  the calibration and service reports from HCS indicate that all maintenance to the  weather station and required calibrations were carried out as needed.     ===== PAGE 132 =====                                                       THE ODOUR UNIT     VEOLIA (AUSTRALIA) PTY LTD  CLYDE WASTE TRANSFER TERMINAL –   ODOUR AUDIT XXXX  12    Based on the findings in the Odour Audit, the following action is recommended:  ▪ No further action is required at this stage.  3.6 OFF-SITE ODOUR IMPACTS  The results of the FAOA survey conducted during the Odour Audit found that no odours  were detectable off-site that could be linked back to the Site and its activities.    Based on the findings in the Odour Audit, the following action is recommended:  ▪ No further action is required at this stage.  3.7 ODOUR MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES/PLAN  At the timing of the writing of the Odour Audit, the February 2010 OMP was last updated  over eight years ago.  Given the previous update, it is suggested that as part of good  practice that Veolia reviews and update the February 2010 OMP to ensure it continues  to reflect the odour management procedures implemented and followed at the Site.   TOU was provided a copy of the Draft OEMP.  Upon finalisation of the Draft OEMP and  consolidation of all referenced documents, the Odour Audit will review this document in  its entirety.  Nevertheless, the annual review and commitment to continuous  improvement to the operational and environmental management procedures and  practices at the Site is endorsed by the Odour Audit.  Based on the findings in this Odour Audit, the following action/s is recommended:  ▪ Action 1 – Continue with the on-going review and commitment to  continuous improvement of the Draft OEMP and referenced documents.  3.8 CONCLUDING REMARK  Overall, this Odour Audit found that the operation and maintenance of the odour  management system at the Site was excellent.  There was no evidence to suggest that  significant fugitive odour emission release from the Site is occurring.   The next Odour Audit is due in June 2023.  ===== PAGE 133 =====                 VEOLIA (AUSTRALIA) PTY LTD      Clyde Waste Transfer Terminal      Odour Audit XXXX    Appendices    December 2022     ===== PAGE 134 =====         APPENDIX A:  ODOUR EXTRACTION SYSTEM SERVICE REPORTS  (JUNE 2022 – DECEMBER 2022)         ===== PAGE 135 =====  ===== PAGE 136 =====  ===== PAGE 137 =====  ===== PAGE 138 =====  ===== PAGE 139 =====  ===== PAGE 140 =====  ===== PAGE 141 =====  ===== PAGE 142 =====  ===== PAGE 143 =====  ===== PAGE 144 =====                       Equilibrium Air Conditioning Services Pty Ltd ABN 51 844 035 531    Telephone: (02) 9439 4822  service@eqac.com.au    PO Box 7996  Norwest NSW 2153                                              CUSTOMER JOB NO. 32746 - Steve Hortis Project Name Date Created PO # Site Details Name Address Contact Telephone Mobile Email Customer Details Name Address Contact Telephone Mobile Email Work Requested Marcus Jackson (16/06/2022) - Work Note  ===== PAGE 145 =====                       Equilibrium Air Conditioning Services Pty Ltd ABN 51 844 035 531    Telephone: (02) 9439 4822  service@eqac.com.au    PO Box 7996  Norwest NSW 2153                                              CUSTOMER JOB NO. 32746 - Steve Hortis For my safety and well-being during COVID-19, I cannot provide my signature, however, I confirm that the technician was onsite to carry out the above mentioned works.

The Conditions include a requirement to assess heavy vehicle noise limits specified in Australian Design Rule 28/01 (ADR 28/01). The requirements of Condition 112 are as follows: The Applicant shall implement a Heavy Vehicle Noise Monitoring Management Program for the development to the satisfaction of the Director-General. This program must: (a) monitor heavy vehicle noise on site, in accordance with the methods outlined in the “Truck Noise Monitoring – Proposed Test and Management Plan” prepared by Heggies and dated 26 May 2008; (b) be undertaken quarterly for a year starting in October 2008, and annually thereafter, unless otherwise agreed by the Director-General; (c) measure at least 25% of the heavy vehicles visiting the site; (d) identify heavy vehicles exceeding the relevant noise criteria specified in the Australian Design Rule 28/01, or its successor, and ensure that the owners of these subsequently comply with the relevant noise criteria; (e) report the number of non-compliant heavy vehicles identified and the actions undertaken to address these non-compliances in the Annual Environmental Monitoring Report; and (f) be amended, should the monitoring activities not achieve the aim of the program to the satisfaction of the Director-General. This Annual Truck Noise Measurements report (the Report) presents the results of the sixteenth round of heavy vehicle noise monitoring at the Terminal. Monitoring was completed by Veolia on the 4th of October 2022 between 10:33 AM and 2:49 PM, in accordance with the Proposed Test Management Plan (PTMP) developed by Heggies. This is the thirteenth sampling event and report prepared by Veolia under Condition 112 since resuming the responsibility of monitoring from Heggies. Annual Truck Noise Measurements Clyde Transfer Terminal Final October 2022 6  ===== PAGE 189 ===== Noise Limit Criteria The noise limit criteria for maximum allowable noise levels for Goods Vehicles described in the PTMP (2008) are provided in Table 1 below. Table 1: LAmax Noise Limits (dBA) – ADR 28/01 Vehicle Category Code Vehicle Type Vehicles In Motion Stationary Vehicles Direct Injection & Spark Ignition Diesel Engines Spark Ignition Engines Exhaust Outlet Height Direct Injection Engines Exhaust Outlet Height <1500mm ≤1500mm <1500mm ≤1500mm NA Light Goods Vehicles GVM ≤3.5t on road use 78 to 80 89 85 99 95 NB Medium Goods Vehicles GVM >3.5t ≤12t on road use 81 to 84 95 91 101 97 NC Heavy Goods Vehicles GVM >12t on road use 81 to 87 95 91 103 99 Note: For vehicles in motion test, LAmax noise limits are based on the Gross Vehicle Mass (GVM) and the Nett Engine Power (NEP). The noise limits in the table are expressed as a range where the lower noise level refers to the minimum GVM and NEP in each category and the upper noise level refers to the maximum GVM and NEP in each category. Waste collection trucks entering the Terminal are loaded vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Mass (GVM) over 12 tonnes, based on tare weights of incoming vehicles on the site weighbridge. Hence, for the purpose of conducting a vehicle noise assessment at the Terminal, Vehicle Category Code “NC”, for heavy goods vehicles with a GVM of 12 tonnes or more on the road, a Net Engine Power (NEP) of greater than 150 kilowatts (kW) has been applied. The upper limit (87dBA) of the NC range provided in Table 1 will be used to assess truck noise measurements. This is consistent with the assessment criteria applied by Heggies in previous monitoring rounds. Annual Truck Noise Measurements Clyde Transfer Terminal Final October 2022 7  ===== PAGE 190 ===== Measurement Methodology The monitoring location from which the truck noise was measured was consistent with previous monitoring rounds conducted by Veolia and Heggies. Measurements were taken at a distance of 7.5 metres from the centre of the vehicle travel path and a height of 1.2 metres above the vehicle entrance ramp from the weighbridge to the Terminal building, which was the test site surface. Trucks accelerating at this location, which is shown in Appendix A, were measured where the vehicle was accelerating in line with the microphone of the sound level meter. For further information regarding measurement location and methodology refer to the PTMP prepared by Heggies (Heggies, 2008). Measurements were taken with a TSI Quest SoundPro Series SE/DL Sound Level Meter, using an A-weighted (LA) filter network and fast response time constant as required under ADR 28/01. The (LA) filter ensured that the sound level meter was less sensitive to very high and very low frequencies which would be outside the range of noise emitted by the heavy vehicles entering and exiting the Terminal, while the fast response time constant enabled a more accurate reading of noise from each vehicle movement. Calibration of the Sound Level Meter was completed by AirMet Scientific prior to monitoring. Refer to Appendix B for calibration certificate. For each truck movement a LA maximum noise level measurement was recorded. Additional information on each truck movement was noted (where possible) to assist in identification of trucks exceeding noise criteria, including: ●        Company; ●        Vehicle Make and Type; ●        Registration; and ●        Exhaust Location. The collected data was cross referenced with the Terminal’s weighbridge records for vehicles entering the facility on 4 October 2022, a copy of which is provided in Appendix C, to identify trucks measured during this sampling period and to calculate the percentage of trucks sampled. Annual Truck Noise Measurements Clyde Transfer Terminal Final October 2022 8  ===== PAGE 191 ===== Noise Measurement Results A total of 69 truck movements were recorded entering the Terminal and a measurement for each vehicle movement past the monitoring location was taken as the trucks accelerated on the entrance ramp. Two (2) of these measurements were under impeded traffic conditions causing distorted noise emissions, caused by queuing of waste trucks waiting to enter the Terminal building during busy periods or idling of engines past the testing zone. Impeded traffic conditions affected the representative quality of the noise measurements. The measured sound levels of each pass-by event were recorded on field sheets, which have been tabulated in Appendix D. A total measurement of 27% of all truck movements (255) was achieved during this monitoring round, which satisfies the minimum requirements of Condition 112 (25% of daily truck movements). Figure 1 presents the distribution of recorded sound level frequencies which were measured in A-weighted decibels (dBA). Measurements of ‘normal’ truck acceleration ranged from 67.2dBA to 81.8dBA with the highest frequency occurring between 76 - 78dBA. Impaired acceleration readings due to the impeded traffic conditions ranged from 69dBA to 79dBA, with the highest frequency occurring between 73-74dBA. Impaired acceleration readings were plotted separately from the normal accelerating vehicles on Figure 1. Figure 1: Noise level distribution from Truck Noise Monitoring – 4th of October 2022 Annual Truck Noise Measurements Clyde Transfer Terminal Final October 2022 9  ===== PAGE 192 ===== Discussion Comparison of the heavy vehicle noise measurement results against the limits specified in ADR 28/01 (refer to Table 1) indicates that all trucks entering the Terminal in this monitoring round were within the acceptable noise criteria for the NC category vehicles (<87dBA). Four smaller waste vehicles (ranging from approximately 6 – 11 tonnes when loaded) were observed entering the facility during this monitoring event. For the purpose of this assessment it is considered that these vehicles would fall within the NB category with a noise limit of 84dBA. All noise emitted from vehicles assigned to this category was measured below this threshold as indicated in Table 3. Table 2: NB class vehicle noise measurements Time Company Make Registration LA Max (dBA) Impeded Movement 10:39 Ku-ring-gai Council Mitsubishi CN92MI 71 N 10:46 Ku-ring-gai Council Unknown CN75MI 72.8 N 12:03 Leichhardt Municipal Council Hino CO41MK 72.4 N 13:26 Hunter's Hill Council Unknown XN02SU 67.2 N Noise from the Terminal’s operations such as plant noise (forklift, compactor, front end loader and road sweeper) and surrounding areas (Parramatta Road, train tracks) were not significant enough to influence waste truck noise measurements at this location. The noise wall located adjacent to the exit ramp, on the North-western boundary of the Terminal, also assisted in focusing noise measurements on truck movements into the facility by limiting interference noise sources. Annual Truck Noise Measurements Clyde Transfer Terminal Final October 2022 10  ===== PAGE 193 ===== No noise complaints pertaining to the Terminal’s operations were received between the annual truck noise monitoring rounds. This indicates that noise impacts from waste truck movements at the Terminal boundary are within the Terminal and surrounding area background noise levels. Conclusions Truck noise monitoring was conducted on the 4th of October 2022 between 10:33 AM and 2:49 PM. The results indicated: ● Noise from 69 truck movements was measured; ● A total of  27% of truck movements were measured, which satisfies the minimum 25% requirement of Condition 112; ● All measured trucks were identified against weighbridge records to verify the accuracy of field data for reporting. ●  All truck noise measurements were within the noise criteria of ADR 28/01 and hence did not exceed the trigger limits. ●  Noise from the Terminal’s operations was not significant enough to influence the truck noise assessment. ●  No noise complaints pertaining to the Terminal’s operations were received since the previous truck noise monitoring round. ● Truck noise impacts at the Terminal boundary are considered to be within background levels.
