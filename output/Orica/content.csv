The accident involved a  third-party heavy haulage truck that struck  an Orica mobile manufacturing unit from  behind, leading to the death of one of  our employees. We conducted a thorough  investigation and implemented learnings  across our operations. Safety and the prevention of harm remain  our number one priority. The prevention of  fatalities drives our strong safety culture,  and the embedment of our Major Hazard  Management program at all levels of our  global operations. Over the past five years our serious injury  case-rate has improved, with the rate of  serious injuries decreasing from 0.220 in  FY2019 to 0.117 in FY2024. Despite the  lower rate, we remain committed to   ongoing fatality prevention and the  prevention of harm. Our focus on safety  begins with people: our employees, those  of our customers and the people living and  working in the communities we are part of.  LETTER FROM OUR CHAIRMAN   AND MANAGING DIRECTOR Malcolm Broomhead AO Chairman This year, we celebrate Orica’s 150-year history. From  humble beginnings in the Victorian goldfields of 1874,   we have grown to become a global leader in mining   and infrastructure solutions.  Our business is underpinned by our history of safety,  innovation and sustainability. Today we are a global and  diverse team of more than 14,000 people, servicing  customers in over 100 countries. Our ability to adapt as the world transitions is reflected  in our achievements this year. We have delivered another  year of strong financial performance with $806 million in  earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), up by 15 per cent  on the previous year. Our continuing growth across all  segments reflects the successful execution of our strategic  initiatives, commercial discipline and the ongoing global  demand for our premium products and technologies. Sanjeev Gandhi Managing Director and   Chief Executive Officer We also take great care in considering our  shared natural environments and cultural  heritages as we go about our work. This  year, across all our operations, no significant  environmental incidents occurred. People and culture Our people are the foundation of our  company and our most-valued asset. The  dedication and capabilities of our people  to face challenges and remain true to our  promises ensure Orica’s legacy as a global  leader continues and we deliver long-term  value for our customers, communities   and shareholders. Orica has a unique workplace culture,  fostering innovation and inclusion, and  encouraging the potential of people.   This year we invited our employees to  share their insights about working at Orica  through our employee engagement survey,  ‘Our say’. We received our highest ever  response rate of 69 per cent and the results  revealed an employee engagement score  well-above comparable industry benchmarks  at 89 per cent. Around the world, our  people feel highly engaged and proud   to work at Orica. As an organisation of people from more  than 90 cultural backgrounds, we are  committed to diversity. We continue to  develop our women in leadership programs   and remain focused on increasing the  number of female senior leaders throughout  our organisation. Last year we launched our  diversity, equity and inclusion strategy, and  while we have achieved some of our targets  in FY2024, we recognise that for Orica to  continue being a great place to work, and  for us to keep attracting and retaining the  best people, there is more we can and will  do to continuously improve our people  strategy. Strategy and performance We are well-positioned to contribute to, and  continue prospering in, a dynamic economy.  In FY2024, we continued to successfully  execute our strategy and delivered another  year of high quality earnings. Through   our strategic acquisitions, we have  positioned Orica for growth beyond   blasting, becoming the global leader   in each of our business segments. We have diversified our commodities and  customer portfolios through the acquisitions  of Terra Insights and Cyanco, which expand  our global footprint, further diversify our  business, and create global opportunities  among new customers and industries in  diverse locations. Terra Insights creates  opportunities in the civil infrastructure  environment and energy industries, and  Cyanco increases our exposure to the gold  industry, particularly in the highly attractive  region of North America. We leverage our key competitive advantages,  delivering superior customer outcomes and  maintaining security of supply to successfully  achieve our objectives. We draw on Orica’s 150 years of innovation  as we continue to invest in technology to  solve our customers’ challenges and position  Orica at the forefront of industry. Unique  product offerings and exceptional customer  service continue to revolutionise the ways  we, and our customers, are optimising our  operations as the world continues   to transition. As a reliable and trusted partner for our  customers around the world, we continue   to leverage Orica’s strategic capabilities,   and global manufacturing and supply   chain networks to enhance our resilience  and provide a greater degree of certainty  over our customers’ security of supply.   Amid global supply chain disruptions,   we continued to deliver for our customers  throughout FY2024. Our customers provided feedback across six  categories in our customer survey this year,  (including safety, reliable supply, product and  service quality, ease of doing business and  value delivery) saying the most important  Annual Report 2024 4  ===== PAGE 7 ===== and beneficial aspects of their relationship  with Orica are our uncompromising  commitment to safety; continuing  technological innovations; reliability of  supply; high quality products; and our  willingness to listen, understand   and act to solve their challenges.  To support reliable supply for our customers  and safe and efficient manufacturing  operations into the future, this year we  successfully completed a significant planned  turnaround schedule.  Business performance We are pleased to deliver another year of  strong financial performance. The increased  uptake of our premium products, blasting  technology, digital solutions and contribution  from our recent acquisitions has delivered  quality earnings across all segments of   the business. This year, EBIT of $806 million equates to an  increase of 15 per cent on the previous year.  Net profit after tax (NPAT) was $525 million,  including $115 million in profit from  significant items. We achieved a return on  net operating assets (RONA) of 12.8 per  cent, up from 12.6 per cent last year, driven  by our improved earnings performance, the  execution of our strategy and strong market  demand. Orica’s business-segment reporting model  changed this year to provide transparency  across our three key segments:  •	 Blasting Solutions includes Orica’s core  blasting and quarry and construction  operations in Australia Pacific and Asia,  North America, Latin America and   Europe, Middle East and Africa. The  segment contributed $755 million EBIT,   up 13 per cent on the previous year. •	 Specialty Mining Chemicals includes  Orica’s existing sodium cyanide and  emulsifiers businesses and the newly  acquired Cyanco business, positioning  Orica as the world’s leading and largest  producer of sodium cyanide. The segment  achieved 36 per cent earnings growth  on the previous period and contributed  $69 million EBIT. •	 Digital Solutions comprises Orebody  Intelligence, Blast Design and Execution  solutions, and Geosolutions – which  includes Terra Insights and its six industry- leading brands, establishing Orica as  the global leader in geotechnical and  structural monitoring in mining and civil  infrastructure. The segment achieved   29 per cent earnings growth on the prior  period, and contributed $70 million EBIT. Our prudent balance sheet is well positioned  to provide resilience in a volatile external  environment. We have continued our  disciplined approach towards capital  expenditure as we supported the core  business, pursued opportunities for   growth and expansion, and completed  the delivery of the first phase of our  decarbonisation strategy.  Earnings per share before significant items  of 86.4 cents is up 5.2 cents on the previous  year. The final ordinary dividend of 28.0  cents per ordinary share, unfranked, delivers  a total dividend payout ratio of 56 per cent  of full-year earnings. We continue to deliver on our strategy in  rapidly shifting operating environments  where, amid increasing regulatory   measures, changing societal expectations  and fluctuating market conditions, we   have found new opportunities to adapt,  innovate, and expand our global footprint.  Sustainability performance Climate change and decarbonisation  are among the biggest challenges and  opportunities impacting our industry. As a  global leader, we are committed to achieving  our ambition of net zero emissions by 2050. This year, we are pleased to see our  significant efforts delivering tangible results.  Ahead of schedule, we completed the first  phase of our decarbonisation strategy in  FY2024. The installation of two emissions  abatement reactors at our Yarwun site is  forecast to reduce its total Scope 1 and  Scope 2 emissions by 50 per cent. The  installation has accelerated the delivery of  our climate change commitments, resulting  in our net operational Scope 1 and Scope 2  emissions being 43 per cent below our 2019  restated baseline. We are in a strong position to continue  driving further emissions reductions  across our value chain while creating  more sustainable operational outcomes  and offering our customers solutions that  support their sustainability commitments. As we look ahead, our expansive climate  goals will be achievable with support and  partnerships with governments, suppliers  and partners as we work towards a lower- carbon future together. Access to reasonably  priced renewable electricity, recycled water  and natural gas is essential for the transition. Community and  relationships  It is important to us that we continue to  build positive and transparent relationships  with people in the communities we work in.  Through our key areas of focus – education,  environment, health, wellbeing and social  welfare – we aim to contribute lasting  positive outcomes for the people and  environments within our host communities.  This year, our community investment of  $4 million places us on track to exceed our  corporate community investment goal   of $15 million by FY2025.  Through our work in host communities, our  people have benefitted significantly from the  deeper cultural understandings and stronger  ties formed with First Nations people,  especially those in Australia and Canada. Outlook While we continue to make great progress   in executing our strategy and delivering   high quality earnings growth, we remain  deeply committed to continually improving  our performance across each area of   our business. We expect the demand for our blasting  technology, specialty mining chemicals and  digital solutions to continue to increase as  we partner with our customers to cater to  their growing appetite for new technology  and digital solutions. Our commercial prudence continues to  position us well against uncertainties in   the external environment and supports   our future business growth in blasting   and beyond, our climate change initiatives   and enhanced shareholder returns. In our historic 150th year, we have  transformed Orica from being the global  leader in blasting solutions, with our  recent acquisitions, to also becoming the  global leader in geotechnical and structural  monitoring for mining and civil infrastructure  and the global leader in specialty mining  chemicals, supporting the gold mining  industry and efficient mineral extraction. On behalf of our Board and the Executive  Committee, we thank the entire Orica  team for their ongoing commitment and  dedication to delivering on our strategy   and purpose. We also thank our shareholders, customers  and industry partners. We look forward to  continuing our collaborative partnerships  with you and remain in a strong position   to continue our momentum and deliver   on our strategy for growth.

Blasting and beyond We are delivering on our strategy to optimise  our operations, develop smarter solutions  and partner for progress as we drive  sustainable growth and support the   energy transition.  As a customer-centric organisation,   our strategic priorities are focused on   our three key business segments: Blasting  Solutions, Specialty Mining Chemicals and   Digital Solutions.  We continue to execute our sustainability  strategy by developing and deploying  technologies that improve safety and  sustainability outcomes for our workforce,  customers and communities. Sustainability  has been embedded into our policies,  business strategy and practices as we  capture new opportunities, deliver on our  commitments and improve performance. As an emissions-intensive business,  accelerating decarbonisation is a key  component of our sustainability agenda.  We are reducing operational greenhouse  gas (GHG) emissions and will continue to  collaborate with our customers, suppliers  and innovative partners as we pursue  decarbonisation across our value chain   and solve shared challenges. Leveraging our  competitive advantage To successfully achieve our objectives,   we leverage our core strengths, delivering  superior customer outcomes and  maintaining security of supply. Our unique value proposition – derived  from connectivity between our core physical  Blasting Solutions operations and our  Specialty Mining Chemicals, with integrated  end-to-end Digital Solutions and insights  – enables us to support our customers in  optimising safety, productivity, recovery   and sustainability outcomes throughout   their value chains. As a global leader in mining and  infrastructure solutions we draw on our   150 years of innovation that position us   at the forefront of solving challenges   and finding new solutions to issues   as they emerge. We navigate complex operating  environments. Our global manufacturing  and supply networks, ability to leverage  purchasing scale and logistics capabilities,  and our security of supply enable us   as a reliable and trusted partner for   our customers. Our people strategy is fundamental to the  delivery of our commercial objectives and   is designed to attract, retain and develop   the exceptional people who are the  foundation of the Orica business, and   our most valued asset.  Our strategy sets the direction for our business, enabling us to deliver our vision in a focused  and effective way.

Both further diversify our  geographic mix and enable global growth. We continue to collaborate with our  customers and, by focusing on the outcomes  they need to solve unique challenges and  offering smarter solutions, we are seeing  increased penetration of our high-value  technology-driven products and services. While pricing for certain commodities  has created volatility for miners, most  commodities pricing has continued to  support strong demand, particularly for   gold and copper. This has provided additional  prospects as we advance our strategic  priorities, focusing on our three key business  segments: Blasting Solutions, Specialty  Mining Chemicals and Digital Solutions.  We are well-positioned to contribute to,   and prosper, in a dynamic economy. Portfolio resilience Despite initial uncertainty, the global energy  transition continues to gather momentum.  Our increasing and diverse exposure to  the full range of mined commodities – including gold which is counter-cyclical, and  commodities critical to the energy transition,  such as copper, nickel and other future- facing commodities – continues to benefit  Orica. At the end of FY2024 50 per cent  of our combined revenue contribution is  derived from gold, copper and future facing  commodities, compared to 49 per cent in  FY2023. Our global manufacturing footprint and  supply chain network enhance our resilience  and ability to provide customers with   a higher degree of certainty over security   of supply. However, fundamental challenges  such as inflation, geopolitical instability and  reasonable gas pricing and availability on the  east coast of Australia particularly, remain. Operational excellence   – plant turnarounds FY2024 represented one of our most  significant years in terms of planned  turnarounds at our Kooragang Island,   Yarwun and Carseland1 manufacturing  plants. The turnarounds were all completed  safely and successfully. This critical  maintenance activity will ensure safe and  reliable manufacturing operations into  the future and security of supply for our  customers. Decarbonisation We continued to advance our  decarbonisation goals, making notable  progress on the commitments set for future  years, including our FY2026 and FY2030  Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions reduction  targets. We completed the installation of  tertiary abatement catalyst technology at  two of our three nitric acid plants at Yarwun.  These projects represent some of Australia’s  largest industrial decarbonisation projects.  At Kooragang Island we have reduced site  emissions by approximately 60 per cent.  At our Yarwun site our completed tertiary  abatement installations will reduce site  emissions by approximately 50 per cent.  Further details are included in the Climate  and the Natural Environment page. PROGRESS AGAINST OUR STRATEGY This year, we focused on our customers, key partnerships, strategic acquisitions, innovation,  sustainability and excellence as we embraced challenges and opportunities to strengthen  Orica’s position as a global leader in mining and infrastructure solutions.  Botany, Australia, 1945 1. Completion of Carseland turnaround occurred in October 2024. Annual Report 2024 8  ===== PAGE 11 ===== Blasting Solutions Strategic priorities Continue to pursue profitable growth  through expansion across key geographies,  continued commercial discipline and further  penetration of new blasting technologies. FY2024 progress The performance of our core blasting  business continued to strengthen as strong  customer demand for our high-margin  premium products, services and new   blasting technologies improved our quality  of earnings. Blasting Solutions contributed $755 million  EBIT in FY2024. Ongoing commercial  discipline has been applied through  successful completion of contract renewals,  further portfolio optimisation and increased  uptake of Orica’s full differentiated   solution offering.  Significant uptake of our blasting technology  has been achieved globally, specifically  WebGen™ and 4D™. This year, we have  continued to see strong appetite for  sustainability solutions from customers,   and completed the roll out of Exel™ Neo;  the world’s first, lead-free detonator range.  In manufacturing, we safely and successfully  delivered a heavy turnaround schedule.  Additionally, we implemented new  electronic blasting systems (EBS) assembly  production lines and automation capabilities,  strengthening our supply chain capacity  and flexibility, and achieving efficiency  improvements. We are a global leader in blasting services, providing trusted and proven expertise in surface  and underground mining  and civil infrastructure. Specialty Mining  Chemicals Strategic priorities Specialty Mining Chemicals will leverage   its position as the world’s leading producer  of sodium cyanide to deliver value to its  global customers and seek opportunities   to enhance its mineral processing offerings. FY2024 progress The acquisition of Cyanco builds on Orica’s  30-plus years of specialty mining chemicals  experience while enabling access to the  strong North American gold market. Specialty Mining Chemicals, as a separate  reporting segment, contributed $69 million  EBIT, and increased its contribution to Group  revenue from five per cent to seven per cent   in FY2024.  The performance of this segment was  driven by the successful ongoing integration  of Cyanco. Major achievements include  appointing a fully integrated leadership  team, implementing Orica’s information  technology and cyber security systems  and realising new contracts and network  optimisation benefits.  Segment earnings were impacted by a partial  gas curtailment due to supplier pipeline  issues, and planned maintenance at the  Winnemucca plant being brought forward,  resulting in lower than planned production.  We are a global leader in  specialty mining chemicals,  supporting the gold mining  industry and efficient  mineral extraction. Digital Solutions Strategic priorities Growth continues to be driven by increasing  customer adoption and demand for our  digital solutions, now used at more than   400 sites globally. FY2024 progress As a separate reporting segment for the  second year, Digital Solutions is delivering  robust earnings growth of 29 per cent   year-on-year. In FY2024, we achieved strong  performance across all three product  categories. In Orebody Intelligence (OBI),  we continued to grow product sales  globally. We also advanced the global  footprint and technology portfolio of Axis  Mining Technology, a supplier of digital  instrumentation, data and drilling solutions,  acquired in 2022. In Blast Design and Execution (BDE), we  achieved a strong uptake in sales across the  entire portfolio, with an increase in customer  adoption and recurring (SaaS) revenue.  In Geosolutions, we continued to integrate  Terra Insights into the business, enabling  expanded geotechnical and structural  monitoring capabilities, and providing cross- sell opportunities in more regions across  mining, civil infrastructure, environment  and energy – while delivering an established  revenue stream.

This year, continuing global geopolitical  and economic volatility, and an emphasis of decarbonisation and delivering positive ESG  outcomes, added to the complexity of our operating environment. These factors present risks  and opportunities for our business, and determine how we create value for our customers and  deliver on our purpose. Increasing commodities  demand ESG-related   expectations Climate change   and adaptation As the energy transition continues to gain  momentum, the demand for future-facing  commodities such as copper, lithium and  nickel is accelerating. The production of  these commodities is fundamental to the  manufacture of the renewable technologies  – batteries, solar panels and wind turbines–  needed to achieve the Paris Agreement  goals1. We continue to increase our exposure  to future-facing commodities which provide  growth opportunities for our core Blasting  Solutions, Specialty Mining Chemicals and  Digital Solutions segments, particularly in  exploration and resource-definition activities,  and the processing phases of the value chain. ESG-focused outcomes continue to underpin  our stakeholders’ expectations. The  requirement for mandatory disclosures,  managing greenwashing risk and  maintaining tangible ESG-related actions  remain growing areas of importance. The  energy transition and decarbonisation are  key areas of focus for our industry. Driven  by persistent expectations, organisations  are working towards achieving significant  decarbonisation in their operations and  throughout their supply chains. Other  ESG-related expectations for our industry  relate to maintaining our social license to  operate, supporting First Nations people,  and understanding community impacts and  our effects and dependencies on the natural  environment. The global energy transition continues  amid increasing expectations of emissions  reduction compliance as physical climate  impacts, such as fire and flooding, become  more frequent. We are focused on ensuring  our strategy remains robust and resilient  as the global economy transitions to net  zero. To ensure our operations remain safe  and secure, we are in the process of better  understanding potential physical climate  risks at each of our major sites, following   the conclusion of our global assessment.   This will help inform the development  of future mitigation and/or adaptation  measures for our sites and the communities  in which we operate.

As ore  bodies become increasingly challenging to  access, demand for innovative technological  solutions continues to increase. We employ  technology and innovation for continuing  improvement across our core Blasting  Solutions, Specialty Mining Chemicals  and Digital Solutions businesses to  optimise safety, productivity, recovery and  sustainability outcomes for our customers  across the value chain. Financial Performance Climate and the Natural  Environment Technology and  Innovation Community and  Relationships People and   Capabilities Our Approach   to Safety Our global network increases our resilience  to geopolitical tensions. Maintaining security  of supply to our customers is critical to our  Customer Promise and our role as a trusted  partner. Our strategically located global  manufacturing network and third-party  purchasing arrangements are key levers  to increasing our agility in the context of  global uncertainty. We maintained security  of supply for our customers through supply  chain disruptions by maximising production  at our own ammonium nitrate (AN) plants  in Australia, Canada and Indonesia, and  continuing to retain access to and purchase  third-party explosive grade AN in other  regions. With ongoing volatility expected  in the global nitrates market in the near  term, our manufacturing and global supply  networks will continue to be a source of  competitive advantage. Inflation is a key driver of volatility and  uncertainty for the global economy. Orica  has experienced rising costs in salaries and  raw material inputs. We mitigate inflation  risk through our ongoing cost efficiency  initiatives and commercial discipline.

Our risk management framework is aligned  with the principles of the International  Organization for Standardization’s Risk  Management – Guidelines, ISO 31000:2018.  It enables us to consistently identify, assess  and prioritise emerging risks and trends,   and manage, monitor and report risks   across the business as we pursue our  strategic objectives. Our risk appetite Our risk appetite statements strengthen  the Board’s oversight, enable effective  monitoring and instil a strong risk-aware  culture throughout the company. We  continue to review and develop the scope,  applicability and limits of our risk appetite  statements in response to our operating  environment, stakeholder expectations   and strategic priorities.  Risk oversight and  governance The ‘three lines of defence’ model is the  foundation of our risk and governance  approach. It provides assurance that risks   are effectively managed in accordance with  our policies, standards and procedures. RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES Our approach to managing risk and opportunity is shaped by our strategic objectives,   our purpose and values, and our risk appetite. Three lines of defence The Board The Board sets Orica’s risk appetite and has oversight of our risk management and internal control systems. It oversees our material risks  and regularly reviews and challenges, directly or via its committees, the effectiveness of our risk management processes. The Executive Committee The Executive Committee owns our material risks and is responsible for interrogating the effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies  and monitoring our performance against approved risk appetite settings. Line 1 Management is responsible for  identifying, owning, monitoring   and managing risks and controls.   It leads the integration of a strong   risk management culture throughout  the organisation. Line 2 The Group risk function establishes  risk standards, systems and processes  for identifying and managing the risks  material to the achievement of our  strategy. It also coaches and challenges  the first line of defence and has  direct reporting responsibilities, and  communicates with the Board   and Executive Committee. Line 3 The internal audit function provides  independent and objective oversight.  It evaluates the effectiveness of  internal controls, risk management  and governance processes, and has  direct reporting responsibilities, and  communicates with the Board and  Executive Committee. Annual Report 2024 14  ===== PAGE 17 ===== Material risks and opportunities Our material risks and opportunities summarised below have the potential to materially affect our financial or non-financial performance, long- term value creation and/or licence to operate. We proactively manage and mitigate our material risks, within our approved risk appetite settings  and limits, by applying a balanced approach which considers risk and reward. Risk Risk overview Our response Macro-economic factors An uncertain economic outlook and  material fluctuations in demand for  commodities could impact consumer  demand and the margins of products   and services sold by Orica. The volatility in macroeconomic factors such  as inflation, talent shortages, global supply  chain disruptions and fluctuating monetary  policies continued to drive uncertain  macroeconomic outcomes. The global economic recovery persists as  inflation eases, although at a slower pace  given the volatile conditions. 	› Anticipate scenarios to absorb  costs, event-driven pressures,  regulatory changes and  government funding opportunities, 	› Position and diversify portfolio  relative to higher growth  commodities. Political and regulatory environment Uncertain geopolitical dynamics and  regulatory changes could impact our  operations, create additional compliance  obligations, and/or increase compliance costs. Geopolitical challenges increased  throughout the year with policy and security  threats to globalisation, free markets and  business continuity. Complex and evolving policies, geopolitical  tensions and regulatory uncertainties  continue to perpetuate a challenging  environment. 	› Monitor political situations and  assess political/regulatory risk  exposure before operating in   new countries, 	› Engage with key stakeholders to  remain informed and enable rapid  responses to changing regulations,  sanctions and trade rulings   as required. Climate change Transitioning to a lower-carbon economy  and the effects of physical climate change  could impact demand for our products,  cause supply chain disruptions and impede  our ability to maintain production levels  and/or service customer demand. Climate-related risks and opportunities  remain prevalent, affecting government  policy, markets, the transition to a lower- carbon economy and rising stakeholder  expectations. Physical climate-related risks continue   to materialise with more frequent extreme  weather events, including heatwaves   in Europe and Asia, and wildfires in   the Americas. Global emissions remain above Paris  Agreement temperature goals, with the  current trajectory of 2.7°C warming above  pre-industrial levels, based on stated  national policies1. 	› Embed climate risk into strategic  and financial planning in line with  ambition to achieve net zero, 	› Decarbonise assets in line   with climate commitments,   to significantly reduce emissions  and manage tightening climate  policy regulation, 	› Diversify commodities exposure and  customer mix to ensure business  resilience,  	› Continue to support our customers  by exploring the development of  product offerings, to help reduce  value chain emissions, 	› Maintain strong corporate  governance, Board and  management oversight of climate  risks and opportunities, 	› Continue assessing physical climate  risks, particularly water stress, 	› Ensure readiness for mandatory  climate reporting requirements   in key jurisdictions, 	› Advocate responsibly for globally  effective policies in accordance   with our Climate Change Policy. 1.	 2.7°C is the median of the combined low and high ends of current policy projections, from expected warming projections at the year 2100 (Source: Climate Action  Tracker, December 2023). Orica Limited Annual Report 2024 15 Overview Our Business Our Performance Financial Performance Remuneration Report Directors’ Report Financial Report Shareholder Information  ===== PAGE 18 ===== RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES Risk Risk overview Our response Ethical practices and governance Non-compliance with laws and regulations  including those relating to competition,  anti-bribery and corruption could   expose us to penalties including fines,  criminal sanctions, civil lawsuits and/or  reputational damage.  An increasing focus on strengthening  anti-bribery and corruption laws, heavier  penalties and the adoption of protectionist  measures by some countries increase the  complexity of meeting trade compliance  requirements. The imposition of sanction regimes on  countries across our global operations   has increased the compliance risks of   doing business. 	› Maintain extensive controls over  existing operations, and when  entering new countries, and   screen customers and vendors   for potential non-compliance,  	› Embed Code of Business Conduct  to establish shared understanding  of expectations, 	› Conduct ongoing whistleblower  awareness training and provide  communication to our people  about when and how to   raise concerns,  	› Ensure the compliance of business  partners and joint venture   partners operating in higher-risk  jurisdictions through rigorous   due diligence processes, 	› Conduct modern slavery training  with internal stakeholders and   due diligence for suppliers. Customer and technology disruption Rising adoption of new technology and  fast-paced competitor development could  impact our ability to commercialise or  generate an adequate return on previous  investments in technology and services. Competitor and customer investment  – focusing on automation, digitisation,  data, hydrogen and renewable energy  technology.  Security of supply remains a key challenge  in the market, presenting risks and  opportunities for Orica.

Societal, investor and customer  expectations  Failure to respond to rapidly shifting  expectations relating to ESG parameters  could result in an increased regulatory  burden, disruptions to our supply chain  and operations, and/or damage to our  stakeholder relationships and reputation. Expectations of corporate behaviours have  increased for all companies throughout   the year.  It is important to work closely with our  partners and customers to respond to,   and solve shared challenges. 	› Continue to build on responsible  and ethical practices to enhance  safety and security and decarbonise  products and operations, 	› Respond to issues of emerging  concern and align our strategies  with those of host communities, 	› Apply due diligence to manage  human rights impacts across  operations, 	› Ensure readiness for mandatory  non-financial reporting and due  diligence requirements in   key jurisdictions, 	› Partner with local stakeholders   to build trusted relationships, 	› Engage with First Nations  communities, activate Reflect  Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP)  across key areas of the Australian  business. Annual Report 2024 16  ===== PAGE 19 ===== Risk Risk overview Our response Cyber security Compromise in the confidentiality,  availability and/or integrity of critical  technology services and data could impact  our reputation and/or ability to operate. The evolving complexity and sophistication  of cyber threats has continued. Attackers  leverage advanced AI technologies to  develop novel and sophisticated methods,  outpacing current detection and defence  mechanisms, and posing unprecedented  threats of cyber espionage and sabotage.  The increased rate and sophistication of  attacks drives the need for constant   control-environment improvement. 	› Enhance Orica’s defences using  stringent cyber security protocols that  comprise intelligence monitoring,  threat detection and response  technologies, 	› Monitor and assess key suppliers   to ensure security expectations   are met, 	› Train employees to protect the  integrity of data and networks,  and customer data, and build on  preparedness through simulation  exercises. Safety, health, environment   and security Improper management and response   to inherent risks (including biodiversity,  health and safety) could directly impact   our employees, customers and the  communities in which we operate.   Risk events could disrupt operations,   attract financial penalties and/or impact   our reputation.  Safety, health, environment and security  continue to be priority areas for Orica. 	› Embed compliance protocols, plant  and equipment design standards,  and audit, inspection and asset  maintenance programs as part of   the culture of safe work practices   to achieve our number one priority:   the prevention of harm, 	› Focus on fitness to work as not  just physical but also psychosocial,  understand the psychosocial risks  present in our workplaces, and  deliver mental health awareness   for our senior leaders, 	› Define first response and emergency  response plans for all operations  through the Major Hazard  Management program, 	› Ensure risk is proactively managed  and environmental impacts are  prevented or minimised through  established expectations and practice  protocols, 	› Implement track-and-trace technology  to ensure product security. Supply chain disruption Interruption to the integrity and/or  continuity of our supply chain could   impact our operations and ability to  maintain security of supply for our  customers. The susceptibility of global supply chains  continues. Disruptions and operational  complexities due to increasing demand,  extreme weather events and geopolitical  tensions result in capacity constraints on  major shipping lanes and pricing pressures. 	› Assess and maintain appropriate  stock levels and reduce reliance  on suppliers, and anticipate and  build supply-chain capacity using  forecasting methodology, 	› Explore opportunities to optimise and  diversify resources and relationships  to improve efficiencies, 	› Focus on the security of supply   to meet customer demand and   drive growth. Product quality Poor-quality products or services could  impact performance against required  outcomes, causing harm to people and the  environment, impacting our reputation and/ or resulting in regulatory action or penalties.  We remain committed to responsible  product stewardship and to managing the  impacts of our products and materials on  the environment, human health and safety. 	› Monitor sites against performance  metrics and introduce improvement  programs where required, 	› Focus on ensuring products meet  customer needs via our quality  improvement framework, 	› Ensure supplier capability, contractual  quality and performance through  global and regional due diligence, 	› Institute systems and methodologies  across key business areas: people  and culture, supplier management,  process control and change  management. Orica Limited Annual Report 2024 17 Overview Our Business Our Performance Financial Performance Remuneration Report Directors’ Report Financial Report Shareholder Information  ===== PAGE 20 ===== OUR PERFORMANCE OUR APPROACH TO SAFETY At Orica, safety is a core value and our  first priority, always. Our approach to  safety is evident at all levels of the  company, in all regions, and in each of  our people. We actively encourage a  proactive safety culture, in physical and  psychosocial terms, that is built on the  understanding that safety is everyone’s  responsibility. As a world-leading mining and infrastructure  solutions company, our people work in many  high-energy settings that involve multifaceted  risks. Safety and the prevention of harm to  people, the natural environment and cultural  heritage are our top priorities, always.  Safety performance Sadly, this year we reported a fatality   due to a collision on a public road in India.  The accident involved a third-party heavy  haulage truck that struck an Orica mobile  manufacturing unit from behind, leading   to the death of one of our employees.   We conducted a thorough investigation and  implemented learnings across our operations.  This includes installing in-vehicle monitoring  systems in our mobile manufacturing unit  fleet which leverages artificial intelligence  (AI) to support safe driving behaviours,   while strengthening our vehicle controls   and standards and investing in our  employees’ awareness. 0.117 serious injury case-rate  including fatalities Our serious injury case-rate (SICR) has  improved over the last five years with a  reduction from 0.220 in FY2019 to 0.117 in  FY2024. Despite improvements in our SICR,  our key focus remains fatality prevention  which drives the embedment of our Major  Hazard Management (MHM) program   at all levels of our operations.  In FY2024 we continued our ambition to  achieve industry leading performance across  the areas of safety, health, environment  and security (SHES). We have focused on  personal safety, process safety, occupational  health, and mitigating our impact on the  environment. Our overall results comprised   a number of positive outcomes, including: •	 A reduction in the number of serious  injuries during a year that included our  heaviest turnaround schedule in the past  five years, and  •	 	Commencement of the rollout of our  Orica-designed Safety Leadership program  (NextGen Safety Leadership). Stopping work and  speaking up Orica’s culture facilitates open discussion,  and it is critical that all employees feel  comfortable to speak up and stop work  anywhere and anytime there is any concern  about safety. Our focus in this area and the fostering of  a culture where it is safe to speak up, are  evident in the number of MHM stoppages,  which has increased year-on-year since  the introduction of the MHM program in  2019. MHM stoppages are recorded when  our people stop working and/or do not  commence an activity due to a key control  being identified as absent or potentially  ineffective. Since the program was first  introduced, the number of MHM stoppages  has increased substantially with more than  5,600 MHM stoppages in FY2024 alone. Safety management Over 150 years, we have observed,  categorised and learned to manage diverse  risks across our operations, and we continue  to learn as we deploy new technologies  and initiatives as our world, industry and  environments change. Several initiatives, including our MHM  program, SHES Management System and our  focus on High Potential Incidents, enable us  to manage our risks and identify the areas   in which we can continue to improve. Verification of our risk frameworks is  an essential and key activity across our  business. Key controls as defined in our  MHM program are verified regularly across  our global business. In FY2024, more than  14,000 key controls were verified by our  leaders and in our frontline operations. To  ensure thoroughness of these verifications,  quality review programs are in place  to assess the depth of the key control  verifications completed.  Product stewardship   and security We have stringent controls in place to ensure  our products remain secure throughout their  chain of custody and cannot be used for  unintended purposes.  Orica has thoroughly implemented track- and-trace technology at manufacturing,  packaging and distribution sites globally   to maintain awareness of our product   and its security.  Zero Severity 3 or higher  product security incidents In FY2024, there were no Severity 3 product  security incidents.  We actively advocate for global security  standards as a participant of international  forums. In FY2024, we participated at the  Global Congress on Chemical Security and  Emerging Threats, and as a member of the  Industry Advisory Group of the Congress,  we advocated for the development of a  global security standard for transport. We  are also leading a working group within  SAFEX, a global safety industry organisation  developing a good-practice guide for security  in transport and storage.

We are proactively advancing our  accountability and transparency efforts  amid increasing societal and regulatory  expectations and remain diligent and  confident in achieving our climate-related  targets and well-prepared to comply with  mandatory reporting requirements. As we position the business for a future  beyond blasting, our investments in  technology and innovation, partnerships  with government and key stakeholders,   and the dedicated work of our people,   are enabling continued innovation. Decarbonisation Following the successful installations of  emissions abatement technology at our sites  in Canada and Australia, we installed two  tertiary catalyst abatement reactors at our  Yarwun site this year, completing the first  phase of our decarbonisation strategy ahead  of schedule. The technology is forecast to  reduce the site’s total Scope 1 and Scope 2  emissions by approximately 50 per cent, the  equivalent of approximately 200 ktCO2-e per  year and a total elimination of 1.5 MtCO2-e  by 2030. It also provides our customers  with lower-carbon-intensive AN products,  reducing their Scope 3 profiles. Looking ahead, as part of phase two of our  decarbonisation planning, we continue to  evaluate the viability and role of renewable  hydrogen and additional technologies  including carbon capture, utilisation and  storage, fuel-switching and electrification. Greenhouse gas emissions The acceleration of Orica’s climate change  commitments has resulted in significant  emissions reductions. Net GHG emissions 43% below FY2019 baseline1 At 1,262 ktCO2-e, we achieved a 26 per  cent2 annual reduction in net Scope 1 and  Scope 2 emissions from FY2023 and a   43 per cent decrease on FY2019 levels1.  In real emissions terms, these reduction  levels demonstrate significant progress  towards our short-term target of 30 per  cent reduction by FY2026, and at least  45 per cent reduction by FY2030, from   our FY2019 baseline. In FY2024, our global Scope 3 emissions at  7,891 ktCO2-e are four per cent higher   than FY2023. Net Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 intensity3  was 1.52 tCO2-e/t AN sold, four per cent  lower than FY2023. Global nitric acid intensity In addition to marking the completion of the  first phase of our decarbonisation strategy,  this year also delivered the first full year of  emissions reduction performance from the  Kooragang Island decarbonisation project.  Our Scope 1 nitrous oxide intensity per  tonne of nitric acid produced reduced   by 52 per cent from FY2023. For further information about Orica’s  decarbonisation and greenhouse gas  emissions performance, refer to our   FY2024 Climate Action Report. Responsible water use Our assessment of physical climate risks has  identified water stress as a potential impact  in some operating regions. Our sites use  potable, ground, recycled, surface and waste  water from various sources. This year, our  Kooragang Island site in New South Wales  celebrated 10 years of recycled water  use, returning an estimated 20GL of  clean drinking water to the Hunter Valley  community – an amount equivalent to   8,000 Olympic sized swimming pools. Our potable water intensity across six  material sites increased by four per cent  this year to 1.64 kL per tonne of AN  manufactured. This was primarily driven  by demand-related lower production,  particularly at our Carseland, Canada  facility, resulting in higher potable water  consumption per tonne of product. Refer   to our ESG Data and Frameworks Pack at  orica.com for more information. Nature and biodiversity  We acknowledge the increased expectation  for businesses to understand their  dependencies and impacts on nature and  biodiversity, and to develop methods to  maintain and regenerate areas of high  nature-value and prevent significant  degradation. Ecosystem health is considered across our  operational and commercial activities and  we manage risks to protect biodiversity  accordingly. We continue to work to determine the  most effective approach to understanding  our nature-related dependencies, risks  and opportunities in consideration of the  Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity  Framework and the rapidly evolving  landscape of additional frameworks,  including the Taskforce on Nature-related  Financial Disclosures. Environmental remediation We are working to preserve and protect  the natural environment and since FY2018,  have maintained a record of no significant  environmental incidents4. This year, we  are pleased to again report the absence of  any significant environmental incidents at  our sites, globally. We are vigilant in our  anticipation and prevention of any loss of  containment of product to soil or water  while continuing to enhance the efficacy of  our environmental remediation strategies  in the event they are needed. Our Material  Environmental Issues Review program  (MEIR) ensures specialist onsite assessments  of our environmental performance and  impact management, and applies a global  environmental standard across all our  regions, exceeding local requirements   in some jurisdictions.

Through the fund, we strive to provide  lasting, positive outcomes and build long- term relationships based on trust and  transparency in local communities. Our key  areas of strategic community investment are  education, environment, health, wellbeing  and social welfare.  $14.2m  Total community investment  since FY2021 Education We forge key partnerships around the world  to facilitate education for children and young  people, so they can acquire foundational  learning skills, participate more fully in  society and experience greater opportunity  throughout their lives. •	 We have given our support through  partnerships in Argentina and Peru to  facilitate education for more than 1,000  children to provide them with educators,  learning materials, and clean and safe  learning environments. •	 In Tanzania, we have supported 2,000  girls – by providing funding for feminine  hygiene kits – to continue their education. •	 In Canada, our partnership with the Tłı̨chǫ  Investment Corporation will provide 7,000  meals for students in outlying community  schools over the coming three years. •	 Since FY2014, we have been working  with The Smith Family to improve the  educational prospects of Australian  children and young people experiencing  inequality caused by poverty. 10 years  working with The Smith Family Environment We support the environments of our  communities around the world, and  through our partnerships with independent  organisations and governments, have  enabled long-term environmental projects. In Indonesia, we partnered with the Borneo  Orangutan Survival Foundation to rehabilitate  habitat and enhance the facilities supporting  orangutans and sun bears at Samboja Lestari  Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre. Through the ‘Little guardians of the  moorland’ project and the Department   of Education in Colombia, we distributed   funds and provided a greenhouse to benefit  175 families by assisting students’ field  practice and the reforestation of 7,500  native tree species. Health, wellbeing and  social welfare The health, wellbeing and social welfare   of our host communities is important to us,  and we actively support young people and  their families through our partnerships with  organisations and schools. Through our partnership with Resolute  Mining in Mali, West Africa we contributed  to the delivery of a potable water line as  part of a broader project. In neighbouring  Senegal, we provided financial support to  improve the quality of life of elderly people  living in a remote region where there is little  help available for the ageing population. Our support in Zambia has involved the  restoration of an entire school, improving  safety, and providing access to water,  washroom facilities, building renovations,  and learning equipment and furniture. Our work with First Nations Wherever we work around the world, our  intention is to achieve harmony and support  First Nations people. Our partnerships in  Canada and Australia are examples of some  of our efforts to date. In Canada, our ongoing partnerships with  First Nations people support community  development, education and employment.  Through our management of two First  Nations joint ventures in the northwestern  territories, we employ Tłı̨chǫ workers and  contribute towards education and women’s  wellness. We also maintain agreements and  provide support for education through the  Wabun Tribal Council, for the Mattagami  and Flying Post First Nations in Ontario, and  provide educational bursaries for the Tahltan  First Nation in British Columbia. In Australia, since launching our inaugural  Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) in  FY2022, we have deepened our cultural  understanding and strengthened ties with  First Nations people. Our yarning circle –   a dedicated space created with our First  Nations employees – fosters the sharing   of stories and a sense of community within  the Orica business. We have also partnered  with two schools-based programs –  Shooting Stars and the Clontarf Foundation  – to advance our investment in equitable  education, mentoring and engagement  opportunities for young First Nations people.  While providing financial support, we also  host site visits and participate at community  events to build engagement. Initiatives such as these, and others with our  First Nations people in Australia, provide   a strong foundation to progress to the  innovate-phase of our RAP in FY2025.

Profit on sale of Yarraville land Settlement on the sale of excess land at Yarraville occurred on 28 June 2024 with net proceeds of $48.0 million. Axis Group acquisition earnout Consideration for the acquisition of Axis Mining Technology on 3 October 2022 had a deferred earnout element based on the achievement  of cumulative EBITDA generated from 1 October 2022 to 31 December 2024 and was contingent on certain key management remaining  employed by Orica. During the period, the earnout of $26.6 million that had been provided for in FY2023 has been reversed primarily due to key  management exiting the business. Integration activities and knowledge transfer has occurred across all key functions including manufacturing,  commercial and technology, with succession implemented for key management positions. Restructuring costs Restructuring costs incurred with the transfer of functional roles to the Global Business Services centre in Manila, and operating model changes   in parts of the EMEA region. Business acquisition costs Acquisition costs of $41.3 million have been incurred as part of the acquisitions of Terra Insights on 29 February 2024 and Cyanco on 30 April 2024.

The reduction from the  prior corresponding period is driven by the  payment of transaction costs incurred on   the acquisitions, increased interest costs   and restructuring costs.  Net investing cash flows Net investing cash outflows were higher  than the prior corresponding period  predominantly due to the consideration of  $1,529.7 million paid for the acquisitions  of Terra Insights and Cyanco (prior  corresponding period (pcp) consideration  of $255.8 million for Axis Group). This is  offset by cash inflows from proceeds from  the sale of Deer Park of $210.0 million and  Yarraville of $48.0 million and the deferred  cash consideration of the $3.6 million  from the sale of Türkiye business. In the  prior corresponding period, a deposit of  $50.0 million was received for the sale   of Deer Park. Net financing cash flows Other net financing cashflows include  $213.0 million of net proceeds on debt  facilities offset by $84.4 million of lease  payments. $455.1 million proceeds, net of  cost from the institutional placement and  share purchase plan were subsequently used  to partially fund the Cyanco acquisition.  The prior year cash outflow included  $116.0 million of net repayment on debt  facilities and $73.3 million of lease payments. Balance sheet As part of the ongoing management  of Orica’s debt structure and debt  maturity profile during the year,  $275 million of existing committed bank  debt facilities were refinanced and a new  $150 million committed bank debt facility  was established. The average tenor of drawn  debt at 30 September 2024 was 4.7 years  (September 2023: 5.9 years). On 17 December 2023, S&P Global Ratings  reaffirmed Orica’s investment grade credit  rating of BBB/Stable/A-2. Following the  announcement of the Cyanco acquisition  and equity placement in February 2024,  S&P Global Ratings issued a further bulletin  affirming Orica’s credit rating.  The balance sheet remains well positioned  to provide resilience in a volatile external  environment, support Orica’s strategic  priorities and deliver increased returns   to shareholders.  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE (CONTINUED) Trade working capital7 reduced by  $98 million on the prior corresponding  period due to an improvement in cycle   days and foreign exchange translation. Non trade working capital8 net liability  decreased by $58 million. The main drivers  of the movement include the release of the  refundable deposit received from the sale of  Deer Park stage 1 surplus land of $50 million  and the reversal of the provision for the Axis  Mining Technology earnout of $27 million  partially offset by an increase in restructuring  provisions of $26 million. Net fixed, intangible and right of use  assets decreased by $133 million during   the period. The decrease was mainly due   to depreciation and amortisation expense   of $412 million, foreign exchange translation  of $192 million and $120 million of  disposals (primarily Deer Park and Yarraville  $79 million), which was partially offset by  capital expenditure and lease additions of  $570 million. Other net assets decreased by $94 million  primarily due to the reduction in the net  deferred tax asset position.  Net debt (incl. leases) liability was  $720 million higher than the prior  corresponding period primarily due to cash  outflows for the acquisitions of Terra Insights  and Cyanco of $1,530 million partially   offset by proceeds from the Institutional  Share Placement and Share Purchase Plan   of $455 million and proceeds from the sale  of Deer Park and Yarraville of $258 million.

FY2024 STI performance outcomes are  detailed in section 3.2(a) of this report. Long-term incentive The FY2021–23 long-term incentive (LTI)  did not vest following testing in November  2023, with average return on net assets  (RONA) being below the required threshold  target for the three-year performance period  (1 October 2020 to 30 September 2023). Vesting outcomes for the FY2022–24  LTI award (based on average RONA and  relative total shareholder return (rTSR) over  the three-year performance period from  1 October 2021 to 30 September 2024)  will be confirmed following the release  of full-year FY2024 results – however,  with improved financial and share price  performance over the performance period,  strong vesting is anticipated. This would be  the first time since the FY2017-19 LTI award  that vesting has occurred. Full details of  any vesting will be included in the FY2025  Remuneration Report. Executive remuneration   in FY2025 Following substantial changes to the executive  incentive plans in FY2024 and the positive  feedback received internally and externally,  no incentive changes are proposed for  FY2025. Refer to section 2 of this report for  an overview of the FY2024 changes. The Board has however, decided to remove  the fixed equity component of the CEO’s  fixed annual remuneration (FAR). Upon  Sanjeev Gandhi’s appointment as CEO in  FY2021, the Board decided that a portion  of his FAR should be delivered as Orica  equity to ensure immediate and ongoing  alignment with shareholders. As the CEO’s  shareholding is now above the minimum  shareholding requirement (150% of FAR),  from 1 October 2024 all FAR will be paid   in cash, in alignment with market practice. On behalf of the People and Remuneration  Committee, I would like to thank you for  your ongoing support and invite you to read  the full report in detail. Karen Moses  Chair, People and Remuneration Committee Dear Shareholders, On behalf of the Board, I am pleased   to present Orica’s FY2024 Remuneration  Report, for which we seek your support   at our Annual General Meeting. As always, our dedicated workforce remains  central to Orica’s success, working hard  through FY2024 to deliver sustainable  performance improvement and growth  across the business. With people being our  most valued asset, we continue to invest  in their skills, capabilities and wellbeing to  ensure an empowered, enabled and highly  engaged workforce for the future. Our key  employee initiatives are outlined on page 20  of the FY2024 Annual Report. During FY2024, we again delivered year-on- year earnings growth and have increased the  quality of our earnings, which together with  strong execution against Orica’s business  strategy, have positioned the business well  for the continued delivery of long-term  shareholder returns.  Our executive remuneration decisions  and outcomes seek to reflect the overall  performance of the business, while ensuring  alignment with Orica’s values. As safety  is one of our core values, a no-fatality  gateway was introduced into the short- term incentive (STI) in FY2024, signalling  the Board’s intent to reduce the outcome  of the safety component to nil in the  event of a work-related fatality, having  regard to the circumstances. The gateway  has been applied this year as tragically  in December 2023, an Orica vehicle was  struck from behind on a public road in India,  fatally injuring an employee. A thorough  investigation into the incident has been  completed and key learnings implemented  across our global business. FY2024 remuneration  outcomes Short-term incentive FY2024 STI outcomes for the Managing  Director and Chief Executive Officer (CEO)  and other executive key management  personnel (KMP) reflect our strong  performance against the relevant targets set: •	 Our serious injury case-rate (SICR) was  our lowest recorded result in five years,  however the no-fatality gateway has been  applied to reduce the outcome of this  metric to nil. •	 The focus on loss of containment (LOC)  across the business has resulted in another  low outcome, particularly in the context of  major plant turnaround activity which can  increase the risk of LOC events. •	 Significant progress has been made  against Orica’s climate change objectives,  with our major tertiary abatement  installation projects completed and  operational ahead of schedule, and net  Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions ahead   of our strengthened target level. •	 Positive Group EBIT and net operating  cash flow (NOCF) outcomes were  achieved, a result of strong performance  and commercial discipline across the  business, including a clear focus on cost  control and trade working capital. •	 The new operational priorities component  has focused executives on delivering  against key milestones critical to  Orica’s long-term success including the  completion of two strategic acquisitions  and major turnaround activities, details   of which are provided on page 39. The result is a final STI for the CEO of   132.5 per cent of his target opportunity  (88.3 per cent of maximum).

Retired from the Board on 29 February 2024. Section 2. Key Stakeholder Questions Key questions Orica response Further detail How does  Orica’s executive  remuneration  framework align   to strategy? Orica’s executive remuneration framework is weighted towards variable (at-risk) remuneration to  align with the interests of our shareholders and drive performance against short and long-term  business objectives.  The alignment of executive remuneration to our strategy was strengthened in FY2024 through  several incentive plan design changes including the introduction of an operational priorities  component into the CEO’s short-term incentive (STI) and the new long-term incentive (LTI)  business sustainability metric. Section 3.1 What changes  were made in  FY2024 and why? As a result of the Board’s review of executive remuneration during FY2023, the following  changes were made for FY2024: •	 Introduction of an LTI business sustainability metric with a 20 per cent weighting from the  FY2024–26 LTI award. The metric is initially focused on portfolio resilience and diversification,  rewarding the delivery of initiatives and outcomes that strengthen the resilience and  sustainability of Orica’s portfolio in alignment with our strategic plan. •	 Introduction of an STI operational priorities component with a 15% weighting for the CEO to  provide a more balanced view of performance and ensure direct alignment with key initiatives  and actions required to ensure long-term success. •	 Other modifications to the STI scorecard including a new fatalities gateway over the safety  (SICR) metric; expansion of the Scope 1 and 2 absolute emissions reduction metric to include  an assessment of delivery of key net zero program initiatives viewed as critical to meeting  Orica’s stated targets; removing RONA (with RONA remaining in the LTI); and shifting from  cash generation efficiency (an internal metric) to net operating cash flows (a well understood,  externally reported metric). The post-vesting holding lock on deferred STI awards was also removed with the review  confirming this to be out of step with ASX-listed market peers and no longer necessary   given current executive shareholdings; the re-introduction of rTSR into the LTI from FY2022;   and the two-year LTI post-vesting holding lock. The one-year vesting period for STI deferred  shares remains. Section 4.1 Effective from the start of FY2024, the minimum shareholding period for all executives was  reduced from six to five years from appointment to align to the CEO. Section 6.4 Were there any  fixed pay increases  in FY2024? The CEO’s fixed annual remuneration (FAR) remained at $1.82m for FY2024 (the last increase   to FAR being on 1 April 2023, the second anniversary of his appointment to the CEO role). Following external benchmarking of the other executive KMP roles, remuneration increases  effective 1 January 2024 were received by the Chief Technology Officer (1.5%) and President  SHES, Discrete Manufacturing and Supply (6.3%), reflecting external market benchmarking   and performance in their roles. – REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED) Orica Limited Annual Report 2024 35 Overview Our Business Our Performance Financial Performance Remuneration Report Directors’ Report Financial Report Shareholder Information  ===== PAGE 38 ===== Key questions Orica response Further detail How does the  CEO’s fixed equity  component  operate? On Sanjeev Gandhi’s appointment to the CEO role in FY2021, the Board determined it  appropriate that a portion of his FAR be delivered in the form of Orica equity to ensure  immediate and ongoing alignment with shareholders. As a result, from May 2021 until the end of FY2024, the CEO has received $300,000 per  annum of his FAR as fixed equity, granted in the form of Restricted Rights which vest monthly  in alignment with the payment of fixed cash. Vested Rights are exercisable for a five-year period  from grant, with underlying shares placed under a holding lock subject to the CEO being  deemed to have met his minimum shareholding requirement. With the CEO having reached his minimum shareholding requirement (150% of FAR) during  FY2024 and the objective of ensuring sufficient shareholder alignment being met, the fixed  equity plan has now ceased. From 1 October 2024, the CEO’s fixed remuneration will therefore  be realigned with market practice and provided in cash. Section 4.1 How do FY2024  remuneration  outcomes  reflect business  performance? FY2024 STI outcomes reflect our financial and operational performance including: •	 Increase in EBIT and a strong net operating cash flow (NOCF) outcome •	 Historically low SICR and LOC outcomes, noting no vesting under the STI safety component  as outlined below •	 Strong sustainability performance with Orica well positioned to achieve our stated emissions  reduction target •	 Delivery of critical major turnaround activities with minimal disruption to the business, and •	 Completion of two strategic acquisitions with integration activities well-underway, which will  enable us to realise growth opportunities within the Digital Solutions and Specialty Mining  Chemicals segments. No vesting occurred under the FY2021–23 LTI award (with a single RONA performance metric)  primarily due to financial performance in FY2021 being well-below expectations. While the  final vesting outcome of the FY2022–24 LTI award (with RONA and rTSR metrics) will be  confirmed following the release of Orica’s FY2024 full-year results, it is anticipated that strong  vesting under this award will occur as a result of improved financial performance and positive  shareholder returns over the three-year performance period. Sections 3.2(a)  and (b) Did the Board  apply any  discretion in  relation to FY2024  remuneration  outcomes? The Board has an overriding discretion to adjust executive incentive plan outcomes to ensure  they are reflective of Orica’s overall performance and aligned to shareholder expectations.  This includes the ability to exercise discretion where required to ensure that our remuneration  framework encourages a culture aligned with Orica’s values. Aligned with safety being one of our core values, in FY2024 the Board introduced a no-fatality  gateway over the safety (SICR) metric within the STI scorecard whereby, having regard to the  circumstances, the outcome of this metric may be reduced to nil in the event of a work-related  fatality. The gateway has been applied this year as tragically in December 2023, an Orica vehicle  was struck from behind on a public road in India, fatally injuring an employee. A thorough  investigation into the incident has been completed and key learnings have been implemented  across our global business. As a result, despite a strong SICR performance outcome, the CEO  and all executives will see no vesting for this metric. With two strategic acquisitions occurring during FY2024, STI scorecard metric outcomes have  also been adjusted, as required, to align with the basis upon which the FY2024 targets were set,  ensuring management is neither advantaged nor disadvantaged by the transactions. Similarly,  adjustments for significant items have been made in determining the FY2021–23 LTI outcome  with the adjustment approach being consistent with prior year RONA calculations. Sections 3.2(a)  and (b) Will there be  any changes  to executive  remuneration   for FY2025? With substantial incentive design changes made in FY2024, a decision was made to continue to  embed these changes and, with the exception of the CEO’s fixed equity component (which as  noted previously will be removed), the same executive remuneration framework and incentive  plan constructs will be retained for FY2025. Underlying STI metrics have been reviewed and  updated as appropriate to reflect the current environment and our FY2025 operational priorities. – REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED) Annual Report 2024 36  ===== PAGE 39 ===== Section 3. Remuneration Overview 3.1  FY2024 Remuneration strategy At Orica, our executive remuneration framework is performance-based, with a substantial at-risk component linked to the key drivers   of our business strategy, aligning reward with the interests of our shareholders and the creation of long-term sustainable returns.  OBJECTIVE: COMPETITIVE REMUNERATION THAT ALIGNS EXECUTIVES WITH THE LONG-TERM SUCCESS OF ORICA AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS BOARD  PRIORITIES Strong alignment  with shareholder returns and  overall business performance Fit for purpose,   with a clear link to business  strategy and driving   desired behaviours Simple and transparent,  delivering incentive   outcomes that are fair   and well understood Globally competitive,  enabling Orica to attract   and retain the best talent Component Fixed annual remuneration (FAR) Short‑term incentive (STI) Long‑term incentive (LTI) Purpose  and link   to strategy Provide competitive base pay in   a challenging talent market that   will attract and retain the skills  needed to manage a complex   global business. We target FAR at the median of an ASX  listed comparator group comprising  companies of similar size, operations  and global business complexity. In benchmarking executive remuneration,  additional sector or local industry- specific data is also considered,  particularly for roles located outside   of Australia. Drive performance aligned   to near-term strategy and  underpinning long-term   value creation. Scorecard metrics for FY2024   supported a continued focus on: •	 Reducing serious injuries •	 Minimising the impact of our  operations on the environment •	 Driving improved financial  performance including cash   flow management, and •	 Key operational priorities in the   areas of efficiency, effectiveness   and value generation. The deferred equity component  provides longer-term shareholder  alignment. Drive long-term value creation  for shareholders by encouraging  an owner’s mindset and  decision‑making that supports  sustainable performance. The LTI balances continued growth in  Orica’s underlying business and efficient  capital allocation, with the need to  make substantial operating changes  that will ensure the longevity of the  company and ongoing returns for   our shareholders. Performance is assessed over a  three-year period with longer-term  shareholder alignment through   a two-year post-vesting holding lock.

The accident has led to a review of our  transport related key controls with actions  taken to reinforce these across our business.  10.0% 0.128 0.0% Loss of  containment  (LOC3)  This metric continues to drive awareness  of the need to minimise our environmental  impact and a focus on reducing both the  number and severity level of LOC events.

President SHES, Discrete  Manufacturing and Supply  Leah Barlow Delivery of Orica’s Discrete Network Optimisation program has  continued through FY2024 with successful implementation of new  Electronic Blasting Systems assembly production lines and automation  capabilities strengthening supply chain capacity and flexibility and  achieving efficiency improvements. Security of supply for our customers  was again achieved notwithstanding challenges faced through recent  TNT shortages. Ms Barlow has also provided strong safety leadership  across our global business with the launch of key fatality prevention  initiatives driving an increased Major Hazard Management (MHM)  focus; however, the fatality in India has been taken into account in  determining her STI final outcome. Chief Technology Officer  Angus Melbourne Strong demand for Orica’s suite of digital offerings and value-added  services delivered growth in the Digital Solutions segment despite  continued softness in mining exploration activity. We saw strong  performance from all product categories and early success in cross- selling with 3vGeomatics™ for deformation monitoring, establishing our  platform for accelerated growth in FY2025 and beyond. We continue to  see significant blasting technology uptake with our customers resulting  in strong growth in our new technology products and solutions most  notably for 4D™ and WebGen™.

Executive Remuneration 4.1  Executive remuneration for FY2024 The following table outlines the FY2024 executive remuneration framework. Remuneration positioning Market position Median for FAR and between median and 75th percentile for total remuneration where outstanding performance   is delivered. Comparators Primary comparator group – 13 ASX listed companies similar in size, operations and complexity to Orica,   with reference to market capitalisation, revenue, industry and the extent of international operations. The primary comparator group was last reviewed at 30 June 2024 and comprises the following companies: Amcor  Plc, Ansell Limited, BlueScope Steel Limited, Brambles Limited, Cochlear Limited, Incitec Pivot Limited, James Hardie  Industries Plc, Nufarm Limited, Orora Limited, Sims Limited, Santos Limited, South 32 Limited and Worley Limited. Secondary comparator group (reference) – ASX listed companies with market capitalisation between 50%   and 200% of Orica’s 12-month average market capitalisation, at 30 June of the relevant financial year. Where appropriate, particularly for roles located outside of Australia, additional sector or local industry-specific   data is taken into consideration in benchmarking executive remuneration. FAR (Cash) Payment vehicle Base salary, superannuation (or pension equivalent) and allowances (per local market practice). FAR (Equity) Payment vehicle Restricted Rights (each vested Right providing a 1:1 entitlement to Orica shares). Opportunity   (face value) CEO: Grant value of $300,000 for FY2024 (16.5% of FAR at the date of grant). The actual number of Restricted Rights issued was determined by dividing FAR (equity) opportunity by the five‑day  VWAP of Orica shares following the announcement of our FY2023 annual results ($15.65). Vesting period 1 October 2023 to 30 September 2024. Annual Report 2024 42  ===== PAGE 45 ===== REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED) Vesting schedule Vests in equal monthly tranches subject to continued employment until the end of the relevant month. Due to timing   of the grant, the first two tranches (October and November 2023) were granted fully vested in December 2023. Exercise period Between vesting and five‑years from grant. Holding locks Shares allocated following exercise of vested Rights will be subject to a holding lock until the CEO’s minimum  shareholding requirement (150% x FAR) has been met. Cessation of  employment Unvested Rights lapse on cessation, subject to Board discretion to determine otherwise. Vested Rights are retained  with no holding locks attached to the underlying shares. Change of control Board discretion to determine an appropriate treatment. Access to dividends  Entitlement to dividend equivalent payments in relation to vested Rights. STI Payment vehicle Cash and deferred shares. Opportunity CEO: 0 to 150% of FAR; 100% at target.  Other executives: 0 to 120% of FAR; 60% at target. For executives based outside of Australia, opportunities are referenced to base salary only. Performance  measures CEO: Safety measured through serious injury case-rate (SICR) (10%), environment measured through loss of  containment (LOC) (5%) and decarbonisation (10%) comprising global Scope 1 and Scope 2 absolute emissions  reduction and delivery of net zero program initiatives; financials (60%) comprising EBIT and NOCF; and agreed  operational priorities (15%) Other executives: safety (10%), environment (5%), decarbonisation (10%), financials (50%), operational priorities (25%). Required performance levels for threshold, target and stretch are set for the SICR, LOC, global Scope 1 and Scope 2  absolute emissions reduction, EBIT and NOCF metrics. Below threshold, no incentive is paid. Above threshold,   straight-line vesting applies between threshold and target, and between target and stretch. Targets only are set for the delivery of net zero program initiatives and operational priorities metrics, with vesting  determined using a similar vesting schedule (i.e. performance may range from below threshold to stretch). While not specifically included within the CEO or executive STI scorecards, the Board considers the progress made  against Orica’s business plan, key people metrics and individuals’ adherence to Orica’s business conduct and  compliance frameworks in determining final STI outcomes. Input is sought, as required, from Board Committee   Chairs and senior functional leaders within the Finance, Legal, Risk and Assurance, Safety Health Environment and  Security (SHES), Sustainability and People functions. The Board also retains an overarching discretion to adjust CEO   and executive STI outcomes to ensure our executive remuneration framework encourages a culture aligned with  Orica’s values. Deferred STI CEO: 50% of STI delivered in deferred shares which vest after one year and are subject to risk of forfeiture. Other executives: one‑third of STI delivered in deferred shares which vest after one year and are subject to risk   of forfeiture. The number of deferred shares granted was calculated using the five‑day VWAP of Orica shares following the  announcement of our FY2023 annual results ($15.65). Cessation of  employment Unvested deferred shares lapse on resignation or termination for cause. In other  circumstances, being good leaver events, unvested shares may be retained subject   to the original vesting period. Vested deferred shares are retained on cessation. The Board retains discretion to determine a different treatment on cessation   if considered appropriate in the circumstances. Change of control Board discretion to determine an appropriate treatment. Access to dividends Executives are entitled to accumulate dividends during the deferral period.

Opportunity   (face value) CEO: 200% of FAR grant at face value.  Other executives: 120% of FAR grant at face value. For executives based outside of Australia, opportunities are referenced to base salary only. The actual number of Performance Rights issued to each executive was determined by dividing their respective grant  values by the five‑day VWAP of Orica shares following the announcement of our FY2023 annual results ($15.65). Performance  period Performance is measured over three financial years (FY2024, FY2025 and FY2026). Performance  measures 40% of Rights are subject to RONA1 – calculated as annual EBIT/rolling 12‑month net operating assets (calculated   on an average basis over three financial years). 40% of Rights are subject to relative total shareholder return (rTSR) performance. 20% of Rights are subject to a business sustainability metric which for the FY2024–26 LTI award is focused on  portfolio resilience and diversification including increasing exposure to key emerging markets; accelerating growth   in digital solutions and mining chemicals; and moving towards a more progressive and sustainable commodities mix. Targets and   vesting schedule RONA component (40%) The FY2024–26 vesting schedule for the RONA performance measure is as follows: Average RONA over 3 years % of Rights vesting Below 12.0% No vesting At 12.0%  30% of Rights vest Between 12.0% and 13.0% Straight line vesting between 30% and 60% At 13.0% 60% of Rights vest Between 13.0% and 14.0% Straight line vesting between 60% and 100% At or above 14.0% 100% of Rights vest The FY2024–26 LTI RONA targets reflected the Board’s expectations in late 2023 based on Orica’s corporate plan   and the long term growth forecast considering the current industry and market cycle. Relative TSR component (40%) Orica’s TSR performance over the performance period will be measured against the performance of constituents  within the ASX 100 index, defined as at the start of the performance period (1 October 2023). Orica TSR percentile ranking   (against constituents of ASX 100) % of Rights vesting Below 50th 0% 50th (target performance) 50% of Rights vest Between 50th and 75th percentile Straight line vesting between 50% and 100% 75th or above (stretch performance) 100% of Rights vest Business sustainability (20%) The outcome of the business sustainability metric will be determined by the Board following the end of   the performance period, considering the progress made against a set of challenging portfolio resilience   and diversification targets (directly aligned to our long-term strategic plan) addressing: •	 Growth in key emerging markets •	 Growth in digital solutions and mining chemicals, and •	 Rebalancing of our portfolio towards a more progressive and sustainable commodities mix. The Board’s final vesting assessment and associated rationale will be clearly communicated to investors in the  relevant Remuneration Report. With regard to what may be considered commercially sensitive information at   the time of vesting, this will include how we have performed against the relevant targets. Annual Report 2024 44  ===== PAGE 47 ===== REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED) Holding locks Following the three-year performance period, vested Performance Rights are converted into shares and are subject to  a further two-year holding lock during which time executives are restricted from dealing in those shares. The holding  lock is designed to support an owner’s mindset and provide further alignment with shareholders. Disposal restrictions may be lifted where an executive is required to fund personal tax obligations arising from the  vesting of Rights (for example, where an executive has been based overseas during the vesting period and may have  an earlier taxing point). Cessation of  employment Unvested Rights lapse on resignation or termination for cause. In other circumstances, being good leaver events,   a pro-rata portion of Rights (based on service period) is retained subject to the original vesting period and holding lock. Vested Rights are retained on cessation, subject to the original holding lock. The Board retains discretion to determine a different treatment on cessation if considered appropriate in   the circumstances. Change of control Board discretion to determine an appropriate treatment. Access to dividends Executives are not entitled to receive dividends on unvested Performance Rights during the three-year performance  period. Once vested, executives are entitled to receive dividends during the two-year holding lock. 1.	 For LTI purposes, RONA is defined as 12-month EBIT/rolling 12-month average operating net assets. EBIT is equivalent to profit/loss before financing costs and income  tax excluding individually significant items as disclosed in note 1(b) in the financial statements. Operating net assets is equivalent to property, plant and equipment,  intangibles, equity accounted investees and working capital excluding environmental provisions. The Board has an overriding discretion to adjust final outcomes under the terms of both the STI and LTI plans to ensure executive reward  outcomes are reflective of our overall performance and aligned to shareholder expectations. 4.2  Equity granted in FY2024 The table below presents the equity granted at face value to executive KMP during FY2024.

Section 5. Non-executive Director Arrangements 5.1  Overview Fees for Non-executive Directors (Directors) are set by reference to: •	 The individual’s responsibilities and time commitment attached to the role of Director and committee membership •	 The Company’s existing remuneration policies and survey data sourced from external specialists, and •	 Fees paid by comparable companies and the level of remuneration required to attract and retain Directors of the appropriate calibre. To preserve their independence, Directors do not receive any form of performance‑based pay. The current aggregate fee pool for Directors of $2,750,000 was approved by shareholders at our 2019 Annual General Meeting. The Company  pays superannuation and committee fees to the Directors from this pool. Committee fees are not paid to the Chairman of the Board.

Remuneration Governance 6.1  Responsibility for setting remuneration The People and Remuneration Committee (the Committee) is delegated responsibility by the Board for reviewing and making recommendations  on our remuneration policies, including policies governing the remuneration of executives. Activities of the Committee are governed by its Terms of Reference, which is available on our website at orica.com. Among other responsibilities,  the Committee assists the Board in its oversight of: •	 Remuneration policy for executives •	 Level and structure of remuneration for executives, including STI and LTI plans •	 The Company’s compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements in respect of remuneration matters, and •	 Approval of the allocation of shares and awards under Orica’s equity programs. 6.2  Use of remuneration advisers during the year Independent remuneration advisers are engaged from time to time to provide relevant information including benchmarking and other market  data or to give an external perspective that may assist the Committee with its decision-making. No remuneration recommendations were  received from remuneration advisers during FY2024, as defined under the Corporations Act 2001. Orica Limited Annual Report 2024 47 Overview Our Business Our Performance Financial Performance Remuneration Report Directors’ Report Financial Report Shareholder Information  ===== PAGE 50 ===== REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED) 6.3  Securities dealing policy and Malus Securities dealing All executives are required to comply with our Securities Dealing Policy at all times and in respect of all Orica shares held, including any defined  employee share plans. Trading is subject to pre‑clearance and is not permitted during designated blackout periods unless there are exceptional  circumstances. Executives are prohibited from using any Orica shares as collateral in any margin loan or derivative arrangement. Malus Orica’s Malus Standard allows the Board to require any executive to forfeit in full or in part, any unvested LTIP or deferred STI award as a result of: •	 A material misstatement in financial results, •	 Adverse outcomes or a performance calculation error that would have materially reduced the original assessment of performance, •	 	Behaviour that brings Orica into disrepute or has the potential to do so including a breach of Orica’s Code of Conduct, •	 Serious misconduct, or •	 Any other circumstance, which the Board has determined in good faith. In considering whether any adjustment is necessary in respect of any or all participants, the Board may take into account the individual’s level  of responsibility, accountability or influence over the action or inaction, the quantum of the actual loss or damage, any impact on our financial  soundness or reputational standing, the extent to which any internal policies, external regulations and/or risk management requirements were  breached, and any other relevant matters. 6.4  Executive and Director share ownership The Board considers that an important foundation of our executive remuneration framework is that each executive and Director accumulate   and hold a significant number of Orica shares to align their interests as long-term investors. Executives The executive Minimum Shareholding Requirement guideline requires each executive to accumulate a minimum vested equity holding in Orica  over a fixed time period from their appointment. The requirement is 150 per cent of FAR over five years from appointment for the CEO and   50 per cent of FAR over five years from appointment for other executives. Non-executive Directors To create alignment between Directors and shareholders, Directors are required to hold (or have a benefit in) shares in the Company equivalent   in value to at least one year’s base fees. Such holdings must be acquired over a reasonable time using personal funds.

Cash STI payment includes payments relating to FY2024 performance accrued but not paid until FY2025. 2.	 These benefits include car parking, medical and insurance costs, relocation or assignment-related expenses including reimbursement of accommodation, health  insurance and taxation services, and movements in annual leave accrual (inclusive of any applicable fringe benefits tax). A negative balance may appear where   the leave accrual has decreased from the prior year. 3.	 This benefit includes the movement in long service leave accrual. 4.	 This includes the value of executive LTI awards calculated under Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) 2 Share-based payment to executives which vest over  three years. Value only accrues to the executive when performance conditions have been met. The share-based payment expense represents the amount required  under Australian Accounting Standards to be expensed during the year in respect of current and past long-term incentive allocations to executives. These amounts   are therefore not amounts received by executives during the year nor may they be payable to the executive at any other time if performance hurdles are not met.   The mechanism that determines whether LTI awards vest in the future is described in sections 3.2(b) and 4.1. Where a negative share-based payment expense is  shown, it represents a write-back of a previous share-based payment accrual based on a revised estimate of performance conditions being met. 5.	 Under AASB 2 Share-based payment, STI paid to executives as deferred equity is accounted for as a share-based payment and expensed over two years. Accordingly,  50 per cent of the value of deferred equity is included in the executives share-based payment expense in the relevant performance year with the remainder included   in the subsequent year. 6.	 Remuneration for James Crough relates to his executive KMP period only. 7.	 Kim Kerr ceased to be KMP on 31 May 2024. Remuneration for 2024 therefore reflects her executive KMP period only. During a transition period which ended on  1 August 2024, Kim Kerr remained employed with Orica and received contractual base salary and superannuation in addition to the amounts shown in the above  table. At the conclusion of this transition period, she received a contractual severance payment of $400,000, equivalent to six months’ fixed annual remuneration. 8.	 Christopher Davis ceased to be KMP on 10 October 2022. Remuneration for 2023 therefore reflects his executive KMP period only.

Consistent with prior years, the table shows equity grants made to individuals during their KMP period only. No equity grants have been made to James Crough   in his KMP capacity, noting that the share-based payment expense numbers in section 7.1 include the expense for his KMP period that relates to previously received  equity grants. 2.	 A grant of Restricted Rights was made to Sanjeev Gandhi in relation to the FY2024 fixed equity component of his remuneration. Eleven of the 12 tranches vested  during FY2024 (in relation to service from 1 October to 31 August 2024) with the remaining tranche vesting on 1 October 2024 (in relation to service from   1 September to 30 September 2024). 3.	 Closing balance refers to the balance held at the end of her KMP period. Value of equity instruments included in compensation for the year for Kim Kerr also relates  to her KMP period only. A pro-rata portion of LTIP awards (based only on time served in the CFO role) was retained and remain on foot, with the remainder lapsing   on termination.

Environmental regulation  Orica seeks to be compliant with applicable  environmental laws and regulatory  permissions relevant to its operations.  Where instances of non-compliance occur,  Orica’s procedures require that relevant  governmental authorities are notified in  accordance with statutory requirements  and internal investigations are conducted to  determine the cause of the non-compliance  to ensure the risk of recurrence is minimised. The Company has committed major  investments, both in terms of capital and  resources, to improve its environmental  performance at key sites in addition   to its general maintenance program.   The Company is working closely and   co-operatively with regulators and  government agencies in relation to these  initiatives, and enhancing community  engagement and consultation.

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER Orica Limited Annual Report 2024 63 Overview Our Business Our Performance Financial Performance Remuneration Report Directors’ Report Financial Report Shareholder Information  ===== PAGE 66 ===== Basis of preparation This is a general purpose financial report which has been prepared by a for-profit entity in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards  adopted by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and the Corporations Act 2001 and complies with the International Financial  Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board. It has been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, defined benefit obligations and investments in financial  assets which have been measured at fair value.  The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars with all amounts rounded, except where otherwise stated, to the nearest tenth of  one million dollars, in accordance with ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors’ Reports) Instrument 2016/191 dated 24 March 2016. Orica Limited, incorporated and domiciled in Australia, is a for-profit company limited by shares which are publicly traded on the Australian  Securities Exchange. Orica’s Directors have included information in this report that they deem to be material and relevant to the understanding of the consolidated  financial statements. Where appropriate, comparative information has been reclassified to conform to changes in presentation and to   enhance comparability. Disclosure may be considered material and relevant if the dollar amount is significant due to size or nature, or the information is important   to understand the: •	 Group’s current year results •	 Impact of material changes in Orica’s business, and •	 Aspects of the Group’s operations that are important to future performance. Except as described in note 24, the financial statements have been prepared using consistent accounting policies in line with those of the  previous financial year and corresponding interim reporting period. Material accounting policies that apply to the overall financial statements Foreign currencies Functional and presentation currency The Company’s functional and presentation currency is Australian dollars. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency,   and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. Transactions and balances Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company or entity concerned are recorded using the exchange rate on the  date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies at the balance date are retranslated at closing  exchange rates. Non-monetary assets are not retranslated unless they are carried at fair value. Gains and losses arising on the retranslation of  monetary assets and liabilities are included in the income statement, except where the application of hedge accounting requires inclusion in other  comprehensive income (refer to note 10). Consolidation of Group entities On consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars at the closing rate at balance date. The results of  foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars at average exchange rates for the period where these do not materially differ from rates  applicable on the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange differences arising on the retranslation of foreign operations are recognised directly  in a separate component of equity. Critical accounting judgements and estimates Application of the Group accounting policies requires management to make judgements, and to apply estimates and assumptions to  future events. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and which are material to the report, are highlighted   in the following notes: Note 6 Provisions Note 11 Taxation Note 9 Impairment testing of assets Note 14 Businesses and non-controlling interests acquired NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER Annual Report 2024 64  ===== PAGE 67 ===== NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) Orica Group Manufacture and   supply of commercial  explosives and   blasting systems Manufacture and   supply of speciality   mining chemicals Development, manufacture  and deployment of   advanced software,   sensors and end-to-end   data science Provides strategic   support for the   Orica Group Digital Solutions Blasting Solutions Specialty Mining Chemicals Global Support Section A.

Other than Australia, Canada, Peru and the United States of America, sales to other countries are individually less than 10% of the Group’s total revenues. Recognition and measurement Revenue is recognised when, or as the Group transfers control of goods or services to a customer at the amount to which the Group expects  to be entitled. If the consideration includes a variable amount (net of trade discounts and volume rebates), the Group estimates the amount of  consideration to which it will be entitled. The majority of the Group’s operations are conducted under Master Service Agreements which require  customers to place orders for goods or services on a periodic basis. The performance obligations are identified at the point that the customer  places the order. Supply of products and provision of services  Revenue is derived from contractual agreements for either:  •	 the supply of products; or •	 the supply of products and the provision of services. Contracts for the supply of products are one performance obligation; contracts for the supply of products and services include one or two  separate performance obligations depending on whether the customer can benefit from the products independently of the services.  Product revenue is recognised when the goods are delivered to the contracted point of delivery as this is the point at which the customer gains  control of the product and the performance obligation is satisfied by the Group.  Service revenue is recognised over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Group’s performance.   Where products and services are combined into one single performance obligation, revenue is recognised over time as the customer  simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group’s performance. Contracts to provide a designated output  The provision of goods and services in contracts that provide a designated quantity of output results in the identification of a single performance  obligation to deliver an integrated service to the customer. Revenue from this performance obligation is recognised over time as the customer  simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Group’s performance.

Orica Limited Annual Report 2024 71 Overview Our Business Our Performance Financial Performance Remuneration Report Directors’ Report Financial Report Shareholder Information  ===== PAGE 74 ===== NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) Section B. Capital  Management Orica’s objectives when managing capital (net debt and total equity)  are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern   and to ensure the capital structure enhances, protects and balances  financial flexibility against minimising the cost of capital. This section  outlines the principal capital management initiatives that have been  undertaken, current year drivers of the Group’s cash flows, as well  as the key operating assets used and liabilities incurred to support  financial performance. 3.  Net debt and net financing costs In order to maintain an appropriate capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend paid to shareholders, utilise a dividend reinvestment  plan, return capital to shareholders such as through a share buy-back, or issue new equity, in addition to incurring an appropriate level of  borrowings. Orica maintains a dividend policy and expects the total dividend payout ratio to be in the range of 40-70 per cent of profit after  income tax expense before individually significant items attributable to shareholders of Orica Limited. It is also expected that the total dividend  paid each year will be weighted towards the final dividend. Orica monitors debt capacity against a number of key credit metrics aligned to debt covenants, principally the gearing ratio (net debt excluding  lease liabilities divided by net debt excluding lease liabilities plus equity) and the interest cover ratio (EBIT excluding individually material items,  divided by net financing costs excluding lease interest). These ratios, together with performance measure criteria determined by S&P Global  Ratings (S&P), are monitored in support of maintaining an investment grade credit rating, which enables access to borrowings from a range of  sources. S&P’s key measures include Funds from Operations (FFO)/Debt and Debt/EBITDA. Of note, S&P’s rating methodology adjusts Orica’s net  debt to incorporate post-retirement benefit obligations, asset retirement obligations (i.e. environmental and decommissioning provisions) and  leases. Orica’s debt covenants are exclusive of these items. The gearing and interest cover ratios are monitored to ensure an adequate buffer  against covenant levels applicable to the various financing facilities. Consolidated 2024  $m 2023  $m The gearing ratio is calculated as follows: Interest bearing liabilities excluding lease liabilities (refer to note 3a)  2,198.4   2,075.4  Less cash and cash equivalents  (580.7)  (1,152.1) Total net debt  1,617.7  923.3  Total equity  4,547.6   4,051.8  Total net debt and equity  6,165.3   4,975.1  Gearing ratio (%) 26.2% 18.6% The interest ratio is calculated as follows: Profit before financing costs and income tax (excluding individually significant items – refer to note 1b)  805.6   698.1  Net financing costs excluding lease interest (note 3b)  158.6  128.2  Interest cover ratio (times)  5.1   5.4 Annual Report 2024 72  ===== PAGE 75 ===== NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 3.  Net debt and net financing costs (continued) (a)  Interest bearing liabilities Current  Opening  Balance  $m Non-cash  movements3  $m Non-cash  reclassifi- cations  $m Net cash  movements  $m Closing  Balance  $m Unsecured 	 Private placement debt1 – –  92.4  –  92.4  	 Other loans – – –  0.8   0.8  Lease liabilities  72.8  96.1  10.2   (103.0) 76.1 Total  72.8  96.1 102.6  (102.2) 169.3 Non-current Unsecured 	 Private placement debt1  2,050.0   (83.4)  (92.4) –  1,874.2  	 Bank loans1 –  (6.6) –  212.2   205.6  	 CEFC1,2  22.4  – – –  22.4  	 Other loans  3.0  – – –  3.0  Lease liabilities  224.0  32.7  (10.2) – 246.5 Total 2,299.4  (57.3) (102.6) 212.2  2,351.7 Total 2,372.2  38.8 – 110.0  2,521.0 1.

Interest bearing liabilities, excluding lease liabilities Interest bearing liabilities are initially recognised net of transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest bearing liabilities are stated at  amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the liabilities  on an effective interest basis, unless they are liabilities designated in a fair value relationship in which case they continue to be measured at fair  value (refer to note 10). Financing costs Borrowing costs are expensed as incurred unless they relate to qualifying assets where interest on funds is capitalised. Interest income and  interest expense relating to interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps are presented on a net basis. Lease liabilities The Group recognises all lease liabilities and corresponding right of use assets, with the exception of short-term (12 months or less) and low- value leases, on the Balance Sheet. Lease liabilities are recorded at the present value of fixed payments, variable lease payments that depend  on an index or rate, amounts payable under residual value guarantees and extension options expected to be exercised. Where a lease contains  an extension option which the Group can exercise without negotiation, lease payments for the extension period are included in the liability if  the Group is reasonably certain that it will exercise the option. Variable lease payments not dependent on an index or rate are excluded from  the liability. Lease payments are discounted at the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee unless the rate implicit in the lease can be readily  determined. Annual Report 2024 74  ===== PAGE 77 ===== NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 3.  Net debt and net financing costs (continued) Lease liabilities (continued) Lease liabilities are remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate, or a change in   the assessed lease term. A corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right of use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss   if the carrying amount has been reduced to zero. The Group applied judgement to determine the incremental borrowing rates as well as the lease term for some lease contracts that include  extension or termination options. The assessment of whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease term,  which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities and right of use assets recognised. The Group recognises depreciation of the right of use assets and interest on the lease liabilities in the income statement over the lease term.  Repayments of lease liabilities are separated into a principal portion (presented within financing activities) and interest portion (presented within  operating activities) in the cash flow statement. Expenses relating to short-term and low-value leases of $60.2 million (2023: $65.6 million) have been recognised in the income statement.  Total cash outflow for leases was $163.2 million (2023: $154.4 million).

Working capital (continued) Recognition and measurement The collectability of trade and other receivables is assessed continuously, specific allowances are made for any doubtful trade and other  receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts at year end. The Group utilises a simplified approach for expected credit losses which  considers both quantitative information from historic credit losses together with qualitative information on different customer/debtor profiles  and segments. The net carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair values. A risk assessment process is used for all  accounts, with a stop credit process in place for most long overdue accounts.

The carrying amount of trade payables approximates their fair values due to   their short-term nature. (b)  Non-trade working capital Non-trade working capital includes all other receivables and payables not related to the purchase of goods and is recognised net of provisions   for impairment of $31.0 million (2023: $23.0 million). Accounting judgements and estimates In the course of normal trading activities, management uses its judgement in establishing the carrying value of various elements of working  capital – principally inventory and accounts receivable. Provisions are established for obsolete or slow-moving inventories. Actual expenses  in future periods may be different from the provisions established and any such differences would impact future earnings of the Group. 6.  Provisions Consolidated 2024  $m 2023  $m Current Employee entitlements 128.2  117.0  Environmental and decommissioning1,2,3 66.2  66.6  Restructuring3 25.8  – Other 32.1  68.3  252.3  251.9  Non-current Employee entitlements 21.9  17.7  Defined benefit obligations (see note 19b) 70.0 74.3  Environmental and decommissioning1,2,3 227.1  213.0  Other 29.3 5.6  348.3  310.6 1.

Decommissioning In certain circumstances, the Group has an obligation to dismantle and remove an asset and to restore the site on which it is located. The present  value of the estimated costs of dismantling and removing the asset and restoring the site on which it is located are recognised as a depreciable  asset with a corresponding provision being raised where a legal or constructive obligation exists. At each reporting date, the liability is remeasured in line with changes in discount rates, timing and estimated cash flows. Any changes in the  liability are added to or deducted from the related asset, other than the unwinding of the discount which is recognised as a finance cost. Environmental As a result of historical and current operations, certain sites owned or used by the Group will require future remediation activities to address  environmental contamination. Estimated costs for the remediation of soil, groundwater and untreated waste are recognised as a provision when:  •	 There is a present legal or constructive obligation to remediate •	 A probable outflow of economic resources will occur to undertake the remediation, and  •	 The associated costs can be reliably estimated.  Where future expenditure is expected to meet the recognition and measurement criteria of an asset (as described in Note 7), a provision is  recognised only to the extent of the performance of the obligation (i.e. when costs are incurred by the Group). Where the cost relates to the enhancement of land which is expected to be sold (e.g. where the Group no longer has ongoing operations),   then the costs are assessed for recognition as an asset taking into consideration the nature and extent of the activities and also the expected sales  proceeds compared to the sum of the current book value of the land and the estimated total costs. Any costs which result in the total carrying  value exceeding the expected proceeds on sale are expensed. The amount of each provision reflects the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle each respective obligation having regard to a range  of potential scenarios, input from subject matter experts on appropriate remediation techniques and relevant technological advances.

The Group  considers that a constructive obligation exists where there is a current risk to human health or the environment arising from environmental  contamination; or where an expectation has been established with a third party (including regulators, employees, neighbours or other  stakeholders) that remediation activities will be undertaken.  Where an obligation (legal or constructive) exists, further judgement is necessary to determine the future expenditure required to settle  the obligation. This is due to uncertainties in assumptions regarding the nature or extent of the contamination, the nature of the remedial  solution deployed and its effectiveness, the application of relevant laws or regulations and the information available at certain locations  where Orica no longer controls the site. Changes in these assumptions may impact future reported provisions. Subject to those factors and  taking into consideration experience gained to date regarding environmental matters of a similar nature, Orica considers that the provision  balances are appropriate based on currently available information. Changes in the assumptions noted above may result in costs incurred   in future periods being greater than or less than amounts provided. Environmental provisions are reviewed bi-annually taking into account any material changes to facts or circumstances which would be  expected to impact the valuation of the provision. Botany groundwater remediation Orica’s historical operations at the Botany Industrial Park resulted in contamination of the soil and groundwater. Due to the complex nature  of the chemicals involved and its distribution e.g. Dense Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid (DNAPL), the lack of known practical remediation  approaches and the unknown scale of the contamination, a practical solution to completely remediate the contamination has not been  found. Orica continues to work in close cooperation with the New South Wales (NSW) Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) to address  the contamination. Orica has a current obligation to contain and mitigate the effects of the contamination on the groundwater at the site. Orica and the NSW  EPA entered into a Voluntary Management Proposal to contain groundwater contamination while an effective remediation approach to the  DNAPL source contamination is identified (refer to contingent environmental liabilities section below).  Our analysis indicates that the cessation of groundwater extraction using the groundwater treatment plant is possible by 2036. After this  period, Orica anticipates that the contamination levels will be materially below current levels and will be able to be managed through  natural attenuation or less intensive technologies. Contingent environmental liabilities  In addition to the obligations for which an environmental provision has been recognised, certain sites may require future remediation  activities to address environmental contamination.  Where the criteria for recognition of a provision are not met, a contingent liability may exist in the following circumstances: •	 Sites where known contamination exists but does not pose a current threat to human health or the environment and there is no current  legal or regulatory requirement to remediate. Orica has a possible obligation for remediation which may be confirmed by future events  and the likelihood of a future outflow of resources is not remote, or •	 Sites where contamination is known or likely to exist and it is probable that a future outflow of resources will occur, however the  financial impact cannot be reliably measured due to uncertainties related to the extent of Orica’s remediation obligations or the  remediation techniques that may be utilised.  Any costs associated with these matters are expensed as incurred. Information regarding each class of contingent liability is set out below. Annual Report 2024 80  ===== PAGE 83 ===== NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 6.  Provisions (continued) Botany – remediation of source contamination  Specifically related to the remediation of DNAPL source contamination a reliable estimate of the costs to complete remediation is not  possible given the lack of proven remediation techniques that can be effectively deployed at the site and uncertainty of the scale of the  DNAPL contamination.  Other sites Contingent liabilities exist with respect to a number of other sites owned or used by Orica where future remediation may be required and  possible obligations exist. Orica’s obligations with respect to these sites will be confirmed by future events and are subject to the following  uncertainties regarding the amount and timing of future outflows: •	 Orica’s future decisions regarding the use of the site including the timing of any changes to the current use •	 The requirements of laws and regulations at an unknown future point in time and the outcome of discussions with regulators   at that time •	 The nature and extent of environmental remediation required at a future point in time, and •	 The availability and determination of solutions to address identified environmental issues and the cost and duration of the   method selected. Depending on the outcome of these factors, Orica may be required to incur expenditure to prevent or remediate environmental  contamination. Due to the uncertainties described above, it is not practicable to estimate the financial effect of the possible   future outflows.  7.

Recognition and Measurement Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is directly  attributable to the acquisition of the item and includes capitalised interest. Subsequent costs are capitalised only when it is probable that   future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The right of use asset at initial recognition reflects the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made before the commencement date  plus any make good obligations and initial direct costs incurred (refer to note 3). The leases recognised by the Group under AASB 16 Leases  predominantly relate to property leases including offices and storage together with plant and equipment leases including vehicles and rail cars. Accounting judgements and estimates Management reviews the appropriateness of useful lives of assets at least annually. Any adjustments to useful lives may impact future  depreciation rates and asset carrying values. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis using the following useful lives: Owned assets Right of use assets – leased Land Indefinite 1 to 70 years Buildings and improvements 25 to 40 years 1 to 20 years Machinery, plant and equipment 3 to 40 years 1 to 15 years 7.

Orica Limited Annual Report 2024 83 Overview Our Business Our Performance Financial Performance Remuneration Report Directors’ Report Financial Report Shareholder Information  ===== PAGE 86 ===== NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 8.  Intangible assets (continued) Identifiable intangibles Software and product development costs are capitalised only if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically   and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete  development and to use or sell the asset. Otherwise, they are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition,  development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Identifiable intangible  assets with a finite life are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful life to the Group, being up to thirty years. Expenditure   on intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits of the specific asset to which it relates and which the  Group controls (therefore excluding Software as a Service). All other expenditure is expensed as incurred. Accounting judgements and estimates Management reviews the appropriateness of useful lives of intangible assets at least annually, any changes to useful lives may affect  prospective amortisation rates and asset carrying values. 9.  Impairment testing of assets Recognition and measurement Methodology Formal impairment tests are carried out annually for goodwill. In addition, formal impairment tests for all non-financial assets are performed  when there is an indication of impairment. The Group conducts an internal review of asset values at each reporting period, which is used as   a source of information to assess for any indications of impairment. External factors, such as changes in expected future prices, costs and other  market factors, are also monitored to assess for indications of impairment. If any such indication exists, an estimate of the asset’s recoverable  amount is calculated.  The recoverable amount is determined using the higher of value in use or fair value less costs to dispose. Value in use is the present value of  the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continued use of the asset in its present form and its eventual disposal. Value in  use is determined by applying assumptions specific to the Group’s continued use and does not consider future development. The value in use  calculations use cash flow projections which do not exceed five years based on actual operating results and the operating budgets approved   by the Board of Directors. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated in the table below.  Growth rates are specific to individual cash-generating units (CGUs) and reflect expected future market and economic conditions. Fair value   less costs to dispose is the value that would be received in exchange for an asset in an orderly transaction.  The discount rates applied to the post-tax cash flows are derived using the weighted average cost of capital methodology. Adjustments to the  rates are made for any risks that are not reflected in the underlying cash flows, including country risk. The terminal growth rate was determined  based on management’s estimate of the long-term compound annual EBIT growth rate.  In testing for indications of impairment and performing impairment calculations, assets are considered as collective groups and referred to  as CGUs. CGUs are the smallest identifiable group of assets, liabilities and associated goodwill that generate cash inflows that are largely  independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets with each CGU being no larger than a segment. CGUs to which goodwill  has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is  monitored for internal reporting purposes. The test of goodwill and its impairment is undertaken at the reportable segment level, except   for the Pilbara CGU which contains the joint operation with Yara International ASA Group. The capital outflows required to meet the Group’s 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target have been incorporated into the cash   flows. As part of the Group’s FY2024 Climate Action Report (CAR) and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reporting,   an assessment of climate-related risks and scenario analysis was performed but did not identify a risk of impairment at this time. As the Group’s  financial and non-financial reporting develops and quantitative analysis is performed, financial implications will continue to be considered and  built into future cash flow assumptions.  If there is an indicator that a previously recognised impairment loss no longer exists or has decreased, recoverable amount of the relevant asset  or CGU is estimated. If there has been a change in the estimates used to determine an asset’s recoverable amount since an impairment loss was  recognised, the carrying value of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount (limited to the amount that would have been determined,   net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years).  Any reversal is recognised in the consolidated income statement with an adjustment to depreciation in future periods to allocate the asset’s  revised carrying value, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life. The Group does not reverse impairments  recognised for goodwill.

The recoverable amount of the Latin America cash generating unit was based on a value in use model. The key  assumptions underlying the value in use calculations are as follows: •	 Growth in post-tax cashflows of $25.0 million from FY25 to FY29. This is reliant on achieving future growth in earnings primarily due   to delivery of new technologies and value add services and growth in future facing commodities. •	 A weighted average terminal growth in line with local country economic forecasts of 2.6%. •	 A weighted average post-tax discount rate of 9.6%. Management has identified that a reasonably possible change in the growth in post-tax cash flows of $11.2 million across the forecast  period could, in the absence of other factors, cause the carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.

Managing  Financial Risks Orica’s Review of Operations and Financial Performance highlights  funding and other treasury matters as material business risks that could  adversely affect the achievement of future business performance.  This section discusses the principal market and other financial risks the  Group is exposed to and the risk management program, which seeks  to mitigate these risks and reduce the volatility of Orica’s financial  performance. 10.  Financial risk management Financial risk factors Financial risk management is carried out centrally by the Group’s Treasury function under policies approved by the Board. The Group’s principal financial risks are associated with: •	 Interest rate risk (note 10a) •	 Foreign exchange risk (note 10b) •	 Commodity pricing risk (note 10c) •	 Credit risk (note 10d), and •	 Liquidity risk (note 10e). (a)  Interest rate risk Interest rate risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial instrument or cash flows associated with the instrument will fluctuate due   to changes in market interest rates.  The Group is primarily exposed to interest rate risk on outstanding interest bearing liabilities. Non-derivative interest bearing assets are  predominantly short-term liquid assets. Interest bearing liabilities issued at fixed rates expose the Group to a fair value interest rate risk while  borrowings issued at a variable rate give rise to a cash flow interest rate risk.  Interest rate risk on long-term interest bearing liabilities is managed by adjusting the ratio of fixed interest debt to variable interest debt. This  is managed within policies determined by the Board via the use of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps. As at September  2024, fixed rate borrowings after the impact of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps were $1,443.6 million (2023: $1,305.0 million),  representing a fixed/floating split of 66 per cent and 34 per cent respectively (2023: 63 per cent and 37 per cent). Interest rate sensitivity A 10 per cent movement in interest rates without management intervention would have a $5.7 million (2023: $4.0 million) impact on profit  before tax and a $3.8 million (2023: $3.4 million) impact on shareholders’ equity. (b)  Foreign exchange risk (i)  Foreign exchange risk – transaction Foreign exchange risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial commitment, recognised asset, liability or cash flow will fluctuate due to  changes in foreign currency rates. The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk due to foreign currency cash, borrowings and sales and/or purchases denominated, either directly  or indirectly, in currencies other than the functional currencies of the Group’s subsidiaries.  Foreign exchange risk on foreign currency borrowings is managed using cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.   As at September 2024, the notional balance of derivative contracts hedging foreign currency debt was $893.8 million (2023: $1,197.8 million).  In regard to foreign currency risk relating to sales and purchases, the Group may hedge up to 100 per cent of committed exposures utilising a  declining percentage over time methodology. Only exposures that can be forecast to a high probability are hedged. Transactions can be hedged  for up to five years. The derivative instruments used for hedging purchase and sale exposures are bought vanilla option contracts and forward  exchange contracts. Forward exchange contracts may be used only under Board policy for committed exposures and anticipated exposures  expected to occur within 12 months. Bought vanilla option contracts may be used for all exposures. These contracts are designated as cash flow  hedges and are recognised at their fair value.  At reporting date, Orica held foreign exchange contracts with a fair value loss of $16.1 million (2023: fair value loss of $0.8 million)  predominately related to hedging of intercompany loans.

Derivative contracts to hedge earnings exposures do not qualify for hedge accounting under Australian Accounting  Standards. Board approved policy allows hedging of this exposure in order to reduce the volatility of full year earnings resulting from changes   in exchange rates. At reporting date, Orica held no derivative contracts to hedge earnings exposures (2023: nil). Foreign currency net investment translation risk arises as a result of translating the balance sheet of foreign operations from functional currency  into AUD. Hedging of foreign investment exposures is undertaken primarily through originating debt in the functional currency of the foreign  operation, or by raising debt in a different currency and swapping the debt to the currency of the foreign operation using derivative financial  instruments. The remaining translation exposure is managed, where considered appropriate, using forward foreign exchange contracts, or   cross currency interest rate swaps. As at reporting date, 22.5 per cent of the Group’s net investment in foreign operations was hedged (2023:  21.2 per cent).

Natural gas and ammonia are the primary feedstocks in Orica’s production process. Orica manages its contract portfolio so that on a mass  balance basis it seeks to maintain a low risk position across the contract cycle such that material input cost variations are passed through   to customers in price variations through rise and fall adjustments contained in all significant contracts. The Group may enter into derivative contracts to hedge commodities pricing risk that is not eliminated via contractual or other commercial  arrangements. In FY2022, Orica executed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) to source renewable energy for Kooragang Island for 10 years  commencing FY2025. At reporting date, the fair value of the PPA was $18.2 million loss (2023: $2.8 million loss). The following table summarises the impact of changes to the key unobservable inputs on the fair value of the PPA for 2024: Key unobservable inputs Range of inputs Relationship of key unobservable inputs to fair value Forward electricity price +/-20% A change in the electricity price by +/-20% would increase/decrease   the fair value by $8.9 million. (d)  Credit risk Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognised if counterparties failed to meet their obligations under a contract or arrangement.   The Group is exposed to credit risk from trade and other receivables and financial instrument contracts.  The credit-worthiness of customers is reviewed prior to granting credit, using trade references and credit reference agencies. Credit limits are  established and monitored for each customer, and these limits represent the highest level of exposure that a customer can reach. Trade credit  insurance may be purchased when required. The Group manages bank counterparty risk by ensuring that actual and potential exposure is monitored daily against counterparty credit limits,  which have been assigned based on counterparty credit ratings. The Group does not hold any credit derivatives to offset its credit exposures.  Orica’s maximum exposure to credit risk as at 30 September is the carrying amount, net of impairment, of the financial assets as detailed   in the table below: Financial assets 2024 $m 2023 $m Cash and cash equivalents 580.7 1,152.1 Derivative assets 15.3 50.4 Trade and other receivables 996.1 964.4 Total 1,592.1 2,166.9 (e)  Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that there will be insufficient funds available to make payment as and when required.  The Group manages this risk via: •	 Maintaining an adequate level of undrawn committed facilities in various currencies that can be drawn upon at short notice •	 Using instruments that are readily tradeable in the financial markets •	 Monitoring duration of long-term debt •	 Spreading, to the extent practicable, the maturity dates of long-term debt facilities, and •	 Comprehensively analysing all forecast inflows and outflows that relate to financial assets and liabilities.

These fair values are categorised into hierarchy  levels that are representative of the inputs used in measuring the fair value. Valuation method Level 1 – uses quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Level 2 – uses inputs for the asset or liability other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. Level 3 – uses valuation techniques where one or more significant inputs are based on unobservable market data. At reporting date, other assets and other liabilities on the balance sheet included an equity investment in the ASX listed company Alpha HPA  (2024: $63.8 million, 2023: $34.9 million) valued at the quoted market price and categorised as level 1, derivatives (2024: $63.1 million net  liability, 2023: $10.2 million net liability) carried at fair value and categorised as Level 2 as the inputs are observable, and a renewable electricity  PPA categorised as Level 3 as the electricity forward prices cannot be forecasted using observable market data.  Valuation techniques include, where applicable, reference to prices quoted in active markets, discounted cash flow analysis, fair value of recent  arm’s length transactions involving the same instruments or other instruments that are substantially the same, and option pricing models.  Changes in default probabilities are included in the valuation of derivatives using credit and debit valuation adjustments.   2024 2023 Derivative financial instruments Current $m Non-Current $m Current $m Non-Current $m Derivative assets         Designated as a hedge of interest-bearing liabilities  – 11.6 – 46.4 Other 3.7 – 4.0 – Total 3.7 11.6 4.0 46.4 Derivative liabilities Designated as a hedge of interest-bearing liabilities – (58.6) – (56.0) Power purchase agreements – (18.2) – (2.8) Other (19.8) – (4.7) – Total (19.8) (76.8) (4.7) (58.8) The fair values of forward exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps and other financial liabilities measured  at fair value are determined using valuation techniques which utilise data from observable markets. Assumptions are based on market conditions  existing at each balance date. The fair value is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows using an appropriate market- based yield curve, which is independently derived and representative of Orica’s cost of borrowings. The fair value of the PPA is determined using an electricity forecasting model created specifically for Orica for the valuation of the PPA, and key  inputs used include the contract strike price, forecast electricity volumes, forward NSW electricity spot prices and the credit worthiness of the  service provider. Key inputs into the model are provided by a third-party which are then reviewed by management to ensure consistency with   the industry movements.  There have been no reclassifications between Level 1 and Level 2 or changes in the valuation techniques applied the prior year.

Annual Report 2024 90  ===== PAGE 93 ===== NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 10.  Financial risk management (continued) Financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables (note 5), and trade and other payables (note 5) approximates their  carrying amount due to their short maturity.  Interest bearing liabilities excluding lease liabilities have a carrying amount of $2,198.4 million (2023: $2,075.4 million including discontinued  operations). The carrying amount of bank and other loans which are primarily short-term in nature approximates fair value. Private placement  debt which is primarily long-term in nature has a carrying amount of $1,966.6 million (2023: $2,050.0 million) and a fair value of $1,943.2  million (2023: $1,957.1 million). Fair value of private placement debt is determined as the present value of future contracted cash flows  discounted using standard valuation techniques at applicable market yields having regard to timing of cash flows. Offsetting financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet where Orica currently has a legally enforceable right   to offset the recognised amounts, and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.   No financial assets or liabilities are currently held under netting arrangements.  Orica has entered into derivative transactions under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master agreements that do not meet  the criteria for offsetting but allow for the related amounts to be set-off in certain circumstances, such as the event of default. As Orica does not  presently have a legally enforceable right of set-off, derivatives are presented on a gross basis on the balance sheet.  Derivatives and hedge accounting  The Group uses derivatives and other financial instruments to hedge its exposure to currency, interest rate and commodities pricing risk exposures  arising from operational, financing and investing activities. Where applicable, these instruments are formally designated in hedge relationships  as defined by AASB 9 Financial Instruments. To qualify for hedge accounting the Group formally designates and documents details of the hedge,  risk management objective and strategy for entering into the arrangement and methodology used for measuring effectiveness.  Hedge accounting relationships are categorised according to the nature of the risks being hedged: Hedge type Description Fair value hedge Hedges the change in fair value of recognised assets and liabilities. Cash flow hedge Hedges the exposure to variability in cash flows attributable to a particular risk associated with an asset,  liability or highly probable forecast transaction. Net investment hedge Hedges the foreign currency translation exposure of the net assets of foreign operations. Critical terms of hedging instruments and hedged items are transacted to match on a 1:1 ratio by notional values. Matching critical terms enables  economic offset thereafter to be determined qualitatively. Hedge ineffectiveness arises primarily from the counterparties’ and the Group’s own credit risk which is included in the fair value of the derivative  hedge instrument but not the hedge item. During the current and prior financial years, there was no material impact on profit or loss resulting  from hedge ineffectiveness. AASB 9 also allows certain costs of hedging to be deferred in equity. Gains or losses associated with ‘currency basis’ cost of hedging are deferred  in the cash flow hedge reserve as they are not material for separate disclosure. The amounts are systematically released to the income statement  to align with the hedged exposure. Effects of hedge accounting on financial position and performance  Fair value and cash flow hedges The table below shows the carrying amounts of the Group’s private placement debt and the derivatives which are designated in fair value and/or  cash flow hedge relationships to hedge them: •	 The carrying amount of the private placement debt includes foreign exchange remeasurements to year end rates and fair value adjustments  when included in a fair value hedge •	 The breakdown of the hedging derivatives includes remeasurement of foreign currency notional values at year end rates, fair value movements  due to interest rate risk, foreign currency cash flows designated into cash flow hedges, costs of hedging recognised in other comprehensive  income and ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement, and •	 Hedged value represents the carrying amount of the private placement debt adjusted for the carrying amount of the designated derivatives.

During the period movements in the hedging instruments of $74.7 million gain   (2023: $8.6 million loss) were recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve, with no ineffectiveness (2023: nil) recognised in the   income statement. Annual Report 2024 92  ===== PAGE 95 ===== NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 10.  Financial risk management (continued) Derivatives and hedge accounting – material accounting policies Valuation: Derivatives are measured at fair value at inception, and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. Fair value hedges Cash flow hedges Net investment hedges Gains or losses  on fair value  movements of the  financial instrument Recognised within financing costs  in the income statement, together  with gains or losses in relation to  the hedged item attributable to the  risk being hedged. The effective portion is recognised  in other comprehensive income.  The ineffective portion is  recognised immediately within  financing costs in the income  statement. The effective portion is recognised  in the foreign currency translation  reserve in equity. The ineffective  portion is recognised immediately  in the income statement. Discontinuation of  hedge accounting The cumulative gain or loss that  has been recorded to the carrying  amount of the hedged item is  amortised to the income statement  using the effective interest method. When a hedging instrument expires  or is sold, terminated or exercised,  or the entity revokes designation  of the hedge relationship but the  hedged forecast transaction is still  expected to occur, the cumulative  gain or loss at that point remains  in equity. If the forecast transaction  is no longer forecast to occur,  the cumulative gain or loss is  transferred immediately to the  income statement. Amounts remain deferred in the  foreign currency translation reserve  and are subsequently recognised   in the income statement in   the event of disposal of the   foreign operation. Derivatives not in a designated hedge arrangement Financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting but remain economically effective, are accounted for as trading instruments.   As at 30 September 2024 the Group has entered into a 10 year power-purchase agreement (PPA) commencing January 2025 and due to expire   in December 2035. The PPA is a contract for difference (CfD) derivative financial instrument classified as non-current on the balance sheet.   All other derivatives not in a designated hedge arrangement are classified as current on the balance sheet. All derivatives not in a designated  hedge arrangement are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised within raw materials and inventories in the income  statement. The Group policy is to not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative purposes.

Taxation This section outlines the taxes paid by Orica and the impact tax has on   the financial statements. Orica has operations in more than 45 countries,  with customers in more than 100 countries. In 2024, Orica paid  $282.2 million (2023: $252.7 million) globally in corporate taxes  and payroll taxes. Orica collected and remitted $136.6 million (2023:  $157.1 million) globally in GST/VAT. As Orica operates in a number of  countries around the world, it is subject to local tax rules in each of those  countries. Orica’s tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of profits  earned in different countries with different tax rates, as tax will be due   in the country where the profits are earned. Many of the jurisdictions  Orica has operations in have headline tax rates lower than 30 per cent. 11.  Taxation (a)  Income tax expense recognised in the income statement Consolidated 2024  $m 2023  $m Income tax expense 	 Current year  125.9  195.6  	 Deferred tax  65.9  (70.0) 	 (Over)/under provided in prior years  (2.9) 6.2  Total income tax expense in income statement 188.9  131.8  (b)  Reconciliation of income tax expense to prima facie tax payable Consolidated 2024  $m 2023  $m Income tax expense attributable to profit before individually significant items Profit from operations before individually significant items 628.4  554.4  Prima facie income tax expense calculated at 30% on profit 188.5  166.3  Tax effect of items which (decrease)/increase tax expense: 	 variation in tax rates of foreign controlled entities (11.4) (4.4) 	 tax (over)/under provided in prior years (2.9) 6.2  	 non-allowable interest deductions 0.7  5.8  	 non-creditable withholding taxes 10.5  8.0  	 recognition of previously unbooked temporary differences – (11.8) 	 utilisation/(recognition) of unbooked prior year tax losses 2.3  (9.6) 	 other (2.9) 5.7  Income tax expense attributable to profit before individually significant items  184.8  166.2  Income tax expense/(benefit) attributable to individually significant items  Profit/(loss) from individually significant items  119.3  (171.2) Prima facie income tax expense/(benefit) calculated at 30% on individually significant items  35.8  (51.4) Tax effect of items which increase/(decrease) tax expense: 	 variation in tax rates of foreign controlled entities 0.8  – 	 profit on sale of Deer Park Stage 1 surplus land (46.1) – 	 profit on sale of Yarraville land (5.3) – 	 Axis Group acquisition earnout (8.0) 8.0  	 restructuring expense 14.5  – 	 business acquisition costs 12.4  – 	 loss on sale of Türkiye businesses – 21.2  	 loss on exit of Venezuela business – (12.2) Income tax expense/(benefit) attributable to gain/(loss) on individually significant items  4.1  (34.4) Income tax expense reported in the income statement 188.9  131.8 Annual Report 2024 94  ===== PAGE 97 ===== NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 11.  Taxation (continued) (c)  Income tax recognised in equity Consolidated 2024 2023 Before tax  $m Tax  (expense)/ benefit  $m Net of tax  $m Before tax  $m Tax  (expense)/ benefit  $m Net of tax  $m Exchange (loss)/gain on translation of  foreign operations (401.6) 7.1  (394.5) 75.6  16.3  91.9  Net gain/(loss) on hedge of net investments  in foreign subsidiaries 74.7  (22.4) 52.3  (8.6) 2.6  (6.0) Cash flow hedges  –  Effective portion of changes in fair value 4.0  (1.2) 2.8  20.9  (6.3) 14.6  –  Transferred to income statement – – – (35.7) 10.7  (25.0) Changes in the fair value of financial assets  through other comprehensive income 17.9  (9.9) 8.0  15.0  – 15.0  Net actuarial (loss)/gain on defined   benefit obligations (3.7) 0.4  (3.3) 1.1  (0.5) 0.6  Recognised in comprehensive income (308.7) (26.0) (334.7) 68.3  22.8  91.1 (d)  Recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities Consolidated Balance sheet Income statement 2024  $m 2023  Restated1  $m 2024  $m 2023  Restated1  $m Deferred tax assets Trade and other receivables 16.7  27.3  10.9  (1.7) Inventories 22.3  31.4  9.3  5.9  Property plant and equipment 70.6  51.8  (7.8) (0.8) Intangible assets 39.3  51.9  21.4  15.9  Trade and other payables 18.6  73.6  41.8  (23.1) Interest bearing liabilities 78.6  29.1  (35.4) (35.2) Provision for employee entitlements 38.1  34.8  (3.2) (3.5) Provision for retirement benefit obligations 4.5  9.6  5.5  3.2  Provision for environmental and decommissioning 89.1  75.1  (14.1) 8.7  Provision for other 19.3  15.1  (4.1) (9.7) Tax losses 163.0  156.8  9.1  (13.1) Other items 4.1  2.6  (1.6) (8.3) Deferred tax assets  564.2  559.1  Less set-off against deferred tax liabilities (194.3) (126.1) Net deferred tax assets  369.9 433.0  1.

Recognition and measurement Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax and is recognised in the income statement.  Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year using tax rates applicable at the reporting date, and any  adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.  Deferred tax balances are determined by calculating temporary differences based on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial  reporting purposes and their amounts for taxation purposes. Where amounts are recognised directly in equity the corresponding tax impact is  also recognised directly in equity.  The amount of deferred tax recognised is based on the expected manner of realisation of the asset or settlement of the liability, using tax rates  enacted or substantively enacted at reporting date.  A deferred tax asset will be recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset  can be utilised. Deferred tax assets will be reduced to the extent it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.  Tax consolidation Orica Limited is the parent entity in the tax consolidated group comprising all wholly-owned Australian entities. Due to the existence of a tax sharing agreement between the entities in the tax consolidated group, the parent entity recognises the tax effects  of its own transactions and the current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and unused tax credits assumed  from the subsidiary entities. Annual Report 2024 96  ===== PAGE 99 ===== NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 11.  Taxation (continued) Critical accounting judgements and estimates The Group is subject to income taxes in Australia and jurisdictions where it has foreign operations and is subject to periodic challenges  by local tax authorities on a range of tax matters during the normal course of business. These include transfer pricing, indirect taxes and  transaction-related issues. Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many  transactions and calculations undertaken during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities for tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of  these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax provision  in the period in which such determination is made. In addition, deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future  taxable profits are available to utilise those temporary differences and losses, and the tax losses continue to be available having regard to  the nature and timing of their origination and compliance with the relevant tax legislation associated with their recoupment. Assumptions are also made about the application of income tax legislation. These assumptions are subject to risk and uncertainty and  there is a possibility that changes in circumstances or differences in opinions will alter outcomes which may impact the amount of  deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities recorded on the Balance Sheet and the amount of tax losses and timing differences not yet  recognised. In these circumstances, the carrying amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change, resulting in an impact on the  earnings of the Group. Contingent tax liabilities In the normal course of business, contingent liabilities may arise from tax investigations or legal proceedings. Where management are of  the view that potential liabilities have a low probability of crystallising or it is not possible to quantify them reliably, they are not provided  for and are disclosed as contingent liabilities. Consistent with other companies of the size and diversity of Orica, the Group is the subject of ongoing information requests, investigations  and audit activities by tax and regulatory authorities in jurisdictions in which Orica operates. Orica co-operates fully with the tax and  regulatory authorities. It is possible that Orica may incur fines and/or other penalties as a consequence of these investigations and audits. Brazilian tax matters 1.	 The Brazilian Taxation Authority (BTA) is claiming unpaid taxes, interest and penalties of approximately $31.0 million for the 1997  financial year relating to an alleged understatement of income based on an audit of production records. Orica believes BTA has  misinterpreted those production records and has received a favourable decision from the Brazilian Civil Court in relation to an excise  dispute based on the same factual matter. This decision should support the income tax dispute. 	 ICI plc, the vendor of the business to Orica, has been notified to preserve Orica’s rights under the tax indemnity obtained upon  acquisition of the business which provides indemnity for amounts exceeding certain limits. The BTA has been granted a bank  guarantee of up to approximately $31.0 million.  2.	 The BTA has issued Orica Brasil LTDA assessments for unpaid ICMS (Brazilian Value Added Tax), interest and penalties of approximately  $34.0 million for the 2018 to 2022 financial years relating to goods supplied to a customer alleging a misclassification of the goods.  The BTA is yet to issue assessments for the 2015-2017 and 2023-2024 financial years which, if received, may increase the overall  amount to approximately $63.0 million. Orica Brasil LTDA does not agree with the BTA’s assessment and classification and is currently  disputing the matter in the Brazilian courts. If the BTA is ultimately successful, Orica has reasonable grounds to seek recovery from   the customer for any amount that is finally found by the Brazilian courts to be payable to the BTA. Orica Limited Annual Report 2024 97 Overview Our Business Our Performance Financial Performance Remuneration Report Directors’ Report Financial Report Shareholder Information  ===== PAGE 100 ===== NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) Section F. Group  Structure Orica has a wide range of global operations, including controlled  entities incorporated in over 45 countries, together with strategic  partnering arrangements with third parties. This section highlights   the Group structure. 12.  Investments in controlled entities Recognition and measurement The consolidated financial statements are prepared by combining the financial statements of all entities that comprise the Group, being the  Company (the parent entity) and its subsidiaries as defined in AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements. On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess  of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.  When the Group relinquishes control over a subsidiary, it derecognises its share of net assets. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit   or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.  The consolidated financial statements include information and results of each subsidiary from the date on which the Company obtains control  until such time as the Company ceases to control such entity. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, all intercompany balances,  transactions and unrealised profits arising within the Group are eliminated in full. Refer to note 23 for the list of investments in controlled entities. 13.  Equity accounted investees and joint operations (a)  Investments accounted for using the equity method The table below shows material investments (based on carrying values).

An associate exists where Orica holds an interest in the equity of an entity, generally of between 20 per cent and 50 per cent, and is able to  significantly influence the decisions of the entity. A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control. Joint operations A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets and obligations  for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. Orica recognises its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses   in the consolidated financial statements under applicable headings. 14.  Businesses and non-controlling interests acquired Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group, in accordance with AASB 3  Business Combinations. On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the   date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.   The transaction costs are expensed in the income statement. Consolidated – 2024 Acquisitions of business and controlled entities Terra Insights Group acquisition On 29 February 2024, the Group acquired 100 per cent of the shares of Terra Insights, a leading end-to-end sensors, software and data delivery  technology platform for geotechnical, structural and geospatial monitoring in mining and infrastructure.

Goodwill on the purchase of Cyanco is attributable to the synergies expected to be achieved from business integration, together with the  advantageous location servicing the North America gold markets. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The disclosure above is based on provisional accounting. Accounting standards permit a measurement period of up to one year to finalise  acquisition accounting.  Deal contingent foreign exchange forward contracts were taken out to hedge the purchase price of both acquisitions. The cost of $5.7 million   is recognised within financial expenses. Acquisition-related costs of $41.3 million that were not directly attributable to the issue of shares are included in the income statement   as a significant item and in operating cash flows in the statement of cash flows.  Consolidated – 2023 Acquisitions of business and controlled entities On 3 October 2022, the Group acquired 100 per cent of the shares of Axis Group, who designs, develops and manufactures specialised  geospatial tools and instruments for the mining industry. The purchase price comprises $255.8 million paid on completion and potential earn  out payments of up to $90.0 million based on the achievement of cumulative EBITDA generated from 1 October 2022 to 31 December 2024,  and contingent on certain key management remaining employed by Orica during the earn-out period.

Acquisition-related costs of $6.5 million that were not directly attributable to the issue of shares are included in the income statement and in  operating cash flows in the statement of cash flows. On 22 June 2023, the Group acquired the operations of two ammonium nitrate emulsion plants and associated assets in Blackwater, Queensland  and Gunnedah, New South Wales. The purchase price comprises $19.6 million paid on completion and an additional amount up to $2.5 million  payable within 24 months from completion. There was no goodwill associated with the transaction. In August 2023, the Group acquired an additional 0.01 per cent of Exsa, for the consideration of $0.02 million. The ownership at 30 September 2023  is 100 per cent. Critical accounting judgements and estimates Accounting for acquisitions is inherently complex and requires a number of judgements and estimates. Management judgement is required  to determine the fair value of identified assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations. A number of judgements have been made  in relation to the identification of fair values attributable to separately identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. The determination of fair  values requires the use of valuation techniques based on assumptions including future cash flows, revenue growth, margins, performance  and weighted-average cost of capital. 15.  Businesses disposed and discontinued operations Businesses disposed – 2024 The Group has not disposed of any businesses or entities in the current year. Businesses disposed – 2023 On 10 November 2022 Orica completed the sale of Orica Nitro Patlayici Maddeler Sanayi ve Ticaret Anonim Sirketi and GeoNitro Limited (Türkiye  businesses), for a consideration of $19.0 million. Orica recorded a loss on sale before tax of $73.5 million which included a loss of $92.5 million  relating to the release of the foreign currency translation reserve as required by Australian Accounting Standards. $45.1 million of the net loss   on sale was attributable to non-controlling interests.

For each defined benefit scheme, the cost of providing retirement benefits is expensed in the income statement so as to recognise current and  past service costs, interest cost on net liabilities, and the effect of any curtailments or settlements. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in  other comprehensive income. The Group’s net liabilities in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the future benefit  employees have earned, less the fair value of any plan assets (subject to any restrictions placed).  (a)  Defined benefit pension plans The Group participates in several Australian and overseas defined benefit post-employment plans that provide benefits to employees upon  retirement. Plan funding is carried out in accordance with the requirements of trust deeds and the advice of actuaries. Information within   these financial statements has been prepared by the local plan external actuaries. Orica were assisted by Willis Towers Watson to consolidate  those results globally. During the year, the Group made employer contributions of $20.4 million (2023: $24.8 million) to defined benefit plans.

The weighted averages for those assumptions and related sensitivity information are presented below. Sensitivity information indicates by   how much the defined benefit obligations would increase or decrease if a given assumption were to increase or decrease with no change   in other assumptions. Weighted average of  assumptions used p.a.

A change of one year in the expected age of death would result in an $12.3 million movement in the defined benefit  obligation at 30 September 2024. Accounting judgements and estimates The defined benefit obligation costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries, however require the  exercise of judgement in relation to assumptions for future salary and superannuation increases, long-term price inflation and bond rates.  Whilst management believes the assumptions used are appropriate, a change in the assumptions used may impact the earnings and equity  of the Group. Annual Report 2024 108  ===== PAGE 111 ===== NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) Section H. Other  Disclosures This section includes additional financial information that is required   by Australian Accounting Standards and which management considers  to be relevant information for shareholders. 20.  Contingent liabilities Contingent liabilities relating to environmental uncertainties are disclosed in note 6 and those relating to taxation in note 11. All others are  disclosed below. (a)  Guarantees, indemnities and warranties •	 The Group has entered into various long-term supply contracts. For some contracts, minimum charges are payable regardless of the level   of operations, but the levels of operations are expected to remain above those that would trigger minimum payments. •	 There are guarantees relating to certain leases of property, plant and equipment and other agreements arising in the ordinary course   of business. •	 Contracts of sale covering companies and assets which were divested during the current and prior years include commercial warranties   and indemnities to the purchasers. (b)  Legal, claims and other There are a number of legal claims and exposures which arise from the ordinary course of business. Where there is material uncertainty as   to whether a future liability will arise in respect of these items, no amounts have been disclosed. Management have concluded that any   potential liabilities over and above those already provided for in the financial statements would not have a material effect on the Group’s   financial performance. Accounting judgements and estimates Where management are of the view that potential liabilities that arise in the normal course of business have a low probability of  crystallising or it is not possible to quantify them reliably, they are not provided for and are disclosed as contingent liabilities. Legal proceedings The outcome of currently pending and future legal, judicial, regulatory, administrative and other proceedings of a litigious nature  (Proceedings) cannot be predicted with certainty. Proceedings can raise complex legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties  including, but not limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case, issues regarding the jurisdiction in which each Proceeding  is brought and differences in applicable law. Thus, an adverse decision in Proceedings could result in additional costs that are not covered,  either wholly or partially, under insurance policies and that could significantly impact the business and results of operations of the Group.  Therefore, it is possible that the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Group could be materially affected by an  unfavourable outcome of those Proceedings. Proceedings are evaluated on a case-by-case basis considering the available information,  including that from legal counsel, to assess potential outcomes. Warranties and Indemnities In the course of acquisitions and disposals of businesses and assets, Orica routinely negotiates warranties and indemnities across a range of  commercial issues and risks, including environmental risks associated with real property. Management uses the information available and  exercises judgement in the overall context of these transactions, in determining the scope and extent of these warranties and indemnities.  In assessing Orica’s financial position, management relies on warranties and indemnities received, and considers potential exposures  on warranties and indemnities provided. It is possible that the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Group  could be materially affected if circumstances arise where warranties and indemnities received are not honoured, or for those provided,  circumstances change adversely.

Critical accounting judgements and estimates The determination of tax residency involves judgement as there are different interpretations that could be adopted and which could give  rise to a different conclusion on residency. In determining tax residency, the Group has applied the following interpretations: Australian tax residency The Group has applied current legislation and judicial precedent, including having regard to the Commissioner of Taxation’s public  guidance in Tax Ruling TR 2018/5. Foreign tax residency  The Group has applied current legislation, relevant tax authority guidance and judicial precedent in the determination of foreign   tax residency. Partnerships and trusts Australian tax law does not contain specific residency tests for partnerships and trusts. Generally, these entities are taxed on a   flow-through basis so there is no need for a general residence test. There are some provisions which treat trusts and partnerships   as residents for certain purposes, but this does not mean the entities are subject to tax. Additional disclosures on the tax status of partnerships and trusts have been provided where relevant. Branches (permanent establishments) Foreign branches of subsidiaries are not separate legal entities and therefore do not have a separate residency for tax purposes. Generally,   the subsidiary that the branch is a part of will be the relevant tax resident, rather than the branch operations. Additional disclosures on the tax status of subsidiaries having a foreign branch with a taxable presence in that jurisdiction have been  provided where relevant.

Independent Auditor’s Report    To the shareholders of Orica Limited  Report on the audit of the Financial Report    Opinion  We have audited the Financial Report of Orica  Limited (the Company).  In our opinion, the accompanying Financial Report of  the Company gives a true and fair view, including of  the Group’s financial position as at 30 September  2024 and of its financial performance for the year then  ended, in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001,  in compliance with Australian Accounting Standards  and the Corporations Regulations 2001.  The Financial Report comprises:   • Balance Sheet as at 30 September 2024  • Income Statement, Statement of  Comprehensive Income, Statement of  Changes in Equity, and Statement of Cash  Flows for the year then ended  • Consolidated Entity Disclosure Statement and  accompanying basis of preparation as at 30  September 2024  • Notes, including material accounting policies   • Directors’ Declaration.  The Group consists of the Company and the  entities it controlled at the year end or from time  to time during the financial year.  Basis for opinion  We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. We believe that the audit  evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.  Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit  of the Financial Report section of our report.   We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical  requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for  Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the  Financial Report in Australia. We have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these  requirements.         Annual Report 2024 120  ===== PAGE 123 ===== INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (CONTINUED) Key Audit Matters  The Key Audit Matters we identified are:  • Recoverable amount of intangible assets • Environmental and decommissioning provisions and contingent liability disclosures • Acquisition accounting Key Audit Matters are those matters that, in our  professional judgement, were of most significance  in our audit of the Financial Report of the current  period.   These matters were addressed in the context of  our audit of the Financial Report as a whole, and in  forming our opinion thereon, and we do not  provide a separate opinion on these matters.  Recoverable amount of intangible assets ($2,571.9 million)  Refer to Notes 8 and 9 of the Financial Report  The key audit matter  How the matter was addressed in our audit  A key audit matter was the Group’s testing of  intangible assets for impairment given the size of  the balances (being 26.8% of total assets) and  uncertainty around forecast cash flows.   We focused on the significant forward-looking  assumptions the Group applied in the value in use  model, including:    • Forecast operating cash flows: the ongoing economic uncertainty increases the possibility of intangible assets being impaired and the risk of inaccurate forecasts or a significantly wider range of possible outcomes for us to consider. We focused on both the forecast growth for the Group and the impact of the Group’s future business plans when assessing the feasibility of the Group’s forecast cash flows. • Terminal growth rates: in addition to the uncertainties described above, the Group’s model is highly sensitive to changes in terminal growth rates. This drives additional audit effort specific to their feasibility and consistency of application having regard to the Group’s strategy. • Discount rates: these are complicated in nature and vary according to the conditions and environment the specific cash generating units (CGUs) are subject to from time to time, and the approach to incorporating risks into the cash flows or discount rates. The Group engaged an external expert to assist with the determination of the discount rates for the respective CGUs. We involved valuation specialists to supplement our  Our procedures included:  • Consideration of the appropriateness of the value  in use method applied by the Group to perform  the impairment test against the requirements of  accounting standards. • Assessing the key controls in the Group’s  impairment process, including Board approval of  budgets and review and approval of the  impairment assessment, including cash flow  forecasts, by examining the review and approval  of information by the Board. • Assessing the integrity of the value in use model  used, including the accuracy of the underlying  calculation formulas. • Comparing the forecast cash flows contained in  the value in use model to the operating budgets  approved by the Board. • Comparing the Group’s cumulative value in use  to the Group’s market capitalisation to inform our  evaluation of the current forecasts incorporated  in the model. • Assessing the accuracy of previous Group cash  flow forecasts for the respective CGUs to inform  our evaluation of current forecasts incorporated  in the model. • Assessing the scope, competence and  objectivity of the Group’s external expert  engaged to assist with the determination of the  discount rates for the respective CGUs. • Working with our valuation specialists, we: Orica Limited Annual Report 2024 121 Overview Our Business Our Performance Financial Performance Remuneration Report Directors’ Report Financial Report Shareholder Information  ===== PAGE 124 ===== INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (CONTINUED) senior audit team members in assessing this key  audit matter.  • assessed the forecast cash flows by comparing the implicit earnings and asset multiples from the model to corresponding multiples of comparable entities; • independently developed discount rate ranges, using publicly available market data for comparable entities, adjusted by risk factors specific to the Group and the industry it operates in. • Consideration of the sensitivity of the model by varying key assumptions such as forecast operating cash flows, terminal growth rates and discount rates, within a reasonably possible range, to identify those assumptions at higher risk of bias or inconsistency in application and to focus our procedures further. • Using our knowledge of the Group’s operations, their past performance and our industry experience, we challenged the Group’s forecast cash flows, terminal growth rate assumptions and the feasibility of future business plans. We also compared forecast growth rates to authoritative published sources, including those related to inflationary pressures and considered differences specific to the Group’s operations. • Assessing the disclosures in the Financial Report using our understanding of the matters obtained from our testing and against the requirements of accounting standards. Annual Report 2024 122  ===== PAGE 125 ===== INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (CONTINUED) Environmental and decommissioning provisions ($293.3 million) and contingent liability disclosures  Refer to Note 6 to the Financial Report  The key audit matter  How the matter was addressed in our audit  The estimation of environmental remediation and  decommissioning provisions and contingent liability  disclosures is considered a key audit matter due to  the:  • Inherent complexity associated with the Group’s estimation of remediation costs, particularly for potential contamination of ground beneath established structures and long term legacy matters impacting the Group, and in gathering persuasive audit evidence thereon. • Periodic restructuring activities undertaken by the Group, including the scheduled closure of certain manufacturing sites which give rise to heightened audit focus on the nature, timing and amount of decommissioning costs expected to be incurred by the Group. The complexity in estimating the Group’s  environmental remediation and decommissioning  provisions and reporting of contingent liability  disclosures is influenced by:    • The inherent challenges experienced by the Group in precisely determining the size and location of potential contamination beneath established structures and associated costs to be included in the provisions and/or reporting of a contingent liability in accordance with accounting standard requirements. • Current and probable environmental and regulatory requirements and the impact on completeness of remediation activities within the provision estimate, including the activities which will be acceptable to regulators. • The expected environmental remediation strategy of the Group and availability of any known techniques to remediate source contamination, in particular for treatment of Dense Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid source areas at Botany, New South Wales. • Historical experience, and its use as a reasonable predictor when evaluating forecast costs. • The expected timing of the expenditure given Our procedures included:  • Assessing key controls over the Group’s process to estimate provisions for environmental and decommissioning obligations, including the Group’s review and authorisation of cost estimates. • Assessing the scope, competence and objectivity of the Group’s internal and external experts engaged to assist in the determination of strategies to remediate contamination and the costing of remediation activities. • Testing a sample of the Group’s provisions to evaluate the accuracy of historical remediation provisions by comparing to actual expenditure. We used this knowledge to challenge the Group’s current cost estimates and to inform our procedures further. • Obtaining a sample of the Group’s quotations for remediation activities, as well as other internal and external underlying documentation for the Group’s determination of required future activities, their timing and associated cost estimates. We compared them to the nature, timing and quantum of cost contained in the provision balance. We compared the basis for recognition of the provision with the criteria in accounting standards. • Making enquiries of various personnel regarding the Group’s strategy for remediating certain source contamination and compared these for consistency with our understanding of the Group’s strategy and its impact to the provision. • Challenging the Group where provisions were unable to be made for source contamination, in particular for treatment of Dense Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid source areas at Botany, New South Wales, in relation to the existence of information which would enable a reliable estimate of the provision to be made. We compared this to our understanding of the matter and the criteria in accounting standards for recording a provision or reporting a contingent liability.

The Group uses internal and external specialists to  assist in the determination of strategies to  remediate contamination and the costing of  remediation activities.   • Testing a sample of the Group’s provision models for mathematical accuracy. • Assessing the Group’s disclosures in the Financial Report using our knowledge of the business and the requirements of accounting standards. In particular, we focused on the disclosure of uncertainties associated with the provision or exposures. Annual Report 2024 124  ===== PAGE 127 ===== INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (CONTINUED) Acquisition accounting  Refer to Note 14 of the Financial Report  The key audit matter  How the matter was addressed in our audit  The Group’s acquisition of Cyanco Intermediate 4  Corp (Cyanco) and Terra Insights (Terra) are  considered to be a key audit matter due to the:   • Size of the acquisitions having a significant  impact on the Group’s financial statements. • Judgement and complexity required  to  determine the fair values of assets acquired and  liabilities assumed in the transactions. The  Group engaged external valuation experts to  assess the fair value of certain assets. • Group’s valuation models used to determine the  fair value of acquired intangible assets is  complex and sensitive to changes in a number of  key assumptions. This drives additional audit  effort specifically on the feasibility of these key  assumptions. The key assumptions we focused  on included forecast earnings, discount rates and  terminal growth rates. We involved valuation specialists to supplement our  senior audit team members in assessing this key  audit matter.    Our procedures included:  • Evaluating the acquisition accounting by the Group against the requirements of accounting standards. • Reading the underlying transaction agreements to understand the terms of the acquisitions and nature of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. • Assessing the accuracy and measurement of the consideration paid to acquire Cyanco and Terra based on the underlying transaction agreements. • Working with our valuation specialists, we assessed the Group’s external expert reports and: • Considered the objectivity, competence and scope of the Group’s external valuation experts. • Evaluated the valuation methodologies used to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities assumed, considering accounting standard requirements and observed industry practices. • Assessed the key assumptions in the Group’s external valuation expert reports prepared in relation to the identification and valuation of customer contracts and other intangible assets, including: • Checking forecast earnings assumptions for consistency with the Group’s valuation model used as part of the acquisition process; • Comparing terminal growth rates to published studies of industry trends and expectations; Orica Limited Annual Report 2024 125 Overview Our Business Our Performance Financial Performance Remuneration Report Directors’ Report Financial Report Shareholder Information  ===== PAGE 128 ===== INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (CONTINUED)                 •  Evaluating the calculation  methodology for the discount  rates, against observed industry  practice.  •  Recalculating the goodwill balance arising as a  result of each transaction and compared it to  the goodwill amount recorded by the Group.  •  Assessing the adequacy of disclosures in the  Financial Report using our understanding  obtained from our testing and against the  requirements of accounting standards.

This includes disclosing, as applicable, matters  related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend  to liquidate the Group and Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do  so.   Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Report  Our objective is:  • to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Report as a whole is free from material  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and   • to issue an Auditor’s Report that includes our opinion.   Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in  accordance with Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,  they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the  Financial Report.

Further information may also be found at orica.com. Ammonium nitrate (AN) Ammonium nitrate is an industrial chemical commonly used in fertilisers and as a commercial  explosive for quarrying and mining. It is typically produced as small porous pellets or ‘prills’.  It is one of the world’s most widely used fertilisers and the main component in many types of  commercial explosives. In explosives, its use is critical as an oxidising agent in the explosion  reaction. Orica manufactures ammonium nitrate at our four continuous manufacturing plants and  where required, sources it from third parties across our operating regions for use in our blasting  and drilling services. Assets Assets include our operated and non‑operated assets – a set of one or more geographically  proximate operations including, open‑cut mines, underground mines, and onshore and offshore  oil and gas production and production facilities. ASX The Australian Securities Exchange (asx.com.au). Carbon In sustainability terms ‘carbon’ is interchangeable with ‘greenhouse gases’. Civil infrastructure The physical structures and systems that support a community, such as roads, bridges, water  supply networks and public buildings. Community investment Community investment includes financial contributions made to benefit communities and the  needs and activities of the people within them. CPS Cents per share. Counter-cyclical Contrary to or tending to counteract the movements in an economic cycle. For example,   gold tends to perform well during economic downturns. Employee engagement Employee engagement represents the levels of energy, enablement and engagement our  workforce has with Orica, measured through the all-employee engagement survey, ‘Our Say’. Environmental remediation Ecological or ecosystem restoration. The process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that   has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed. It is distinct from conservation (which generally  adopts preventative measures) as it is retroactive, aiming to repair already-damaged ecosystems. Environmental, social, and corporate  governance (ESG) A set of non-financial criteria and standards applied to a company’s operations that focus on  corporate responsibility and sustainability outcomes. Investors may assess their portfolios based   on ESG criteria, to identify material risks and/or growth opportunities. Emissions abatement technology Aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by using cleaner energy sources, improving efficiency  and capturing carbon dioxide. Female workforce participation The proportion of female workers relative to the total number of Orica employees. Future-facing commodities Includes commodities such as copper, nickel, lithium, cobalt, and other metals and minerals crucial  to the manufacture of low emissions technologies designed to enable the energy transition - such  as batteries for electric vehicles (e.g. nickel, lithium, cobalt), solar panels (e.g. copper, silicon) and  wind turbines (e.g. rare earth materials, copper) for renewable energy. Financial year The Orica financial year is the accounting year from 1 October to 30 September. Geographic mix Relates to the distribution of a company’s operations across various regions or countries. GHG (Greenhouse gases) Gases that absorb and re‑emit infrared radiation, thereby trapping heat in the earth’s  atmosphere. Includes carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapor, methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O),  hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulphur hexafluoride (SF6 ), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3 ).  The GHG applicable to Orica’s operations are CO2 , CH4 , and N2O. GL Gigalitre, the equivalent of one billion litres of water. Grade/Quality Any physical or chemical measurement of the characteristics of a material sample of interest. KL Kilolitre, the equivalent of one thousand litres. KPI Key performance indicator. Kt Kilotonne, the equivalent of one thousand tonnes. KtCO2‑e Kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. Loss of containment Where a contained substance escapes from containment and results in an environmental impact  on water or soil ranging in category from Severity 1 to Severity 3. Severity 1 events are minor,  reversible environmental effects with short-term impacts only, in the immediate vicinity of release  and with only minor clean-up required at a total cost of less than $100,000. Severity 2 events  have a localised and measurable environmental impact that is reversible after clean-up. Severity 3  events result in relatively wide-spread, serious environmental damage with some impairment of  ecosystem function that will recover after remediation. Low‑carbon ammonia An internal definition covering ammonium nitrate (AN) products manufactured with nitric acid  from plants utilising catalytic abatement technology eliminating at least 95 per cent of nitrous  oxide emissions, and/or a low‑carbon ammonia feedstock. Low‑carbon AN A definition covering ammonium nitrate (AN) products manufactured with nitric acid from plants  utilising catalytic abatement technology, eliminating at least 95 per cent of nitrous oxide emissions  and/or low-carbon ammonia feedstock. Annual Report 2024 132  ===== PAGE 135 ===== GLOSSARY (CONTINUED) Low‑carbon hydrogen Broad grouping for green and blue hydrogen sources. Renewable (green) hydrogen is made via  electrolysis using 100 per cent renewable energy while blue hydrogen is made using fossil fuel  feedstock (e.g. gas steam methane reforming or gasification of coal) in addition to using carbon  capture and storage to capture and sequester ~90 per cent of emissions generated. Material and materiality In the context of the International Integrated Reporting (IR) Framework, a matter is considered  material if it could substantively affect the organisation’s ability to create value in the short,  medium and/or long term. The process of determining materiality is entity-specific and based   on the relevant industry and other factors, including stakeholder perspectives. Mt The expression of one million tonnes, equivalent to one billion kilograms. NAP Nitric acid plant Net GHG emissions The reported GHG emissions in a reporting period (an Orica financial year) after applying   claimable emissions reductions or surrenders from carbon credit units. Includes generated   carbon credits which have not been surrendered but have been sold to a third party or banked   in a carbon credit registry. Net zero Net zero refers to achieving an overall balance between greenhouse gas emissions produced   and greenhouse gas emissions removed from the atmosphere. Nitrous oxide A potent greenhouse gas possessing a global warming potential approximately 265 times that   of carbon dioxide. Paris Agreement goals The central objective of the Paris Agreement is to avoid climate change by limiting global warming  to well-below 2°C and pursue efforts to limit temperatures to no more than 1.5°C above  pre‑industrial levels. Additionally, the agreement aims to increase the ability of countries to deal  with the impacts of climate change, and make finance flows consistent with a low GHG emissions  and climate‑resilient pathway. Performance The financial and non-financial performance of a company. Financial performance metrics are  quantitative and focus on measuring a company's financial health, profitability and growth.   Non-financial performance metrics are qualitative and measure a company's intangible assets   such as customer satisfaction, brand reputation and employee engagement. Plant turnarounds Planned shutdowns of industrial plants and facilities, generally for maintenance activities. Potable water See water.

Renewable electricity   may be obtained directly (e.g. by solar generation) or via grid‑connected supply supported   with the retirement of renewable energy certificates. Also referred to as green hydrogen. Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions Direct emissions from operations that are owned or controlled by the reporting company.   For Orica, these are primarily emissions from industrial manufacturing processes and natural   gas feedstocks. Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions Indirect emissions from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heat or cooling  that is consumed by operations that are owned or controlled by the reporting company. Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions All other indirect emissions (not included in Scope 2) that occur in the value chain. For Orica, these  are primarily emissions resulting from purchased goods and services which account for around  two-thirds of our global Scope 3 GHG emissions. Security of supply The guarantee of supply of goods and/or services enough to be relied upon and available   at all times and in sufficient quantities, at a reasonable and/or affordable price.
