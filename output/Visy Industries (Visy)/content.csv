We have commenced integrating Visy’s policy and practices for Visy Glass.  ===== PAGE 3 ===== Page 3 | Visy – UN Global Compact Report Operating across more than 120 sites   in Australia, New Zealand and other parts of  the world, Visy’s more than 7,000 employees  are guided by the company’s vision to be  the global leader in creating high quality,  innovative and sustainable packaging  solutions for a better world.  Sustainability sits at the centre of our operating  model, driving strategic, long-term investments in  plants, technologies and local jobs. We are committed  advocates on some of the bigger issues that make  a difference to our customers and communities,  from pushing for more sustainable manufacturing  approaches to creating better economic futures   for regional communities. As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact  (UNGC) since 2014, Visy reports progress annually  on our performance against the 10 UNGC Principles,  as well as supporting and contributing to the United  Nations Sustainable Development Goals.  I am pleased to confirm that Visy reaffirms its support  of the 10 UNGC Principles in the areas of Human Rights,  Labour, Environment and Anti-corruption. In this, our  sixth annual Communication on Progress, we describe  our actions to continually improve the integration of  the UNGC and its principles into our business strategy,  culture and daily operations.  Our annual Communication on Progress is an important  requirement of all companies participating in the UNGC,  supporting public accountability and transparency.  We also commit to sharing this information with other  relevant stakeholders through our website and social  media channels. We are proud of the progress we continue to make in  UNGC related areas, including supporting the circular  economy, utilising increasing levels of renewable energy,  and improving diversity across the business. Just as  importantly, we are willing to continually learn, question  and improve our performance. Statement of support from   Visy’s Chief Operating Officer Mark De Wit Chief Operating Officer, Visy  ===== PAGE 4 ===== Page 4 | Visy – UN Global Compact Report CUSTOMER FOCUS We will build strong relationships with our customers to support their business.   When they succeed, so do we. RELENTLESS PURSUIT OF BEST VALUE We will be innovative in driving to achieve the best value for the supply chain. SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT Everything we do is dependent on the safety of ourselves, our employees,   our customers and the communities in which we operate.   Sustainability is critical to our business. ACTING WITH URGENCY, PASSION AND ENERGY  We have a strong work ethic and commitment to the success of “one Visy”.   We act decisively, using facts, to achieve the best outcomes for our customers   and for Visy. Our key people act with a strong sense of business leadership. DEVELOPING EXCELLENCE IN PEOPLE Core to our personal credibility is treating people with respect.   We encourage everybody to be their best. Our people are supported   and challenged to achieve their potential. Our vision is to be the global leader in  creating sustainable packaging solutions  for a better world Our values  ===== PAGE 5 ===== Page 5 | Visy – UN Global Compact Report Human rights and labour Principle 1:   Business should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights Principle 2:  Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights issues Principle 3:  Business should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition   of the right to collective bargaining Principle 4:  The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour Principle 5:  The effective abolition of child labour Principle 6:   The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation Our approach Visy supports the United Nations Declaration of  Human Rights. Our company has a core value  of treating all people with dignity and respect. As a company, we believe in a workforce that is   diverse and free from harassment, bullying,  victimisation or unlawful discriminatory practices   and behaviour. Our company values, obligations and  expected standards of behaviour towards each other,  as well as towards our customers and suppliers, are  detailed in our range of Health and Safety, Human  Resources and Legal policies, and in our Code   of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct.   These policies address human rights issues,   including our commitment to equal opportunity  employment, our compliance with applicable wage   laws and our positions against child labour, forced  labour, vilification and occupational violence. Visy supports the International Labour Organization’s  (ILO) core conventions. This support includes a  commitment to ensuring our fibre inputs are not  sourced from wood harvested in violation of traditional  and human rights or the ILO’s core conventions.   This commitment is captured in Visy’s Responsible  Sourcing Commitment - Fibre and supported by Visy's  Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification across  all core fibre businesses (FSC-C008345). As we continue to expand our business and broaden  Visy's supply chain, we remain committed to our  aim of providing a safe and engaging workplace for  our employees. This commitment extends to the  workplaces of our suppliers. As an active participant   in the UNGC, Visy confirms this commitment as a   key element of the continual growth and success   of our operations.  ===== PAGE 6 ===== Page 6 | Visy – UN Global Compact Report Our progress Responsible supply chains We are committed to ensuring responsible, ethical   and sustainable engagement with our supply chain  partners of materials and services. We believe that   a collaborative approach with our supply chain   partners, service providers, and customers is key   to a successful business.  Our Commitment to Responsible Supply Chains Policy,  endorsed by Visy’s Executive Chairman, Anthony Pratt,  and Visy’s Chief Operating Officer, Mark De Wit, supports  this commitment. Beyond our participation in the UNGC, we continue to be  a progressive and collaborative member of the following  social and environmental initiatives: •	 FSC Australia  •	 Sedex  •	 UNGCA – United Nations Global Compact Australia  •	 Sustainable Agricultural Initiative Australia  •	 APCO – Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation  •	 ACOR – Australian Council of Recycling  •	 Ecovadis Prior to engagement, supply chain partners we work  with are requested to accept Visy’s Supplier Code   of Conduct. Every supply chain partner is also reviewed  for risk factors, including modern slavery, through   our licensed risk rating tool set. This is an ongoing  review process.  In addition, for critical or high spend materials, a robust  sourcing process is followed and plant audits may be  conducted prior to, or following engagement, on an  ongoing basis.  Where we identify other potential risks during a supply  chain partner risk review, the supply chain partner is  asked to provide statements on compliance to the  relevant matter. In 2019, in order to address potential modern slavery  practices in our supply chain, the Visy executive  team established a Modern Slavery Action Team and  introduced a Supply Chain Risk Review Panel (SCRRP).  Both the Modern Slavery Action Team and the SCRRP  have been authorised and mandated to monitor, assess,  remediate and report on the potential for modern  slavery risks in our operations and supply chains.   In particular, the SCRRP has a formal charter outlining  the functional requirements of Visy’s supply chain   risk assessment and provides updates to the Visy  executive team.  The SCRRP is comprised of senior managers from  Corporate Counsel, Group Commercial, Governance   and Risk, Group Procurement and Operational  Excellence. Additional positions are established to  conduct individual assessments of each new supply  chain partner before they are on-boarded as a supply  chain partner, and to review existing supply chain  partners used by Visy. To support the SCRRP, we have licenced third-party  software to assist in reviewing the supply chain.   This tool reviews our supply chain partners by  assessing each partner against a number of different  risk indexes, including country, region and industry.  In addition, the tool reviews any applicable global  sanctions, convictions and high risks associated   with the ownership and activities for each supply   chain partner.  A set of criteria has been established to identify   ‘red flags’ associated with each supply chain partner.   These then require follow-up before sign off by the  SCRRP, and before a supply chain partner can be  engaged, or further trading commenced for existing  supply chain partners.  As a result of this ongoing work and supply chain  partner review process, decisions have been made to  not engage several supply chain partners requested   to be utilised in the Visy supply chain.  ===== PAGE 7 ===== Page 7 | Visy – UN Global Compact Report Case Study As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded during  2020, the Pratt Foundation and Visy joined  Second Bite and Fare Share, two long-standing  food rescue partners, to respond to the growing  number of Victorians needing food relief.  The programs resulted in the delivery of   100,000 Cryovac pre-cooked frozen meals   to a wide range of charities. At home in local communities While Visy’s network spans the breadth of   Australia, New Zealand and other parts of the   region, our plants, warehouses and people are   primarily part of the local communities in which   we operate, with many in regional locations.   We actively seek initiatives, and partner with   like-minded organisations, to create positive   change within these communities.  In the past year Visy and the Pratt Foundation,  the philanthropic arm of the Pratt Family and Visy,  continued support for key food rescue organisations,  including providing practical, in-kind support for  communities suffering from the effects of drought,  bushfire and COVID-19. This support included   provision of food hamper boxes and direct funding  contributions to community organisations.  Case Study Following the bushfires in early 2020 in the region  surrounding Tumut, where Visy’s Tumut kraft  paper mill is located, the Pratt Foundation worked  with the Foundation for Regional and Rural  Renewal (FRRR) in administering the $1 million  Visy Tumut Region Recovery Fund.  The fund was designed to support the recovery   of communities in the Snowy Valleys Council   region, providing support in the form of grants   to local not-for-profit organisations and  community groups to deliver programs,   services and activities to help local people.  The programs covered mental health and   wellbeing, environmental and wildlife recovery,   social connectedness and cultural vibrancy,  community infrastructure and equipment.  The $1 million donated by the Pratt Foundation  to the recovery fund, was in addition to a further  $100,000 donated by the Pratt Foundation   to ten local fire services.  ===== PAGE 8 ===== Page 8 | Visy – UN Global Compact Report Case Study The Pratt Foundation is a long-term supporter   of The Royal Children’s Hospital (RCH). At the   end of 2020, the Pratt Foundation donated 1,100  toys to RCH, in lieu of the annual Pratt Party for   the Kids which was sadly unable to go ahead   due to COVID-19 restrictions.  Patients, and their siblings, were delighted to  receive the gifts which catered for age groups  from newborns to teens, and included remote  controlled cars, puzzles, showbags and soft  toys. In 2021, the Pratt Foundation were again  honoured to support The RCH Good Friday Appeal  2021 Teddy Bear Hospital. More than $17 million  was raised in this year’s Good Friday Appeal, the  90th time the annual event has been held.  An active voice on big issues in the region We continue to engage with stakeholders in seeking  practical ways to reduce food waste in all supply   chains, consistent with Sustainable Development   Goal 12 (‘ensure sustainable consumption and  production patterns’).  In 2020, Visy continued sponsorship of the Global  Food Forum, an event designed to debate and progress  the critical issues facing the region’s $150 billion  agribusiness sector, including climate change and   local food manufacturing. Visy sees its contribution   to achieving these outcomes as a practical way to  support sustainable development in the regions in  which we operate.  ===== PAGE 9 ===== Page 9 | Visy – UN Global Compact Report A safe and healthy workplace Visy employs over 7,000 people. Our workforce is  predominantly based in Australia and New Zealand,   with some employees based in Singapore, China,  Thailand*, US, UK and Europe. (* Visy sold 80% of the  Thailand-based business in August 2019, retaining 20%   as an investor. Thailand-based employees are only relevant  for two months of the FY2020 reporting period.) We believe that all humans have a right to safety   and we take our obligation and duty to provide a   safe and healthy work environment seriously.  Visy’s Safety Policy outlines the aims and actions in  place to protect our employees, contractors and visitors  from exposure to harm as part of our operations. Our  company’s commitment to health and safety is put  into practice through the effective implementation of  a risk based Health, Safety and Environment (HSE)  management system which, together with our Incident  Management and Learning Management systems,  create structure and consistency in the planning,  implementation and management control of HSE  issues. The Visy Safety Policy establishes long term  objectives, while the HSE Plan sets two year targets. All Visy sites are required to develop safety and  environmental hazard registers to identify risks,  determine the necessary controls to manage the   risks, and to assure those controls are in place and  working. All sites are audited internally on an annual  basis and rated on a traffic light system. Site safety   data is reported monthly to the Visy Executive   covering hazard identification, action completion   and injury results.  In FY2020 Visy’s recordable injury rate reduced by   18% compared to the previous year, and the lost time  injury frequency rate reduced by 14%. Over the past   five years, our lost time injury and total recordable injury  rates have reduced by 50% and 41% respectively. Awareness around mental health issues remains   a key workplace initiative. We have continued our  mental health awareness program for all Front Line  leaders, which commenced in 2018, with more than   200 leaders completing the 'Building a Mentally   Healthy Workforce' program.  Case Study Visy sites and teams marked RUOK? Day in  September 2020 with a focus on positive   mental health more important than ever.  Despite many sites not being able to hold  traditional events that gather groups of  employees together due to COVID-19 restrictions,  important conversations were still the order   of the day.  The aim of RUOK? Day is to remind everyone  about the importance of asking ‘Are you ok?’   in order to meaningfully connect with others   and support anyone struggling with life.   ===== PAGE 10 ===== Page 10 | Visy – UN Global Compact Report COVID-19 introduced additional health and wellbeing  challenges to the workforce. In addition to strict hygiene  and health protocols in line with government guidelines,  during 2020 we rolled out a series of campaigns  specifically tackling mental challenges around   COVID-19 including fatigue, anxiety and COVID-19  complacency. Further skill building workshops  continued throughout 2020, focusing on resilience  during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, we ran a 'Leading a Mentally Healthy and  Thriving Workforce: Transitioning out of COVID-19'  program to support leaders to help their teams  transition out of COVID-19. Case Study In 2020, the Pratt Foundation announced a  donation of $1 million to the Peter Doherty   Institute for Infection and Immunity at the  University of Melbourne, to be used in a trial   of existing HIV and arthritis drugs in the   potential treatment of COVID-19.  The trial involved 2,440 people over 60 days in   60 hospitals across Australia and New Zealand. Visy’s range of human resources policies and guidelines  define our requirements and expectations across the  employment spectrum, including recruitment and  selection, remuneration and salary options, induction  and training, leave and flexible work arrangements,   and performance reviews and disciplinary actions. People policies, including Child & Forced Labour,  Workplace Harassment and Bullying, Parental Leave  and Code of Conduct were reviewed and refreshed in  February 2018. Visy's Leave Policy was updated   in August 2018 to include the option for Purchased  Annual Leave. In addition, the Domestic Violence   Victim Support Policy was introduced in 2019. Visy’s Employee Assistance Program (EAP) offers   free and confidential counselling to all our employees  and immediate family members, as well as online  support and resources. An engaged workforce At Visy, one of our key values is ‘Developing Excellence  in People’. We know that in order to create a bright  future for our business, we need to invest in our people,  reward and recognise their efforts, and ensure we are  developing our future talent pipeline. We have developed  an Attraction, Retention and Engagement Strategy to  ensure we remain focused on attracting and engaging  the talent we need, now and into the future. Our range of development and training programs show  our commitment to not only developing talented people  but also ensuring all our employees understand our  expectations as a company and their obligations in  workplace behaviour. In FY2020 we offered a wide range of development   and training opportunities covering leadership, business,  compliance and personal development. Courses were  offered in person where possible, and also through  virtual and online delivery methods.  ===== PAGE 11 ===== Page 11 | Visy – UN Global Compact Report Case Study Visy Logistics’ inaugural in-house Female Driver  Trainee Program launched in 2020. Successful  applicants participated in a fully-paid, four-week  intensive driver training course in January 2021   to obtain a Heavy Rigid Licence.  Graduates of the course are now employed   within the Visy Logistics’ team in Melbourne.   This program supports our attraction strategy   and our commitment to lifting female   representation across the business.  Our Visy Circle In Portal, launched in 2019, provides valuable resources, coaching, support tools and tips to our working  parents group, supporting our employees commencing a family, taking parental leave, returning to work, or managing work  and family. The platform continues to gain participation and interest as the content is increasingly expanded and enriched.  Encouraging diversity We believe equal opportunity makes for a better world  and we take pride in building upon our diverse and  inclusive culture. Appreciating different perspectives,  experiences and approaches – irrespective of age,   race, gender or department – fuels creativity and   helps people bring their best to work.  We have an action plan in place focused on advancing  women at Visy. This plan includes a variety of initiatives  including consultation with both women and men  through national workshops to understand the   barriers and enablers to advancing women at Visy.   Since 2018, we have run an Executive Mentoring  Program, involving mentoring relationships between  high potential women and senior leaders of the  company. Interest in the mentoring program is   high, with the last intake fully subscribed. 32% Gen Y 35% Gen X 33% Baby boomers Visy’s workforce is spread fairly evenly by age, with  ===== PAGE 12 ===== Page 12 | Visy – UN Global Compact Report Environment Principle 7:   Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges Principle 8:  Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility Principle 9:  Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies Our approach Visy is a global leader in packaging and resource recovery, and has been a pioneer in sustainability since  our inception.

This philosophy  underpins our circular economy model.  ===== PAGE 14 ===== Page 14 | Visy – UN Global Compact Report *Includes recyclable materials used by Visy and provided to other recyclers.  Source: Visy Blue Book FY2020 Materials Reporting We continue to work with government and industry to increase the regions’ capabilities in re-manufacturing and  recycling, in line with government focus areas and recent legislation prohibiting the export of specific unprocessed  materials collected for recycling.  As a leading packaging manufacturer, Visy also contributes to improved environmental sustainability in consumable  packaging through incremental improvements of packaging design, manufacture and functionality. Visy’s varied food  packaging innovations have contributed improvements that range from the more obvious, such as increased recycled  content and recyclability of packaging, to the less obvious, such as reducing energy consumption of manufacture,  increasing food shelf-life, reducing food waste and providing for more space-efficient packaging. Case Study As one of the region’s largest recycling companies,  we continually drive improvements in the recycling  industry. For example, our recycled plastics plant  opened in 2012 uses FDA approved recycling  processes to manufacture food grade recycled   PET and HDPE.  Our recycled food grade PET is suitable for use in  packaging for applications such as water bottles,  while our recycled food grade HDPE is suitable for  use in packaging for applications such as milk   and juice, which is a first for the Australian market.  Visy is closing the loop locally to provide food grade  recycled PET and HDPE sourced, produced and  distributed in Australia.

Visy’s Environmental Policy commitments   are put into practice through the implementation of   our HSE Management System Standards and Codes   of Practice. These provide a consistent framework   for the establishment of our HSE Management System  across our operations. Visy’s HSE Management   System includes company-wide policies, procedures  and processes that manage aspects of HSE. Visy currently holds 32 environmental licences, as   well as trade waste agreements for discharges of  industrial liquid waste to sewer. Compliance is a key  aspect of Visy’s Environmental Policy and we conduct  risk assessments of our sites to identify risks and  actions to maintain compliance in all circumstances.  Where an issue arises we proactively inform and work  with state and local governments to resolve it promptly.  Across our more than 120 Australian and New Zealand  sites, there were no environmental penalties issued   to Visy in FY2020. Our sites work to an environmental management  system based on the structure of the International   EMS standard ISO 14001. This forms part of our   HSE Management System and our manufacturing   sites are audited annually. Third party auditors   externally certify Visy’s material environmental risk   sites, the paper mills at Gibson Island QLD, Smithfield  NSW, Tumut NSW, Coolaroo VIC and Reservoir VIC   to ISO 14001. Visy is committed to sustainable fibre sourcing for  our recycled content and virgin papers that are the  predominant input into the fibre packaging products  we produce. We are a member of Forest Stewardship  Council (FSC C-008345) Australia and the Australian  Forest Products Association (AFPA). Our current FSC  and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forestry  Certifications (PEFC) certificates cover more than   70 sites certified across five different countries.  Our Visy Responsible Sourcing Commitment – Fibre,  details our processes for ensuring our fibre sources are  certified against the relevant accredited standards and  support sustainable forest management by sourcing  wood fibre from suppliers that are economically viable,  environmentally responsible and socially beneficial.   We conduct annual reviews of all wood suppliers  supplying fibre used in our production. Find out more at visy.com.au/responsible-business  In addition to supporting sustainable forest  management, Visy also supports sustainable  agribusiness by contributing innovations in product  packaging and related food waste reduction  technologies across the supply chain.  Visy is a major sponsor of the Global Food Forum   (see page 8 for further details) and we are investing  heavily in technology improvements for our food  customers including, for example, temperature  controlled packaging for produce, dairy specialised  in-mould label barrier systems and ultra lightweight  beverage containers.  ===== PAGE 16 ===== Page 16 | Visy – UN Global Compact Report Further reporting and ratings Visy’s environmental performance is tracked and  measured for continuous improvement through  our operational KPIs as a component of our Visy  Integrated Management System. Environmental  targets are included in the Safety and Environmental  Sustainability Plan. Operational performance  targets include weekly inspection activity, incidents,  complaints, toolbox talks and HSE observations.   Visy measures waste to landfill, energy and water   use and carbon emissions and uses this data to fulfil  our annual reporting requirements. In Australia, Visy is required to report to the National  Pollution Inventory (NPI), National Greenhouse and  Energy Reporting Act (NGER), and The Australian  Packaging Covenant Organisation (APCO).   We are also required to submit annual returns for   our licensed sites to the respective state authorities. Visy engages with Ecovadis to measure our  environmental position based upon a scoring system  allowing benchmarking against other global companies.  Our 2019 CSR assessment places Visy as ‘silver’   in the 85% percentile as evaluated by Ecovadis.   We will engage Ecovadis to remeasure our  environmental position in 2021.  ===== PAGE 17 ===== Page 17 | Visy – UN Global Compact Report Case Study Sustainability objectives underpin the design   and operation of Visy’s Tumut kraft mill, located  in New South Wales (NSW), which has been in  operation since 2001. Our total investment in this mill  of over A$1 billion highlights our serious commitment  to sustainability. The mill is among the lowest users   of water of any similar mill in Australia and has   near-zero levels of effluent leaving the site.   A significant proportion of the energy used in the  mill is generated on-site using responsibly sourced  renewable biomass fuels, such as bark and wood  residues from the mill’s operations. This has enabled  the plant to satisfy over 80% of its total energy needs  from on-site renewable generation. Visy’s investment in clean energy also includes   an energy from waste plant opened in 2011 that  uses previously landfilled waste from our paper  recycling process as fuel to generate thermal and  electrical energy to help power two of our recycled  paper mills. These initiatives have resulted in reduced  landfill of waste materials from Visy's manufacturing  operations as well as reductions in greenhouse gas  emissions from the disposal of waste to landfill and  from the reduced use of natural gas and grid electricity. Energy usage We are committed to reducing the energy used, and the  carbon footprint made, by our manufacturing operations.   We continue to monitor and review energy consumption  across our sites.  Visy’s energy and waste committees set targets and  performance indices on a monthly and rolling annual   basis for a range of energy and waste factors across   the company’s manufacturing divisions and sites.   These include unit-of-production based energy  consumption for electricity and gas, landfill waste  volume, avoided landfill volume via energy recovery at the  company’s three Australian energy-from-waste plants,  and carbon emissions. Visy reports on carbon emissions  annually under the Commonwealth of Australian National  Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act. Over the past five years we have consistently increased   the amount of energy produced from renewable sources,  including wood waste, black liquor from kraft paper  production, biomass-paper waste, and bio-gas and   bio-fuels derived from production processes and solar.   In FY2020 approximately 100,000 tonnes of landfill   were diverted to energy production at Visy. Effective 1 January 2020, Visy has entered into a   long-term purchasing agreement with the Lal Lal   wind farm to support the development of renewable  energy infrastructure in Victoria.  We have also completed a 1,920 kW roof-top solar  installation at the Gepps Cross site with funding support  from the South Australian Government. The project  generates 40% of the site’s electricity needs.  Since FY2018 Visy has generated the equivalent   of approximately 50% of its energy needs from   renewable sources. Since FY2009 Visy has reduced   its greenhouse gas emissions per unit energy by 31.3%.   ===== PAGE 18 ===== Page 18 | Visy – UN Global Compact Report Case Study With the challenges presented by COVID-19, Visy  partnered with Wyndham City Council in 2020 to   trial an online education session on recycling.  Targeted at residents, the live webinar covered  what can and cannot be recycled, explained what  happens to the contents of the kerbside recycling  bins once collected, and provided community  members with direct access to ask questions   to a representative from Visy Recycling.  The learnings from this online pilot are being  extended to ongoing web based sessions.   Visy also continued to produce printed copies   of 20-page kids’ activities book to support   in-home engagement and education on   everyday recycling topics. Water usage We continue to monitor and review water consumption  across our sites in line with our commitment to use  natural resources responsibly.  Visy uses a number of alternative water sources,  including desalination and recycled water. More than  20% of our water requirements are obtained from  recycled and desalinated sources.  These alternative water sources have increased from  3.8% of total water consumption in FY09 to 23.5% of  total water consumption in FY2019, reducing our use   of fresh water sources. Increasing education around   environmental issues Visy offers a range of programs and support to   councils and businesses with the aim of improving  community and business knowledge and attitudes  towards waste minimisation, increasing levels of local  recycling, and driving demand for recycled packaging.  Activities offered include Material Recovery Facility  (MRF) tours, speaking engagements on recycling   topics to residents, and the provision of educational  materials such as flyers, social media content,  community paper and bus shelter advertising   and PDF downloads for councils and businesses   to use locally.  Visy continues to partner with Cool Australia, a   not-for-profit organisation that provides educational  curriculum in environmental, social and economic  sustainability from early learning to secondary school.  Visy has worked with Cool Australia to develop a range  of over 30 sets of teacher resources which relate  to Visy's resource recovery operations, in particular,  recycling and the circular economy.  ===== PAGE 19 ===== Page 19 | Visy – UN Global Compact Report Anti-corruption Principle 10:   Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery Our approach Visy supports the UN Convention   against Corruption Visy is committed to conducting business in an   ethical, honest way and without the use of bribery   or other corrupt practices to obtain an advantage.

Internally the policy supports our Code of Conduct,  including our expectation that all Visy employees  behave in a fair and legal manner and are seen to  be doing so. This policy is required to be read and  acknowledged on an annual basis by all monthly   paid employees and those in roles with direct links   to customers and suppliers through our related party  declaration process. Visy’s employees, contractors   and consultants are responsible for ensuring that   their behaviour and actions comply with the Code   of Conduct at all times. Visy’s comprehensive compliance program provides  online and face-to-face training and information   to relevant employees about their obligations   under the law.  All managers complete an annual Related Parties  declaration to highlight any matters that require  management attention where an employee may   have personal or family interests at a customer,   supplier or competitor business. Visy’s Commitment to Responsible Supply Chains  addresses corruption and business ethics. In addition,  during 2020, new processes were established using  external software to assess corruption risk as part of  the vendor on-boarding process.   ===== PAGE 20 ===== Page 20 | Visy – UN Global Compact Report This process considers the country of operation of all  suppliers, and any enforcement that have been received  by the potential vendor. A diverse internal panel, the  Supply Chain Risk Review Panel, has been established  to support this to review vendors with an unacceptable  risk score. Read more about this on page 6. Formal processes exist and continue to be improved  for assessing cyber security risk and identifying and  blocking external attacks to protect our systems and  data. This includes personal data covered under the  Privacy Act.  Ernst & Young, Protiviti and other external specialist  companies continue to provide internal and external  audit outsource support to review our frameworks  for managing general risk, fraud, theft and improper  conduct risk. This includes the risk of bribery and  corruption. These reviews cover IT security relating to  cyber threat, physical security and compliance with  privacy legislation. External Whistleblower Service Visy’s External Whistleblower Service is managed by  an external service provider for all of Visy’s businesses  globally. Disclosures can also be made securely  through email, fax or postal mail. Protocols have been  established to receive and protect information of these  documents for privacy purposes. Training is provided on this subject to employees in  a number of forms including face-to-face, video and  through use of signage and communications at all   our operating sites and offices.  Record keeping and reporting Each case received through the External Whistleblower  Service, Internal Complaints Line or via other sources,  is recorded by the Head of Risk Management in a  secure register. Reporting is provided in numerous  forms including individual investigation reports,  audit reports on the controls impacted and quarterly  summary reporting on the investigations and outcomes  for the Governance Board (Audit Committee) and the  Compliance Committee (Competition and Consumer  Law Committee). There have been no findings of incidences of direct  bribery or corruption cases for the financial period  FY2020. Complaints Management Policy Our Complaints Management Policy and related  procedure is in place to deal with all general complaints  not pertaining to theft and fraud. It offers a free call  complaints line to raise issues of concern. Details are  published on our website for the general public and on  our intranet for employees. Competition and consumer law training In Australia and New Zealand, relevant Visy employees  are required to complete comprehensive competition  and consumer law training. The training is designed  to inform Visy employees of the provisions of the laws  and their impact on our business, and the need to act  in accordance with their obligations under competition  and consumer laws.  ===== PAGE 21 ===== Page 21 | Visy – UN Global Compact Report visy.com "

FY2021 Australia Totals  ===== PAGE 3 ===== HELPING YOU ACHIEVE YOUR SUSTAINABILITY TARGETS | MARCH 2022 Page 3 The 2025 National Packaging Targets require the industry to drive systematic change in the way packaging is designed,  produced, collected and recovered. The targets are ambitious and will require both technical change  from industry and behavioural change from end consumers to be achieved.  We are committed to working closely with you across design and production to develop packaging that will help  us collectively meet the targets.  This includes ensuring packaging is designed for purpose whilst maximising opportunities to:   use sustainable packaging materials;   include recycled content;   improve recyclability through kerbside collections; and   support you with recycling collection opportunities to enable packaging to be re-manufactured back into new packaging. As our unique model comprises both recycling and re-manufacturing, we offer the ability to include recycled content into our  sustainable packaging solutions from the recyclables we collect through kerbside and commercial collections.  Progress towards the 2025  National Packaging Targets Progress against APCO  target 1: 100% reusable, recyclable  or compostable packaging Progress against APCO  target 3: 50% of average recycled  content included in packaging Progress against APCO  target 2: 70% of plastic packaging being  recycled or composted Progress against APCO  target 4: The phase out of problematic  and unnecessary single-use  plastic packaging  ===== PAGE 4 ===== HELPING YOU ACHIEVE YOUR SUSTAINABILITY TARGETS | MARCH 2022 Page 4 Progress against APCO target 1:	  100% reusable, recyclable or compostable packaging Our unique, closed loop re-manufacturing processes link recycling and manufacturing. Recyclability of our packaging Cardboard  & paper Visy paper and cardboard based products, which do not contain coatings,  are recyclable. * When specialty coatings are applied, such as those used to increase wet  strength, our products may not be recyclable. Recyclability needs to be  assessed depending on the coatings applied. Glass Visy glass products are recyclable. Plastics Visy produces the following plastic grades which are recyclable through  kerbside collections PET (1), HDPE (2) and PP (5). Visy also produces PVC. Although PVC, polystyrene and bioplastics/ degradable plastics and other plastics may technically be recyclable, there  are practical challenges to the wide availability of processes and programs  for reprocessing and return to use. Food cans  – tin-plate steel Visy steel food cans are recyclable. Beverage cans  – aluminium Visy aluminium beverage cans are recyclable. We work with you to:   determine the  best sustainable  packaging solution  for your needs;   provide you with  information on the  recyclability of your  packaging options; and   support you in ensuring that you  appropriately label packaging that is  recyclable – making it easier for end  consumers to recycle packaging correctly. Case study: Eliminating plastic  shrink wrap for cluster packs  We have developed a closed loop solution –  made from recycled content and is recyclable.  To eliminate the need to use plastic shrink  wrap for beverage cluster packs, we have  a fibre-based solution that is customisable,  able to support a range of cluster sizes and  improves sustainability performance.    Kerbside recyclable supporting the  circular economy    Can be made from at least 60%  recycled content   Uses sustainably sourced fibre  (FSC certified/recycled)   Made using recycled paper predominantly  sourced from kerbside collections enabling  the full closed loop   Locally manufactured board using locally  made paper reducing transport greenhouse  gas emissions when compared to imported  products   Saves 3.3 tonnes of greenhouse gas  emissions for every tonne of fibre  packaging diverted from landfill2   Helps achieve APCO targets 2 When compared to non-recyclable wet strength paper sent  to landfill.

This includes: Case study: The role of recycled plastics in the circular economy In 2012, Visy opened Australia’s first recycling plastics plant, using US FDA approved recycling processes to  turn plastic collected from kerbside recyclables back into food grade recycled PET and HDPE. The state of  the art plastics recycling facility in Smithfield, NSW, is currently the only bottle to bottle, food grade plastics  recycling facility in Australia – this basically means we are recycling used bottles to make new bottles.  In 2021, we invested a further $19m to increase capacity at our Smithfield rPET plant. Visy is the first  company in Australia to be able to recycle PET Thermoforms (pots, tubs, trays) and coloured PET. These  constitute a substantial portion of the plastics recovered by Visy via the kerbside collection stream.  The facility is now able to process:    HDPE – increased capacity from 4,000 to 12,000 tonnes of recycled food grade HDPE;    PET Thermoforms – new capacity to recycle pots, tubs, trays; and   Coloured PET bottles – new capacity to colour sort PET bottles which are then able to be re-manufactured  back into coloured PET bottles. Working with  governments to  maximise recyclable  collection options. Continually investing in technology at our material  recovery facilities (MRFs) to improve our sorting  and recycling infrastructure. In 2021, we invested $10m at our MRFs to increase  plastics recovery to allow us to sort and recover a  greater variety of plastics. Supporting councils to improve consumer recycling  behaviour and providing education on the correct  disposal of recyclables. Our ongoing partnership with Cool Australia has  provided 30 free lesson plans and education  resources to councils and schools.  ===== PAGE 6 ===== HELPING YOU ACHIEVE YOUR SUSTAINABILITY TARGETS | MARCH 2022 Page 6 Progress against APCO target 3: 50% of average recycled  content included in packaging Visy is investing and innovating in new techniques,  recycling infrastructure and manufacturing capability to  increase the recycled content of packaging across glass,  beverage can, food can, plastics, paper and cardboard.   Maximising recyclables being re-manufactured  back into packaging reduces both reliance on  natural resources and waste going to landfill.  Talk with us to understand the recycled content  of your specific packaging.  We are committed to increasing the  recycled content in our glass bottles  and jars to an average of 70 per cent3 3 Visy calculates average recycled content in our glass containers based upon our plants’ consumption of cullet, being both external glass and internal glass (for example, rejects, losses, obsolete or defective stock from our  manufacturing process). The figure is based on the weight of the cullet issued into the furnace as a percentage of the furnace’s total melt tonnes. Progress against APCO target 4:	  The phase out of problematic and unnecessary  single-use plastic packaging We support a transition away from problematic and unnecessary single-use plastic packaging as  defined by APCO.  We do not produce the following problematic and unnecessary single-use plastic packaging;   expanded polystyrene (EPS), rigid polystyrene (PS), multi-material laminate soft plastics, pumps or  trigger packs, lightweight or heavy weight plastic shopping bags.  We work collaboratively with you to provide information on the sustainability performance of different  material choices and provide alternative sustainable packaging options, including the ability to include  recycled plastic content in packaging. Case study: Visy Enviropunnet™  delivers sustainable benefits To help phase out single-use plastic packaging, Visy developed  a recyclable sustainable punnet packaging solution that  enables you to confidently deliver product to consumers.  It can be made from FSC® certified fibre that is environmentally  responsible. With recent concerns over hygiene and food  safety, many consumers are opting for pre-packed fruit and  vegetable formats that minimise exposure to environmental  elements and human touch. The pre-packed format of the  Enviropunnet™ offers retailers the benefit of reduced spoilage,  while consumers appreciate the increased convenience of  ‘grab-and-go’ shopping experiences.   ===== PAGE 7 ===== HELPING YOU ACHIEVE YOUR SUSTAINABILITY TARGETS | MARCH 2022 Page 7 Case study: A lighter glass bottle  Our investment in technology enables us to significantly ‘light weight’  glass packaging, reducing the amount of glass in a container whilst  maintaining structural integrity.  We have worked to reduce the weights of a selection of stock wine  bottles, including reducing our current punted Burgundy bottle by  15 per cent and our current premium claret bottle by more than eight  per cent, compared to the previous stock bottles. These reductions  result in lower greenhouse gas emissions packaging.  1 2 Design for recovery Optimise material efficiency As a recycling and re-manufacturing company, we understand how to design  sustainable packaging suitable for recovery and re-manufacture.  Our packaging formats are designed to maximise their recovery potential through  kerbside recycling systems and their re-manufacture back into future packaging.  We work with you to produce packaging that supports kerbside recyclability.  When we design packaging, we start with an assessment of your needs.  We are committed to finding sustainable solutions and we strive for innovation. Visy’s packaging is always designed considering your specifications and the  material efficiency of the pack. While this may restrict packaging options to  specific formats and configurations, we work with you to optimise material  efficiency in packaging design, including ‘light weighting’ packaging.  Progress towards the  10 Sustainable Packaging Principles  ===== PAGE 8 ===== HELPING YOU ACHIEVE YOUR SUSTAINABILITY TARGETS | MARCH 2022 Page 8 3 4 Design to reduce product waste Eliminate hazardous materials Packaging plays a critical role in protecting products from damage and spoilage. We design  our packaging to support products from damage and waste. When we work with you to design  your packaging we take into consideration: •  the nature and fragility of the product; •  the transport method and distance; and •  environmental conditions, e.g. humidity. We support sustainable agribusiness through innovations in product packaging and related food  waste reduction technologies across the supply chain, aimed at retaining freshness of products and  minimising damage. We invest heavily in technology improvements for our food customers including: •  temperature controlled packaging for produce; •  dairy specialised in-mould label barrier systems; and  •  ultra lightweight beverage containers. We recognise the importance of minimising the  use of hazardous materials and have a range of  policies and management systems to support the  selection and use of substances in packaging and  our processes.  The packaging we produce for food is required to  be compliant with relevant food contact material  regulations, standards and legislation. We are  committed to maintaining the integrity of the  food chain by utilising global best practices for  food safety management to produce food sector  packaging materials that are:   safe; and   will not introduce or transfer substances that  may adversely affect food quality or endanger  human health. In the course of our manufacturing operations  we are required to use a range of chemicals  and materials classified as dangerous goods.  We operate an integrated health, safety and  environmental (HSE) management system covering  all sites which encompasses the management of  hazardous materials and dangerous goods. We  report under the National Pollutant Inventory (NPI)  and through the Australian Industrial Chemicals  Introduction Scheme (AICIS). Visy sites operate  on lean manufacturing principles and we aim  to minimise the use of all substances in our  manufacturing processes. Case study: Linerless meat boxes The development of our poly-free linerless boxes eliminates the  need for plastic packaging for meat. The boxes are designed to  maintain hydration and freshness and enables meat and poultry  processing without fear of poly-entrapment (where the plastic  liner is trapped into the product during the transportation or  freezing process causing food quality issues). Watch a video on our  linerless meat carton here: vimeo.com/manage/videos/326453608  ===== PAGE 9 ===== HELPING YOU ACHIEVE YOUR SUSTAINABILITY TARGETS | MARCH 2022 Page 9 5 Use recycled materials We are constantly innovating and investing in technology, recycling infrastructure and  manufacturing capability to increase the recycled content of packaging across glass,  beverage can, food can, plastics, paper and cardboard:   To increase the recoverability of mixed paper recycling  we are investing to install a drum pulper at Visy’s Coolaroo plant in Victoria, as well as  upgrading optical sorters at two of our MRFs.    As we work to increase the recycled content of our glass jars and bottles, we are  investing in a new glass beneficiation plant in Victoria, and upgrading our New  South Wales glass plant.    To support the use of recycled plastic, we are upgrading our recycled plastic facility in  Smithfield, increasing capacity from 4,000 tonnes to 12,000 tonnes processed per annum.  We are committed to sustainable fibre sourcing for our recycled content  and virgin papers that are the predominant input into the fibre packaging  products we produce.  Since 2009, all six Visy recycled paper mills have Forest Stewardship  Council (FSC) Chain-of-Custody certification, with the majority of  fibre inputs coming from post-consumer waste streams which are  assessed against the FSC® Standard Sourcing Reclaimed Materials  (FSC-STD-40-007). Visy’s recycled paper mills are principally fed by our  recycling network which recovers used paper and cardboard (as well as  other recyclables), saving them from landfill and utilising the recovered  fibre as feedstock in our box manufacturing plants which supply paper  and cardboard products throughout Australia, and internationally.  Visy’s Pulp and Paper site in Tumut (NSW) which produces kraft paper  is certified to FSC® (FSC‑C008345) and PEFC (the Programme for the  Endorsement of Forest Certification) standards. Visy’s Tumut site only  uses fibre sourced from responsibly managed softwood plantations and  are either PEFC or FSC® certified pulp inputs. Our Visy Responsible Sourcing Commitment – Fibre, details our  processes for ensuring our fibre sources are certified against the relevant  accredited standards and support sustainable forest management  by sourcing wood fibre from suppliers that are economically viable,  environmentally responsible and socially beneficial. We conduct annual  reviews of all wood suppliers providing fibre used in our production. We are a member of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC®) Australia and  the Australian Forest Products Association (AFPA).  Case study: Australia’s first  milk bottle made with 50%  recycled plastic Visy is set to produce Australia’s first  milk bottle made with 50% recycled  plastic as part of a major upgrade to the  country’s plastics recycling capability. We have completed a $29 million multi-state plastics recycling investment,  including a $19 million upgrade to our plastics facility in Smithfield in Western  Sydney. The project includes the installation of plastic sorting infrastructure  in Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales, as well as an upgrade to the  processing capability at Smithfield.  The upgrades at Smithfield will enable Visy to produce Australia’s first milk bottle  with 50% recycled HDPE, as well as being able to recycle food grade PET trays  and coloured PET plastic packaging for the first time in Australia. 6 Use renewable materials  ===== PAGE 10 ===== HELPING YOU ACHIEVE YOUR SUSTAINABILITY TARGETS | MARCH 2022 Page 10 7 Design to minimise litter Due to the nature of the products, packaging systems may require removable pieces, such as screw caps, which  can end up as litter. To reduce litter, we work with you to design packaging formats which reduce the likelihood  of littering by avoiding unnecessary removable items. We also work with governments and councils to support  effective ‘away from home’ recycling systems and community education to reduce littering.  8 Design for transport efficiency We work with you to consider how packaging design can be optimised for transport efficiency.  Light weighting As a market leader in innovative light weight packaging, we  work with you to achieve the lowest use of resources for each  products’ packaging, consistent with the security and transport  requirement of the contained products. Examples include:   investing in infrastructure to lower the gauge of  our aluminium cans for our customers;   reducing glass container weights;   working with major customers to conduct technical analysis  and field trials to identify the lowest weight for specific  corrugated board grades; and   production of lighter weight, high-strength kraft papers at  our kraft paper mill facility at Tumut, enabling our corrugated  board plants to produce lighter weight packaging. Pallet and truck utilisation optimisation We work with you to identify improvements in  pallet stacking patterns that maintain stability  and stacking strength, while allowing lighter  board grades to be used. We also work with you  to fully utilise the space in trucks and shipping  containers by calculating the optimum workable  pallet height to be able to double stack pallets  to the height of the truck instead of single stack. We promote the use of packaging designs that  allow boxes to be delivered flat pre-use and  flattened post-use to assist in back-of-store  recycling and collection. All of these actions can reduce the transport  miles associated with your products.   ===== PAGE 11 ===== HELPING YOU ACHIEVE YOUR SUSTAINABILITY TARGETS | MARCH 2022 Page 11 9 Design for accessibility We work with you throughout the design  process to include customer accessibility  considerations. For example, design  considerations including different types of  handles or grip functionality for pouring. 10 Provide consumer information on sustainability We are committed to working with you to ensure you have accurate information about the environmental  attributes of the packaging we manufacture. We encourage you to enquire about the sustainability  credentials of our packaging and we support your efforts to promote the recycled content, benefits of  closed loop recycling and recoverability of the packaging.  We will provide you with relevant information to assist you in your use of the Australasian Recycling  Label (ARL) system, where appropriate, as well as the use of third party sustainability credentials  – for example, the FSC logo.  Case study: Visy Re+ Brand The Visy Re+ brand is about  delivering better packaging.  Packaging that is recyclable at  Visy’s MRFs and that contains  recycled content. We offer you the  opportunity to feature the Re+ logo  on your sustainable packaging.  The Re+ brand is a badge of  honour end consumers can look  for to know the product they’re  purchasing is able to be recycled  again and again. It’s a sign of  better packaging for a better world.   ===== PAGE 12 ===== HELPING YOU ACHIEVE YOUR SUSTAINABILITY TARGETS | MARCH 2022 Page 12 Our end-to-end recycling and re-manufacturing systems are unparalleled in  Australia and New Zealand. This means we can offer you a unique breadth  of inter-connected sustainable packaging and resource recovery solutions. Your Visy representative can discuss options with you to help you meet  your sustainability targets while ensuring your packaging remains  designed-for-purpose.

Our company has a core value of  treating all people with dignity and respect.    As a company, we believe in a workforce that is diverse and free from harassment, bullying, victimisation or  unlawful discriminatory practices and behaviour. Our company values, obligations and expected standards of  behaviour toward each other, as well as customers and suppliers, are detailed in our range of Human  Resources, Legal and Health and Safety policies and our Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct.  These policies address human rights issues, including not using child labour, not engaging in discrimination,  vilification or occupational violence.    As we continue to expand our business across Asia and lengthen Visy's supply chain, we remain committed  to our aim of providing a safe and engaging workplace for our employees. This commitment extends to the  workplaces of our suppliers. In joining the Global Compact. Visy is confirming this commitment as a key  element of the continual growth and success of our operations.    Implementation    As a global employer and purchaser of services and goods, Visy appreciates that it has an important role to  play in the advancing of human rights. In the first instance, our operations outside of Australia (where our  Corporate Office is based), must comply with all local laws as a minimum standard, these operations must  also comply with any higher order requirements of Visy’s Corporate policies, including our Health Safety &  Environment (HSE) Management System.    Visy vests responsibility for implementation of its principles and obligations against child and forced labour  with management at Visy’s Australian and international facilities. As a company, we are working with our  supplier base to confirm support for the principles in our Supplier Code of Conduct.    Visy’s corporate goal, 'For a Better World', inspires the Company to actively seek initiatives, and partner with  organisations of the same mind, that create positive change within the communities in which Visy operates  its businesses, and beyond. This past year Visy and the Pratt Foundation continued its support for  Australia’s key food rescue organisations, including providing practical, in-kind support for communities  suffering from the effects of the extended drought in NSW and elsewhere. This support included provision of  food hamper boxes and direct funding contributions to community organisations in the Riverina area of NSW,  through the Foundation for Rural & Regional Renewal, of which The Pratt Foundation is a founding partner.  Visy continued to engage with stakeholders in seeking practical ways to reduce food waste in all supply  chains, consistent with Sustainable Development Goal 12 (“ensure sustainable consumption and production  patterns”).  Visy sees its contribution to achieving these outcomes as a practical way to support sustainable  development in Australia.   ===== PAGE 4 =====   3     UN Global Compact  |  Visy Communication on Progress 2019  Visy believes that all humans have a right to safety and takes its obligation and duty to provide a safe and  healthy work environment seriously.

Visy’s range of Human Resources policies and guidelines define our requirements and expectations across  the employment spectrum, including recruitment and selection, remuneration and salary options, induction  and training, leave and flexible work arrangements, and performance reviews and disciplinary actions.    People policies, including Child & Forced Labour, Workplace Harassment and Bullying, Parental Leave and  Code of Conduct were reviewed and refreshed in February 2018. Visy's Leave policy was updated in August  2018 to include the option for Purchased Annual Leave.    During 2019, we intend to continue to apply our supply chain management principles, including code of  conduct and minimum standards, with regards to new suppliers and new operations across Asia. We are  implementing further processes in H2 2019 to risk assess suppliers before they are onboarded as well as  risk assess existing suppliers. Such risk assessments will be conducted from an anti-bribery, corruption and  modern slavery perspective.    In addition to its specific business operations, Visy, through The Pratt Foundation, continues to support the  NGO Hagar Australia, which provides expert on-ground trauma and vocational services to survivors of  trafficking and slavery in Cambodia, Vietnam and Afghanistan. Hagar's Global Impact Report for the period  noted that such financial support helped, with other donors, to ensure 1,163 survivors were supported on  their journey to recovery and empowerment, 275 survivors came into Hagar's care through referrals from  local police, government, partner organisations or direct contact, and an overall estimated 5,815 people  indirectly benefited from this work.         ===== PAGE 6 =====   5     UN Global Compact  |  Visy Communication on Progress 2019    Implementation    Visy is committed to social sustainability. This means we support a highly engaged and capable  workforce and contribute to a more sustainable and inclusive society for our employees and the  broader community. Our range of Development and Training programs show our commitment to not  only developing talented people but also ensuring all our employees understand our expectations as  a company and their obligations in workplace behaviour.    At Visy, one of our key values is Developing Excellence in People. We know that in order to create a bright  future for our business, we need to invest in our people, reward and recognise our people and ensure we are  developing our future talent pipeline, both in the business and in the candidate market. To this end, Visy has  developed an Attraction, Retention and Engagement Strategy to ensure we remain focused on the road map  to attracting and engaging the talent we need now and into the future.    Visy believes it is our duty to provide a safe and healthy work environment. Our Health, Safety and  Environment (HSE) System, together with our Incident Management and Learning Management Systems,  create structure and consistency in the planning, implementation and management control of HSE issues.    With our high standards and achievements for our Australian Workforce, Visy’s goal is to translate this into  our expanding overseas operations, especially in the Asia-Pacific. To achieve this, during 2019 we will  continue to implement our values and expectations through embedding them into the management systems  of our new operations and supply chains.    In 2018, Visy developed an action plan focused on advancing women at Visy. This plan includes a variety of  initiatives including consultation with both women and men through national workshops to understand both  the barriers and enablers to advancing women at Visy. Additional national workshops were also held in 2019  to celebrate International Women's Day and continually seeking feedback and buy in from our people  leaders on how we can increase our attraction and advancement of women at Visy. In 2018, we launched an  Executive Mentoring Program, with 13 high potential women being mentored by one of our Executive Team.  This program will now extend to a second intake in 2019.     We are also pleased to confirm that in 2019 we launched the Visy Circle In Portal - the home for working  parents. This online portal aims to provide valuable resources, coaching, support tools and tips to our  working parents group, support our employees commencing a family, taking parental leave, returning to work  and managing work and family. In 2018, we also doubled our paid maternity leave and introduced purchased  annual leave for our employees.     We are also pleased to be partnering with NAWO, and hosted a Quick Bite Event in July 2019 and are now  offering their mentoring program to women in our business.      ===== PAGE 7 =====   6     UN Global Compact  |  Visy Communication on Progress 2019  Measurement of Outcomes    Visy's Australasian business employs nearly 5,149 people across Australia (4,549 employees), New  Zealand (approx. 600 employees) and Singapore, China, Thailand, West Coast US, UK and Europe  (approx. 200 employees)    Our average tenure is 12 years’ service, with equal representation across the three main generations in the  working world today.    Visy is committed to the safety of its staff, customers and the communities in which we operate. The  expectations of the Executive and Owners are communicated in the Visy Safety Policy and Visy Safe  Transport Policy. These expectations are realised from the Visy HSE system which covers all sites and is  written to conform to the International Standard ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 45001. The HSE system is  designed to adapt to the different environments and scales of our operations to ensure risks are identified  and controlled, staff are trained and competent and incidents are investigated where they occur to enable  corrective actions to be implemented. Injured workers are managed through a Return to Work process to get  them back to work and to full capacity as quickly as possible. In FY19, we had 297 recordable injuries, which  included 73 lost time injuries. This was reduced from FY18 as a result of the hazard reduction and safety  behavioural work of all Divisions.    Mental Health awareness has been identified as a key workplace as well as broader community issue and in  response, Visy has started a mental health awareness program for all Front Line leaders. More than 200  leaders completed the Building a Mentally Healthy Workforce program in 2018. Additional and further skill  building workshops will continue through 2019 to further this capability.    A number of initiatives are working to embed a coaching culture across Visy and to provide specific support  to target groups/individuals. A panel of external coaches has been established to support the specific  development needs of a number of high potential employees identified through the People & Process phase  of our planning cycle. Internal mentors are being used to provide support for our 2018 and 2019 Graduates.  A toolkit to support the conduct of regular 1on1 discussions between leaders and team members was also  rolled out in 2018. It was initially launched in conjunction with our mental health focus, but throughout 2019 is  being embedded within the performance management process and other developmental initiatives.                 ===== PAGE 8 =====   7     UN Global Compact  |  Visy Communication on Progress 2019  Environment    Principle 7 : Businesses should support a precautionary approach to  environmental challenges  Principle 8 : Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental  responsibility  Principle 9 : Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally  friendly technologies      Assessment, Policy and Goals    Visy is an integrated packaging and resource recovery company and is one of Australasia’s largest  resource recovery / recycling companies. Sustainability is at the core of our business. We believe  that being truly sustainable is a journey of continuous improvement, learning and adaptation.    Our Environmental Sustainability Objective is to maximise energy efficiency, maximise recycling, minimise  water use and minimise waste to landfill. Visy sees waste as an opportunity for closed loop manufacturing  and, for materials that are recyclable, we collect and aggregate such waste for feedstock for remanufacturing  of packaging materials.    Visy manages more than 50 environmental licences and trade waste permits. In accordance with the  requirements of state and national legislation and we are required to report annually on our performance.  There was 1 Environmental Penalty issued to Visy in 2018/19.    Our sites have an environmental management system based on the structure of the International EMS  standard ISO 14001 that forms part of our HSE Management System and our manufacturing sites are  audited annually. Third party auditors externally certify Visy’s material environmental risk sites, the paper  mills at Gibson Island QLD, Smithfield NSW, Tumut NSW, Coolaroo VIC and Reservoir VIC to ISO 14001.    Visy is committed to sustainable fibre sourcing for our recycled content and virgin papers that are the  predominant input into the fibre packaging products we produce. We are a member of Forest Stewardship  Council (FSC) Australia and the Australian Forest Products Association (AFPA), the corresponding body to  the International Council of Forest & Paper Associations (ICFPA), which represents industries across the  forest products value chain, including pulp and paper.     Visy has supported the uptake of internationally recognised forest certification schemes which allows  consumers to have confidence that the products they purchase are derived from sustainable forest  management practices. Our Visy Responsible Sourcing Commitment - Fibre, details how we make sure our  virgin and recycled fibre sources and procured papers are certified against the relevant accredited standards  (including Forest Stewardship Council and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forestry Certifications)  and support sustainable forest management by sourcing wood fibre from suppliers that are economically  viable, environmentally responsible and socially beneficial. Visy conducts annual reviews of all wood  suppliers supplying fibre used for the production of Visy's Kraft Liner.     In Australia, where we have approximately 100 operations sites, Visy is required to report to the National  Pollution Inventory (NPI), National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act (NGER), and The Australian   ===== PAGE 9 =====   8     UN Global Compact  |  Visy Communication on Progress 2019  Packaging Covenant Organisation (APCO). We are also required to submit annual returns for our licensed  sites to the respective state authorities.    Visy’s energy committee sets targets and performance indices for a range of energy and waste factors  across the company’s manufacturing divisions and sites. These include unit-of-production based energy  consumption for electricity and gas, landfill waste volume, avoided landfill volume via energy recovery at the  company’s three Australian energy-from-waste plants, and carbon emissions. Visy has consistently  increased the amount of energy from renewable sources (including wood waste, black liquor from kraft paper  production, biomass-paper waste, and bio-gas and bio-fuels derived from production processes). In 2017/18  Visy produced approx. 50% of its energy needs from renewable sources. Since 2008-09, Visy has reduced  its greenhouse gas emissions per unit energy by 31.3%    Visy promotes awareness of the value and importance of recycling to businesses, schools and the local  community through a number of programs. Our Project R education sessions involve face to face  engagement with students and adult groups which provides them with the opportunity to learn about  household recycling, the benefits of getting it right and the process of how materials are sorted and  remanufactured at Visy, using a Circular Economy approach. Visy has recycling and processing facilities  across the country which may also be utilised for education purposes. Project R is based on the National  School Curriculum and can be tailored to certain groups needs if required. In FY19 Visy Recycling completed  19 education sessions and reached 1,512 students.    Visy is proud to have partnered with Cool Australia, a not-for-profit organisation that provides educational  curriculum in Environment, Social and Economic Sustainability. In partnership with Visy, Cool Australia has  designed and developed a range of curriculum resources for Australian teachers which relate to Visy's  operations, in particular, recycling. The Bright Sparks range of curriculum resources for Australian teachers  help schools understand the back-story to recycling and how they can be part of the journey to sustainability.  From May 2018 to May 2019, Visy’s Bright Sparks resources reached 263,534 students and 5,729 teachers,  and 6,835 lessons were used and shared by teachers.    In addition to supporting sustainable forest management, Visy also supports sustainable agribusiness by  contributing innovations in product packaging and related food waste reduction technologies across the  supply chain. Visy's executive chairman addressed the 2019 Global Food Forum where he emphasised the  importance of exporting high value, packaged food products rather than just bulk commodities. Visy is  investing heavily in technology and utilises technology for our customers. These include, for example,  temperature controlled packaging for produce, dairy specialised in-mould label barrier systems and ultra- lightweight beverage containers.             ===== PAGE 10 =====   9     UN Global Compact  |  Visy Communication on Progress 2019  Implementation    Visy’s Environmental Policy commitments are put into practice through the implementation of our  HSE Management System Standards and Codes of Practice. These provide a consistent framework  for the establishment of our HSE system across our operations. Visy’s HSE Management System  includes company-wide policies, procedures and processes that manage aspects of HSE.    Visy's business is built on finding innovative ways to turn waste into something valuable, which underpins our  closed loop manufacturing business model. Some examples of this for FY19  include collecting and  processing 1,858,587 tonnes of paper and cardboard and making 832,838 tonnes of recycled paper as well  as similar amounts of kraft and board containing variable content of recycled fibre; and collecting and  processing 39,773 tonnes of PET and HDPE plastics combined.     As one of Australasia’s largest recycling companies, we continually drive improvements in the recycling  industry. For example, our recycled plastics plant opened in 2012 uses FDA approved recycling processes to  manufacture food grade recycled PET and HDPE. Our recycled food grade PET is suitable for use in  packaging up to 100% composition for applications such as water bottles. Our food grade HDPE is suitable  for use in packaging up to 50% composition for applications such as milk and juice, which is a first for the  Australian market. Visy is closing the loop locally to provide food grade recycled PET and HDPE sourced,  produced and distributed in Australia.    Sustainability objectives underpin the design and operation of Visy’s Tumut kraft mill, located in New South  Wales (NSW), which has been in operation since 2001. Our total investment in this mill of over AU$1 billion  highlights our serious commitment to sustainability. The mill is among the lowest users of water of any similar  mill in Australia and has near-zero levels of effluent leaving the site. A significant proportion of the energy  used in the mill is energy generated on-site using renewable biomass fuels, such as bark and sawmill  residues from the mill’s operations. This has enabled the plant to satisfy over 80% of its total energy needs  from on-site renewable generation.    Visy’s investment in clean energy also includes an energy from waste plant opened in 2011 that uses  previously landfilled waste from our paper recycling process as fuel to generate thermal and electrical energy  to help power two of our recycled paper mills. These initiatives have resulted in reduced landfill of waste  materials from Visy's manufacturing operations as well as reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from the  disposal of waste to landfill and from the use of natural gas and grid electricity.    As a leading packaging manufacturer, Visy also contributes to improved environmental sustainability in  consumable packaging through incremental improvements of packaging design, manufacture and  functionality. For example, Visy’s varied food packaging innovations have contributed improvements that  range from the more obvious, such as increased recycled content and recyclability of packaging, to the less  obvious such as reducing energy consumption of manufacture, increasing food shelf-life, reducing food  waste and providing for more space-efficient packaging.    Visy engaged with the EcoVadis organisation to measure our position based upon a scoring system on  environmental matters. This allowed benchmarking against other global companies and we are currently  planning activity aimed at improving our rating. Our 2018 CSR assessment places Visy among the top 20%  performers evaluated by Ecovadis.             ===== PAGE 11 =====   10     UN Global Compact  |  Visy Communication on Progress 2019  Measurement of outcomes    Visy is committed to reducing the energy used and the carbon footprint made by its manufacturing  operations. Visy continues to monitor and review energy consumption across its sites.  Visy has consistently increased the amount of energy from renewable sources (including wood  waste, black liquor from raft paper production, biomass-paper waste, and bio-gas and bio-fuels  derived from production processes). In 2017-18, Visy produced approx. 50% of its energy needs from  renewable sources.    Since 2008-09, Visy has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions per energy consumed by 31.3%    Visy uses a number of alternative water sources (ie desalination and also recycled water). These alternative  water sources have increased from 3.8% of total water consumption in FY09 to 21.7% of total water  consumption in FY18. This has reduced our impact on fresh water sources.    Visy’s environmental performance is tracked and measured for continuous improvement through our  operations’ KPIs as part of our HSE Management System. Environmental Targets are included in the Safety  and Environmental Sustainability Plan. These include weekly inspection activity, incidents, complaints,  toolbox talks and HSE Observations. Visy measures waste to landfill, energy and water use and carbon  emissions and uses this data to fulfil our annual reporting requirements in Australia.    Compliance is a key aspect of Visy’s Environmental Policy and we conduct risk assessments of our sites to  identify risks and actions to maintain compliance in all circumstances. Where an issue arises, we proactively  inform and work with state and local governments to resolve it promptly. Across our more than 100  Australian sites, there were no Environmental Penalties issued to Visy in 2018.    Visy’s energy committee tracks energy and waste performance indices across the company’s manufacturing  divisions and sites on a monthly and rolling annual basis. These include energy consumption for electricity  and gas, landfill waste volume, avoided landfill volume via energy recovery at the company’s three energy- from-waste plants, and carbon emissions. Visy reports on carbon emissions annually under the  Commonwealth of Australian National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act.             ===== PAGE 12 =====   11     UN Global Compact  |  Visy Communication on Progress 2019  Anti-Corruption    Principle 10 : Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms,  including extortion and bribery      Assessment, Policy and Goals    Visy supports the UN Convention against Corruption.    Our commitment to conducting our business in a professional, lawful and ethical manner is documented in  our range of Legal policies.    These policies support our Code of Conduct by detailing our expectation that all Visy employees behave in a  fair and legal manner and are seen to be doing so, and must not engage in, be party to, or facilitate any  bribery or corruption. Our Supplier Code of Conduct outlines similar expectations for our suppliers. The Visy  Anti Bribery and Corruption Policy outlines Visy’s expectations and requirements of all Visy employees,  officers, agents, contractors, consultants, service providers, advisors and any other party acting on behalf of  Visy. In addition, Visy has recently established a formal process for accessing cyber security risk and has  improved the mechanisms for identifying and blocking external attacks to protect our systems and data. This  includes personal data covered under the Privacy Act. Additional permanent resources have been added to  support these processes with a new role 'Information & Cyber Security Manager' reporting directly to the  Chief Technology Officer.        Visy is committed to observing all applicable laws, regulations, codes and organisational standards in our  business dealings. For our large Australian operations, we have specific and mandatory ongoing training for  Visy managers regarding our obligations under Australia’s Competition and Consumer Laws.      Implementation    Ernst & Young and other external specialist companies continue to provide external audit support to review  our frameworks for managing fraud, theft and improper conduct risk. This includes the risk of bribery and  corruption. In 2018, several reviews were completed to access the management of our systems for cyber  threat, physical security and in one case, to investigate an external attack on one specific business system  which had been hacked. Further work is planned in 2019 to assess compliance with new cyber risk  management processes and to conduct further penetration testing of key systems.          Complaints Procedure  The Complaints Management Policy has been updated and will be put in action going forward.    Competition & Consumer Training  In Australia, all Visy managers are required to complete regular competition and consumer training. The  training is designed to make sure managers understand the attributes and consequences of a range of  corrupt behaviours under Australian laws such as price setting cartels, false representation and misuse of  market power.     ===== PAGE 13 =====   12     UN Global Compact  |  Visy Communication on Progress 2019    External Whistleblower Service  Visy’s External Whistleblower Service is managed by an external service provider to all of Visy’s businesses  (global). Disclosures can also be made securely through email, fax or postal mail. Protocols have been  established to receive and protect information of these documents for privacy purposes.    A short form Video for operating tool box talks was completed and rolled out in January 2019. Approximately   80% of operating sites have now run the new video as tool box talks. Face to face awareness sessions  covering the same content will be run for all staff across all business groups in the second half of 2019     Internal Complaints Handling Line  The Internal Complaints Handling Line is diverted directly to the Head of Internal Audit for general  complaints. There is a separate policy to cover this with similar protocols to the External Whistleblower  Service policy. All managers complete an annual Related Parties declaration to highlight any matters that  require management where an employee has personal or family interests at our customer, supplier or  competitor business.       Measurement of outcomes    Record Keeping and Reporting  Each case received through the External Whistleblower Service, Internal Complaints Line and other sources  is recorded by the Head of Internal Audit in a secure register. Reporting is provided in numerous forms  including individual investigation reports, audit reports on the controls impacted, summary reporting on the  investigations and outcomes for the Governance Board (Audit Committee) and the Compliance Committee  (Competition and Consumer Law Committee) at least quarterly. A new integrated system is being developed  for use by Audit to capture and report on all complaints and improper conduct incidents and investigations.    There have been no findings of incidences of direct bribery or corruption cases for the financial period  2018/2019.    Face to Face Compliance Training  Externally facing staff are required to attend Face to Face Compliance Training as well as successfully  completing a SALT online course.      "
