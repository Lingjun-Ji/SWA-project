The essential services we provide  every day supports the quality of life  for over half a million people in the  Canberra region. But as we deliver  for today, our eyes are always on  the horizon as we plan and invest in  tomorrow. Our strategic planning was a critical  element of our submission to the  Independent Competition and  Regulatory Commission (ICRC) as  part of the five-yearly price review.  Our proposal was informed by broad  and comprehensive engagement  with more than 17,500 Canberrans,  which began in 2021. We have  worked to keep prices as low as  possible for our customers while  ensuring continued quality services  for our community. We developed  a thoroughly considered investment  program that reflects customer  values and priorities and responds  to major factors in our operating  environment including ageing  infrastructure, climate change  impacts, a growing ACT population  and a challenging economic  backdrop. A significant part of the price  direction related to major works at  the Lower Molonglo Water Quality  Control Centre. Over the next five  years, Canberra has a critical window  to upgrade wastewater facilities  largely built in the 1960s and  1970s. We’ve continued to involve  our community on the options  for our wastewater future through  citizen panels, expert forums,  environmental group consultation  and a broader community survey,  which has had a positive response  with thousands participating so far. The safety of our workers and the  community underpins everything  we do. This value is reflected in  our daily work, but also in major  investments and continued focus  outlined in this report. In 2022, we  established a new People, Health  and Safety Group that will provide  leadership and expertise as we  continue our focus on building  a safe, innovative and inclusive  workplace. This team is leading  a values refresh, that will capture  the spirit of our organisation and  underpin how we work together with  each other and for our community. In 2022–23 we achieved a  reasonable financial result for the  year with net profit of $59.7m which  was better than budget, with a  significant contribution attributable  to our energy investment.  There were no dividends paid  as foreshadowed, with dividend  relief agreed with the Voting  Shareholders to help offset the  impact of our pre-tax Large-Scale  Feed-in-Tariff received from the  energy investment, with income  tax equivalent payments totalling  $28.6m. We also delivered $67.9m  of capital expenditure over 2022–23. Over this year, we have progressed  our actions to prepare for the  transition of our corporate services  arrangements. This is a whole  of business effort that presents  a transformational challenge in  terms of complexity and scope.  We continue our focus on the  opportunity to enhance our  integration, long-term efficiency, and  strategic control over services that  support our operations.  The past twelve months has also  involved considerable wet weather  across Canberra. Our network,  plant and incident management  teams have diligently worked to  minimise impacts and respond to  the challenges of these significant  wet weather events. This also  means, that we commence the next  reporting period with our dams at  near full capacity. On behalf of the Board and  Executive, we acknowledge the  achievements made possible by all  our staff this year. We look forward  to working together to deliver the  essential services our community  values whilst laying a sustainable  platform for future generations. WENDY CAIRD  Chair  Icon Water RAY HEZKIAL  Managing Director  Icon Water 2022−23 Annual Report  4  ===== PAGE 7 ===== ORGANISATION 5 Organisation  ===== PAGE 8 ===== ABOUT US We’ve been part of the  Canberra and surrounding  region community for  more than 100 years.  Every day we’re proud to support  our region by sourcing, treating  and supplying water, and managing  Canberra’s wastewater.  Icon Water Limited (Icon Water) is  an unlisted public company owned  by the ACT Government. As a  Territory-owned corporation, we are  separate from the direct functions  of government and governed by an  independent Board of directors who  exercise a governance, strategic  and oversight role. There are two  Voting Shareholders: the ACT  Chief Minister, Andrew Barr MLA  and the Minister for Water, Energy  and Emissions Reduction, Shane  Rattenbury MLA. We manage the region’s network  of dams, water treatment plants,  sewage treatment plants, reservoirs,  water and wastewater pumping  stations, pipes and other related  infrastructure – an asset base valued  at around $3.4 billion. We also  manage an investment, valued at  around $1.0 billion, in the ActewAGL  Joint Venture, which operates in the  energy sector. We are proud to support growth  in our region with a high-quality  water supply to the Canberra  and Queanbeyan communities –  essential services that contribute to  public health, liveability and future  prosperity for all. This includes  respect for our role in protecting  the environment; we operate  Australia’s largest inland sewage  treatment plant, and approximately  60 per cent of the water Canberra  uses is returned to the environment.  As a Territory-owned corporation,  Icon Water has four objectives under  the Territory-owned Corporations  Act 1990: 	 to operate at least as efficiently  as any comparable business 	 to maximise the sustainable  return to the territory on its  investment in Icon Water and  ActewAGL in accordance with  the performance targets in our  Business Strategy (Statement of  Corporate Intent) 	 to show a sense of social  responsibility by having  regard to the interests of the  community in which we operate,  and by trying to accommodate  and encourage those interests 	 where our activities affect the  environment, to effectively  integrate environmental and  economic considerations in  decision-making processes. These objectives drive our strategic  planning and the development of  our vision and business strategies. 2022−23 Annual Report  6  ===== PAGE 9 ===== Figure 1: What we do at Icon Water Discharge  high quality  treated sewage  back to the  environment Filter and  disinfect  raw water Store and  distribute  high quality  drinking water Support our customers Collect and store  raw water Treat and clean  sewage Collect and transport sewage WHAT WE DO  Protect our  environment and  safeguard our  catchments 7 Organisation  ===== PAGE 10 ===== Murrumbidgee River Catchment Queanbeyan  River Catchment Cotter River Catchment N NSW ACT GUNGAHLIN BELCONNEN CANBERRA CITY WODEN QUEANBEYAN TUGGERANONG WESTON CREEK                     Mu rrumbidgee R iver         B ur ra  Cre ek Naas Ri v e r Gudge nb y R ive r Cot ter  Riv e r Bendora gravity main C o t t e r  t o   G o o g o n g   B ul k  Tr an sf er Murrumbidgee to Googong  water transfer pipeline Q u e anb ey a n  R iv er                           M olonglo  Riv er Mt.

We provide water and  wastewater services  and also manage an  investment in the  ActewAGL joint venture  to provide energy  services to the ACT and  surrounding regions.  This joint venture was formed  in October 2000 between Icon  Water (previously ACTEW  Corporation) and Australian Gas  Light Company (AGL). The result  was ActewAGL – the first multi- utility operating as a public private  partnership in Australia.  The joint venture comprises  two partnerships, ActewAGL  Distribution and ActewAGL Retail,  with Icon Water participating in  both partnerships through its  two subsidiary companies: Icon  Distribution Investments Limited and  Icon Retail Investments Limited. The  eight Directors of the Icon Water  Board sit on both of these subsidiary  Boards.  ActewAGL Distribution, operating  under the brand ‘Evoenergy’, owns  and operates the electricity network  in the ACT, and the gas network  in the ACT, Queanbeyan region  and Shoalhaven in New South  Wales. It is a partnership between  Jemena Limited and Icon Water via  subsidiary companies.   ActewAGL Retail sells electricity and  natural gas and manages customer  service and marketing functions  in a competitive market. The  service footprint extends to centres  such as Queanbeyan, Goulburn,  Yass, Young, Nowra and Bega.  It is a partnership between AGL  Energy Limited and Icon Water via  subsidiary companies.  Our objectives for holding an  investment in the ActewAGL joint  venture are to:  	 maximise return for our  shareholders  	 have regard to the ACT  Government’s ambitions in  relation to liveability, planning,  sustainability and climate  change, and a commitment to  corporate social responsibility  (including safety, customer  service and customer  satisfaction).  The ActewAGL Partnerships Board  is comprised of six members: three  appointed by AGL/Jemena and  three appointed by Icon Water.  As at 30 June 2023, members of the  ActewAGL Partnerships Board were:  	 Julie-Anne Schafer, Icon Water 	 Carol Lilley, Icon Water  	 Ray Hezkial, Icon Water  	 Damien Nicks, AGL (Chair)  	 Frank Tudor, Jemena (Deputy  Chair)  	 Sun Peng, Jemena. Details of ActewAGL’s financial  performance for 2022–23 are  available in the Financial Reports  section. More information on  ActewAGL is available at actewagl. com.au.  The ActewAGL joint venture, guided  by the ActewAGL Partnerships  Board, is committed to the ACT  Government’s ambition to achieve  net zero emissions by 2045, and  has undertaken detailed modelling  to understand how to achieve this  ambition as well as its implications  on the electricity and gas networks  and on customers. In a close  working relationship with the ACT  Government, the joint venture  is planning for the expansion of  the electricity network to enable  the ACT’s energy transition while  maintaining energy security,  reliability and affordability.  The joint venture is also actively  working on a range of initiatives  to promote and support efficient  energy use including:  	 promoting the rollout of smart  electricity meters in the ACT  to support residential and  commercial customers to  better manage their energy  requirements and costs  	 upgrading existing public  charging points and identifying  future sites for additional public  charging points for electric  vehicles in the ACT  	 promoting the installation  of rooftop solar panels and  batteries for residential and  commercial consumers  	 conducting battery tariff trials  to investigate cost-reflective  pricing options for customers  with battery technology, to  make such tariffs more widely  available in the future. 2022−23 Annual Report  10 10  ===== PAGE 13 ===== Notes: 1) Each of Jemena Networks (ACT) Pty Ltd, Icon Distribution Investments Limited, Icon Retail Investments Limited and AGL ACT Retail Investments  Pty Ltd are wholly owned subsidiaries of Jemena Limited, Icon Water Limited and AGL Energy Limited respectively. 2) Jemena Networks (ACT) Pty Ltd and  Icon Distribution Investments Limited are equal partners in the ActewAGL Distribution Partnership (AAD).

Full dams meant we could supply  most of our water from Bendora  Dam, which is our most reliable  source and can be distributed  without major pumping. Googong  Dam and Cotter Dam also  contributed to Canberra’s water  supply during the year.  Despite the wet weather, the drought  conditions experienced from 2017– 2020 remain front of mind. During  2019–20, we saw unprecedented  dry conditions characterised by very  low rainfall, high temperatures and  bushfires. In February 2020, our total  dam storage volume dropped below  50 per cent for the first time since the  Cotter Dam enlargement in 2013,  reaching a low of 44.4 per cent.  We expect, and are planning for,  an increase in climate extremes  and variability in the future.  Notwithstanding the success of  managing the worst drought in our  history without water restrictions, our  analysis of the impacts of climate  change tells us we will continue to  see less reliable water yields from  our catchments. We are monitoring  this closely and using the broad  suite of expertise and tools at our  disposal to continue to provide a  secure water supply to the region.  Since the most recent drought,  we obtained expert advice and  systematically reviewed how we  account for climate change and  other planning variables. We have  updated our hydrological models  to incorporate the latest data and  techniques, to help prepare for  severe droughts and any impacts  to our long-term water security. We  have also optimised our operating  guidelines to make the most of our  water sources and maximise our  water security in future droughts.  Our Drought Management Plan  identifies supply and demand  initiatives that can be implemented  in response to future droughts.  It’s difficult to predict how long or  severe future droughts may be,  so we incorporated an adaptive  planning approach that draws  on three levers: source water  management, demand management  and supply options. This adaptive  approach ensures we keep all  options on the table to prepare for  a drought which may be significantly  worse than those experienced to  date.  Murrumbidgee to Googong  pipeline operation  The Murrumbidgee to Googong  (M2G) pipeline is one of several  measures built to strengthen  Canberra’s water security  following the millennium drought  of 1997–2009. The pipeline  can transfer a maximum of  approximately 100 million litres  (megalitres) a day from the  Murrumbidgee River into Burra  Creek, which then flows into the  Googong Reservoir.  There are strict guidelines in place  for operating the M2G pipeline,  which include river volumes and  water quality.  M2G did not operate during 2022–23  as it was not needed because of the  wet weather conditions.  13 13 Organisation  ===== PAGE 16 ===== 1968/69 1969/70 1970/71 1971/72 1972/73 1973/74 1974/75 1975/76 1976/77 1977/78 1978/79 1979/80 1980/81 1981/82 1982/83 1983/84 1984/85 1985/86 1986/87 1987/88 1988/89 1989/90 1990/91 1991/92 1992/93 1993/94 1994/95 1995/96 1996/97 1997/98 1998/99 1999/00 2000/01 2001/02 2002/03 2003/04 2004/05 2005/06 2006/07 2007/08 2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17 2017/18 2018/19 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 320 280 240 200 160 120 80 40 0 Annual Per Capita Consumption (kL/person/year) Annual Consumption (GL)  Queanbeyan Consumption   ACT Consumption   Per Capita Consumption WATER OPERATIONS  Since November  2010, per capita water  consumption in Canberra  and Queanbeyan has  consistently been 35–40  per cent lower than it was  before the introduction of  water restrictions in 2002.  This is one of the largest sustained  water use reductions per capita in  Australia. Canberra Airport rainfall for the  reporting period totalled 913.2 mm,  which was an increase of 28.8 mm  on the previous 12-month period.  Our combined dam capacity was  at 99.5 per cent of the total 278 GL  volume at 30 June 2023. Our water treatment plants  produced a combined 48 GL of  drinking water over the period.  Stromlo Water Treatment Plant  produced 43 GL, sourced primarily  from Bendora, and Googong  Water Treatment Plant produced  5 GL. Googong Water Treatment  plant operated for seven weeks in  September and October 2022.  Figure 3: Annual water consumption for ACT and Queanbeyan 2022−23 Annual Report  14 14  ===== PAGE 17 ===== WATER QUALITY We provide over 130  million litres of treated  water each day and  we take the quality of  our drinking water very  seriously.  Our approach to managing drinking  water supply is consistent with  the framework of the Australian  Drinking Water Guidelines (ADWG)  2011 and in compliance with the  Public Health (Drinking Water) Code  of Practice 2007 (the Code). We  conduct a comprehensive water  quality monitoring program across  our supply and distribution systems  which informs our operational  decisions and through which we  verify the quality of customers’  drinking water.  The higher inflows to all our dams  brought a corresponding increase in  pathogens in our source water. We  managed this through our multiple- barrier approach, ensuring the water  leaving our treatment plants was  100 per cent compliant with the  ADWG requirements. This quality  verification is published to the  community in our Annual Drinking  Water Quality Report in compliance  with the Code.  There were eight notifiable events to  ACT Health as per the Code during  the year; four of these referred to  raw water that had not yet been  treated, and four occurred in the  reticulation system requiring further  investigation to resolve the issue. We maintained our third-party  certification of the Hazard Analysis  and Critical Control Point risk  management system for water quality  management. The recertification  was issued in April 2022 with no  identified issues to be rectified. In June 2022, some members of our  community told us the taste of their  drinking water changed.  During  this period water was being sourced  from Bendora Dam and treated at  Stromlo Water Treatment Plant. The  change in taste was due to a natural  component, 2-Methylisoborneol, or  MIB, which can be found in water  reserves across Australia. MIB does  not make the water unsafe to drink,  however some people can smell  and taste this compound even if it  is detected at very low levels. MIB  concentrations in Bendora Dam  peaked in August 2022 and naturally  dissipated through October 2022.  Icon Water continues to monitor  for MIB in the Cotter River dams.  Since October 2022, MIB results  have remained below detection  levels in the dams and at the water  treatment plant. While all dams were at full supply  level in Spring 2022, we operated  the Googong Water Treatment  Plant for seven weeks to clean  and maintain the Stromlo Water  Treatment Plant. Delivering our high standard of  water quality in 2022–23 was  challenged by the ongoing impact  of high inflows to Googong reservoir  since 2020. The rapid infill brought  runoff from the catchment leading  to higher levels of natural organic  matter. This in turn affected the  treatment capability of the Googong  Water Treatment Plant, and meant  we had to re-chlorinate the water in  service reservoirs across the city to  maintain the disinfection residuals  at the level required all the way  to customers’ connections. The  naturally occurring compounds  affecting taste and odour were well  controlled to meet the expectations  of our customers.  2022–23 saw an increase in Blue  Green Algae (cyanobacteria) levels  across all our source water storages,  compared to the previous few  years. This is managed through the  adherence to our Blue Green Algae  Response Plan. This document  provides guidance and direction  on actions required to ensure the  continued provision of safe drinking  water.  15 15 Organisation  ===== PAGE 18 ===== WASTEWATER OPERATIONS Icon Water has  environmental  authorisations under  the ACT’s Environment  Protection Act 1997,  which regulate activities  with significant  environmental risk.  We performed well, achieving  compliance with authorisations for  these sites: 	 Lower Molonglo Water Quality  Control Centre (LMWQCC) 	 Uriarra Sewage Treatment Plant  	 Cotter Effluent Absorption  Facility 	 Canberra sewage network For the period 2022–23, the  LMWQCC, Canberra’s primary  sewage treatment plant, processed  a total sewage inflow (raw sewerage)  of 43 GL and returned 39 GL of final  effluent (clean, treated water) into  the Molonglo River.  We also recycled approximately  2 GL of treated effluent onsite with  the remaining volume accounted  for in losses through the solids  management process.  The unprecedented extended wet  period was evident at the LMWQCC.  The increase of average inflows over  the last two years, in contrast to  the inflow volume of the previous  16 years, is shown in Figure 4.  During wet weather, it’s possible  for the wastewater flow into the  plant to be higher than the plant  has capacity to treat. When this  happens, we divert some of the  partially treated wastewater into a  storage dam, to reduce the peak  inflow and give the plant time to  catch up. When the peak flows have  passed, the stored, partially treated  wastewater is returned back to the  plant to complete its treatment.  During 2022–23, there were four  instances during major wet weather  events where the peak inflow  exceeded capacity of both our  plant’s treatment capacity and the  storage dam, resulting in a release  of partially treated effluent into the  Molonglo River.  It is important to note that these  releases coincided with high  flows in the Molonglo River and  therefore, the portion of partially  treated effluent entering the river is  relatively small.  The solid product remaining from  the thermal treatment of sewage  biosolids is called Agri-Ash. It is  used as a soil conditioner by farmers  in the local agricultural industry  as part of our ‘no opportunity  wasted’ focus to maximise resource  recovery and minimise material to  landfill. More than 4,860 tonnes  of this commercial product was  produced this year. The product is  around 60 per cent calcium-based  and is especially useful to correct  pH on regional pastures typically  grazed by livestock – a safe and  economical option for farmers.  The product is routinely tested to  ensure it complies with the NSW  Environmental Protection Authority  licence for its use. We have continued our significant  capital investment at LMWQCC,  upgrading several assets in 2022–23.  These are described in more detail  in the Capital Works section of this  report.

We will continue the work on  our three strategic objectives: to  build a culture that values safety,  innovation and inclusiveness; to  deliver sustainable value to our  community and shareholders; and to  enhance customer and community  engagement. These objectives are achieved via  our eight strategic priorities, and  during 2023–24, we will continue to  focus on these priorities to improve  on the work we do every day.

During 2022–23 we achieved many key initiatives in this space:  Established the People and  Culture team The first half of 2023 saw the  creation of the People and  Culture team within the People,  Health and Safety Group as part  of the Transition of services from  ActewAGL. The new team has four  staff: Manager, People and Culture;  two People and Culture Business  Partners; and a Workforce Planning  Business Partner. The People and  Culture team have established  themselves as key partners to the  business and have led several  programs including a values refresh,  a review of human resources policies  and procedures, and have begun  transition of human resources  in‑house in 2023–2024. Values refresh We conducted a values refresh  program to review our current values  (safety, excellence and openness)  and consider whether they continue  to resonate with Icon Water  employees. The review has been  conducted across the organisation,  including values workshops held  with our Board, senior leadership  group and employees. The  workshops were co-facilitated by  volunteer Culture Champions from  within Icon Water and external  consultants. We look forward to  finalising the results of the review in  early 2023–24. 2022−23 Annual Report  22 22  ===== PAGE 25 ===== Flexible working  arrangements A new Flexible Working  Arrangement procedure was  implemented in February 2023.  This procedure provides structure  and governance around employees  accessing options to adjust or  condense hours worked and  flexibility in working from home.  It demonstrates our commitment  to supporting employees in  achieving balance in their lives while  continuing to meet the needs of the  business and our customers. Enterprise Agreement Enterprise bargaining negotiations  for the 2022 Enterprise Agreement  commenced in early 2022. After  two unsuccessful votes in 2022 and  negotiation between the parties,  a new Enterprise Agreement was  put to a vote in February 2023  with the majority (80 per cent) of  eligible voters voting in favour of the  proposal. The new agreement represents the  culmination of considerable effort  and goodwill from all parties to  reach an agreed position through  negotiation. It balances a fair  and reasonable offering for our  people with the sustainability of  the organisation and customer  affordability.  Gender equality We continue to demonstrate our  commitment to gender equality  across a range of areas. We regularly review and refine our  recruitment processes, maintaining  our focus on our job advertisements  to ensure they are free of gender  bias and encourage any interested  person to apply. In accordance  with our Recruitment and Selection  procedure, we consider the gender  balance of our selection panels,  and remind ourselves that the role  of the panel is to remain objective  and maintain equity and fairness  throughout the recruitment process.  We have also promoted Icon  Water as an employer of choice at  the Tertiary to Work Fair in March  2023 and the Young Women in  Engineering careers fair in April  2023. The Enterprise Agreement 2022  has introduced improvements for  parents and those starting a family  including the reduction in the period  of continuous service for eligibility  for primary and secondary carer’s  leave from 52 to 40 weeks, the  period of primary carer paid parental  leave increasing from 14 weeks to  18 weeks and secondary carer’s  leave increasing from one week to  four weeks. Leave provisions now  also support staff in the event of  miscarriage, pre-term birth and  stillbirth. Other procedures and enablers that  support gender equality at Icon  Water include Flexible Working  Arrangements; Breastfeeding in the  Workplace; and Workplace Support  for Domestic and Family Violence. We continued our initiative to  increase female participation in  non-traditional roles. KPI targets  are in place for gender equality,  including the percentage of women  in leadership roles as well as roles  traditionally filled by males such as  science, technology, engineering  and mathematics (STEM) roles  and competency-based roles (as  defined in the Enterprise Agreement  2022, Schedule B). The Board and  Executive have ongoing oversight of  these KPIs.  Engagement survey The annual 2023 Employee  Engagement Survey was conducted  in May 2023, with 78 per cent of  the business participating. This  year the level of engagement saw a  minor increase of 0.05 in the overall  engagement mean score of 3.73.  23 23 Our strategic priorities: Year in review  ===== PAGE 26 ===== 2022−23 Annual Report  24 24  ===== PAGE 27 ===== General Manager  Customer Engagement Chief Financial Officer General Counsel General Manager   Infrastructure Services Chief Technology Officer General Manager  People, Health and Safety Managing Director Customer Advocacy and  Experience Urban Development Services  Revenue Assurance, Asset  Information and Metering Communications and  Engagement Digital Technology Operations Cyber Security Digital Technology Project  Delivery Enterprise Architecture Digital Program Management  Office People and Culture Workforce Planning Health and Wellbeing Health and Safety Engineering Services Infrastructure Planning and  Logistics Project Delivery Major Plants Network Secretariat Legal and Procurement External Relations Internal Audit and Quality Risk and Resilience Environment and Sustainability Corporate Finance Commercial Finance Strategic Planning Strategic Advisory  Economic Regulation ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE Icon Water is made up of six groups, each led by an Executive.

During this period of change, we  continued to focus on and improve  the physical and psychological  health and safety of our people.  Our commitment to a healthy and  safe workplace and workforce  is implemented via our People  Health and Safety Strategy 2022–23  to 2023–24 and our AS/NZS  ISO45001 certified Health and Safety  Management System.  The People Health and Safety  Strategy 2022–23 to 2023–24  focuses on four areas to improve  health and safety in Icon Water:  1.	 Leadership – We model  behaviours that enable positive  people, health and safety  outcomes.  2.	 Culture – We grow skills,  capability and behaviours that  promote a positive culture.  3.	 Performance – We have people,  services and systems that are  user-centric and outcome- driven.  4.	 Wellbeing – We support our  people to develop skills and  confidence in effective self- management of their health and  wellbeing.  Incidents and injuries  There were 74 health and safety  incidents recorded in 2022–23,  which is 7.5 per cent lower than  the 80 incidents recorded in  the previous year. Out of the 74  incidents, 1 was high severity, 20  were medium severity and 53 were  low severity.  Three notifiable incidents were  reported to WorkSafe ACT, the same  as the previous year. All incidents  prompted rapid investigation with  corrective and preventive actions  put into place. We continue to  share safety learnings from incidents  across the business.  This year there were 18 recordable  injuries including 14 Lost Time  Injuries, 4 Medical Treatment  Injuries and no Restricted Work  Duty Injuries. Most of these injuries  continued to be low severity  musculoskeletal injuries from  undertaking manual work. Our Total  Recordable Injury Frequency Rate  has increased slightly to 24.5.  2022−23 Annual Report  30 30  ===== PAGE 33 ===== Good catches  ‘Good catch’ reporting (commonly  known as hazard reporting) has  improved as the business increased  its understanding of the Good  Catches Program implemented last  year. There were 174 good catches  reported this year, a 50 per cent  increase compared to the last year.  On average, 14 good catches have  been reported monthly and this has  met our target of higher than 10  reports per month. We addressed  and closed 159 good catches this  year, which is an increase from 24  good catches closed last year.  Service strikes  There were four service strikes  associated with activities being  undertaken by Icon Water this  year. This has met our target of  less than six service strikes a year.  A service strike is striking an active  underground or overhead utility  service that supply electricity,  communications, gas, streetlights,  water or wastewater.  Health and Safety  Management System We continued to improve our Health  and Safety Management System  (HSMS) throughout the year. Our  HSMS successfully transitioned  to certification to AS/NZS ISO  45001:2018 Occupational Health  and Safety Management Systems.  Certification to this standard  ensures we provide safe and healthy  workplaces while proactively  improving our performance in line  with industry best practice. To assist  our people to understand the HSMS,  we published an Icon Water HSMS  Manual following certification.  We improved our Health and Safety  Consultation Framework taking  into account our workers’ views  and in consultation with the Joint  Consultative Committee which  brings together the combined  unions that are party to our  enterprise agreement and employee  representatives. We then updated  our Health and Safety Committee  (HSC) structure to align with  legislative requirements and best  practice, including establishing three  frontline HSCs and one business- wide HSC (see Figure 6).  These new committees focus on  consultation and participation  of workers in health and safety  management to improve the  efficiency and effectiveness of the  committees.  This year, we consulted on and  introduced our Health and Safety  Worker Participation Program.  The program summarised how we  involve our people in health and  safety management and included  enabling instructions so staff can  more proactively participate. We  also introduced additional work  groups and Health and Safety  Representatives in the office and  customer service environments. This  has ensured staff from all teams and  levels have access to representation  in health and safety and can be  consulted with effectively.

The  program has been renamed  as ‘Safety Connect Visit’ to  focus on dedicated leadership  engagement and connection  with frontline workers.  	 Review of the Just Culture  framework and instructions  in consultation with key  stakeholders to provide  action pathways for observed  behaviours.  	 We continued to provide our  flagship behaviour program,  ‘Switch On’, to all new starters.  We also reviewed feedback  from all attendees for future  improvement.  	 The Good Catch program  survey allowed for feedback and  reporting trends to improve the  program. Health and Wellbeing  Program  Our 2023 Health and Wellbeing  Program is a body of work focused  on enhancing, maintaining and  protecting the health and wellbeing  of our workers. It provides the  roadmap for meeting the objectives  of the broader People, Health and  Safety Strategy 2022–23 to 2023–24  regarding wellbeing, as well as  contributing to aspects of our  leadership, culture and performance  objectives. The program has been  recognised by the ACT Healthier  Work Program at Gold status (see  case study on page 33).  This year we:  	 Developed and commenced  the Icon Water Psychological  Health Framework detailing the  steps we are undertaking to  incorporate the identification  and control of psychological  hazards and risks into our  health and safety systems and  practices.  	 Redeveloped our Colleague  Support Network, an employee- led network that provides on the  ground support and guidance  across the business.  	 Continued to provide onsite  and community-based health  and fitness resources including  onsite physiotherapy, subsidised  gym memberships and  ergonomic assessments for  computer, vehicle and other  workspaces.  	 Developed a detailed tasks  library so we can better manage  the risks associated with  manual tasks, including being  able to place injured workers  more quickly into suitable and  meaningful roles while they  recover.  	 Maintained our active social club  which provides opportunities for  community building and social  connection across the business.  This includes charity fundraising  for local community groups and  awareness raising for relevant  social and health messaging  campaigns.  	 Continued our progress on  developing a comprehensive  five year Disability, Diversity,  Access and Inclusion Plan.  We are consolidating work done  to date to establish a consistent,  measurable and evidence-based  approach. 	 Continued to support the work  of our Reconciliation Action Plan  Working Group.  	 Developed thorough, accessible  and transparent processes for all  aspects of injury management  (early intervention, workers  compensation, income  protection and wellbeing  support) to ensure a smooth  transition of injury management  services from ActewAGL.  	 Continued our oversight of  and review into our health  monitoring program.  	 Developed and published an  inhouse health and wellness  newsletter promoting relevant  information and internal  resources to support good  health both within and outside  of the workplace.  	 Review of our fatigue  management practices and  ongoing work to develop  practical and effective guidance  material, tools and practices  to manage fatigue in the  workplace.  2022−23 Annual Report  32 32  ===== PAGE 35 ===== CASE STUDY ACT Government Healthier Work Program  Healthier Work (act.gov.au) is a  recognition and resources scheme  for ACT workplaces to promote  health and wellbeing across the  ACT. Icon Water had previously  been awarded Silver recognition  in 2019. Our new Health and  Wellbeing Program is structured  around three pillars of workplace  health: health promotion; injury  prevention; and responding  to incidents (including early  intervention, injury management,  rehabilitation and return to work),  and three domains of human  wellbeing: physical; psychological;  and sociocultural. This framework  encompasses activities that are both  proposed and underway and is a  comprehensive but cohesive suite  of activities with a clear purpose –  a happy healthy workforce.  Once this program was endorsed  by our Executive, we resubmitted  ourselves to the ACT Government  Healthier Work Program for review.  Under a revised set of criteria in the  new Healthier Work Program, we are  thrilled to have received Gold level  recognition for our approach and  initiatives in supporting the health  and wellbeing of our people. This  recognition emphasises the value  of having a structured and visible  Health and Wellbeing Program that  ensures a holistic and evidence- based approach to promoting health  for Icon Water employees.  Participation in the Healthier Work  Program also gives us access to  resources and supports to ensure  our ongoing best practice for  employee health and wellbeing. 33 33 Our strategic priorities: Year in review  ===== PAGE 36 ===== STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE ENHANCE CUSTOMER AND  COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT 34 2022−23 Annual Report  34  ===== PAGE 37 ===== STRATEGIC PRIORITY: STRATEGIC CUSTOMER AND  COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT We are committed  to delivering quality  products and services  that our customers and  community value.  This commitment is reflected  in our strategic objective to  enhance customer and community  engagement. We care about what our customers  think, and we show this by listening  to understand customer needs  and seeking their feedback on our  services and planning. We consider  the voice of the customer when we  make decisions and improve our  services, and we actively participate  as a member of our community to  foster a culture where we all care for  water. During 2022–23, we received over  80,000 customer calls (including  faults and emergencies, accounts  and general enquiries).  We are committed to appropriate  quality assurance, consistency in  billing practices, and clear and  helpful communication across every  channel. A survey of 300 residential  households and 200 businesses  indicated that 90 per cent of  our customers are satisfied with  our services. Our drinking water  continues to be highly regarded  with 91 per cent of our customers  satisfied with the quality. Let’s Talk Water and  Wastewater Our Let’s Talk Water and Wastewater  engagement activities are designed  to inform our strategic priorities and  investment decisions and support  a deeper understanding of our  customers.  We have engaged through multiple  channels including surveys, focus  groups, deep dive deliberative  processes and panels. Our customers have told us they  have clear expectations and  priorities for how we plan and  invest in the future. Water security,  environmental sustainability,  maintaining quality, maintaining  long-term affordability and being  more visible in the community  are the key areas of focus for our  customers. Our 2022–23 engagement program  sought engagement from the  community and stakeholders for two  significant projects for our primary  wastewater treatment plant, Lower  Molonglo Water Quality Control  Centre (LMWQCC).  This year, engagement has been  conducted over two phases. The  first phase included a Citizen Panel  with participants representing  all segments and demographics,  an Environmental Panel with  representatives from various  environmental groups, and an  Expert Panel – a group of eight  experts and academics in the  water cycle, the environment and  meteorology. 35 35 Our strategic priorities: Year in review  ===== PAGE 38 ===== The second phase of engagement  included a community survey and  presentations to various Community  Councils.  We have continued to promote Let’s  Talk Water and Wastewater across  available external forums to increase  the number of people it reaches.  We are also sharing insights with our  partners to identify mutual areas of  interest and responsibility. Community engagement  Our external education and  community support programs  are an integral component of our  vision ‘to be a valued partner in our  community’.  We inform and educate the  community about our services for  two primary reasons:  	 To encourage behaviour change  by highlighting the impacts  (financial, environmental and  safety) of individual behaviours  on our network services.  	 To increase water and  wastewater literacy by building  an understanding of the  wastewater network and our  water supply catchments, as well  as our role as Canberra’s water  and wastewater utility.  We provide information to  the community and where  possible direct access to specific  infrastructure particularly through  schools, tertiary institutions and  community organisations. We also  share information to the community  via our website and social media  channels including Facebook,  Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and  YouTube.  External education programs  Our education program provides  engaging water and wastewater  literacy programs to local schools  (primary, secondary schools and  tertiary students along with industry  and community groups). In doing  so we are building local knowledge  of the ACT and Queanbeyan urban  water network including source  water, water quality, the water and  wastewater treatment process,  catchment management, permanent  water conservation measures  (PWCMs), and the urban water cycle.  Even though our dams have been  full this year, it is important that we  build ongoing knowledge around  PWCMs and long-term, sustainable  water use.  Our Free the Poo campaign was  developed to build the community’s  awareness of our wastewater  systems. Key messaging for this  campaign highlights the impacts  of wet wipes, sanitary products  and other non-flushable items  on the wastewater network when  flushed down the toilet. This  messaging was illustrated though  the Gallery of Gross and the  Blockage Busters video series.  The campaign incorporates a  multifaceted communication  strategy including radio, social  media, a mobile application game,  out of home advertising (bus wraps  and messaging in shopping centres),  as well as promotion through our  community and education partners.  CASE STUDY External tours programs This year’s hybrid education  program incorporated digital  webinars and face-to-face sessions  in the classroom, and external  tours across our major water and  wastewater assets. Tours to water  and wastewater treatment plants  for secondary, tertiary students  and industry stakeholders proved  popular this year, with 102 site tours  delivered to 2,056 participants.  We continued our community tours  of the Cotter Pump Station for  ACT Heritage Week in April, and  welcomed six generations of Garett  Cotter’s family (whom the Cotter  River is known to be named after), to  the Cotter Dam in November 2022  for the bicentennial celebrations of  his arrival to the region in 1822. Our Cotter Dam Discovery Tours  (CDDT) and education excursions  remain popular for ACT and  Queanbeyan primary, secondary  students and community groups. The CDDT location provides  opportunity to engage audiences  in local water education to deliver  multiple consecutive tours and  educational activities to larger groups.  2022−23 Annual Report  36 36  ===== PAGE 39 ===== Tour programs  Our tour programs resumed in  semester one 2023. Guided tours  were made available across our  major plants including Mount  Stromlo Water Treatment Plant,  Lower Molonglo Water Quality  Control Centre, the Cotter and  Googong dams and Googong  Water Treatment Plant. We engaged  with secondary and tertiary students  as well as industry programs across  102 site tours to 2,056 participants.  The Cotter Dam Discovery Trail  tour remains popular for ACT and  Queanbeyan primary and secondary  students and community groups.  These education excursions allow  us to engage with larger groups  and teach the history of our water  supply through engaging education  activities.  To ensure these tours are accessible  to students of all socio-economic  backgrounds, this year we  supported six ACT and Queanbeyan  schools with a bus subsidy to attend  Cotter Dam excursions.  Unlike the dams within the Cotter  catchment, the Googong Dam  is publicly accessible for limited  recreational activities. As the  Googong community continues  to grow we maintain our focus  on protecting the quality of the  Googong catchment area. We  provide information on acceptable  recreation activities to residents of  the Googong township and visitors  to the area. We also work closely  with key stakeholders including  ACT Parks and Conservation, the  Googong Township Group and  Queanbeyan-Palerang Regional  Council. CASE STUDY STEM event Icon Water’s education program  was included as part of ACT STEM  education network’s STEM science  showcase at the Canberra Show in  February 2023.  Our Free the Poo video game and  our interactive catchment model,  provided an engaging experience  to over 65,000 children and families  who visited the showcase. The  three-day event provided the  opportunity to engage with the  Canberra community and build  water and wastewater literacy.  The audience were fascinated with  our jar tester display, which shows  exactly why some things should  not be flushed down the toilet. The  demonstration showed how badly  various well-known household  products like wet wipes, tissues and  paper towel break down once they  are flushed into the wastewater  network compared to toilet paper.  Our Gallery of Gross allowed us to  share front line images from our  crew members who are required to  clear avoidable blockages caused  by inappropriate items in the  wastewater network.  We know that if people understand  the impacts of their actions,  including risks to their own  plumbing, they are more likely  to commit to positive behaviour  change.  37 37 Our strategic priorities: Year in review  ===== PAGE 40 ===== Table 11: Consultations  Project  Consultation Process (tools used)  Groups or  Individuals consulted  Approx. number  consulted  Outcome  School and  community  education  program  	 Education sessions about urban  water cycle, Icon Water assets  and treatment processes 	 Digital school presentations  	 Education program newsletter  	 Use of website education  materials ACT and  Queanbeyan primary  and secondary  schools  Tertiary groups –  universities, CIT  Industry delegates  Community groups  and individuals ACT Government  145 sessions  direct 3,981 pax.  11 STEM  education events  63,700 pax.  4 newsletters  43,278 water  education web  page unique  visitors  Increased awareness of our  water catchments, the urban  water cycle and network Increased understanding of  water quality and treatment  processes, sustainability,  conservation and wastewater  drain care Contributed to the study of  various tertiary areas of study  including STEM, environment,  history, geography, plumbing Community  engagement  and awareness  program  	 Participation at local events  such as Floriade Community  and Lifeline’s Bookfairs 	 Participation in OzWater  conference  	 Community group talks  	 Advertising  	 Articles in publications  	 Flyers and brochures  	 Social media  	 Website  	 Media releases ACT residents and  visitors Interstate water  industry operators  and local trade  community Website and social  media users 150,000+ Relationship and awareness  building Increased knowledge of  services available and  importance of individual  responsibility in relation to the  network (water consumption,  drain care etc.) Brand  awareness and  engagement  	 Promotion of Icon Water  as Canberra’s water and  wastewater provider through  partnerships, media, social  media, website, stakeholder  and sponsorship engagement Customers and  community Website: over  812,840+ unique  visits Social media:  962,000  impressions Relationship building,  education, community support  and increased brand awareness Let’s Talk  Water and  Wastewater  Strategic  Engagement  Program 	 Surveys 	 Social media posts and polls 	 Deliberative deep-dive process 	 Presentation to environmental  and community groups 	 Icon Water Expert Panel 	 Stakeholder interviews Customers and  community Online survey  provided by  direct email  to 98,936  customers.

Our new Virtual Reality  (VR) experience gave student  attendees to Questacon’s Q Lab the  chance to virtually enter our sludge  holding tank to see first-hand how  wet wipes are removed, by hand,  from the network. While in the  queue, students were kept engaged  through watching the graphic VR  imagery that was displayed on  digital screens.  Our Free the Poo video game was  also a popular drawcard for many  kids. As were the experiments  run by Questacon staff such as  a water vortex, density column  (demonstrating how water from  different densities do not mix), an  upside-down water jar and walking  water demonstration. Over the week the combined  Questacon and Icon Water teams  engaged with over 7,600 visitors  including students from 17 school  groups, teachers and other visitors. Our sponsorship of Music by the  River allowed the Queanbeyan and  Canberra community to enjoy a  night under the stars like no other –  a free, family friendly event and an  uplifting experience.  Almost 5,000 people attended the  event (believed to be one of the  largest crowds ever seen on the  banks of the Queanbeyan River).  Crowds were entertained by the  Canberra Symphony Orchestra,  esteemed conductor George Ellis  with his band, and the talented  musician and songwriter, Darren  Percival, who delivered Elton John  classics, including the ultimate  crowd-pleaser ‘Rocket Man’. This event allows Icon Water and  the Queanbeyan-Palerang Regional  Council to celebrate our long  history together, as we close in on  100 years of providing water to the  Queanbeyan Community. The free  live music performance is presented  in partnership by Icon Water,  Queanbeyan Palerang Regional  Council and the Canberra Symphony  Orchestra. 39 39 Our strategic priorities: Year in review  ===== PAGE 42 ===== ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER  COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT As the ACT’s sole drinking  water and wastewater  provider, we embrace our  responsibility to respect  the rich Aboriginal culture  of the Canberra region,  and in particular the land  and waterways under our  management.  We continue to learn from First  Nations people with a connection  to the region about traditional water  and land management practices. In our operational work, we  understand that Aboriginal heritage  items and places exist on land and  waterways under our management.  Training and procedures continue  to be reinforced so staff are  empowered to identify and  protect items of cultural heritage  significance.  When designing and constructing  major infrastructure we perform  heritage assessments in consultation  with representative Aboriginal  organisations, where relevant, to  avoid and minimise impacts on  Aboriginal cultural heritage sites and  artefacts. Our Reflect Reconciliation Action  Plan (RAP) recognises that we are in  the early stages of our reconciliation  journey as we build the necessary  foundations for authentic and  meaningful reconciliation across our  business. During 2022–23, we progressed  several actions in our RAP and  continued activities towards our  goal of building strong working  relationships and engagement with  local Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander groups.  Together with the Upper  Murrumbidgee Catchment Network,  we supported a Cool Burn at  our Williamsdale Offset property  attended by ACT Government  stakeholders, sustainability groups  and local community members.  Ngunnawal Elder Wally Bell shared a  very personal and heartfelt Welcome  to Country and spent the morning  sharing his knowledge about the  traditional land-care approach  of using fire to selectively burn  small areas of vegetation. This was  done to control weed growth and  encourage new seasonal growth in  preferable native grass species.  Attendees had the opportunity to  experience the Cool Burn approach  first-hand and discuss many of the  traditional approaches to caring for  country.  2022−23 Annual Report  40 40  ===== PAGE 43 ===== This year we continued our  sponsorship of the Ngadyung  program with Dreamtime  Connections through our  Community Support Program.  The program is rolled out to ten  different schools each year and  involves an education session on  bush tucker plants found in the  local area, how to use the plants  and the tools traditionally used for  hunting and gathering. As part of  this program, we also hosted a bush  tucker education session for our  staff in our established bush tucker  garden at our Mitchell office. The  garden includes self-watering raised  wicking beds containing a range of  bush tucker/medicinal plants with  sandstone rocks used for seating to  form a yarning circle.  We held activities to celebrate  Reconciliation Week at both our  Lower Molonglo Water Quality  Control Centre and our Mitchell  office, bringing staff together to  learn about the history and cultural  significance of Welcome to and  Acknowledgement of Country. This  year, we also provided funding  support to the Belconnen Arts  Centre event NAIDOC in the North,  through the Community Support  Program.  The original artwork designed for  our RAP by Ngunnawal, Wiradjuri  and Kamilaroi artist, Lynnice Church,  represents the three rivers that  connect on Ngunnawal Country:  the Molonglo, Murrumbidgee and  Yass rivers. It now hangs proudly in  the foyer at our Mitchell building.  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  artwork also appears on some of our  fleet vehicles.  We continue to participate in the  Water Services Association of  Australia (WSAA) Reconciliation  Community of Practice to share  experiences and learnings with  industry peers. Senior leaders and  employees also had the opportunity  to participate in one of 19 Yarning  Circles held at the Australian Water  Association’s national Oz Water  event in May this year. Participants  were able to listen to indigenous  perspectives and share thoughts,  reflections and experiences in  progressing reconciliation. We actively acknowledge days and  weeks of significance to Aboriginal  and Torres Strait Islander peoples  on our social media channels  and internal communications and  encourage the use of Ngunnawal  language in greetings and  Acknowledgment of Country at  events and meetings.  41 41 Our strategic priorities: Year in review  ===== PAGE 44 ===== COMMUNITY SUPPORT PROGRAM  We have been part of the Canberra community for more than 100 years, and it is  important to us that our support extends beyond water and wastewater services.  One of the ways we do this is through our Community Support Program.  Through the program we provide  financial and in-kind assistance  to local organisations. We focus  particularly on supporting  organisations that deliver valuable  local community support services  and programs, as well as activities  that encourage community access  and participation. Our program is  open for community applications  in March and April each year. We  highlight our partnerships through  our website and across our social  media channels, as well as through  public relations and sponsored  media stories.  The program has two primary objectives: To meet the objectives  under the Territory-owned  Corporation Act 1990, ‘to show  a sense of social responsibility  by having regard to the  interests of the community  in which we operate and by  trying to accommodate and  encourage those interests’. To complement and progress  our Business Strategy goals  by providing a focused and  efficient program to promote  our brand and meet our  commitment to the community.  The guidelines we use to assess funding applications are published on our  website. During 2022–23 we committed $400,028 to sponsorships and  donations through 29 groups, individuals, and organisations. 1 2 2022−23 Annual Report  42 42  ===== PAGE 45 ===== Table 12: Community support  Organisation – event/donation 2022–23 1 Lifeline – Gala dinner, women of spirit awards and book fairs $50,000 2 Questacon – Aquarium exhibit, awareness and education about sustainable water practices  $40,000 3 Menslink – business breakfast and various campaigns $35,000 4 Catchment Studio  $25,525 5 OzHarvest  $20,000 6 Dementia Australia  $20,000 7 Karinya house for mothers and babies  $15,000 8 Domestic Violence Crisis Support (DVCS) – various campaigns $15,000 9 Royal Life Saving ACT – day at the lake/ACT water safety week $10,000 10 Kids in Care ACT – Christmas presents for kids in crisis $10,000 11 Roundabout Canberra – Sustainable recycling $9,090 12 Dreamtime Connections – Ngadyung program $7,000 13 Canberra Special Kids Christmas Party – Christmas party for kids with disabilities $6,363 14 ACT Chief Ministers Inclusion Awards  $5,000 15 Belconnen Arts NAIDOC week $4,000 16 Focus ACT – one + one ball $3,200 17 Every Chance – Sports registrations $3,200 18 Tennis ACT – Canberra Girls get Active event $3,000 19 2XX – radio landcare program  $1,650 20 The Salvation Army  $1,000 21 The CBR GALS  $1,000 Total $285,028 Table 13: Community inclusion  Organisation – event/donation 2022–23 1 Canberra Symphony Orchestra – Music by the River with QPRC $40,000 2 Rise Above Capital Regional Cancer Relief – Cancer Convoy $20,000 Total $60,000 Table 14: Affiliated industry partner  Organisation – event/donation 2022–23 1 Master Plumbers Association – awards nights and Icon Water community excellence award $20,000 2 Southern ACT Catchment Group  $12,000 3 Ginninderra Catchment Group – Frog Watch Program (schools’ education)  $10,000 4 Molonglo Conservation Group  $5,000 5 Australian Water Association – ACT Water Matters conference, Leaders dinner  $5,000 6 Conservation Council ACT – World Environment Day dinner $3,000 Total $55,000 43 43 Our strategic priorities: Year in review  ===== PAGE 46 ===== STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE DELIVER SUSTAINABLE VALUE FOR OUR  COMMUNITY AND SHAREHOLDERS 44 2022−23 Annual Report  44  ===== PAGE 47 ===== STRATEGIC PRIORITY: SUSTAINABILITY Sustainability is at the  heart of what we do.  Under this priority, we  focused on building  resilience to climate  change, reducing  our emissions and  contributing to a  regenerative circular  economy. Managing greenhouse gas  emissions and adapting to  climate change We continued to work on actions  that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)  emissions in our eMission Possible  Plan on our pathway to net zero  by 2045 and shared lessons learnt  through OzWater’23 and Next  Water’23 conference presentations. We progressed actions in the  third year of our Climate Change  Adaption Plan. We established  a replacement five-year Climate  Change Adaptation Plan – sustaining  resilience – that uses the latest  modelling data and consideration  of cascading impacts consistent  with the Intergovernmental Panel  on Climate Change Assessment  Report 6.  We continued our fugitive GHG  emissions project, monitoring  and measuring our nitrous oxide  emissions at LMWQCC, our  greatest generator of greenhouse  gas emissions. More information  on this is provided as a case study  in our research, development and  innovation section on page 49.  This information will help us review  our net zero pathway, particularly  in terms of identifying possible  mitigation measures to explore.  Our renewable energy systems  (our solar photovoltaic arrays and  mini-hydros) provided four per cent  of all electricity used on our sites.  As part of our net zero pathway we  transitioned 25 per cent of the grid  electricity used at our main NSW  sites to GreenPower™ and we have  a strategy in place to increase this  by 25 per cent per calendar year. This year we welcomed the  introduction of 100 per cent zero  emission battery electric vehicles  into our fleet with the acquisition of  two Kia Niro electric vehicles. These  vehicles form part of our pool fleet  where we continue to collect and  evaluate data on the effectiveness of  zero emissions vehicles for various  utility functions. In the second half  of this financial year our fleet team  have also secured two trials with  zero emission vans. We will continue  to seek feedback and conduct trials  to better understand appropriate fit  for purpose design and application  for our transition to net zero fleet. Overall, there was a three per cent  reduction in GHG emissions across  Icon Water. This was partly due to  reductions in the use of natural gas  and fuel oil in our LMWQCC furnace  and because we were able to  reduce the amount of biosolids that  were diverted from the furnace for  storage onsite. 45 45 Our strategic priorities: Year in review  ===== PAGE 48 ===== Managing resources in a  circular economy  Contributing to Canberra’s circular  economy and improving our  sustainability is pivotal to our  mission to sustain and enhance  quality of life. We continued to work  on actions in our Circular Economy  Plan, which takes a holistic view of  the resources we control and the  waste we generate.  We considered energy efficiency in  all our projects maintaining a steady  electricity consumption over the  year. We continued our focus on resource  recovery of our waste streams  and recycled 79 per cent of our  operational waste during 2022–23,  including:  	 Over 4,860 tonnes of biosolids- derived Agri-Ash was used as a  soil conditioner by local farmers.  When our heat treatment  process for biosolids is  disrupted, we need to stockpile  and treat onsite for around  two years before they can be  beneficially re-used. This year,  around 930 tonnes of biosolids  were beneficially re-used on  agricultural paddocks resulting  in diversion of this stream from  landfill.  	 On the back of a successful  waste concrete trial last year  wherein concrete, culverts and  pipes sorted from excavations  were crushed and reused in our  internal operations, around 480  tonnes of concrete was crushed  this year. This will be reused  onsite as laydown area material  along with stabilisation fill for  supporting pipe works. This has  resulted in us procuring less  virgin aggregate material for  use.  	 The amount of solids sent to  landfill from our water treatment  plants increased slightly from  last year. This is possibly due  to higher than usual rainfall in  certain months leading to higher  catchment runoff and thus  more turbid water received for  treatment. We are continuing  to explore reuse options for  our water treatment solids  which might include use as an  ingredient for topsoil, road base  or wetland media.  We have reduced the amount of  waste sent to landfill by 25 per cent  compared to the previous financial  year. This is largely because of the  significant reduction in the amount  of screenings being sent to landfill  (an 84 per cent reduction). Last  year, we faced maintenance issues  with our sludge holding tank as  it was nearing its end of life – so  to ease the load on the tank the  screenings had to be temporarily  sent to landfill. This year, as part  of our solids handling upgrade  project a new sludge holding tank  has been commissioned. The new  efficient equipment means we can  send screenings to the new sludge  holding tank with biosolids for  heat treatment, to become and be  re‑used as Agri-Ash.  We have also substantially  decreased our business’s metered  potable water consumption which  almost halved this year. This  reduction is mainly due to additional  monitoring which identified an  opportunity to address water lost  and reduce usage at the plant.  Some of the reduction is also due to  the pattern of wet weather and less  demand for potable water required  onsite. 2022−23 Annual Report  46 46  ===== PAGE 49 ===== Table 15: Sustainable development performance  Indicator as at 30 June Unit Current Previous Percentage  change Stationary energy usage  Electricity use Kilowatt hours 34,890,170 34,255,114 +2 Natural gas use (non-transport) Megajoules 41,824,941 42,179,530  -1 Diesel use (non-transport) Kilolitres 6.5 9.1  -33 Transport fuel usage  Battery electric vehicles  Number 2  0   NA Hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles Number 0 0 0 Plug in hybrid electric vehicles Number 1 1  0 Hybrid electric vehicles Number 2 0  NA Internal combustion engine Number 130 135 -4% Total number of vehicles Number 132 135  -2% Fuel use – Petrol Kilolitres 8.4 8.2  +2% Fuel use – Diesel Kilolitres 319.8 332.1  -4% Fuel use – Liquid petroleum gas  Kilolitres 0.1 0.1  0 Fuel use – Compressed natural gas  Gigajoules 0 0  0 Water usage Water use Kilolitres 64,628   121,262  -47% Resource efficiency and waste Reams of paper purchased Reams 475 673  -29% Recycled content of paper purchased1 Percentage 30% 43%  -30% Waste to landfill2 Tonnes 2601 3,472  -25% Co-mingled material recycled3 Tonnes 2.16 1.56  +38% Paper and cardboard recycled (incl. secure paper) Tonnes 13.25 9.97  +33% Organic material recycled4 Tonnes 0 0  0 Greenhouse gas emissions Emissions from natural gas use (non-transport) Tonnes CO2-e 2,703 2,726  -0.8 Emissions diesel use (non-transport) Tonnes CO2-e 22 26  -15% Emissions from transport fuel use Tonnes CO2-e 1,108 889  +25 Total emissions5 Tonnes CO2-e 17,997 18,593  -3% Additional table notes 	- Electricity use includes onsite renewable energy.  	- The total electricity use for the previous year has changed from 36,538,578 due to a recalculation once actual data became available.  	- This excludes direct water, gas and electricity consumption at the Bunda Street office (where Icon Water occupies one floor of a commercial office building).  	- Estimates are provided for 2022–23 resource efficiency and waste data as not all invoicing has been received at the time of data collection. 	- Waste to landfill includes general office waste, maintenance waste and treatment plant material disposed of to landfill including alum sludge, screening  material and security burial material. Waste to landfill data does not include legacy, project, construction and demolition waste data.  	- Total emissions also include fugitive nitrous oxide emissions. Fugitive nitrous oxide emissions have been calculated using the same approach as in  previous years for consistency.  1.	 30% of paper purchased contained 20% or more recycled content. The decrease in paper purchased during 2022–23 is likely due to digitisation of processes.  2.	 The reduction in waste to landfill is largely attributed to a significant reduction in the amount of screenings being sent to landfill.  3.	 The increase in comingled along with paper and cardboard recycling is likely to be due to an increase in staff returning to the office and the addition of  new commingled and paper and cardboard facilities introduced in Mitchell office.  4.	 Organic material (food waste from kitchen) is now being picked up from Mitchell office.  5.	 Emissions from grid electricity in the ACT have been assumed to be zero. NGERS emissions factors for Scope 2 and National Greenhouse Accounts  emissions factors for Scope 3 have been used for NSW grid electricity. These figures exclude methane and furnace stack emissions.  47 47 Our strategic priorities: Year in review  ===== PAGE 50 ===== Research, development and  innovation We approach research, development  and innovation as enablers of  change in areas that support us  to deliver our core purpose and  essential services and prepare us for  strategic challenges in the future. We provide funding, in-kind support  and share scientific understanding  with other ‘can do’ collaborative  partners and leading research  institutions to solve problems  relevant to our community and  industry. Our partners include universities,  peer utilities and industry  associations such as the Water  Services Association of Australia  (WSAA) and Water Research  Australia (Water RA). These  relationships give us access  to international projects and  knowledge via Cooperative  Research Centres (CRCs), the Water  Environment Research Foundation,  International Water Association, the  Smart Water Fund and individual  Australian Research Council (ARC)  projects. This allows us to influence,  drive and leverage projects through  collaborative funding models. We  are also a member of the Australian  Water Association’s Australian and  New Zealand Biosolids Partnership  collaborating on wastewater  biosolids and biochar.  In 2022–23, we contributed to  the following notable research,  development and innovation  projects: 	 In partnership with the University  of Canberra, we continued our  focus on eDNA to provide more  precise presence and absence  data and quicker sampling times  for Macquarie perch. We also  expanded the ‘Environmental  DNA (eDNA) techniques for  monitoring Macquarie perch  translocation’ program to use  eDNA to identify carp in farm  dams near and upstream of  Googong reservoir. 	 We initiated a WSAA project  with peer utilities and Griffith  University to research and  develop an industry paper on  nutrient trading regimes. The  report, ‘How a nutrient trading  regime can deliver environmental  outcomes’, was released in  March 2023. The paper outlines  the environmental, social  and economic benefits of  catchment-scale nutrient offset  options for resilient regions  and includes Australian and  international case studies. The  report has initiated discussions  between government and  catchment groups on the  potential application in the ACT  region for realising improved  catchment condition. 	 Two research projects,  awarded through the Perpetual  Endowment Fund, established  with the Australian National  University (ANU) to support  water sustainability research  projects, commenced in  2021–22, and continued through  2022–23: 	- A research project conducting  plant growth trials using  biochar derived from our  biosolids from LMWQCC on  wheat and pine seedlings.  This involves maximising  phosphorus availability  from biosolids through the  production of biochar.  	- A research project to  improve understanding  and incorporation of runoff  non-recovery in source water  models for improved water  security. 	 We continued and extended  our participation in the ARC  Nutrients in a Circular Economy  (NiCE) Hub. Our participation  is centred on investigating  the fugitive greenhouse gas  emissions of nitrous oxide from  wastewater treatment processes,  due to the presence of nutrients  (nitrogen) in the influent, and  how they might be reduced  while not jeopardising other  environmental outcomes.  	 We continued our work on two  linked research programs with  the University of Queensland,  WaterRA and several peer  water utilities, assessing ways  to effectively monitor and  mitigate fugitive greenhouse  gas emissions from wastewater  treatment processes as part  of our net zero commitment  (referred to in our Case Study). 	 Our bid for $34.5 million  to establish CRC Solving  Antimicrobial Resistance  in Agribusiness, Food and  Environments was successful,  with WaterRA the nominated  representative on the Research  and Commercialisation  Committee. This project will  enable us to leverage, influence  and access research in managing  the emerging challenge of  antimicrobial resistance. This  project is expected to support  our approach to both source  water catchment protection and  our non-potable water, effluent  discharge and biosolids-derived  products from wastewater  treatment. 	 We continued resource  recovery trial projects. This  includes looking at options for  wastewater treatment plant  solids including blending  biosolids with hydromud spoil.  This generates a topsoil for  reuse on site. A trial to reuse  water treatment solids as water  wetland media for water quality  improvement or potential as  road base around lagoons or  on Icon Water’s tracks was also  conducted. 2022−23 Annual Report  48 48  ===== PAGE 51 ===== We share our knowledge and  expertise through conference  presentations, industry papers and  publications.  	 In 2022–23, we presented on  the following around our fugitive  greenhouse gas emissions  research and development work: 	- At OzWater’23, we co-hosted  a panel with Melbourne  Water discussing net zero  emissions efforts under the  ARC NiCE Hub. 	- We presented our nitrous  oxide emission monitoring  project findings with  Associate Professor Liu  Ye from the University of  Queensland (UQ) at the  WSAA Climate Change,  Energy and Environment  network meeting in  November 2023. 	- We presented the results  and challenges of the nitrous  oxide monitoring project  at NextWater in February  2023 with Ms Kaili Li (PhD  candidate from UQ).  	 We presented at the 2023 ACT  Water Matters Conference in  June 2023 on three topics:  Canberra’s water security in a  climate change future; How  a nutrient trading regime can  deliver environmental outcomes;  and Balancing water security  and environmental biodiversity:  a win-win for regional water  supply and fish conservation. 	 As project coordinator, we  opened the online launch of  WSAA’s Australia Nutrient  Offset Report in March 2023 in  partnership with the Australian  Rivers Institute at Griffith  University and water industry  peers.  	 We attended and presented at  a launch event for the Australian  Biochar 2030 roadmap in June  2023 focusing on establishing a  market for the growing biochar  industry. We continued to participate in  various WSAA groups such as the  Research Managers Network and  Innovation Network, WaterRA  forums and W-Lab (the platform  for showcasing the latest advances,  innovations and international  water utility technologies). Our  involvement included:  	 participation in the Steering  Committee for ARC Industrial  Transformation Training Centre  for Transformation of Australia’s  Biosolids Resource (ITTC  Biosolids) Project 1A – Novel  Biosolids, processing routes for  next generation, high quality  products.  	 participation in a joint WSAA  Modern Slavery Working Group  and the Climate Change, Energy  and Environment Network.  	 contributing to a multi-utility  team in the W-Lab Technical  Advisory Group on net zero  technologies which is expected  to lead to technology trials  at various utilities in the near  future. Commissioner for  Sustainability and the  Environment We sought input and feedback from  the Commissioner for Sustainability  and the Environment during the  development of our second version  of the Climate Change Adaptation  Plan – securing resilience. Advice was provided to the  Commissioner on the technology  selection and intent for further  community engagement on the  bioreactors secondary wastewater  treatment process and biosolids  treatment projects at our LMWQCC  facility.  49 49 Our strategic priorities: Year in review  ===== PAGE 52 ===== STRATEGIC PRIORITY: 2023–28 PRICE REVIEW  The prices that Icon Water  can charge for water and  wastewater services in the  ACT are regulated by the  Independent Competition  and Regulatory  Commission (ICRC).  In May 2018, the ICRC issued its  five-yearly price direction, which set  the path for Icon Water’s prices for  the period 1 July 2018 to 30 June  2023. Each year in this period, the  ICRC updates the prices to account  for actual inflation, government  charges, and market factors.  In 2022–23, the annual water  and wastewater bills for a typical  Canberra household using 200 kL  of water per year decreased by 2.2  per cent, roughly 50 cents less per  week. The lower prices are primarily  due to market factors and reduced  payments for the ACT Government’s  Water Abstraction Charge due to  the ACT’s lower water consumption  in the 2021–22 financial year.  Independent Competition  and Regulatory Commission  2023–28 water and  wastewater price investigation   The ICRC concluded its 2023–28  water and wastewater price  investigation, and in May 2023  issued its five-year price decision,  which sets the path for Icon Water  for the period 1 July 2023 – 30 June  2028.   The ICRC’s final decision considered  the investments outlined in our  price proposal that are necessary  for us to continue providing reliable  water and wastewater services to  our community. These investments  focus on the services our customers  told us they value most: reliable  water and wastewater services;  quality drinking water; affordable  pricing; and responsive customer  service. At the same time, we will  respond to major factors influencing  our operating environment,  allowing us to proactively make  plans for our ageing infrastructure  while supporting a growing ACT  population and mitigating the  effects of climate change. The  ICRC’s final decision includes  approximately $717 million of  capital investment over the 2023–28  regulatory period. Our pricing process overview  and the full price proposal and  submission to the ICRC’s draft  decision are available at iconwater. com.au/pricing. The final decision means an increase  in the prices our customers pay  for water and wastewater services  for the next five years. A typical  household consuming 200 kL  of water per year would see an  increase of 6.1 per cent each year.  Prices are rising due to recent high  inflation and an increase in capital  spending. These factors have been  partially offset by the growth in  Canberra’s population and the ability  to spread these increased costs  across a broader customer base.  Each year in the 2023–28 regulatory  period, the ICRC will update prices  to account for actual inflation,  government charges, and market  factors. As part of the price direction for the  2023–28 regulatory period, the ICRC  also made a commitment to conduct  a review of the sewerage tariffs  charged by Icon Water, this will likely  occur in the coming years. 2022−23 Annual Report  50 50  ===== PAGE 53 ===== STRATEGIC PRIORITY: REVIEW THE  CORPORATE SERVICE MODEL  ActewAGL has historically  provided corporate  and customer services  to Icon Water through  the Corporate Services  Agreement (CSA) and  Customer Services and  Community Support  Agreement (CSCSA).  The CSA expired on 30 June 2023,  and following an agreement to  extend the transition period, we are  now working towards completing  transition by 31 December 2024.  In preparation for the expiry of  the CSA, Icon Water stood up a  Transition Program to implement the  Board-approved sourcing strategy  for those services covered under the  former CSA contracts.  In 2021–22, a new Retail Customer  Service Agreement (RCSA) with  ActewAGL was executed. The RCSA  continues services related to meter  reading, billing and related customer  contact, accounts receivable and  credit management. In 2021–22,  Icon Water also approached the  market and signed contracts with  service providers for the delivery  and continued operations of ICT  services, networks, and the financial  information management system. During 2022–23, we have continued  to make progress towards delivering  the approved sourcing strategy  including engaging new strategic  advisory services and an approach  to engage a Transition Program  Management Office and Systems  Integrator service provider to  ensure the continued success of the  Transition Program. Whilst we are well positioned to  transition a number of corporate  services at or shortly after expiry  of the CSA, more complex  and integrated services will be  transitioned in 2024. To support  the successful transition of these  services a new governance model  was developed and implemented to  create further efficiencies through  greater consistency across all CSA  services. This will also increase  continuous improvement and  strategic benefits through aligning  this program to the Digital Strategy.  The benefit of this approach is to  position the organisation to provide  a modern, digital service experience  for both employees and customers.

Our Digital Strategy also supports  the corporate sourcing strategy,  reducing risk and maximising  opportunities of the transition  from the CSA and CSCSA to new  arrangements. During 2022–23, the second tranche  of work under the Digital Strategy  commenced delivering outcomes  for the business. We also concluded  the first Cyber Security Strategy and  accompanying roadmap to further  improve our cyber-preparedness and  ensure our compliance with Security  of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018  obligations.  Throughout 2022–23 we delivered  the following upgrades and new  capabilities: 	 Work and Asset Management  System upgrades and  enhancements. We have  made version upgrades to  modules of our works and asset  management system to maintain  support and take advantage  of new features. This included  enhancements to support  additional work types in the  system. 	 Modern ways of working. We  have adopted modern ways of  working and mitigating security  risks by implementing the  following upgraded Microsoft  capabilities: 	- Exchange Online migration  – We retired an unsupported  platform for managing our  email services and migrated  all users to Microsoft’s latest  offerings via Exchange  Online. 	- Office365 and OneDrive  migration – We have  implemented a simple  and secure platform for  users to create, store and  collaborate on content at the  enterprise level. This has also  assisted with flexible work  arrangements for our staff. 	 Noggin upgrade and  compliance management  system upgrades. We have  made upgrades to our incident  and compliance management  systems, migrating to more  secure and flexible versions of  these systems. 	 Cyber safety campaign.  An ongoing program has  commenced to improve the  knowledge and awareness  of our staff in the threats and  tactics faced whilst using  computer systems. Achieved  through the use of an online  training platform and a regular  communications campaign and  pivoting the overall messaging  to align with our strong safety  heritage. 	 Cyber security (identity access  management). We established  foundational capability for  identity and access management  across our environments. Key  deliverables included reviewing  legislative requirements, and  then developing a governance  framework and the policy and  processes that will help us  effectively manage identities  and access to our environment  and managed services. 	 Customer management platform  implementation. This is a multi- staged project that involves  establishing a new platform to  improve the user experience  for specific customer types  including developers, building  applicants, and those submitting  connection requests and  approvals. Later stages of the  project will focus on improving  customer complaints and liquid  trade waste management as  part of our essential services. 	 Customer complaints system.  We have decommissioned our  20 year old customer complaints  management system and  developed an interim system  in readiness to migrate to the  new customer management  platform. 	 Encrypted telemetry network.  We have replaced obsolete base  stations and radio equipment  with contemporary equipment  that meets the requirements for  communications, monitoring  and field operation.  In addition, a Change Management  Model and supporting Change  Strategy were developed and  implemented to improve consistency  and standardise our approach  to managing the people side of  change for projects and initiatives  under the Digital Program. To date,  the Change Management Model has  been applied to over 30 projects,  creating opportunity for people  across the business to collaborate,  engage in continuous conversations,  and provide valuable insights to  projects so that we can change at  pace and be able to sustain business  outcomes. 2022−23 Annual Report  52 52  ===== PAGE 55 ===== STRATEGIC PRIORITY: DATA  GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT  In 2022–23, we  developed an enterprise  data governance and  management framework,  a key step in improving  our data governance  maturity.  The Data Governance Framework  was co-designed with the business  and with external expertise to  ensure we created one that was fit- for-purpose. This included: 1.	 Discovery. Seek to  understanding the data  landscape, key stakeholders and  business sentiment. 2.	 Role definition. Define and  assign data governance roles  and responsibilities, including a  data governance committee. 3.	 Maturity assessment. Assess  baseline and target maturity  levels for data governance, that  are realistic and achievable. 4.	 Processes and tools. Design  Icon Water’s Data Governance  Framework, and develop  templates and process outlines  to support the model. 5.	 Roadmap. Document a clear  set of activities to realise data  governance objectives and  maturity level. Part of the process included a clear  focus on our people, aligning to our  Digital Strategy, aligning to the ACT  Government’s Data Governance  and Management Framework and  assessing tools which will support  our data governance capabilities. The approved Data Governance  Framework is shown in Figure 7. The Data Governance Framework  is aimed to provide a common  understanding of data in our  organisation, and a consistent  structure to manage it. This includes:  	 Clarity around the roles  and responsibilities for data  management, ensuring  accountability for all data  domains.  	 A common set of processes  for analysing, improving and  maintaining data.  	 Communication of expectations  for how data should be  collected and managed through  its lifecycle.  A Data Governance Committee  has been established to oversee  the implementation of the  Data Governance Framework  and support the establishment  of data governance roles and  responsibilities. The framework is  being piloted with an initial two  domains, with a view to learn,  iterate and continue to other rollout  thereafter.

As our assets age, ongoing  operations and maintenance  can become more challenging  and costly. So we can maintain  service levels for our customers,  we must continue to prioritise  upgrades and modernisation  our assets. Our strategic asset  management approach ensures that  our investments are thoughtfully  evaluated to deliver long-term  sustainable value to our community.  Asset management  Our Asset Management System  (AMS) underpins our ability to  provide affordable, resilient and  reliable services to the community. We are committed to continually  improving our AMS and asset  management capability to align  with the international standard  AS/NZS55001 and associated  supporting standards (see Figure 8).  We have made improvements to  several of the seven elements of our  AMS.  We continued to improve how we  plan and deliver assets to provide  resilient and reliable services. The  focus in 2022–23 has been on  continuous improvements in several  of the elements of our AMS, as  follows:  Organisation and people  We undertook quantitative and  qualitative engagement on customer  expectations for services, and  the balance of pricing, planning  and service levels. We used this  information to update our targeted  service levels and proposed revised  service outcomes as part of our  2023–28 price proposal.  Strategy and planning  We have started to implement our  Integrated Water Management  Program (IWMP) to ensure future  investment decisions consider the  whole water cycle. The IWMP has  been developed from our water,  wastewater and non-drinking water  service strategies and drought  management plan activities. Governance arrangements have  been established to provide  oversight and accountability for  the IWMP. Priority activities have  been identified for 2022–23 to  2023–24 to support informed and  timely decisions on our next water  source, preferred wastewater system  strategic pathways and drought  response actions. We are continuing  to work closely with the Office of  Water, Utilities Technical Regulation  and the Environmental Protection  Agency on key issues related to  water security and wastewater  strategic planning.  2022−23 Annual Report  54 54  ===== PAGE 57 ===== Asset decision-making  We have reviewed and updated  the asset models for our network  of water and wastewater pipes.  These have been used to estimate  future customer service levels under  varying levels of interventions and  renewals. This has supported our  decision-making and allowed us to  optimise our intervention programs  to optimally balance current  customer prices and longer-term  service impacts.  Asset creation  We have standardised and improved  our asset creation by updating and  publishing our asset standards.  We have introduced three new  standards associated with: 	 managing electrical hazards near  metallic pipelines  	 minimum technical requirements  for new reservoirs  	 establishing sustainability  guidelines for design.  We have also updated existing  Icon Water standards and our water  network design requirements to  reflect updates to technical codes  and in response to stakeholder  feedback.  These standards work together to  ensure that the assets designed  and accepted by Icon Water will  minimise ongoing service and  operating risks and costs, particularly  where infrastructure is gifted to us as  part of a development.  Maintain and protect  We have reviewed and updated our  condition monitoring framework.  This includes updating the methods  used for condition assessment  including vibration monitoring and  thermography. This will allow for  consistent, modern and systematic  application of condition monitoring  across all our assets, and early  detection and intervention of asset  issues, which in turn reduces the  number of unplanned outages. Over  time this will improve both customer  service levels and efficiency. Operations  We have addressed gaps in  our asset data. As many assets  were installed prior to modern,  computerised information systems,  there were some information gaps.  We have undertaken site visits and  resolved these gaps and provided  this information in verified systems  of records. This is an ongoing area  of focus.

Most significantly we have continued  a major program of works at the  Lower Molonglo Water Quality  Control Centre (LMWQCC).  LMWQCC, our primary sewage  treatment plant, was constructed in  the 1970s.  Now in its sixth decade, significant  components of the plant have  needed to be replaced due to age,  increasing risk of failure, cost to  maintain, and to continue to meet  environmental regulations. In 2022–23, we continued or  completed the following major  projects:  High voltage asset renewal  This project will address reliability issues related to ageing electrical  infrastructure.  Extensive early procurement of long lead time items is complete.  Construction work is progressing well on site with excavation  activities associated with the installation of a new electrical ring  main, which will provide redundancy of power supply at the plant. $47.6m  Estimated total  project value Anticipated  construction  period:  FY22-FY24 Solids handling This project had multiple parts including furnace and exhaust  upgrades, screening and ventilation upgrades, centrifuge  replacement and a new sludge holding tank. The project delivered a  more reliable and consistent solids feed to the furnaces, improving  its efficiency. All projects have been completed.  $102.0m  Estimated total  project value Construction  period:  FY17-FY23 Tertiary filters and disinfection upgrade  This project involved renewal of the tertiary treatment filtration  system. These assets had not had a major renewal since installation  in the late 1970s.  This project has been completed. $42.6m  Estimated total  project value Construction  period:  FY19-FY23 2022−23 Annual Report  56 56  ===== PAGE 59 ===== Other capital works projects  Belconnen trunk sewer upgrades Wastewater from Belconnen and Gungahlin is collected and  conveyed via the Belconnen trunk sewer to the Ginninderra sewer  tunnel and then to LMWQCC for treatment. The Belconnen trunk sewer was constructed in the 1960s and  increased capacity was needed to meet current and future  population growth. As well as improving capacity, the network will  be upgraded to include extra ventilation and odour control units to  protect new and existing infrastructure and improve the amenity of  existing and future communities. Construction has progressed in 2022–23 with completion of the  trunk sewer and the first of the Odour Control Units (OCUs).  Completion of the remaining OCUs and project commissioning will  continue into 2023–24. $34.1m  Estimated total  project value Anticipated  construction  period:  FY21-FY24 Cotter Pump Station upgrade The Cotter Pump Station supplies raw water from either the Cotter  Dam or the Murrumbidgee River to Stromlo Water Treatment Plant.  Access to this water supply is reliant on the pump station. The upgrade will ensure the ongoing reliability of this ageing asset  which is critical to water security. The project involves constructing a new building, plus two new  pumps, a high voltage switch room and supply and discharge  manifolds. The new pump station will provide redundant pumping  capacity and allow for decommissioning of the historic Cotter Pump  Station (Cotter WPS No.1).  Detailed design is completed, and construction will commence early  2023–24 with construction completion expected in 2024–25.  $26.0m  Estimated total  project value Anticipated  construction  period:  FY23-FY24 Water meter upgrades Our annual water meter and service upgrade program continued in  2022–23.  We replaced 10,390 meters in the planned replacement program  (9,727 small and 663 large meters). In addition, there were 395  reactive meter replacements to rectify meters that had failed.  1,584 new meters (small and large) were issued for new building  development projects.  The total number of meters replaced and issued was 12,369 which  is a 48 per cent increase from the previous year, largely due to the  shortfall in the previous year as a result of COVID-19 impacts. Of the  total, 84 per cent were planned, three per cent were reactive and 13  per cent were new meters issued.  $18.5m  Estimated total  project value Ongoing  program 57 57 Our strategic priorities: Year in review  ===== PAGE 60 ===== O’Connor reservoir roof replacement and floor  sealing The O’Connor reservoir, with a capacity of 27.3 ML, was built in  1958 to supply the North Canberra pressure zone. Due to its age,  both the roof structure and the floor joints had suffered significant  deterioration.  The construction of the O’Connor reservoir roof replacement  commenced in 2021–22 with replacement of the roof structure  and renewal of the floor joints. Commissioning was completed in  2022–23.  $7.5m  Total project  value Construction  period:  FY22-FY23 LMWQCC biosolids management renewal The LMWQCC biosolids management renewal project is a renewal- driven upgrade of the biosolids treatment and management  infrastructure. The furnaces have been in operation since the 1970s  and are nearing their end of nominal service life.  The project business case was endorsed in 2022–23 and the project  has moved to the plan stage.  ~$182m  Estimated total  project value Anticipated  construction  period:  FY25-FY28 LMWQCC secondary treatment bioreactors  The LMWQCC Secondary Treatment Bioreactors project is proposed  to address the region’s population growth by augmenting the  secondary treatment bioreactor capacity to accommodate ACT  population projections. The project business case was endorsed in 2022–23 and the project  has moved to the plan stage. ~$290m  Estimated total  project value Anticipated  construction  period:  FY26-FY30 2022−23 Annual Report  58 58  ===== PAGE 61 ===== CORPORATE  GOVERNANCE AND  ACCOUNTABILITY 59 59 Corporate governance and accountability  ===== PAGE 62 ===== THE BOARD At 30 June 2023, the Icon  Water Board comprised  eight Directors: seven  non-Executive Directors  and the Managing  Director.

Superannuation contributions are generally made in accordance with tax concession guidelines.  Individual Non-Executive Directors may obtain approval from the Australian Tax Office to be exempt from receiving superannuation contribution  payments from Icon Water due to these obligations being met by other employers. Where this occurs, the obligatory superannuation contribution is paid  directly to the individual Non-Executive Director as cash and included within their total fees payment. 2	 Ray Hezkial, Gerard Brierley and Alison Pratt utilised their excess recreation leave balances during this financial year which has been offset from their salary and  fees payment. 3	 Mark Mulligan commenced employment as General Manager People, Health & Safety on 5 September 2022. The Voting Shareholders determine remuneration for Icon Water Board Directors. Board Committee members and  Directors of Icon Distribution Investments Limited and Icon Retail Investments Limited are not separately remunerated.

Effective risk management increases  the probability of successful  outcomes while protecting the  community and our business  operations. A key initiative this year was to align  our Risk Management Framework  (the framework) to the International  Standard on Risk Management  ISO 31000:2018. The framework  identifies why we undertake risk  management and how we are  expected to do so. It integrates  risk management practices into  governance practices, informal and  formal decision-making, business-as- usual and audit activities within our  strategic business planning, policy  advice and project management.  Other risk activities undertaken in  2022–23: 	 Over 100 risk workshops were  provided to staff to collaborate  in the risk assessment process  supporting better decisions about  actions to take on risk. 	 We delivered training and  refresher sessions on risk  management, focusing on  applying these processes to  enhance internal business  practices. This training provided  a foundation to recognise and  understand how managing risk  impacts and benefits individuals  and the organisation. 	 We empowered the business to  take greater ownership on risk  assessment information drawn  from subject matter experts  from within the business. This  has improved the quality of  the information and created a  proactive approach to managing  risk. 	 The introduction of risk  champions, which has improved  the commitment by risk owners  to manage their risks within their  own business areas. This has  resulted in improved accuracy of  risk information and enhanced  communication of risk data across  the business. 	 Enterprise risk reviews were  conducted across seven  enterprise risk themes and  13 enterprise risks. Key  improvements have seen a  greater emphasis on the use of  strategic ‘parent’ controls with  operational and tactical ‘child’  controls and the introduction  of control effectiveness against  critical controls with appointed  control owners. The outcomes  of the enterprise risk reviews  are provided to the Board  throughout the year. The revised  process saw improvement in  broader management inclusion in  developing the risk assessments  and elevated the enterprise risk  information to align with the  strategic level of the Board. 2022−23 Annual Report  70 70  ===== PAGE 73 ===== ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT We are committed  to protecting the  environment and  improving sustainability  for our business and our  community.  This is articulated through our  Sustainability and Environment  Policy which is underpinned  by our certified Environmental  Management System. Through  this financial year, we continued  to implement a wide range of  environmental and sustainability  programs and initiatives, achieving  legislative compliance and making  positive change. Environmental compliance  Environmental compliance is critical  to our business, and we continued  to comply with all environmental  licences, environmental discharge  requirements and legal obligations  this year, despite continued  challenges from major rainfall  events.  We incorporated ecologically  sustainable development in  decision-making, as required under  the Territory-owned Corporations Act  1990 (ACT), through completion of  21 sustainability assessments which  consider environmental and social  impacts and opportunities in capital  infrastructure project planning. We aligned with our general  environmental duty under ACT,  NSW and Commonwealth  environmental legislation through  completion of seven Development  Application approvals, four National  Capital Authority Works’ approvals,  four Environmental Significance  Opinions, two Nature Conservation  Licences, two Letter of Design  Reviews, and one Environmental  Protection and Biodiversity  Conservation Act Self-Referral for  our activities. Catchments and waterways  Healthy catchments and ecosystems  are essential to our work. We  conducted inspections of all major  reservoirs and water protection  zones to ensure the safety of  our drinking water supply. These  assessments comply with our  Source Water Protection Strategy  and will inform our formal triennial  catchment sanitary survey in 2024.  We have undertaken several  environmental programs on our  Williamsdale biodiversity offset  property, including erosion and  sediment control, invasive species  management, and riparian area  fencing.  71 71 Corporate governance and accountability  ===== PAGE 74 ===== These programs help improve the  property’s environmental condition  and demonstrate our commitment  to source water protection. We  also continued to trial intermittent  livestock grazing at our sites to  reduce bushfire fuel, better manage  invasive weed species, and decrease  the cost of maintaining the grounds.  We continue to deliver conservation  and rehabilitation programs to  help protect threatened species  in our water sources. As part of  these efforts we have been working  with the University of Canberra  to monitor protected fish species  in the Cotter catchment using  environmental DNA monitoring  techniques. We have extended this  program to identify carp in farm  dams near and upstream of the  Googong reservoir. Our ongoing  monitoring of Macquarie perch  in the Cotter reservoir and Cotter  River throughout 2022–23 show  adult numbers are stable and the  spawning stage has been successful  for the sixth consecutive year. We continued to participate in  various catchment management  forums and community events to  influence source water protection.  Through our involvement in the  ACT and Region Catchment  Management Coordination Group  we continued assistance in the  implementation of relevant actions  in the ACT Water Strategy 2014–44  and the ACT and Region Catchment  Strategy. CASE STUDY Innovative fish conservation On World Environment Day (5 June  2023), we launched our Balancing  water security and environmental  biodiversity. The publication  summarises our efforts to conserve  threatened fish populations over  the life of the enlarged Cotter Dam.  This work has been conducted in  partnership with ACT Parks and  Conservation Services and the  University of Canberra. While it’s  been almost 10 years since the  completion of the Cotter Dam  enlargement, we have maintained a  constant focus on fish management  to ensure the conservation of  aquatic species, including several  threatened species, in their Cotter  reservoir habitats. This award-winning fish  management program comprised  18 research projects, and included  regular surveys and long-term  aquatic monitoring, and the  completion of various construction  projects to mitigate the risks of the  inundation and provide a more  protective environment for these  threatened fish populations. Some of the 18 projects included: 	 Building a seven km artificial  freshwater rock reef in the  inundation zone – a world first  – as a substitute for the fringing  aquatic plants used by the  Macquarie perch to shelter from  cormorants. 	 Installing fishways (also known  as fish ladders) above the dam  to open a substantial area in the  Cotter River as spawning habitat  for the Macquarie perch. 	 Salvaging rubbish from the  waterways so the area was left  in a better state than before  we started the project. This  included removing ten dumped  vehicles from the Cotter River,  which were compromising water  quality and biodiversity health. 	 Installing more than 50 large  scale erosion and sediment  control structures around the  dam, including restoring native  vegetation cover, stabilising  drainage lines with rocks and  limiting activities that cause  erosion and sedimentation. 	 Preventing disease by  removing invasive fish caught  between the old Cotter Dam  and construction of the new  dam wall; establishing strict  requirements for all personnel  working near or in the water  to avoid contamination; and  disinfecting the stream bed to  kill potential pathogens and  the Epizootic Haematopoietic  Necrosis virus (known to kill  Macquarie perch).  	 Monitoring fish populations  each year and seeing a healthy  and self-sustaining Macquarie  perch population thrive with  good fish management. The project proved balancing  water security and biodiversity  conservation in managed freshwater  systems is possible – with effective  collaboration.  Balancing water   security and environmental  biodiversity A win-win for regional water supply and fish conservation 2022−23 Annual Report  72 72  ===== PAGE 75 ===== BUSHFIRE RISK MANAGEMENT  Bushfires pose a potential  threat to our operations  which is managed  through an annual works  program, known as the  Bushfire Operational Plan  (BOP). These works primarily involve  removing vegetation to meet  the requirements of the ACT  Government’s Strategic Bushfire  Management Plan and the specific  bushfire protection needs of our  water and wastewater assets.  The 2022–23 BOP identified 62  hazard reduction works to be  completed at major treatment  plants, water mains, service  reservoirs, pump stations, weather  stations, power lines, access roads  and other critical assets. All 62  works have been completed in the  financial year and an additional 20  sites requiring work outside of the  scheduled BOP were completed.  The BOP is approved by the  ACT Emergency Services Agency  Commissioner, with lists of  completed works reported to the  Commissioner on a quarterly basis. The Bureau of Meteorology’s  forecast of potential impacts for the  2022–23 high risk weather season  was used in the review of bushfire  scenarios and environmental  conditions to assist business  preparations. Several employees were trained  in basic wildfire awareness  (accredited) and bushfire awareness,  which improves staff safety and  strengthens interoperability with fire  agencies during bushfire response  and recovery operations. 73 73 Corporate governance and accountability  ===== PAGE 76 ===== RESILIENCE Icon Water has  implemented a holistic  resilience program, that  incorporates emergency,  business continuity, and  security functions. The program includes the  preparation of response and  recovery plans and related support  documentation, training, internal  audit and review mechanisms, and  an exercise regime that meets the  requirements of relevant ACT and  NSW legislation and emergency  management best practice. Operationally, the business  responded to six emergency  incidents and prepared for twelve  potentially disruptive events. The  number of incidents and events  was higher than the average,  primarily due to the La Niña climatic  conditions. Eight exercises were conducted  over the year, and a number of staff  undertook Australasian Inter-Service  Incident Management System  (AIIMS) training, Liaison Officer  training and qualified as AIIMS Level  2 Incident Controllers. The exercise  and training program is designed to  provide the business with a cadre of  qualified and experienced staff who  can be appointed as members of an  Incident Management Team. During the reporting period, the  Commonwealth Government  progressed several critical  infrastructure resilience reforms  designed to deliver a national  uplift in critical infrastructure  security. Under the reforms we have  developed a Critical Infrastructure  Risk Management Program and  implemented a cyber-security  incident reporting regime. We have  also progressed a range of initiatives  to enhance our capacity to respond  to emerging cyber, personnel,  supply chain, physical security  challenges, and natural hazard risks. Icon Water is represented on the  ACT Security and Emergency  Management Senior Officers Group  as required, is a member of the  Emergency Plans Review Group;  and the ACT Critical Infrastructure  Working Group. We also participate  in other resilience-related forums  across jurisdictions and government.  2022−23 Annual Report  74 74  ===== PAGE 77 ===== INTERNAL AUDIT  Icon Water’s internal  audit function provides  independent, objective  assurance and consulting  to add value and improve  our operations.  Internal audit activity is performed in  accordance with established internal  procedure, which conforms to:  	 the International Standards  for the Professional Practice of  Internal Auditing; and 	 the requirements of ISO 19011  for the auditing of management  systems. Our internal audit strategy is set  annually and is supported by our  annual internal audit program.  The 2022–23 audit program  incorporated a broad range of  performance and compliance- related internal audits. A key focus  was assessing the effectiveness of  several key governance and people  related functions including risk  management, fraud control, training  and development and community  support. Compliance reviews  relating to water quality, customer  and environmental topics were also  performed.

We achieve this by developing,  implementing, monitoring and  reviewing a range of prevention,  detection and response strategies  and measures.  Fraud prevention includes regular  formal fraud awareness training  at induction for all new staff and  contractors and regular refresher  training for existing staff.  Fraud, corruption and unethical  behaviour control practices are also  embedded and include appropriate  detection measures, transparent  and timely investigations and  monitoring of implementation of  recommendations to reduce the  likelihood of future reoccurrence. The assessment of fraud controls is  reviewed annually for effectiveness  and opportunities to improve  and enhance risk mitigation. This  is done in consultation with risk  owners, control owners and other  stakeholders across Icon Water  to improve the education and  awareness of fraud and corruption  control. There have been no reported  allegation of internal fraud,  corruption or unethical behaviour  within the reported period. There have been 301 instances  of alleged unlawful connections  to the water network identified  in the reporting period which are  managed by Icon Water’s Metering  Services Team. A number of actions  are undertaken to reduce and/  or rectify these reported cases  which can result in water loss, loss  of revenue and increased risk of  network contamination due to  backflow. These include educating  plumbers, builders, developers and  customers on the correct process  to connect to the water network,  regular inspections, audits of new  construction sites and disconnection  of services where applicable. 77 77 Corporate governance and accountability  ===== PAGE 80 ===== FREEDOM OF INFORMATION Icon Water is a company  wholly owned by the ACT  Government, established  under the Corporations  Act 2001, and is subject  to the Freedom of  Information Act 2016 (FOI  Act 2016).

Modern slavery refers to situations  of exploitation or coercion including  slavery, servitude, forced labour,  human trafficking, debt bondage,  forced marriage, child labour  and organ trafficking. It can be  perpetrated on anyone, regardless  of race, age or gender.  We procure a large variety of goods  and services from approximately  2,500 suppliers. Despite more than  99 per cent of our suppliers being  based in Australia, many of them  engage staff and procure products  from overseas. In response, we  have principles and procurement  processes in place that require  our suppliers to address the risk  of modern slavery in their supply  chains.  While we have not identified any  instances of modern slavery to date,  we have developed tools to address  the situation should we become  aware of its occurrence within Icon  Water or in our supply chain.  We acknowledge that tackling  modern slavery requires an ongoing  focus and commitment and we are  prepared to do so. In 2022–23, our  internal modern slavery working  group has continued to work  through our three-phased approach  by having strong policies and  publications, training and capacity  building, and supply chain due  diligence, in which we:  	 delivered Icon Water’s third  Modern Slavery Statement for  2021–22 as required by the  Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth) 	 reviewed and incorporated anti- modern slavery approaches to  our action plan 	 worked internally with business  units to ensure modern  slavery and sustainability is  considered and included  in procurements (for all risk  profiles), and developed quick  reference guides for sustainable  procurement 	 provided input through Water  Services Association of Australia  (WSAA) on the Commonwealth  Modern Slavery Legislative  review 	 attended the National  Government Modern Slavery  Conference 2023 	 actively participated in the  WSAA Modern Slavery Working  Group including the evaluation  panel for an industry-wide  modern slavery supplier  platform to identify modern  slavery risks through our tier two  supply chain.  We are committed to adapting  our approach as we learn from our  experience and shared industry  knowledge and any changes to  legislative requirements.

Select Committee on Estimates 2022–23 – Inquiry into the Appropriation Bill 2022-23 and Appropriation (Office of  the Legislative Assembly) Bill 2022-23 Report, September 2022 Recommendation No. and Summary Action Status Recommendation 34  Icon Water examine the reasons for  the MIB contamination to supply  long-term high-quality drinking  water. Government response  Agreed. There are a number of hypotheses as to why MIB was detected at elevated  levels in 2022.  We are continuing discussions with the ANU regarding research into MIB  occurrence and we are engaging with other utilities and organisations in the  water industry who have experienced MIB events.  In order to assist with the investigation into the root cause of this  unprecedented taste and odour event, we continue to monitor for MIB and  geosmin (another common cause of taste and odour complaints in drinking  water). Monitoring is being conducted at Bendora and Cotter dams, and at the  Stromlo Water Treatment Plant.  We will continue to monitor these compounds through winter to obtain a  full year’s worth of data. This will help us to understand MIB and geosmin  prevalence within our dams and to inform water treatment operations.  The MIB monitoring results so far show that, following the community taste  and odour complaints raised in July 2022, MIB concentrations in Bendora  Dam peaked at 19 ng/L in early August 2022. In the subsequent months, MIB  concentrations trended downwards to 3-7 ng/L by 14 October 2022. MIB monitoring results from October 2022 through to June 2023 have reduced  from an average of 3 ng/L to no detections.  Since 10 September 2022, we have not received any further calls from  customers about this issue. In progress Recommendation 35  Icon Water should provide as part  of the recorded message on known  issues a pathway option to leave  customer feedback. Government Response  Agreed in principle. The new telephony system is scheduled for implementation in late September  2023. The first phase will be a basic upgrade to a more contemporary version  of the system. Access to enhanced features such as functionality to provide a  pathway option for a customer to leave feedback will possibly be available in a  future phase of the upgrade.

In progress AUDITOR-GENERAL AND OMBUDSMAN REPORTS ACT Auditor-General’s report 2021–22 Financial Audits Financial Results and Audit Findings  Report No. 10/2022 No new audit findings were identified for Icon Water. Ombudsman Reports There were no Ombudsman reports relating to Icon Water during 2022–23. 2022−23 Annual Report  82 82  ===== PAGE 85 ===== FINANCIAL  REPORTS 83 83 Financial reports  ===== PAGE 86 ===== $493.3m Total revenue for   2022–23 FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ANALYSIS The following financial information is based on audited Financial Statements for  2022–23 and comparatives for the 2021–22 financial year. Operating Result Icon Water recorded a net profit after tax for the year 2022–23 of $59.7m (2021–22: $76.0m).  The result was largely driven by an increase in joint venture revenue, offset by reduced revenue related to lower water  consumption, and higher operational and financing costs. The increase in joint venture revenue was predominantly  attributable to the fluctuation in large-scale feed in tariff recoveries driven by the volatility in average spot price  within the Australian wholesale electricity market. The lower water consumption volumes were primarily driven by the  continued higher than average rainfall experienced throughout the year.  Total Revenue During 2022–23 Icon Water derived $493.3m in revenue and joint venture income. The components of this are  depicted in the following graph: 27% Sewerage 35% Water 32% ActewAGL  Joint Venture 3% Gifted assets 3% Other Comparison to 2021–22 Total Revenue Total revenue of $493.3m was $24.9m higher than 2021–22. The primary factor was a $21.4m increase in joint  venture revenue, primarily attributable to the continued effects of large-scale feed in tariff fluctuations, in  conjunction with a $2.5m increase in water revenues suppressed by the continuation of wetter than average  weather conditions and an increase of $1.9m in financing income due to higher cash balances held with higher  cash interest rates. This was partially offset by a decrease of $0.9m in other income being mainly attributable to  the $1.0m fair value loss on the Fyshwick investment property valuation recognised in the current year. 2022−23 Annual Report  84 84  ===== PAGE 87 ===== $433.6m Total expenditure for   2022–23 3% Consumables 4% Administration 10% Cost of sales 19% Depreciation 6% Tax 15% Operational 24% Interest expense  19% Employment costs Total Expenditure During 2022–23 Icon Water incurred $433.6m in expenditure. The components of this are depicted in the following  graph: Comparison to 2021–22 Total Expenditure Total expenditure was $41.2m higher than 2021–22 mainly due to the following factors: 	 Higher financing costs of $22.2m due to the higher consumer price index which is linked to indexed bonds  within the borrowings portfolio; 	 Higher operational expenditure of $26.0m primarily due to expenditure related to the continued investment  in upgrading Icon Water’s digital platform and operating systems; a combination of annual Enterprise  Agreement wage increases and increased employee numbers; expenditure related to the 2023–2028  Regulatory Price Review and higher depreciation, predominantly related to the impact of the upwards  revaluation of infrastructure assets recognised over the last two financial periods; and 	 Lower income tax equivalents expense of $6.9m resulting from the corresponding decrease in profit  compared to the prior year. 85 85 Financial reports  ===== PAGE 88 ===== Assets Icon Water has $4,632.3m in assets at 30 June 2023. The components are as depicted in the following graph: The major components are as follows: 	 Property, plant and equipment totalling $3,382.9m mainly consisting of Icon Water’s water and sewerage  infrastructure assets; and 	 Investment of $1,042.7m in the ActewAGL Joint Venture partnerships, consisting of two separate businesses,  energy retail and distribution. $4,632.3m Total assets at   30 June 2023 73% Property, plant,  & equipment 22% ActewAGL  Joint Venture 2% Liquid securities 2% Other Receivables and  contract assets 1% 2022−23 Annual Report  86 86  ===== PAGE 89 ===== The major components are as follows: 	 Outstanding borrowings at 30 June 2023 are $1,937.5m, an increase of $22.5m this year primarily due to a  new medium term note borrowing of $40m; and 	 Deferred tax liability at 30 June 2023 of $617.4m. This amount is mainly due to the tax effect of revaluation  adjustments to the fair value of land and building assets, water and sewerage infrastructure assets and the  infrastructure assets held within the investment in ActewAGL Joint Venture partnerships.  Liabilities Icon Water has $2,663.7m in liabilities. The components are as depicted in the following graph: Payments to the ACT Government Payments to the ACT Government during 2022-23 included the payment of the 2021-22 final dividend of $20.4m and  income tax equivalent payments of $28.6m.  The shareholders of Icon Water maintain a dividend policy of 100% distribution of net profit after tax less gifted asset  revenue. During the year ended 30 June 2023, Icon Water formally requested consent for dividend relief in relation to  the anticipated fluctuation in the calculation of large-scale feed in tariff recoveries which has arisen from the prevailing  spot price volatility within the Australian wholesale electricity market. These recoveries represent a significant  component of the share of results that the Group receives from the ActewAGL Joint Venture partnerships and these  amounts are subsequently returned or passed on to customers in future years in the form of reduced network charges.  The shareholders of Icon Water granted approval on 21 December 2022 for a one-off exemption in relation to its  dividend policy for the year ended 30 June 2023.  3% Payables and other 1% Provisions $2,663.7m Total liabilities at   30 June 2023 73% Borrowings 23% Deffered tax  balances 87 87 Financial reports  ===== PAGE 90 ===== FINANCIAL REPORTS ICON WATER LIMITED AND  CONTROLLED ENTITIES           Icon Water Limited and   Controlled Entities  ABN 86 069 381 960    ANNUAL REPORT  For the year ended   30 June 2023  2022−23 Annual Report  88 88  ===== PAGE 91 =====             Icon Water Limited and Controlled Entities  ABN 86 069 381 960    Annual Report for the year   ended 30 June 2023      Contents         Page  Directors’ report  1  Independent auditor’s report  11  Auditor’s independence declaration  13  Financial statements   14  Consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income  14  Consolidated balance sheet  15  Consolidated statement of cash flows  16  Consolidated statement of changes in equity  17  Notes to the financial statements  18  Directors’ declaration  61                                The financial statements are the consolidated financial statements for Icon Water Limited and its controlled entities.

Icon  Water is also subject to a New South Wales Environment Protection Licence for water discharge from the  Googong Water Treatment Plant in accordance with the Protection of the Environment (Operations) Act 1997  (NSW).     Icon Water holds several other environmental activity approvals, approved management plans and  development approval conditions for both operational and project activities that require compliance.     During the financial year, Icon Water materially complied with all requirements in respect to these licences,  approvals and associated legislation. There were instances where there were delays in relation to sampling  which did not result in infringement notices or fines. There were notifiable incidents, primarily relating to wet  weather events causing sewer overflows and controlled releases from the LMWQCC bypass storage dam and  stack emission exceedances from LMWQCC. All notifiable incidents were reported to the ACT or NSW  Environment Protection Authority (as relevant) and have not resulted in infringement notices or fines.  ACT Parks  and Conservation Services issued a repair damage direction under the Nature Conservation Act 2014 (ACT)  regarding erosion caused by operations at Oakey Hill reservoir. Remediation works have been identified and  implemented.      97 97 Financial reports  ===== PAGE 100 ===== Icon Water Limited and Controlled Entities  Directors’ report  30 June 2023    9    Regulation and licence compliance (continued)  Licence to Take Water  Issued by the ACT Environment Protection Authority (EPA) under the Water Resources Act 2007 (ACT), the  ‘Licence to Take Water’ provides for taking of water covered by water access entitlements and the protection  of environmental flows.

The  policy also applies if a claim is made against directors or officers after they have left the service of Icon Water,  where the claim was over events during the directors’ Icon Water service.

No liability has arisen under these indemnities as at the date of this report.  Proceedings on behalf of the company  No proceedings have been brought or intervened in on behalf of the company with leave of the Court under  section 237 of the Corporations Act 2001.

In my opinion, the consolidated financial report:   (i)  presents fairly, in all material respects, the Group’s consolidated financial position as at   30 June 2023, its consolidated financial performance and consolidated cash flows for the year  then ended; and  (ii)  is presented in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards – Simplified Disclosures and  the Corporations Regulations 2001.   Basis for opinion  I conducted the audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards. My responsibilities  under the standards are further described in the ‘Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the  consolidated financial report’ section of this report.   I am independent of the Group in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the  Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical  Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence  Standards) (Code). I have also fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.   I believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my  opinion.   Responsibilities of the Group for the financial report  The directors of the Group are responsible for:  •  preparing and fairly presenting the consolidated financial report in accordance with Australian  Accounting Standards – Simplified Disclosures and the Corporations Act 2001;  •  determining the internal controls necessary for the preparation and fair presentation of the  consolidated financial so that it is free from material misstatement, whether due to error or  fraud; and  •  assessing the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern and disclosing, as applicable,  matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting in preparing  the consolidated financial report.    2022−23 Annual Report  100 100  ===== PAGE 103 ===== Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial report   My objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial report as  a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s  report that includes my opinion.   Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted  in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when  it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or  in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken  on the basis of the consolidated financial report.   As part of an audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards, I exercise professional  judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:  •  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial report,  whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks,  and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one  resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,  misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;   •  Obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit  procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for expressing an opinion on  the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls;  •  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of  accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors;  •  Conclude on the appropriateness of the Group’s use of the going concern basis of accounting  and, based on audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to  events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a  going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention  in this report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial report or, if such  disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. I base my conclusions on the audit  evidence obtained up to the date of this report. However, future events or conditions may  cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;   •  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial report,  including the disclosures, and whether it represents the underlying transactions and events  in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and  •  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the  entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated  financial report.   I communicate with the directors of the Group regarding, among other matters, the planned scope  and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in  internal control that I identify during my audit.

Significant accounting policies    The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set  out below and in the relevant notes. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented,  unless otherwise stated.   a)  Basis of preparation  These general purpose financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Australian  Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board and the  Corporations Act 2001. Icon Water Group is a for-profit entity for the purpose of preparing the financial  statements.  (i)  Compliance with Australian Accounting Standards – Simplified Disclosure Requirements  The consolidated financial statements of the Group comply with Australian Accounting Standards –  Simplified Disclosures as issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB).  (ii)  Early adoption of standards  The directors have not elected under section 334(5) of the Corporations Act 2001 to early adopt any  new Australian Accounting Standard in the current year.  (iii) New and amended accounting standards adopted by the Group  There are no standards, interpretations or amendments to existing standards that are effective for the  first time for the financial year beginning 1 July 2022 that have a material impact on the amounts  recognised in prior periods or will affect the current or future periods.  (iv) Impact of accounting standards issued but not yet applied by the Group  There are certain new accounting standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that have  been published, that are not mandatory for the current reporting period and have not been early  adopted by the Group. While these remain subject to ongoing assessment, these standards are not  expected to have a material impact on the Group or its controlled entities, in the current or future  reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.   (v)  Historical cost convention  These financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except those assets and  liabilities recognised at fair value including property, plant and equipment, investment properties and  carbon credits.  (vi) Going concern  The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. At 30 June 2023, current  liabilities exceed current assets by $36.5 million.  Included in current liabilities is a medium term note of  $99.8 million maturing in May 2024 which will be refinanced with a long-term borrowing upon expiry  using approved borrowing limits held with the ACT Government pursuant to Treasury Authorisation  TI2022/5 – Financial Management (Icon Water Borrowing & Investment Limit) Approval 2022.    The deficiency in current assets is managed by the Icon Water Group’s ability to utilise the authorised  borrowing facilities in Treasury Authorisation TI2022/5 and to generate profits with related cash flows as  evidenced by current and prior year results.  In the opinion of the directors, the Icon Water Group has  adequate resources to continue as a going concern and pay its debts as and when they fall due and  payable.      2022−23 Annual Report  108 108  ===== PAGE 111 ===== Icon Water Limited and Controlled Entities  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023    20    b) Rounding and presentation of amounts  Icon Water Limited is a company of the kind referred to in ASIC Corporations (Rounding in  Financial/Directors’ Report) Instrument 2016/191, relating to the 'rounding off' of amounts in the financial  statements. Amounts in the financial statements have been rounded off in accordance with the Instrument  to the nearest thousand dollars, or in certain cases, the nearest dollar. Where applicable, comparative  figures have been adjusted to conform to changes in presentation for the current year.  c)  Goods and Services Tax (GST)  Revenues, expenses, assets other than receivables, and liabilities other than payables are recognised  exclusive of GST. Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST payable and  receivable.  d) Impact of climate change related risk  As the ACT region’s water and sewerage utility, Icon Water’s operations and financial results are affected  by weather, rainfall cycles and climate change. Climate change may increase the occurrence of extreme  events, such as bushfires, drought, floods and heat waves.  These extreme events will have an impact on  Icon Water’s financial results through changing the demand for water and also increasing operating and  capital costs.  Climate change may also cause the ACT region’s average temperatures to increase which may result in  increased consumption of water (revenue) and a corresponding increase to the operating expenditure to  supply that water, especially if dam levels are low. Wetter conditions could result in reduced consumption  of water (revenue).  The demand for water may also impact the useful life of the water and sewerage  infrastructure assets.  Potential secondary impacts such as decline in water quality may affect water  availability and treatment costs. Climate change may result in additional infrastructure assets being  constructed to ensure the ACT region’s longer term water security. Potential changes to the demand for  water, the useful life of assets and the requirement to enhance existing assets may have an impact on the  future price of water charged to the community.   Icon Water has a significant investment in the ActewAGL partnerships which own and/or operate gas and  electricity distribution networks, in addition to selling electricity, gas and other services in the ACT and  surrounding regions. The ACT Government’s response to climate change includes a policy to reduce  electricity emissions to zero and achieve carbon neutrality by 2045. This strategy places a strong emphasis  on the energy sector to effectively reduce emissions that come directly from electricity and gas assets and  develop renewable energy opportunities.  The changes in the prevailing policy environment have been a key consideration in determining the fair  value assessment of the plant and equipment assets within the ActewAGL Distribution Partnership as at 30  June 2023. The outcome of the combined quantitative and qualitative assessment determined that the fair  value of these assets was below the carrying value held by Icon Water. This has resulted in the recognition  of a revaluation decrement of $64.7 million within the Asset revaluation reserve (2022: $25.6 million  decrement). Refer to note 8c for further information.   However, considerable uncertainty remains as the energy transition is expected to negatively impact gas  demand and customer numbers over the longer term, with some related demand uplift for electricity.  In  the event that network price caps are put in place that limit the ability to recover the full value of the gas  regulated asset base in the ActewAGL Distribution Partnership, this will negatively impact the fair value of  the gas network unless future changes to current regulatory pricing mechanisms to deal with potential  stranded assets and/or access to other forms of recovery through government compensation is  accommodated in the medium to longer term. The next five-year regulatory pricing period for gas  commencing on 1 July 2026 may consider several responses including accelerated depreciation,  decommissioning costs and price caps on increases, which will provide a better view as to modelling the  future cashflows of the gas network but considerable uncertainty presently exists with respect to the future  regulatory response for gas.  This may result in a material change to the estimated cash inflows expected  to be received by Icon Distribution from its investment in the ActewAGL Distribution Partnership and the  resultant fair value of the gas assets in future periods.  109 109 Financial reports  ===== PAGE 112 ===== Icon Water Limited and Controlled Entities  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023    21    2.

Accounting policy  A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are  subject to risks and returns that are different to those of other business segments.  Segment revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are those that are directly attributable to a segment and  the relevant portion that can be allocated to a segment on a reasonable basis. Segment assets include all  assets used by a segment and consist primarily of receivables, property, plant and equipment, and other  assets, net of related allowances.  While most of these assets can be directly attributed to individual segments, the carrying amount of certain  assets used jointly by segments are allocated based on a reasonable estimate of usage. Segment liabilities  consist primarily of trade and other payables and employee benefits.  Operating cash, borrowings, interest expense and interest revenue have not been allocated to segments,  as this type of activity is managed by a central treasury function, which manages the cash position of the  Group.  111 111 Financial reports  ===== PAGE 114 ===== Icon Water Limited and Controlled Entities  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023    23    3.

The transaction price includes a supply charge  and a consumption charge. The prices are set by the regulator and the revenue is billed quarterly and  accrued for when unbilled (see critical accounting estimate below).  The amount of revenue that Icon  Water recognises reflects the right to consideration from customers at an amount that corresponds  directly with the value transferred to the customer for the performance completed to date.  The Group  has elected to use the practical expedient ‘right to invoice’ available in AASB 15 Revenue from  Contracts with Customers for these revenues as the Group recognises revenue at the amount for which  the Group has the right to invoice the customer. No element of financing is deemed present as the  invoices are issued with a credit term of 21 days.  Commonwealth subvention revenue  Icon Water receives a Commonwealth subvention payment for location limitations associated with  providing water supply and sewerage services in the ACT as it is an inland location. Icon Water’s  performance obligation is satisfied over time, consistent with the provision of providing drinking water  and waste water services to customers.  As revenue is received in equal instalments throughout the year,  no element of financing is deemed present.  Gifted assets revenue  Gifted asset revenue is derived from water and sewerage infrastructure assets which are gifted to Icon  Water.  These assets may include water and sewerage pipes, fittings, hydrants, valves and manholes.   Icon Water’s performance obligation is to accept the gifted assets and revenue is recognised at the  point in time when the Group gains control of the asset. The transaction price used to recognise revenue  has been measured as the replacement cost of the asset (refer to note 8d).  Other water and sewerage related revenue  Other water and sewerage related revenue relates to trade waste services and regulated external  services provided to customers which are not water and wastewater services.  Revenue from these sales  is recognised based on the price specified in the contract. Icon Water’s performance obligation is met  at a point in time when the services have been provided. No element of financing is deemed present  as the invoices are issued with a credit term of 21 days or are payable prior to the services being  performed.  2022−23 Annual Report  112 112  ===== PAGE 115 ===== Icon Water Limited and Controlled Entities  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023    24    3. Revenue from contracts with customers (continued)  a) Revenue related to contracts with customers (continued)                          b) Assets and liabilities related to contracts with customers  The Group has recognised the following assets and liabilities related to contracts with customers:        2023    2022      $’000    $’000  Current assets          Net trade receivables (Refer note 7b)    20,198    22,941  Total net trade receivables    20,198    22,941            Current assets          Accrued revenue relating to water supply contracts    18,779    18,250  Other accrued revenue (i)    1,373    1,480  Total contract assets    20,152    19,730            Current liabilities          Revenue received in advance relating to water and        sewerage supply contracts    9,651    9,412  Total current contract liabilities    9,651    9,412            Non-current liabilities          Revenue received in advance relating to water and        sewerage capital contributions    10,102    7,038  Total non-current contract liabilities    10,102    7,038  (i) Other accrued revenue primarily consists of accrued community service obligations revenue for the June  quarter of $1.3 million (30 June 2022: $1.3 million).       Critical Accounting Estimate  Revenue recognition  Icon Water's water revenue includes an estimated accrual for water consumed but not yet billed. This is a  regular occurrence at the end of each reporting period. The estimate is calculated by determining unbilled  consumption (water consumed for the period less actual billings), applying historical assumptions regarding  the tier split of the balance, and then multiplying the unbilled consumption by relevant tier prices. The 30  June 2023 accrual amount was $16.1 million (30 June 2022: $15.7 million) and is reflected in note 3b below.  Management has determined that it is highly probable that a significant reversal of the accrued revenue  will not occur in future periods.  This is because Icon Water has satisfied its performance obligation for the  accrued revenue, the prices have been set by the regulator and revenue is billed for quarterly.  Accounting policy  A contract asset is recognised in relation to an estimated accrual for water consumed but not yet billed  (refer to note 3a). The community service obligation revenue accrual is for water and sewerage services  consumed by community service organisations but not yet billed.   A contract liability is recognised in relation to water and sewerage revenue received in advance from  customers, where the Group has not yet provided the services.  113 113 Financial reports  ===== PAGE 116 ===== Icon Water Limited and Controlled Entities  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023  25  4.

Other income and expense items (continued) Accounting policy Finance income Interest income on financial assets at amortised cost is calculated using the effective interest method (which is the rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument) by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset. Total interest income on financial assets that are measured at amortised cost for the year was $2.3 million (30 June 2022: $0.4 million). Finance costs Borrowing costs incurred for the construction of qualifying assets are capitalised during the period of time  that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use or sale. Qualifying assets are assets  that take a substantial period of time (greater than 12 months) to get ready for their intended use. Icon Water typically has qualifying assets at any given period as part of its capital expenditure program. Other  borrowing costs are expensed. 115 115 Financial reports  ===== PAGE 118 ===== Icon Water Limited and Controlled Entities  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023    27    5.

Income tax equivalents expense (continued) Accounting policy  National Tax Equivalents Regime  Icon Water and its controlled entities are established as a Territory Owned Corporation hence Icon Water  and its controlled entities are exempt from Federal income tax. Icon Water is required to make an  equivalent payment to the ACT Government as required by the Taxation (Government Business Enterprises)  Act 2003.  Tax effect accounting procedures are followed whereby the income tax equivalents expense or revenue  for the period is the tax payable/receivable on the current period's taxable income based on the National  Tax Equivalents Regime.  This is adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to  temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the  financial statements, and to unused tax losses.  Tax consolidation legislation  Icon Water and its wholly-owned Australian controlled entities are part of a tax consolidated group formed  under tax consolidation legislation. These entities are taxed as a single entity and the deferred tax assets  and liabilities of these entities are set off in the consolidated financial statements.  The subsidiaries have entered into a tax funding agreement under which the wholly-owned entities fully  compensate Icon Water for any current tax payable assumed and are compensated by Icon Water for  any current tax receivable and deferred tax assets relating to unused tax credits that are transferred to  Icon Water under the tax consolidation legislation. The funding amounts are determined by reference to  the amounts recognised in the wholly-owned entities' financial statements.  The amounts receivable/payable under the tax funding agreement are due upon receipt of the funding  advice from Icon Water, which is issued to the controlled entities as soon as practicable at the end of the  financial year. Icon Water may also require payment of interim funding amounts to assist with obligations  to pay tax instalments. The funding amounts are recognised as intercompany receivable or payable.  117 117 Financial reports  ===== PAGE 120 ===== Icon Water Limited and Controlled Entities  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023  29  6.

LFiT recoveries represent a significant component of the share of results that the Group receives from the ActewAGL joint venture partnerships (refer note 8c) and these amounts are subsequently returned or passed on to customers in future years in the form of reduced network charges. The shareholders of Icon Water granted approval on 21 December 2022 for a one-off exemption in relation to its dividend policy for the year ended  30 June 2023. Accounting policy  The shareholders maintain a dividend policy of 100% distribution of net profit after tax less gifted asset  revenue. An interim, fully authorised dividend is declared and paid in June with a provision made for the  payment of a final dividend in October.   2022−23 Annual Report  118 118  ===== PAGE 121 ===== Icon Water Limited and Controlled Entities  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023    30    7.

They are generally due for settlement within 21 days and therefore are all classified  as current. Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is  unconditional unless they contain significant financing components, when they are recognised at fair  value. The Group holds the trade receivables with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows  and therefore measures them subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less  loss allowance.  The Group recognises a loss allowance for all trade receivables and contract assets.  The loss allowance  is calculated based on the simplified approach outlined in AASB 9 Financial Instruments which requires  that the Group recognises lifetime expected credit losses.   Bad debts are written off when debts become uncollectible in a subsequent period.  Subsequent  recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against other expenses in the statement of  profit or loss and other comprehensive income.  Current other receivables  This includes amounts such as GST and interest receivable which are receivable within one year from  the end of the reporting period.   Employee entitlement receivable  A number of employees of Icon Water have been seconded to the joint venture partnerships. A  receivable from the joint venture partnerships is recognised as employee entitlements are reimbursed  to Icon Water for these seconded employees.  Accounting policy  Trade and other payables  Trade and other payables are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at  amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.  They represent liabilities for goods and services  provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year and which are unpaid.  The amounts are  unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition. Trade and other payables are presented as  current liabilities unless payment is not due within 12 months after the reporting period.   2022−23 Annual Report  120 120  ===== PAGE 123 ===== Icon Water Limited and Controlled Entities  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023    32    7.

Borrowings are  subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.  CIBs are adjusted quarterly based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The adjustment is made to the  principal of the loan and an expense is recognised in the period of the adjustment depending on the  terms of the loan.  IABs are adjusted by quarterly changes to CPI with the interest and principal  repayments impacted by changes to CPI, although the principal of the loans reduces to zero by maturity  date. Fluctuations in CPI influences principal balances over the term of the loan.  Borrowing costs incurred for the construction of qualifying assets are capitalised in accordance with the  accounting policy in note 4c.  121 121 Financial reports  ===== PAGE 124 ===== Icon Water Limited and Controlled Entities  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023    33    7. Financial assets and liabilities (continued)  e) Accounting policy relating to investments, other financial assets and financial liabilities    Accounting policy  Classification  The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:  •  those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income (OCI)  or through profit or loss), and  •  those to be measured at amortised cost.   The classification depends on the Group’s business model for managing the financial assets and the  contractual terms of the cash flows.   For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI.   The Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets  changes.   Recognition and derecognition  Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade-date, the date on which the Group commits  to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from  the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the  risks and rewards of ownership.  Initial and subsequent measurement  At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset  not at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition  of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss.  Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments  of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is  included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition  is recognised directly in profit or loss and presented in other gains/(losses) together with foreign exchange  gains and losses. Impairment losses are presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.  Fair value  If the market for a financial asset is not active, and for unlisted securities, the Group establishes fair value by  using valuation techniques. These include the use of recent arm's length transactions, reference to other  instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, and option pricing models making  maximum use of market inputs and relying as little as possible on entity-specific inputs.  Impairment of financial assets  The Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments  carried at amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a  significant increase in credit risk.   For trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by AASB 9 Financial Instruments,  which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables, see note  7b for further details.  2022−23 Annual Report  122 122  ===== PAGE 125 ===== Icon Water Limited and Controlled Entities  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023    34    7. Financial assets and liabilities (continued)    e)  Accounting policy relating to investments, other financial assets and financial liabilities (continued)        Accounting policy  Financial risk management  The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities must be estimated for recognition and  measurement or for disclosure purposes.  The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using  valuation techniques. Icon Water uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on  market conditions existing at each balance date. Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar  instruments are used for long-term debt instruments held. Other techniques, such as estimated discounted  cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.  The carrying value less impairment allowance of trade receivables and payables are assumed to  approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature. The fair value of financial liabilities for  disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market  interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.  123 123 Financial reports  ===== PAGE 126 ===== Icon Water Limited and Controlled Entities  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023  35  8.

The cost of consumables used and recognised as an expense during the year was $12.2 million (30 June 2022:  $10.5 million).  Accounting policy  Prepayments are recognised when payments have been made for services in advance of Icon Water  utilising the benefit of those services.  Prepayments are amortised over the period in which services will be provided to Icon Water. Where the  prepayment relates to a period that is greater than 12 months from the end of the financial year, it is  classified as non-current.  Carbon credits prepayment  Icon Water is required to offset carbon emissions generated during the construction and operation of the  major water security projects. Icon Water has made prepayments for carbon credits associated with these  emissions which will be received in the future.  Accounting policy  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs of inventories are determined on  a weighted average cost basis.  Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price for inventories  less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale. The difference between cost  and net realisable value is recorded as a write down of inventory.  Stocktakes are performed on a cyclical basis, where inventory is assessed for obsolescence and written off  to profit or loss when required.  2022−23 Annual Report  124 124  ===== PAGE 127 ===== Icon Water Limited and Controlled Entities  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023  36  8.

The interests in the joint venture partnerships are accounted for  using the equity method.  Under the equity method, the share of the profit and losses of partnerships is recognised in the consolidated  statement of profit or loss. Profits or losses on transactions establishing the joint venture partnerships and  transactions with the joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the consolidated entity's ownership  interest.  This is continued until the profits or losses are realised by the joint venture partnership on  consumption or sale, unless they related to an unrealised loss that provides evidence of the impairment of  an asset transferred.  Revaluation of plant and equipment within the Distribution Partnership  ActewAGL Distribution Partnership’s accounting policies for their electricity and gas assets will be adjusted  such that it aligns to Icon Water Group's accounting policy on property, plant and equipment assets  accounted for at Fair Value. Revaluations are performed at the end of every five-year regulatory period  (assessed separately for the electricity and gas assets) or whenever there have been significant changes  in the longer term expectations of Icon Water, with adjustments in intervening years as necessary to ensure  that movements in observable market measures are appropriately measured.   Where the inputs have been reset by the Australian Energy Regulator (AER), gas and electricity  infrastructure assets are valued by Icon Water using an income approach. The terminal value used is based  on the Regulated Asset Base value determined by the AER.  The expected net cash flows are then  discounted to their present value using a market equivalent risk adjusted discount rate.  In the intervening years throughout the five-year regulatory period, gas and electricity infrastructure assets  are valued by application of a market multiples approach only where management has determined that  there are no indicators present of significant changes in the longer term expectations of the ActewAGL  Distribution Partnership at reporting date.  125 125 Financial reports  ===== PAGE 128 ===== Icon Water Limited and Controlled Entities  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023  37  8. Non-financial assets and liabilities (continued) Accounting policy (continued)  Revaluation of plant and equipment within the Distribution Partnership (continued)  In performing fair value assessments from a market participant perspective, management will select several  publicly traded Australian and internationally based entities with similar characteristics to the ActewAGL  Distribution Partnership to form a comparable peer group.  The assumptions used in determining the Fair Value assessment adopted at reporting date are detailed in  the critical accounting estimate.  Critical Accounting Estimate  Revaluation of plant and equipment within the Distribution partnership  Icon Distribution assesses the fair value of plant and equipment within the ActewAGL Distribution Partnership  annually.   Gas assets  The ACT Government’s Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Reduction (Natural Gas Transition)  Amendment Bill was legislated in June 2023 and formalises its long-term strategy to transition away from fossil- fuel gas and achieve carbon neutrality by 2045.  In order to achieve this, it is more than likely that the use of natural gas within the ACT will cease within the  next 23-year period. For the year ended 30 June 2023, the fair value of gas assets has been determined by  application of an income approach using a discounted cash flow method.   The following key estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation calculations for the current reporting  period are:  • estimated future cash flows, based on management’s estimates, have been projected over 23 years  to 30 June 2045, with no terminal value applied; • forecasted revenue considers reducing volumes over time and a declining regulated asset base (RAB); • forecasts include cash inflows anticipated from the disposal of decommissioned regulated assets; • only nominal capital expenditure is forecast to be incurred until 2045. Investment or growth capital expenditure has not been forecast as the assets are considered to be in good condition with the remaining service life likely able to deliver natural gas until termination by, or before, 2045; • other operational and incidental expenditures such as taxes and decommissioning costs are also expected to be fully recovered over the forecast period; • under recoveries due to revenue shortfalls are expected to be recovered in subsequent regulatory periods. Decreasing volumes over the forecast period may result in price increases to the remaining customer base. Management have not included pricing caps in later years where pricing increases are expected; • the Weighted Cost of Capital (WACC) discount rate of 6.00% (2022: 5.10%) has been developed from a market participant perspective and has been applied to discount cash flows and reflects the longer-term view of the risks inherent in the forecast cash flows; • the RAB is expected to be fully recovered over the remaining useful life and it is also assumed that returns are not expected to be recovered beyond an asset’s useful life. Inherent in this assumption is that the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) will allow the RAB base and associated regulatory depreciation to be recovered by 2045; and • the RAB has been depreciated on a straight-line basis and will have a nil value by the end of the forecast period in 2045. 2022−23 Annual Report  126 126  ===== PAGE 129 ===== Icon Water Limited and Controlled Entities  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023  38  8. Non-financial assets and liabilities (continued)         Critical Accounting Estimate (continued)  Revaluation of plant and equipment within the Distribution partnership (continued)  Gas assets (continued)  All estimates regarding future outcomes are based upon the use of scenarios, judgements and assumptions  and are subject to risk and uncertainty that may be beyond the control of management, therefore there is  a possibility that changes in circumstances will materially alter projections which could lead to changes to  estimates in future reporting periods.  Specialist valuation advice has been obtained to perform the income valuation approach and also  undertake a correlation using the market-multiples approach to further assess the reasonableness of the  valuation outcome. This included calculating implied EV/EBITDA multiples and EV/RAB multiples. In addition  to the income valuation approach and the market-multiples approach, an assessment has also been made  as to whether there are qualitative factors that could impact the valuation.  The valuation is sensitive to variations in the WACC, consumption volumes, decommissioning costs and  assumptions around the estimated useful life of the RAB.   The valuation exercise undertaken for gas assets for the year ended 30 June 2023 resulted in a $40.8 million  decrement adjustment being required for the equity accounted investment in the partnership reflecting the  change in value of Icon Distribution’s investment in those underlying assets. This adjustment was recognised  in the Asset revaluation reserve.  Electricity assets  For the year ended 30 June 2023, the fair value of electricity assets has been determined by application of  an income approach using a discounted cash flow method. The following key estimates and assumptions  underlying the valuation calculations for the current reporting period are:  • estimated future cash flows, based on management’s estimate, have been projected over five years and discounted to their present value using the WACC; • the WACC discount rate of 6.00% (2022: 5.10%) has been used to discount cash flows and has been developed from a market participant perspective. The WACC discount rate used is based on external valuation advice and is considered the best estimate of a long-term view of the market cost  of capital; • future capital expenditure, fixed and variable operational expenditure and related revenues relating to restructuring or improving asset performance have been included in the cash flows, derived from the Board approved 2023-24 long term forecasts and taking into account the latest determinations from the AER; and • the projected regulatory asset base value (at a multiple of 1.25) has been used to compute the terminal value of the valuation. The valuation exercise undertaken for electricity assets for the year ending 30 June 2023 resulted in a $23.9  million decrement adjustment being required for the equity accounted investment in the partnership  reflecting the change in value of Icon Distribution’s investment in those underlying assets. This adjustment was  recognised in the Asset revaluation reserve balance.  For the year ended 30 June 2023, the combined valuation exercise for gas and electricity assets resulted in  the recognition of a $64.7 million decrement (30 June 2022: $25.6 million decrement) in the Asset  revaluation reserve.  127 127 Financial reports  ===== PAGE 130 ===== Icon Water Limited and Controlled Entities  Notes to the consolidated financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023    39    8.

Non-financial assets and liabilities (continued) d) Property, plant and equipment (continued) Accounting policy  Acquisition and recognition of assets  The cost method is used for all acquisitions of property, plant and equipment assets.  Cost is measured as the  purchase price plus incidental costs directly attributable to the acquisition, and an estimate of the costs of  dismantling and removing the item at the end of its useful life.  Gifted assets provided free of charge are initially valued at replacement costs of those assets and  subsequently revalued as part of the class of property, plant and equipment to which the asset belongs.  Plant and equipment – held at cost  Plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.  Water network and sewerage network assets – valuation  Water and sewerage assets are measured at Fair Value in accordance with AASB 116 Property, Plant and  Equipment and AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement. Revaluations are performed at the end of every five-year  regulatory period or whenever there have been significant changes in the longer-term expectations of Icon  Water, along with adjustments in intervening years as necessary to ensure that movements in observable  market measures are appropriately recorded.    Where the inputs have been reset by the Independent Competition and Regulatory Commission (ICRC),  water and sewerage infrastructure assets are valued using an income approach. The terminal value used is  based on the Regulated Asset Base value determined by the ICRC.  The expected net cash flows are then  discounted to their present value using a market equivalent risk adjusted discount rate.  In the intervening years throughout the five-year regulatory period, water and sewerage infrastructure assets  are valued by application of a market multiples approach only where management has determined that  there are no indicators present of significant changes in the longer-term expectations of Icon Water at  reporting date.  When performing fair value assessments from a market participant perspective, management select several  publicly traded Australian and internationally based entities with similar characteristics to Icon Water to form  a comparable peer group.  The assumptions used in determining the Fair Value assessment adopted at reporting date are detailed in  the critical accounting estimate.   Land and building assets – valuation  Land and buildings are shown at Fair Value less subsequent depreciation for buildings. Valuations are  undertaken by external independent valuers every three years with the most recent valuation in June 2022  performed by Certified Practicing Valuers.    If the Fair Value of an asset materially differs from its carrying amount outside of the three year valuation  cycle, then the asset will be revalued regardless of when the last valuation occurred.  Land and buildings are measured at Fair Value in accordance with AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement.  Land  assets have been valued on the basis of highest and best use. Building assets have been valued with regard  to the risk of physical and functional obsolescence. The majority of Icon Water's land and buildings are  considered specialised assets and are therefore valued using the current replacement cost approach.   129 129 Financial reports  ===== PAGE 132 ===== Icon Water Limited and Controlled Entities  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023    41    8. Non-financial assets and liabilities (continued)    d) Property, plant and equipment (continued)        Accounting policy (continued)  Accounting impact – changes to Fair Value  Increases in the carrying amounts arising on revaluation of land and buildings and water and sewerage  assets are credited, net of tax, to the asset revaluation reserve in shareholder's equity. Any revaluation  increase arising on the revaluation of such land and building and water and sewerage assets is recognised  in the asset revaluation reserve, except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease for the same  asset previously recognised in the profit or loss. In this case the increase is credited to the profit or loss to the  extent of the decrease previously expensed. A decrease in the carrying amount arising on the revaluation  of such land and building and water and sewerage assets is recognised in the profit or loss to the extent that  it exceeds the balance, if any, held in the asset revaluation reserve relating to a previous revaluation of that  asset.   Depreciation  Land is not depreciated and is substantially held under 99-year renewable crown leases in the ACT.  Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the assets' cost or revalued amounts,  net of their residual values over their estimated useful lives as follows:    Years  Water network    Dams  30 - 150  Reservoirs  50 - 100  Treatment plants  20 - 60  Mains  80  Other assets  10 - 80  Sewerage network    Mains  80  Treatment plants  20 - 60  Sewer tunnels  120  Other assets  10 - 80  Buildings  60  Plant and equipment  5 - 15    2022−23 Annual Report  130 130  ===== PAGE 133 ===== Icon Water Limited and Controlled Entities  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023    42    8. Non-financial assets and liabilities (continued)    d) Property, plant and equipment (continued)  Critical Accounting Estimate  Fair value assessment of water and sewerage infrastructure assets  Icon Water assesses the fair value of water and sewerage infrastructure assets annually.   During the year ended 30 June 2023, the Independent Competition and Regulatory Commission (ICRC)  published the regulated price determination for the next five-year regulatory cycle, commencing 1 July 2023  to 30 June 2028.   In making their determination, the ICRC reviews the actual capital investment for the current regulatory period  (2018-23) and the proposed expenditure for the next regulatory period (2023-28). If actual and proposed  capital expenditure are considered to be both prudent and efficient they are added to the Regulated Asset  Base (RAB) at the appropriate time. In the building block methodology utilised by the ICRC, capital expenditure  is recovered through the return on capital and depreciation building blocks. This requires a roll-forward  calculation of the RAB for each year of the next regulatory period. The RAB is also indexed by inflation to  maintain its real value, and separate adjustments are made to the allowed nominal return on capital to ensure  there is no double-counting.  To ensure alignment with the ICRC’s approach, Icon Water has adjusted the value of its water and sewerage  assets to correspond with the opening balance of the RAB of each respective asset class of the next regulatory  period as at 30 June 2023. Where the inputs have been reset by the ICRC, the fair value of water and sewerage  assets are determined by application of an income approach using a discounted cash flow method.  The following key estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation calculations for the current reporting  period are:  •  estimated future cash flows, based on management’s estimates, have been projected over five years  and discounted to their present value using the Weighted Cost of Capital (WACC) discount rate;  •  the WACC of 6.10% (2022: 5.00%) has been used to discount cash flows and has been developed from  a market participant perspective. The WACC discount rate used is based on external valuation advice  and is considered the best estimate of a long-term view of the market cost of capital;  •  future capital expenditure, fixed and variable operational expenditure and related revenues for  restructuring or improving asset performance have been included in the cash flows, as set out in Icon  Water’s Statement of Corporate Intent 2023; and  •  the projected regulatory asset base value (at a multiple of 1.15) has been used to compute the  terminal value of the valuation.  The valuation exercise for the year ending 30 June 2023 resulted in a $82.8 million increment adjustment being  required for water infrastructure assets (30 June 2022: $271.0 million increment) and a $125.1 million increment  adjustment being required for sewerage infrastructure assets (30 June 2022: $133.8 million increment). These  adjustments were recognised in the Asset revaluation reserve.    131 131 Financial reports  ===== PAGE 134 ===== Icon Water Limited and Controlled Entities  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023    43    8.

Non-financial assets and liabilities (continued)  e) Leases (continued)    Accounting policy  Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased  asset is available for use by Icon Water.  The right-of-use assets are recognised at cost comprising of the  following:  •  the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability   •  any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received   •  any initial direct costs, and   •  restoration costs.   Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include  the net present value of the following lease payments:   •  fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable   •  variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or  rate as at the commencement date   •  amounts expected to be payable by the group under residual value guarantees   •  the exercise price of a purchase option if the group is reasonably certain to exercise that option,  and   •  payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the group exercising that  option.   Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options are also included in the  measurement of the liability.   The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily  determined, which is generally the case for leases in the group, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is  used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain  an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security  and conditions.  Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment and all leases of low-value assets are recognised  on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12  months or less. Low-value assets may comprise small items of equipment.   Building lease  Icon Water leases building space at 40 Bunda Street, Canberra City for a period of 15 years which expires on  8 December 2024.  This lease contains a single lease component which has been used to calculate the right- of-use asset and corresponding liability.  The asset and liability arising from this lease is initially measured on a present value basis.  The lease liability  includes the net present value of the fixed payments.  As there is no interest rate implicit in the lease, the  lease payments are discounted using Icon Water’s incremental borrowing rate, being the rate that Icon  Water would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of- use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions.    The building lease contains variable lease payment terms which are varied to reflect changes in market  rental rates.  When adjustments to lease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability  is reassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use asset.  There is no extension option for the building lease.    133 133 Financial reports  ===== PAGE 136 ===== Icon Water Limited and Controlled Entities  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023  45  8. Non-financial assets and liabilities (continued) e) Leases (continued) Accounting policy (continued)  Equipment and vehicle leases  Icon Water leases vehicles and equipment which are typically leased for fixed periods of 3 to 12 years. These  leases contain both lease and non-lease components.  Icon Water has elected to not separate lease and  non-lease components and instead accounts for these as a single lease component.  This single lease  component is used to calculate the right-of-use assets and corresponding liabilities.  Each lease is negotiated on an individual basis, however all equipment and vehicle leases contain similar  terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants other than the security interests  in the leased assets that are held by the lessor. The leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing  purposes.  There are no extension or termination options for the equipment and vehicle leases.  Lease payments  Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or  loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of  the liability for each period.   Depreciation of right-of-use assets  Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on  a straight-line basis. If Icon Water is reasonably certain to exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use asset  is depreciated over the underlying asset’s useful life. While Icon Water revalues its land and buildings that  are presented within property, plant and equipment, it has chosen not to do so for the right-of-use buildings.  2022−23 Annual Report  134 134  ===== PAGE 137 ===== Icon Water Limited and Controlled Entities  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023  46  8.

They are carried at fair value. Changes in fair values are presented in profit or loss  as part of other income.   Valuation  Valuations are undertaken every year by Certified Practising Valuers. When an independent external  valuation is not undertaken at the end of a reporting period, Icon Water updates the assessment of the fair  value of each property, taking into account the most recent independent valuations.    Impairment  At each reporting date, the Group assesses, whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired.  If such an indication of impairment exists, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. Assets  are also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying  value may not be recoverable.  Where the carrying amount of a non-current asset is greater than its  recoverable amount, the asset is written down to its recoverable amount. The decrement in the carrying  amount is recognised as an expense in net profit or loss in the reporting period in which the recoverable  amount write-down occurs. For investment properties held at fair value, changes in fair value are recognised  in the profit or loss as part of other income.  Lease income  Rental income recognised by Icon Water during the financial year was $2.3 million.  Icon Water did not  receive any variable lease income that is not dependent on an index or rate.  During the financial year, the Group leased out its investment property which is an owned commercial  property to ActewAGL.  The lease was classified as an operating lease as the lease did not transfer  substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of the assets.  The lease contained a non- cancellable period of 14 years which expired on 30 June 2023.   135 135 Financial reports  ===== PAGE 138 ===== Icon Water Limited and Controlled Entities  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023    47    8.

Carbon credits are subject to an annual impairment test and are disposed of when surrendered or sold.  Computer software  Icon Water capitalises and amortises specific-use computer software, such as its Works Asset Management  System, Geospatial Information System and design drawing software. Computer software includes  capitalised development costs being an internally generated intangible asset.   Cloud computing arrangements  Icon Water has a number of cloud computing arrangements that provide it with the right to access the  cloud-based software over a contracted period. Costs incurred to configure or customise, and the ongoing  fees to obtain access to such software, are recognised as operating expenses when the services are  received. Some additional costs are incurred for the development of software code. Where this  development enhances or creates additional capability to existing systems and meets the definition of,  and recognition criteria, for an intangible asset, it is recognised as a software asset.  Amortisation methods and useful lives  The Group amortises software intangible assets with a limited useful life using the straight-line method over  5 - 9 years.    2022−23 Annual Report  136 136  ===== PAGE 139 ===== Icon Water Limited and Controlled Entities  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023  48  8. Non-financial assets and liabilities (continued) g) Intangible assets (continued) Accounting policy (continued)  Impairment  At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired.  If such an indication of impairment exists, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. Assets  are also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying  value may not be recoverable.  Where the carrying amount of a non-current asset is greater than its  recoverable amount, the asset is written down to its recoverable amount. Where net cash inflows are derived  from a group of assets working together, recoverable amount is determined on the basis of the relevant  group of assets. The decrement in the carrying amount is recognised as an expense in net profit or loss in the  reporting period in which the recoverable amount write-down occurs.  For assets held at fair value a revaluation increase is recognised in the asset revaluation reserve, except to  the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease for the same asset previously recognised in the profit or loss,  in which case the increase is credited to the profit or loss to the extent of the decrease previously expensed.  Critical Accounting Estimate  Configuration and customisation in cloud computing arrangements  Some customisation and configuration activities undertaken in implementing cloud computing  arrangements entail the development of software code that enhances or modifies, or creates additional  capacity to, existing on-premise systems. Judgement is applied in determining whether the benefits from  these costs meet the definition of, and recognition criteria for, an intangible asset in AASB 138 Intangible  Assets.  Costs that do not result in intangible assets are expensed as incurred, unless they are paid to the suppliers of  the cloud computing arrangement to significantly customise the cloud-based software for the Group, in  which case the costs are recognised as a prepayment for services and amortised over the expected  renewable term of the contractual or service arrangement.  137 137 Financial reports  ===== PAGE 140 ===== Icon Water Limited and Controlled Entities  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023  49  8.

There are provisions within the agreement that allow for these services to continue over of a period of transition that  is expected to conclude on 31 December 2024.    Accounting policy  Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable  that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of  the obligation.  Wages and salaries  Liabilities for wages and salaries (including on-costs) expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting  date are recognised in other payables in respect of employees services up to the reporting date and are  measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.  2022−23 Annual Report  138 138  ===== PAGE 141 ===== Icon Water Limited and Controlled Entities  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023    50    8. Non-financial assets and liabilities (continued)  h)  Provisions (continued)                  Accounting policy (continued)  Annual, sick and long service leave  A liability for annual, sick and long service leave (where employees have been employed by Icon Water for  seven years or greater) is recognised as a current provision for employee benefits. Under AASB 119 Employee  Benefits, leave entitlements that are not expected to be wholly settled in 12 months must be discounted to  a present value.  An employee who has completed seven years’ service with a single employer is entitled to long service leave  for the period of the service and is therefore classified as a current provision. Long service leave less than  seven years is measured as a non-current provision for employee benefits. Long service leave is measured  as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees  up to the reporting date. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels and for long  service leave, expectation of employee departures and periods of service.

The relevant tax rates are applied to the cumulative amounts of  deductible and taxable temporary differences to measure the deferred tax asset or liability. An exception is  made for certain temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability. No deferred  tax asset or liability is recognised in relation to these temporary differences if they arose in a transaction, other  than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction did not affect either accounting profit or  taxable profit or loss.  Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is  probable that future taxable amounts will be available to use those temporary differences and losses.  2022−23 Annual Report  140 140  ===== PAGE 143 ===== Icon Water Limited and Controlled Entities  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023  52  9.

Contingencies  Contingent liabilities  i.  Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme  A number of claims have been made against the Commonwealth and Icon Water in relation to information  purportedly given to former employees regarding their eligibility to originally join the Commonwealth  Superannuation Scheme. To date, Icon Water has settled a number of these claims. Future claims fall into  the categories of current claims in the process of pre-settlement, notified prospective claims and possible  future claims. Possible future claims have not been provided for and are therefore disclosed as a contingent  liability.    These individuals may make a claim for settlement at a future date that, if successful, creates a liability for  Icon Water. Any liability in relation to this group is uncertain as the individuals have not been identified and  have not yet advised of any intention to bring a claim now or in the future. Insufficient evidence exists to  estimate the financial effect of this contingent liability. Depending on the circumstances of each claim, costs  arising from settlement of these claims may be shared between Icon Water and the Commonwealth. No  other reimbursement of Icon Water’s costs is likely. Icon Water is not able to quantify claims at this point in  time.  ii.  Claims  Entities within Icon Water are involved in other disputes in the normal course of operations.  The directors  believe that material losses (including costs) are not anticipated in resolving those claims.  15.

There are provisions within the agreement that allow for  these services to continue over of a period of transition that is expected to conclude on 31 December  2024.

In my opinion, the financial report:   (i) presents fairly, in all material respects, the Company’s financial position as at 30 June 2023, and  its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended; and  (ii) is presented in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards – Simplified Disclosures and  the Corporations Regulations 2001.   Basis for opinion  I conducted the audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards. My responsibilities  under the standards are further described in the ‘Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the  financial report’ section of this report.   I am independent of the Company in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of  the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical  Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence  Standards) (Code). I have also fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.   I believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my  opinion.   Responsibilities of the Company for the financial report  The directors of the Company are responsible for:  •  preparing and fairly presenting the financial report in accordance with Australian Accounting  Standards – Simplified Disclosures and the Corporations Act 2001;  •  determining the internal controls necessary for the preparation and fair presentation of  financial report so that it is free from material misstatements, whether due to error or fraud;  and  •  assessing the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern and disclosing, as  applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting  in preparing the financial report.      161 161 Financial reports  ===== PAGE 164 ===== Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial report   My objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is  free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report  that includes my opinion.   Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted  in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when  it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or  in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken  on the basis of the financial report.  As part of an audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards, I exercise professional  judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:  •  identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to  fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain  audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk  of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting  from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations,  or the override of internal control;  •  obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit  procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for expressing an opinion on  the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls;  •  evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of  accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors;  •  conclude on the appropriateness of the Company’s use of the going concern basis of  accounting and, based on audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists  related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to  continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to  draw attention in this report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such  disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. I base my conclusions on the audit  evidence obtained up to the date of this report. However, future events or conditions may  cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern; and  •  evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the  disclosures, and whether it represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner  that achieves fair presentation.

Significant accounting policies  The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial report are set out below. These  policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.  The financial  statements are for Icon Distribution as an individual entity.   (a) Basis of preparation  This general purpose financial report has been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards  and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board and the Corporations Act 2001. Icon  Distribution is a for-profit entity for the purpose of preparing the financial statements.  (i)  Compliance with Australian Accounting Standards – Simplified Disclosure Requirements  The financial report of Icon Distribution complies with Australian Accounting Standards – Simplified  Disclosures as issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB).  (ii)  Historical cost convention  These financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost convention, unless otherwise stated in  the financial statements.  (iii) Early adoption of standards  The directors have not elected under section 334(5) of the Corporations Act 2001 to early adopt any new  Australian Accounting Standard in the current year and they are not expected to have a material  impact.  (iv) New and amended standards adopted  There are no standards, interpretations or amendments to existing standards that are effective for the first  time for the financial year beginning 1 July 2022 that have a material impact on the amounts recognised  in prior periods or will affect the current or future periods.  (v)  Going concern  The financial report has been prepared on a going concern basis.  At 30 June 2023, current liabilities exceed  current assets by $97.7 million.  This deficiency in current assets is managed by an intercompany loan and  the Icon Water Group’s ability to generate profits, as evidenced by current and prior year results as well as  generating positive cash inflow from operating activities.  In the opinion of the directors, Icon Distribution  has adequate resources to continue as a going concern and pay its debts as and when they fall due and  payable.  (b) Rounding and presentation of amounts  Icon Distribution is a company of the kind referred to in ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors’  Report) Instrument 2016/191, relating to the 'rounding off' of amounts in the financial statements. Amounts in the  financial statements have been rounded off in accordance with the Instrument to the nearest thousand dollars,  or in certain cases, the nearest dollar.  Where applicable, comparative figures have been adjusted to conform to changes in presentation for the  current year.  (c) Goods and Services Tax (GST)  Revenues, expenses, assets other than receivables, and liabilities other than payables are recognised exclusive  of GST. Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST payable and receivable.      169 169 Financial reports  ===== PAGE 172 ===== Icon Distribution Investments Limited  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023  18  1. Significant accounting policies (continued) (d) Impact of climate change related risk Icon Distribution has a significant investment in the ActewAGL Distribution Partnership which owns the gas  distribution networks and owns and operates the electricity distribution networks in the ACT and surrounding  regions. Australia’s transition to a low carbon economy is subject to considerable uncertainty including in  relation to government policy, technology development and consumer uptake of new technologies. The ACT  Government has introduced legislated targets to reduce electricity emissions to zero and ultimately achieve  carbon neutrality by 2045. This strategy places a strong emphasis on the energy sector to effectively reduce  emissions that come directly from electricity and gas assets and develop renewable energy opportunities in the  short to medium term.   A fair value assessment of the plant and equipment assets within the partnership was undertaken as at 30 June  2023. The outcome of the combined quantitative and qualitative assessment determined that the fair value of  these assets was below the carrying value held by Icon Distribution. This has resulted in the recognition of a  revaluation decrement of $64.7 million in the Asset revaluation reserve (2022: $25.6 million decrement). Refer to  note 5 for further information.  However, considerable uncertainty remains as the energy transition is expected to negatively impact gas  demand and customer numbers over the longer term, with some related demand uplift for electricity.  In the  event that network price caps are put in place that limit the ability to recover the full value of the gas regulated  asset based within the ActewAGL Distribution Partnership, this will negatively impact the fair value of the gas  network unless future changes to current regulatory pricing mechanisms to deal with potential stranded assets  and/or access to other forms of recovery through government compensation is accommodated in the medium  to longer term.   The next five-year regulatory pricing period for gas commencing on 1 July 2026 may consider several responses  including accelerated depreciation, decommissioning costs and price caps on increases, which will provide a  better view as to modelling the future cashflows of the gas network but considerable uncertainty presently exists  with respect to the future regulatory response for gas.  This may result in a material change to the estimated  cash inflows expected to be received by Icon Distribution from its investment in the ActewAGL Distribution  Partnership and the resultant fair value of the gas assets in future periods.  2.

Icon Water and its controlled entities are required to  make an equivalent payment to the ACT Government as required by the Territory-owned Corporations Act  1990.  The income tax equivalents expense or benefit for the period is the tax payable/receivable on the current  period's taxable income based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes  in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses.  The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted  at the end of the reporting period where Icon Water’s subsidiaries and associates operate and generate  taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations  in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on  the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.  Tax consolidation legislation  Icon Water and its controlled entities have entered into a tax funding agreement under which the controlled  entities fully compensate Icon Water for any current tax payable assumed and are compensated by Icon  Water for any current tax receivable and deferred tax assets relating to unused tax credits that are  transferred to Icon Water under the tax consolidation legislation. The funding amounts are determined by  reference to the amounts recognised in the controlled entities' financial statements.  The amounts receivable/payable under the tax funding agreement is due upon receipt of the funding  advice from Icon Water, which is issued as soon as practicable at the end of the financial year. Icon Water  may also require payment of interim funding amounts to assist with its obligations to pay tax instalments. The  funding amounts are recognised as non-current intercompany loan receivable or payable.  Accounting policy  Icon Distribution pays 100% of its profits to its immediate parent entity, Icon Water Limited.  A provision is made  for this dividend at the end of the financial year.  2022−23 Annual Report  172 172  ===== PAGE 175 ===== Icon Distribution Investments Limited  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023    21    5.

Icon Distribution  has a 50% participating interest in the ActewAGL Distribution Partnership. Information relating to the ActewAGL  Distribution Partnership is set out below:  Share of the ActewAGL Distribution Partnership commitments:      2023    2022      $’000    $’000  Capital commitments    12,157    28,266  Each of the partners in the ActewAGL Distribution Partnership is jointly and severally liable for the debts of the  Partnership.  The assets of the ActewAGL Distribution Partnership exceeded its debts at 30 June 2023.  (b) Bank guarantees  A number of bank guarantees have been provided by the partnership for the normal operations of the business.  Each of the partners in the ActewAGL Distribution Partnership is jointly and severally liable for the debts of the  partnership.   (c) Contingent liabilities  There are no contingent public liability insurance claims against the ActewAGL Distribution Partnership at year  end. Icon Distribution's share of this contingent liability is nil as at 30 June 2023 (30 June 2022: nil).        Accounting policy  The cost method of accounting is used for all acquisitions of assets regardless of whether equity instruments  or other assets are acquired. Cost is measured as the fair value of the assets given up, shares issued or liabilities  undertaken at the date of acquisition plus incidental costs directly attributable to the acquisition.  Icon Distribution has assessed its joint arrangement in ActewAGL Distribution Partnership and concluded the  arrangement to be a joint venture. The interest in the joint venture is accounted for using the equity method.  Under this method, the share of the profits or losses of the partnership is recognised as income in the statement  of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, and the share of movement in reserves is recognised in  reserves in the balance sheet.  173 173 Financial reports  ===== PAGE 176 ===== Icon Distribution Investments Limited  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023  22  5. Investments accounted for using the equity method (continued) Accounting policy (continued)  Icon Distribution's share in the plant and equipment assets of the ActewAGL Distribution Partnership will be  adjusted to fair value, if material, to align to Icon Water Group's accounting policy on property, plant and  equipment assets. The valuation is conducted by way of discounting the expected cash flows of the  ActewAGL Distribution Partnership to present value.  An annual assessment of fair value is performed to determine if it is materially different to the carrying value  at the end of the reporting period. The assessment includes both qualitative and quantitative reviews.    Critical Accounting Estimate  Revaluation of plant and equipment within the Distribution partnership  Icon Distribution assesses the fair value of plant and equipment within the ActewAGL Distribution Partnership  annually.   Gas assets  The ACT Government’s Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Reduction (Natural Gas Transition)  Amendment Bill was legislated in June 2023 and formalises its long-term strategy to transition away from fossil- fuel gas and achieve carbon neutrality by 2045.  In order to achieve this, it is more than likely that the use of natural gas within the ACT will cease within the  next 23-year period. For the year ended 30 June 2023, the fair value of gas assets has been determined by  application of an income approach using a discounted cash flow method.   The following key estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation calculations for the current reporting  period are:  • estimated future cash flows, based on management’s estimates, have been projected over 23 years  to 30 June 2045, with no terminal value applied; • forecasted revenue considers reducing volumes over time and a declining regulated asset base (RAB); • forecasts include cash inflows anticipated from the disposal of decommissioned regulated assets; • only nominal capital expenditure is forecast to be incurred until 2045. Investment or growth capital expenditure has not been forecast as the assets are considered to be in good condition with the remaining service life likely able to deliver natural gas until termination by, or before, 2045; • other operational and incidental expenditures such as taxes and decommissioning costs are also expected to be fully recovered over the forecast period; • under recoveries due to revenue shortfalls are expected to be recovered in subsequent regulatory periods. Decreasing volumes over the forecast period may result in price increases to the remaining customer base. Management have not included pricing caps in later years where pricing increases are expected; • the Weighted Cost of Capital (WACC) discount rate of 6.00% (2022: 5.10%) has been developed from a market participant perspective and has been applied to discount cash flows and reflects the longer-term view of the risks inherent in the forecast cash flows; • the RAB is expected to be fully recovered over the remaining useful life and it is also assumed that returns are not expected to be recovered beyond an asset’s useful life. Inherent in this assumption is that the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) will allow the RAB base and associated regulatory depreciation to be recovered by 2045; and • the RAB has been depreciated on a straight-line basis and will have a nil value by the end of the forecast period in 2045. 2022−23 Annual Report  174 174  ===== PAGE 177 ===== Icon Distribution Investments Limited  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023  23  5. Investments accounted for using the equity method (continued) Critical Accounting Estimate (continued)  Revaluation of plant and equipment within the Distribution partnership (continued)  Gas assets (continued)  All estimates regarding future outcomes are based upon the use of scenarios, judgements and assumptions  and are subject to risk and uncertainty that may be beyond the control of management, therefore there is  a possibility that changes in circumstances will materially alter projections which could lead to changes to  estimates in future reporting periods.  Specialist valuation advice has been obtained to perform the income valuation approach and also  undertake a correlation using the market-multiples approach to further assess the reasonableness of the  valuation outcome. This included calculating implied EV/EBITDA multiples and EV/RAB multiples. In addition  to the income valuation approach and the market-multiples approach, an assessment has also been made  as to whether there are qualitative factors that could impact the valuation.  The valuation is sensitive to variations in the WACC, consumption volumes, decommissioning costs and  assumptions around the estimated useful life of the RAB.   The valuation exercise undertaken for gas assets for the year ended 30 June 2023 resulted in a $40.8 million  decrement adjustment being required for the equity accounted investment in the partnership reflecting the  change in value of Icon Distribution’s investment in those underlying assets. This adjustment was recognised  in the Asset revaluation reserve.  Electricity assets  For the year ended 30 June 2023, the fair value of electricity assets has been determined by application of  an income approach using a discounted cash flow method. The following key estimates and assumptions  underlying the valuation calculations for the current reporting period are:  • estimated future cash flows, based on management’s estimate, have been projected over five years and discounted to their present value using the WACC; • the WACC discount rate of 6.00% (2022: 5.10%) has been used to discount cash flows and has been developed from a market participant perspective. The WACC discount rate used is based on external valuation advice and is considered the best estimate of a long-term view of the market cost  of capital; • future capital expenditure, fixed and variable operational expenditure and related revenues relating to restructuring or improving asset performance have been included in the cash flows, derived from the Board approved 2023-24 long term forecasts and taking into account the latest determinations from the AER; and • the projected regulatory asset base value (at a multiple of 1.25) has been used to compute the terminal value of the valuation. The valuation exercise undertaken for electricity assets for the year ending 30 June 2023 resulted in a $23.9  million decrement adjustment being required for the equity accounted investment in the partnership  reflecting the change in value of Icon Distribution’s investment in those underlying assets. This adjustment was  recognised in the Asset revaluation reserve.

In my opinion, the financial report:   (i) presents fairly, in all material respects, the Company’s financial position as at 30 June 2023, and  its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended; and  (ii) is presented in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards – Simplified Disclosures and  the Corporations Regulations 2001.   Basis for opinion  I conducted the audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards. My responsibilities  under the standards are further described in the ‘Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the  financial report’ section of this report.   I am independent of the Company in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of  the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical  Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence  Standards) (Code). I have also fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.   I believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my  opinion.   Responsibilities of the Company for the financial report  The directors of the Company are responsible for:  •  preparing and fairly presenting the financial in accordance with Australian Accounting  Standards – Simplified Disclosures and the Corporations Act 2001;  •  determining the internal controls necessary for the preparation and fair presentation of the  financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud; and  •  assessing the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern and disclosing, as  applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting  in preparing the financial report.    2022−23 Annual Report  190 190  ===== PAGE 193 ===== Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial report   My objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is  free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report  that includes my opinion.   Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted  in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when  it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or  in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken  on the basis of the financial report.  As part of an audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards, I exercise professional  judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:  •  identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to  fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain  audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk  of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting  from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations,  or the override of internal control;   •  obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit  procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for expressing an opinion on  the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls;  •  evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of  accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors;  •  conclude on the appropriateness of the Company’s use of the going concern basis of  accounting and, based on audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists  related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to  continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to  draw attention in this report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such  disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. I base my conclusions on the audit  evidence obtained up to the date of this report. However, future events or conditions may  cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern; and  •  evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the  disclosures, and whether it represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner  that achieves fair presentation.  I communicate with the directors of the Company regarding, among other matters, the planned  scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in  internal control that I identify during my audit.

Significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial report are set out below and  in the relevant notes.  These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless  otherwise stated.   a) Basis of preparation This general purpose financial report has been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting  Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board and the Corporations  Act 2001. Icon Retail is a for-profit entity for the purpose of preparing the financial statements.  (i) Compliance with Australian Accounting Standards - Simplified Disclosure Requirements The financial report of Icon Retail complies with Australian Accounting Standards – Simplified Disclosures as issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB). (ii) Historical cost convention These financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost convention, unless otherwise stated  in the financial statements. (iii) Early adoption of standards The directors have not elected under section 334(5) of the Corporations Act 2001 to early adopt any new Australian Accounting Standard in the current year and they are not expected to have a material impact. (iv) New and amended standards adopted There are no standards, interpretations or amendments to existing standards that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 July 2022 that have a material impact on the amounts recognised in prior periods or will affect the current or future periods. (v) Going concern The financial report has been prepared on a going concern basis.  At 30 June 2023, current liabilities exceed current assets by $11.8 million.  This deficiency in current assets is managed by an intercompany loan and the Icon Water Group’s ability to generate profits, as evidenced by current and prior year results as well as generating positive cash inflow from operating activities.  In the opinion of the directors,  Icon Retail has adequate resources to continue as a going concern and pay its debts as and when they fall due and payable. b) Rounding and presentation of amounts Icon Retail is a company of the kind referred to in ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors’  Report) Instrument 2016/191, relating to the 'rounding off' of amounts in the financial statements. Amounts  in the financial statements have been rounded off in accordance with the Instrument to the nearest  thousand dollars, or in certain cases, the nearest dollar.  Where applicable, comparative figures have been adjusted to conform to changes in presentation for the  current year.  c) Goods and Services Tax (GST) Revenues, expenses, assets other than receivables, and liabilities other than payables are recognised  exclusive of GST. Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST payable and  receivable.  2022−23 Annual Report  198 198  ===== PAGE 201 ===== Icon Retail Investments Limited  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023  18  1. Significant accounting policies (continued) d) Impact of climate change related risk Australia’s transition to a low carbon economy is subject to considerable uncertainty including in relation to  government policy, technology development and consumer uptake of new technologies. The ACT  Government has introduced legislated targets to reduce electricity emissions to zero and ultimately achieve  carbon neutrality by 2045. This strategy places a strong emphasis on the energy sector to effectively reduce  emissions that come directly from electricity and gas assets and develop renewable energy opportunities in  the short to medium term.   Icon Retail has a significant investment in the ActewAGL Retail Partnership which sells electricity, gas and  other services to its retail and commercial customers in the ACT and surrounding regions. It has been  assessed that the recent change in the ACT Government’s policy has not affected the future cash flow  projections and recoverable asset values in determining the fair valuation of the investment in the  ActewAGL Retail Partnership as at 30 June 2023.   The energy transition represents a period of significant change and volatility which presents both risks and  opportunities for the ActewAGL Retail Partnership.  The continued shift towards full electrification will likely  increase the overall demand for electricity and a move away from fossil-fuel gas.  Ahead of 2045, there may  be regulatory intervention in both the national electricity and gas markets, including the possibility of the  introduction of network price caps.  In such an event, the network price caps would impact all retailers.  2.

Income tax equivalents expense (continued) Accounting policy  National Tax Equivalents Regime  Icon Retail is exempt from Federal income tax.  Icon Water and its controlled entities are required to make  an equivalent payment to the ACT Government as required by the Territory-owned Corporations Act 1990.  The income tax equivalents expense or benefit for the period is the tax payable/receivable on the current  period's taxable income based on the applicable income tax rate adjusted by changes in deferred tax  assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses.  The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted  at the end of the reporting period where Icon Water’s subsidiaries and associates operate and generate  taxable income.  Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to  situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.  It establishes provisions where  appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.  Tax consolidation legislation  Icon Water and its controlled entities have entered into a tax funding agreement under which the  controlled entities fully compensate Icon Water for any current tax payable assumed and are  compensated by Icon Water for any current tax receivable and deferred tax assets relating to unused tax  credits that are transferred to Icon Water under the tax consolidation legislation.  The funding amounts  are determined by reference to the amounts recognised in its controlled entities' financial statements.  The amounts receivable/payable under the tax funding agreement is due upon receipt of the funding  advice from Icon Water, which is issued as soon as practicable at the end of the financial year.  Icon  Water may also require payment of interim funding amounts to assist with its obligations to pay tax  instalments.  The funding amounts are recognised as non-current intercompany loan receivable or  payable.  201 201 Financial reports  ===== PAGE 204 ===== Icon Retail Investments Limited  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023  21  4.

A provision is  made for this dividend at the end of the financial year.  Accounting policy  These amounts represent receivables from Icon Water Limited relating to tax losses.  Icon Retail holds the  receivable with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them  subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.  Accounting policy  The intercompany loan liability to the immediate parent entity, Icon Water Limited, is non-interest  bearing, unsecured and is not payable in the normal course of business.   2022−23 Annual Report  202 202  ===== PAGE 205 ===== Icon Retail Investments Limited  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023  22  6.

Cost is measured as the fair value of the assets given up, shares  issued or liabilities undertaken at the date of acquisition plus incidental costs directly attributable to the  acquisition.  Icon Retail has assessed its joint arrangements in ActewAGL Retail Partnership and ActewAGL Retail  Investments Pty Ltd and concluded the arrangements to be joint ventures.  The interests in the joint  ventures are accounted for using the equity method.  Under this method, the share of profit or losses of  the partnership or company is recognised as income in the statement of profit or loss and comprehensive  income, and the share of movement in reserves is recognised in reserves in the statement of financial  position.  Icon Retail’s share in plant and equipment assets of the ActewAGL Retail Partnership is adjusted to fair  value if considered material to align to Icon Water Group’s accounting policy on infrastructure property,  plant and equipment assets accounted for at fair value.   2022−23 Annual Report  204 204  ===== PAGE 207 ===== Icon Retail Investments Limited  Notes to the financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2023  24  8.

The summarised financial report is consistent with the special purpose financial report from which it is derived.  Profit  Profit for the year ended 30 June 2023 was $313 million, compared to the prior year’s profit of $269 million.  Total revenue for the year ended 30 June 2023 was $971 million compared to $951 million in the prior year. The increase is  primarily due to the increased sale of electricity attributable to higher electricity consumption. This is partially offset by the  regulated decrease in Retail electricity charges due to the impact of ACT Government jurisdictional schemes resulting in  lower network charges for retailers.   Total other income for the year ended 30 June 2023 was $76 million compared to $27 million in the prior year. The increase  is primarily due to the increase in capital contributions received in our energy networks business Evoenergy for capital works  undertaken on behalf of its customers, as well as gifted assets received as part of these customer initiated works.   The total cost of providing goods and services for the year ended 30 June 2023 was $670 million compared to $632 million  in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to the increased cost of electricity purchases due to higher electricity  consumption.  Cash flow  The Joint Venture generated $397 million from its operating activities for the year ended 30 June 2023 compared to  $323 million in the prior year.  Net cash outflows used in investing activities were $132 million for the current year, compared to $103 million for the prior  year.   Cash surplus to the Joint Venture’s operational requirements is returned to the Partners in the form of cash distributions. In  the current financial year, $84 million was distributed to ActewAGL’s Partners, $88 million lower than the $172 million in the  prior year, this decrease occurring in the Distribution Partnership (AAD). This is primarily due to the prior year distribution to  AAD Partners of a portion of the large-scale feed-in tariff (LFiT) scheme over-recovery balance collected by Evoenergy which  was recovered via lower distributions in the current year. Also, in the prior year the proceeds from the sale of smart metering  assets were distributed to Partners.  Financial position  At 30 June 2023, the Joint Venture had net assets of $1,864 million compared to $1,635 million in the prior year. The increase  is primarily due to an increase in the capital investment in the energy network and the higher cash balance due to the  LFiT over-recovery being retained in AAD. Cash available at 30 June 2023, including the LFiT over-recovery balance,  was $304 million, $173 million higher than the prior year. Current assets were $546 million compared to $407 million in the  prior year. Current liabilities were $280 million compared to $289 million at the same time last year. The Joint Venture  does not have any borrowings other than for leases of motor vehicles.  The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is $1,526 million, compared to $1,435 million in the prior year, the  increase is primarily due to the capital investment in the energy network.  211 211 Financial reports  ===== PAGE 214 ===== ActewAGL Joint Venture  Statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income  For the year ended 30 June 2023  2  2023  $’000  2022  $’000  Continuing operations  Revenue   971,082  951,268  Other income  75,653  26,782  Cost of providing goods and services  (670,045)  (631,604)  Share of profits of joint ventures   269  15  Profit before net financing costs, depreciation and amortisation  376,959  346,461  Depreciation and amortisation  (73,025)  (76,346)  Profit before net financing income/costs  303,934  270,115  Finance income  10,721  825  Finance costs  (1,569)  (1,733)  Net financing income/(costs)  9,152  (908)  Profit before tax  313,086  269,207  Income tax benefit  - 32 Profit for the year  313,086  269,239  Profit for the year is attributable to:  Partners of the ActewAGL Joint Venture  313,086  269,239  Other comprehensive income for the year  -  -  Total comprehensive income for the year  313,086  269,239  Total comprehensive income for the year is attributable to:  Partners of the ActewAGL Joint Venture   313,086  269,239  2022−23 Annual Report  212 212  ===== PAGE 215 ===== ActewAGL Joint Venture  Statement of financial position  As at 30 June 2023  3  2023  $’000  2022  $’000  Assets  Current assets  Cash and cash equivalents  304,423  131,415  Trade and other receivables  88,544  82,384  Contract assets  128,452  173,107  Inventories  16,437  10,212  Other current assets  8,127  9,538  Total current assets  545,983  406,656  Non-current assets  Investments in joint ventures  2,811  2,542  Receivables  3,958  4,768  Property, plant and equipment  1,525,707  1,435,172  Right-of-use assets  25,164  30,064  Intangible assets  67,602  76,895  Total non-current assets  1,625,242  1,549,441  Total assets  2,171,225  1,956,097  Liabilities  Current liabilities  Trade and other payables  81,837  67,820  Contract liabilities  162,519  183,217  Provisions  29,168  28,936  Other liabilities including leases  6,929  9,202  Total current liabilities  280,453  289,175  Non-current liabilities  Contract liabilities  238  444  Provisions  1,790  1,696  Other liabilities including leases  24,862  29,986  Total non-current liabilities  26,890  32,126  Total liabilities  307,343  321,301  Net assets  1,863,882  1,634,796  Joint Venture Funds  Joint Venture funds  1,863,882  1,634,796  Total Joint Venture funds  1,863,882  1,634,796  213 213 Financial reports  ===== PAGE 216 ===== ActewAGL Joint Venture  Statement of cash flows  For the year ended 30 June 2023        5      2023  $’000  2022  $’000  Cash flows from operating activities        Receipts from customers (inclusive of GST)    1,242,756  1,137,267  Payments to suppliers and employees (inclusive of GST)     (854,311)  (813,336)  Income taxes paid    -  (132)  Finance income received    9,762  758  Finance costs paid     (1,565)  (1,656)  Net cash inflow from operating activities    396,642  322,901          Cash flows from investing activities        Payments for property, plant and equipment     (125,369)  (110,030)  Payments for intangible assets     (6,528)  (15,809)  Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment    274  22,836  Net cash (outflow) from investing activities     (131,623)  (103,003)          Cash flows from financing activities        Distributions paid to Partners     (84,000)  (172,000)  Principal elements of lease payments     (8,011)  (7,705)  Net cash (outflow) from financing activities     (92,011)  (179,705)          Net increase in cash and cash equivalents    173,008  40,193  Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the year    131,415  91,222  Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year    304,423  131,415        ActewAGL Joint Venture  Statement of changes in Joint Venture funds  For the year ended 30 June 2023  4  Balance at 1 July 2022  Profit for the year  Other comprehensive income for the year  Total comprehensive income for the year  Transactions with Partners in their capacity as Partners:  Distributions paid  Balance at 30 June 2023  Balance at 1 July 2021  Profit for the year  Other comprehensive income for the year  Total comprehensive income for the year  Transactions with Partners in their capacity as Partners:  Distributions paid  Balance at 30 June 2022  2022−23 Annual Report  214 214  ===== PAGE 217 ===== ActewAGL Joint Venture  Joint Venture Board’s declaration  For the year ended 30 June 2023  6  The ActewAGL Joint Venture prepares a special purpose financial report to satisfy the Board's reporting requirements under  the ACTEW/AGL Partnership Facilitation Act 2000.
