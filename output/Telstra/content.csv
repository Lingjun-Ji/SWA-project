This means not only getting the  basics right to be a responsible and trusted business,  but also working to create outcomes in the best  interest of all Australians.    One of our three Behaviours is that we make a  difference. We do the right thing for our customers,   our communities, the planet, ourselves and each other.  As we all grapple with cost-of-living pressures, natural  disasters, the climate crisis, rapid technology change,  and the unrelenting threat from cyber-crime, making   a difference has never been more important in helping  us achieve our purpose: to build a connected future   so everyone can thrive.  Promoting the health, safety   and wellbeing of our people  With our people working in a range of different  environments, from enclosed spaces on network sites  to retail stores and contact centres, we are committed  to enabling a safe workplace through dedicated  support to our people. We have a robust reporting  framework to identify, prevent and mitigate harm,  and actively campaign on the importance of reporting  health and safety incidents by our people as a critical  way to prevent harm and to access support from our  safety and health management teams.   This year, we launched our new ‘Big Three’ behaviours  and habits, which guide how we show up for our  customers and each other to help us deliver on our  purpose. This year, we also launched our new Global  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion strategy and we are  committed to maintaining a diverse and inclusive  workplace where differences are respected.  As we implement necessary organisational changes,  we are cognisant of the impact this can have on  our people who may also be feeling the effects of  socioeconomic factors. We have communicated these  decisions with transparency and care, and will continue  to support our people through the changes.  Supporting customers in   vulnerable circumstances  Australians have experienced significant challenges  this year, ranging from natural disasters to cost- of-living pressures. Through these challenges, our  products, services and programs have been critical  to help keep communities and customers connected,  regardless of their location, circumstance or socio- economic status. We are dedicated to supporting our  customers in a way that meets their needs, whether  they are struggling financially, seeking safe and secure  communications as a victim-survivor of domestic  and family violence, or require immediate access to  connectivity during times of crisis. For example, our  Access for Everyone package provides concession  offers, payment assistance options, free payphones,  and more. In FY24, we helped more than 1.4 million  customers stay connected.   We are delighted to share our 2024 Sustainability Report  4 Sustainability at Telstra 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report  ===== PAGE 5 ===== Taking climate action  We have made good progress against our T25  commitments. We’ve reduced both our scope 1+2  and scope 3 emissions by 37% since FY19. We’ve also  stepped up our commitment to reduce our scope 1+2  carbon emissions, now targeting a 70 per cent (up from  50 per cent) reduction by 2030 (from an FY19 baseline)  and pivoting from using carbon credits to off set the  residual emissions from our operations and products.  In addition, we have now contracted future renewable  energy generation equivalent to over 100 per cent of  our forecast consumption by the end of 2025. However,  there is risk that the overall amount of renewable  energy generated from our contracted projects may  not meet 100 per cent of our forecast consumption  by the end of 2025.   As we strive to approach environmental matters  holistically, it’s important to also consider our impact  on nature. We interact with nature everyday through  the materials we use as well as our infrastructure and  network. To protect it for generations to come, we have  begun analysing our key nature-related dependencies,  impacts, risks and opportunities. We’re also embedding  sustainability across all areas of the organisation,  including business and risk processes, to help meet  our sustainability commitments.  Investing in online safety, privacy  and security   Our customers trust us with protecting their data and  privacy, and we take that responsibility very seriously.  With cyberthreats becoming more frequent and  sophisticated in nature, we continue to invest heavily  in cyber security measures to help protect our  customers from scams and threats, and quickly  respond to incidents. We also invest in cybersecurity  employee training and provide educational resources  to help our customers protect and manage their data  safely. However, is important to recognise that not  every potential threat can be entirely mitigated and  we need to remain focused on identifying and  addressing safety, privacy and security issues.  Keeping our communities connected  Providing reliable connectivity in regional and rural  Australia remains an important focus. This year, we  have continued to invest in expanding and upgrading  our network in regional areas, in infrastructure  including our intercity fi bre network, and in new  services including LEO Satellite technology to  bring connectivity to more places.  To provide a better experience for everyone on 4G and  5G networks, we are switching off  our 3G network, and  we are committed to achieving 4G coverage equivalent  to existing 3G coverage before then1. We also support  modernising the Universal Service Obligation (USO) and  will work with Government and regional communities  to ensure the most appropriate technologies are used  for the delivery of fi xed telephone services.  1. For more information, visit Telstra Exchange.  Backing the aspirations  of First Nations people Telstra has a longstanding commitment to  reconciliation, and it is embedded across our  organisation through building digital skills, providing  employment opportunities and respecting First  Nations cultural heritage through collaborative  engagement. We’ve completed year two of our  three-year Stretch Reconciliation Action Plan  (RAP) and we are making good progress. For  example, we have grown our First Nations Connect  teams, launched the fi rst Mapping the Digital Gap  report to understand digital inclusion barriers for  remote First Nations communities and provided  training opportunities for our people to deepen  their understanding of First Nations culture.   Commitment to transparency    This year the climate-related disclosures in our  Annual Report have been guided by the International  Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB)’s climate  disclosure standard (International Financial Reporting  Standard (IFRS) S2). We are also early adopters of  the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures  (TNFD) and have published our fi rst disclosure in our  Annual Report about how we manage nature-related  dependency, risk, impact and opportunity.  At Telstra, we regularly review our most signifi cant  sustainability impacts in accordance with the Global  Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards and alignment  to the Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs). We  work to ensure our business and our business partners  operate with respect for human rights and report our  progress in our annual Modern Slavery Act Statement.  We recognise that we have a responsibility and an  opportunity to contribute to a more sustainable and  inclusive future for everyone. We also recognise the  work ahead and importance of remaining committed  to our sustainability goals.    We thank you for your interest in this report on our  progress to date and invite any feedback to help  us contribute positively to the communities where  we operate.

On track for delivery       Progress made but below target      Not on track  ✅  Completed 2.  Telstra led six audits and 51 audits were led by peers from the JAC (Joint Audit Cooperation) group. 3.   The Digicel Pacific acquisition was completed in FY23. Digicel Pacific has been excluded from Telstra’s emissions reporting and targets in FY24 as we have not  yet been able to compile data that aligns to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol and meets assurance standards. A multi-year program of education, capability  and capacity building is in progress to uplift data quality and associated data management systems. In the interim, Telstra has reported Digicel Pacific emission  estimates for FY24 and FY19 within our 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report and 2024 Data Pack.  4.  In June 2024, we increased our scope 1+2 emissions reduction target from ‘reduce our absolute emissions by at least 50% by 2030’ from an FY19 baseline. 5.   This is ahead of the trajectory required to reach our target of 50 per cent by 2030, however there is still some risk relating to our scope 3 target – See the Managing  our scope 3 emissions section of this report. In addition, in FY24, improved and more granular investment data allowed us to identify that one entity’s emissions  were duplicated in our scope 3 emissions reporting. As a result, category 15 and total scope 3 emissions differ from those reported in previous years. 6.   From 1 July 2024, Telstra Group will no longer be offsetting the emissions from our operations through the use of carbon credits. We will continue to offset emissions  associated with mobile phone plans and mobile broadband plans until 31 August 2024.  7.   We are committed to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, through the Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign. We are in the process of  validating our science-based net-zero target to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Corporate Net-Zero Standard. 8.   The Digicel Pacific acquisition completed in FY23. Digicel Pacific has been excluded from Telstra’s circular economy reporting in FY24 as we are still working to  compile timely and suitable data. A multi-year program has commenced with the aim of progressively reporting relevant Digicel Pacific circular economy data in  future periods. FY24 progress against targets 6 Sustainability at Telstra 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report  ===== PAGE 7 ===== Our strategy Our purpose is to build a connected future so  everyone can thrive. This underpins our belief that  Telstra has a real opportunity to play a leadership role  in creating a more sustainable and inclusive world.  We are harnessing technology to create a better digital  world and minimise our impact on the planet, as well  as helping our customers, our suppliers and Australia  do the same.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Management approach At Telstra, we consider telecommunications and  technology as an enabler of social and environmental  solutions that contribute to Sustainable Development  Goals (SDGs).  We continue to explore new ways of embedding  sustainability into our business, our decision- making and our culture at Telstra. We know that  building organisational resilience and capacity  to respond to emerging challenges will position  us to anticipate and manage the future risk  landscape more eff ectively. It will accelerate  innovation by driving the development of new  products, services and solutions that can attract  customers and lead to market opportunities.  As a purpose-led organisation, we will seek  to attract and keep the best talent, build our  reputation and strengthen our stakeholder  relationships. We are managing sustainability at Telstra by: • Doing better as a business – delivering on our commitment to do business responsibly and being transparent, ethical and accountable wherever we operate. • Doing better for communities – technology connects us all. We create a better digital world by helping make sure Australians, of every background and ability, has the skills and confi dence to safely take part in the online world. • Doing better by the environment – we take climate action, protect nature and biodiversity and contribute to a circular economy. We work with our customers and suppliers to minimise the impact of climate change and enable the transition to a low-carbon future.

Our materiality  process operates in two-year cycles between a full  materiality assessment and a desktop review, both  of which include peer reviews, industry and global  reporting standard reviews, internal reviews and survey  results. A desktop review was performed in FY24.  We apply a double materiality approach,   considering materiality from both an impact   materiality perspective, as well as a financial  materiality perspective. The output of our material  impact assessment informs the content of this report  and is a key consideration in how we continue to evolve  our sustainability ambitions. We assess financial risk  materiality through our risk management process  where we identify the internal impacts that may  generate risks to Telstra’s enterprise value.  The output of our material risk assessment,  including sustainability-related risks, is  provided in the ‘Material risks’ and ‘Acting  on climate and nature’ sections of our 2024  Annual Report available reports page.                                                               p                                                                                                                                                  For more information on our materiality  methodology, see our In focus: Sustainability  at Telstra paper available on our reports page.

Doing business  responsibly  11 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report  ===== PAGE 12 ===== Approach How we do business  responsibly At Telstra, we are committed to acting responsibly   and being transparent and accountable wherever   we operate. We know that the long-term success   of our company depends on maintaining the trust   of our customers, community and partners through   our value chain.   We do business responsibly by:  •  improving our products and services so they   are sustainable, inclusive and sold responsibly •  driving transparency of our supply chain and  upholding the highest standards in human rights   •   conducting business with fairness and transparency  to build trust with all our stakeholders •  being a diverse, inclusive, safe and flexible  workplace that unleashes the potential of   our people. Training our people to   act responsibly   Our mandatory Business Essentials training  supports our commitment to acting ethically  and responsibly and adhering to our Code of  Conduct. In FY24, we achieved the majority of  our target for 100 per cent completion of the  mandatory refresher training across all Telstra  team members including contingent workers,  partners and internal staff. We achieved a 99.9  per cent total completion rate with 100 per cent  of internal employees and 99.9 per cent for  external team members. For more information on our approach   to doing business responsibly, see our   In focus: Doing business responsibly   paper available on our reports page.  Leading conduct   and governance Across our operations, we promote a fair and  responsible culture through the Telstra Group   Code of Conduct (‘Code’), Group Policies, mandatory  compliance training and by recognising employees   who demonstrate our behaviours and habits. Our  behaviours and habits, Code and supporting Group  Policies and Standards guide our people and partners  to uphold our expectation to act fairly, ethically and   in accordance with the law. For more information, see the ‘Acting  lawfully, ethically and responsibly’   section in our 2024 Corporate Governance  Statement available on our reports page.  For how we govern our supply chain  relationships, see our 2024 Modern   Slavery Act Statement available on   our reports page.  Whistleblowing   Our Code further fosters a culture where our  people are encouraged to speak up and raise  concerns with confidence.  We seek to ensure our people know how to  raise a concern though a range of channels,  including under Telstra’s Whistleblowing Policy.  The Whistleblowing Policy and the relevant  legislation establish protections for a range  of people – including current and former  employees, their relatives and dependants and  suppliers – to report concerns about illegal,  unethical or improper conduct or an improper  state of affairs or circumstances at Telstra.  Our Whistleblowing Policy is supported by   a confidential process that provides appropriate  protections for anyone to report their  concerns; a whistleblowing service where  people can lodge a report anonymously; and  professional investigators and case managers  who investigate eligible reports. Telstra’s  Whistleblowing Committee, which is chaired  by the Group Company Secretary, receives  whistleblowing disclosures and oversees  investigations and any follow-up actions  required. The Whistleblowing Committee   reports to Telstra’s Audit & Risk Committee.  We received 213 whistleblowing reports in FY24,  which was an increase of 26 per cent compared  to FY23. Of these reports 152 were eligible  whistleblowing disclosures. We completed 149  investigations in FY24, with the allegations being  substantiated in whole or in part for 40 reports,  noting that one report might cover multiple  matters and the types of issues being reported  vary in terms of the seriousness of the allegation.  The nature of matters reported that were eligible  whistleblowing disclosures covers people and  workplace culture issues (around 53 per cent),  ethical behaviour (around 25 per cent), fraud and  theft (around 14 per cent) and a small number of  reports on other issues such as misuse of systems  and financial reporting/audit. The core allegations  range from bullying, poor leadership, conflicts of  interest to unethical recruitment practices.

These improvements  are driving higher customer satisfaction and  complaints are at record lows. For more information on our approach to  customer experience and how we measure  it, see the Building a better customer  experience section under ‘Strategy &  performance’ in our 2024 Annual Report  available on our reports page.  Product and service design Telstra's Customer Experience (CX) Design   Framework, comprising 16 principles, guides product  investments based on good, better and brilliant  customer experiences. The Framework emphasises  sustainability and accessibility to help ensure  customer-centric design of products and services.  Regular updates and integration into governance  processes continually evolve the framework.  Operationalising the framework with a CX assessment  tool enables teams to evaluate activities against CX  principles, a mandatory step for customer-impacting  initiatives. Telstra's Product Excellence program  applies the CX Design Framework to all product  releases and uses it to inform improvement plans   for existing products.  This year we have embedded the CX Design Framework  in the Telstra Enterprise Go-to-Market process and  enhanced our standards to align with regulatory  changes and evolving customer needs. Design and accessibility  excellence  In November 2023, Telstra was honoured to be   named 2023 Corporate Website of the Year at the  Australian Access Awards and our app was a finalist  for Corporate App of the year. We have built on this  success by expanding and maturing our accessibility  program, deepening our commitment to improving the  customer experience for all Australians. Our digital  assets achieved top-tier Band 1 Accessibility Maturity  Scores and recently received certification at Level   A/AA through our annual third party external audit.  Our specialist Accessibility team has grown in diversity  with over 50 per cent of people living with disability.  We are also a founding member of the Australian  Disability Network’s Accessible Technology Charter.  On our website we have created the Accessibility and  Disability hub, providing practical information for  people with disability on how to engage with Telstra  products and services using assistive technology   and key accessibility features. Trust and reputation Our goal, to grow trust and operate responsibly,   is one of the foundations of our reputation. We   use the reputation measurement platform RepTrak  to understand how customers and the broader  community think and feel about us. In FY24, we  increased our annual RepTrak reputation score   by 0.2 points from 63.5 to 63.7, for a total uplift   of 2.4 points from our FY21 baseline of 61.3. We   recognise we will continue to be challenged as we  transform and simplify our business.    13 Doing business responsibly 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report  ===== PAGE 14 ===== Responsible selling  To help ensure fair sales practices and actively   address customer issues, we listen to feedback,  monitor sales behaviour and are committed to  continuous improvement. We require our frontline  employees to undertake mandatory training in relation  to responsible sales practices and restrict their  access to Telstra systems if they do not complete  this satisfactorily and on time. We undertake credit  assessments and seek information about the ability   of our customers to afford to pay for our services.   Our approach is supported by tools and systems   and includes communicating affordability outcomes   to customers and offering alternatives when   necessary. We offer a wide range of devices at   different prices to enable customers to have   a broad range of affordable choices.  For more information on affordability,  see the Supporting people in vulnerable  circumstances section of this report.   Proactive self-reporting  Sometimes things do not go as planned. In some  instances, even small errors can have a significant  impact on a group of customers. This can be   especially serious when it impacts customers   in vulnerable circumstances.  We strive to meet community and stakeholder  expectations. Where we identify a significant issue,   we self-report this to regulators in line with community  expectations and our obligations. For example, we   self-reported to the Australian Communications  and Media Authority (ACMA) after we found that we  had charged 7,404 customers for ADSL broadband  services after they had disconnected. In December  2023, following ACMA’s investigation of the issue and  subsequent findings, we paid an infringement fine of  $3 million together with full refunds of around $20  million to impacted customers.  We continue to focus on preventing issues from  occurring, and where they do, ensuring we detect   and address them quickly. Through our Compliance  Uplift Program we have made significant improvements  in our controls and assurance capabilities to help  ensure our processes, policies and behaviours meet our  legal obligations and broader customer expectations. When we don't get it right  We aim to treat our customers fairly and offer them  products and services that are safe, easy to understand  and meet their underlying needs. Our Chief Customer  Advocate listens to our customers and helps us ensure  the voice of the customer is considered in the design   of products and processes.  We also aim to resolve complaints effectively and  respectfully, with a focus on resolving issues quickly  and in consideration on its merits. We are moving to new digital platforms that will make  the customer experience better, but we still find and  report cases where we fall short of some standards. In  addition to the enforcement noted above, we faced the  following enforcement action by regulators this year: •  paid a $0.3 million infringement notice and  provided an enforceable undertaking to the ACMA  for failing to provide accurate details of customers  to the Integrated Public Number Database (IPND) •  paid a $1.5 million infringement notice and provided  an enforceable undertaking to the ACMA for failing  to comply with customer authentication rules. For more information on our Chief  Customer Advocate, see the Chief  Customer Advocate Report on Customer  Vulnerability available on our website.    Telecommunications Industry  Ombudsman (TIO) complaints In FY21, we set the ambitious target to halve TIO  referral complaints by June 2025. This year, we  achieved and exceeded this target, more than a  year ahead of schedule with an overall reduction of  more than two thirds. Sometimes things go wrong.  When they do, we work with customers to resolve  issues as quickly as possible. If the customer remains  dissatisfied with the response, external dispute  resolution can be accessed through an industry  funded scheme: the Telecommunications Industry  Ombudsman (TIO).   14 Doing business responsibly 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report  ===== PAGE 15 ===== Human rights  Our Human Rights Policy sets out our commitment to respect and support human rights as defined in the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the ten principles of the United Nations (UN) Global Compact,   in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  This year, we refreshed our assessment of Telstra’s salient human rights issues. These have been determined  by identifying potential human rights risks present across Telstra’s value chain and assessing their saliency  according to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

For more information on how we manage  labour rights in our supply chain, see   our 2024 Modern Slavery Act Statement  available on our reports page.  We also work with our suppliers and partner with   CDP (previously known as the Carbon Disclosure  Project) to gain better insights into our emissions and  identify reduction opportunities. For more information,  see the Taking climate action section of this report.  To improve our use of resources, reduce waste going   to landfill and create innovative solutions to reduce   our environmental impact we work with various  partners across the lifecycle of our networks and  products. For more information, see the Progressing   a circular economy section of this report. Reflecting the diversity of our customers and  communities, we are also committed to elevating   First Nations peoples as suppliers to our businesses.  For more information, see the Reconciliation section   of this report.  We monitor, manage and report progress on a range of indicators used to assess the effectiveness of our actions  to support and ensure respect for human rights. These include: Salient human  rights issues Indicators Where to find these indicators Labour rights in  the supply chain • Number of supplier site audits conducted (including number of Tier 2  and 3 supplier audits) 2024 Modern Slavery Act Statement  available on our reports page • Number and type of supplier audit findings  • Number of corrective actions closed • Feedback from workers in worker voice surveys in relation to  their work conditions Fair and inclusive  workplace • Employee engagement score Our people and Advancing online  safety, privacy and security sections  of this report • Number of complaints made to the Australian Human Rights Commission • Number of employee discrimination and sexual harassment complaints 2024 Data Pack available on our  reports page • Number of employee discrimination complaints • Gender pay equity compa-ratio • Diversity of employees by gender and age group • Percentage of disability representation level in workforce Health and safety • Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate 2024 Data Pack available on our  reports page • Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate • High severity outcomes recorded Environment • Percentage reduction per year from FY19 baseline of scope 1+2  and scope 3 emissions 2024 Data Pack available on our  reports page • Percentage reduction in network waste Indigenous  people's rights • 100% of identified employees to undertake structured cultural e-learning Telstra Reconciliation Action Plan  Year 1 Report Digital and  customer rights • Percentage of Australian population reached by Telstra’s mobile network 2024 Annual Report  available on  our reports page • Number of customers in vulnerable circumstances helped to stay  connected each year Supporting people in vulnerable  circumstances section of  this report • Number of community members supported in building digital skills • Number of scam texts and calls to customers identified and blocked Advancing online safety, privacy  and security section of this report Privacy and  freedom of  expression • Number of privacy incidents requiring notification to the Office of the  Australian Information Commissioner Advancing online safety, privacy  and security section of this report • Number of customer information disclosures to third parties Data provided to Australian  Communications and Media Authority  (ACMA) and published in aggregate  in their Annual Report General • Number of whistleblowing reports and number of substantiated reports Leading conduct and governance  section of this report    • Percentage of employees and contractors who complete their  mandatory compliance training, on the Telstra Group Code of Conduct  (which includes modules on human rights, ethical behaviour and health,  safety and wellbeing) Leading conduct and governance  section of this report 16 Doing business responsibly 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report  ===== PAGE 17 ===== Reconciliation Our vision for reconciliation is an inclusive Australia  where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are  connected and empowered to thrive. Our vision will be  achieved by embedding reconciliation outcomes and  system changes into our organisation. This involves  working with First Nations people and harnessing the  strengths of our organisation to build digital futures,  providing employment opportunities to lift economic  participation and making Telstra a culturally inclusive  and engaged organisation. Telstra is also committed to supporting a fair and  inclusive Australia that recognises, respects and  celebrates its First Nations people, culture and  wisdom, and this is why we actively supported  the Uluru Statement from the Heart and the Voice  referendum. Telstra’s support included being one   of the 150+ signatories to the Reconciliation Action  Plan (RAP) Partner statement of support; holding  internal storytelling sessions with high profile speakers  including Thomas Mayo, Senator Patrick Dodson, and  Julian Leeser; providing education opportunities for  employees; and donating $1 million of advertising  space to the Yes campaigns. Land access and cultural heritage Ensuring the respectful management of land  access and cultural heritage is of utmost  importance to us. This is achieved through  comprehensive engagement with First Nations  communities and thorough assessments  of cultural heritage. By valuing culture and  protecting heritage sites, we not only comply with  legal requirements but also build constructive  relationships with First Nations people. These  relationships are vital to achieving wider goals   of societal and environmental sustainability. In FY24, we completed year two of our three-year  Stretch Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP). The 93  actions in our RAP stretch across the organisation and  cover activities that include improved infrastructure in  remote Australia (access), delivery of on-the-ground  digital literacy programs in remote communities  (digital ability) as well as targets around employment,  procurement, and cultural competency within our  organisation. FY24 performance highlights include: •  spending $42.5 million across 33 First Nations  businesses, improving on last year’s spend of  $20.8 million •   expanding our First Nations Connect Hotline   to 23 customer care team members, and  establishing micro call centres in Jumbun   and Palm Island (QLD) •   undertaking a truth telling project with the  National Communications Museum to tell the   story of the Overland Telegraph Line (OTL) with  specific focus and care toward First Nations’  contexts and experiences. For more information on our   commitment and action towards  reconciliation, visit our Engaging   First Nations Communities webpage.   17 Doing business responsibly 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report  ===== PAGE 18 ===== Our people Sustainable engagement Telstra's workplace culture, essential for realising our purpose and business strategy, centres on our new  Big Three behaviours and the supporting habits that guide how we perform in our roles. Our FY24 employee  engagement score was 79 which puts us three points below the 90th percentile target, but above Glint's global  75th percentile and reflects our ongoing focus on employee experience.     Learning and capability  development To build the capability to deliver our ambitions for   a workplace where people are engaged, productive  and collaborative, we invested $15.3 million in training  and development in FY24, with more than $4.9 million  invested in technology training and $3.5 million in  leadership training.  We invested just under $4.3 million in developing  critical capabilities including Human-centred Design,  Gallup Strengths Teaming, industry masterclasses  and the Future Ready leadership curriculum; along  with $0.9 million for all company access to LinkedIn  Learning and $1.7 million invested in our Connect,  Understand and Execute (CUE) program for   frontline staff. We have also invested $1.6 million into Career   Connect: an AI-enabled Talent Marketplace platform  that will commence our transition to a skills-based  organisation. The platform connects our people  to opportunities across Telstra based on skills,  experience and career goals, while also enhancing  informed strategic workforce planning and capability  development requirements. Continued investment   in technical skills In the past year, we’ve invested over $1.2 million in  blended learning solutions to upskill our workforce  in Data, Analytics and AI, Software Engineering, 5G,  Radio Access Networks and VoLTE and Security.  Over 470 employees received micro-credentials in  various domains including Product Management, Data  Analytics, Data Engineering and Security Engineering.  A $2 million investment in digital learning platforms  provided over 80,000 hours of skill-building in cloud,  data, analytics, AI, machine learning, cyber security,  software engineering and network skills. Additionally,  $1 million was spent on upskilling the technical  workforce including the field through vendor training  such as Red Hat, satellite and wireless technologies. Building a high-performance  culture We utilise annual and quarterly planning and  performance approach to deliver on company a   level objectives and key results (OKRs). Company  level OKRs provide clarity of prioritised work so we  can better respond to customer needs, as well as stop  or pause work that doesn’t align to our priorities and  focus on work with the greatest impact. Our people’s  strengths in various skills and capabilities guide the  prioritisation of work to which they are allocated.   We encourage our people to have regular conversations  with their leaders about their performance,  development and career needs as well as peer  feedback. We invest in our leaders’ capability to ensure  these conversations are meaningful and effective.   Our pay-for-performance philosophy means that   at the end of the financial year our people receive an  individual performance rating based on their outcomes  and behaviours. These performance ratings are an  important input to Fixed and Incentive pay outcomes  for the majority of our people.  For more information on our remuneration,  see our 2024 Remuneration Report which  forms part of our 2024 Annual Report  available on our reports page.  18 Doing business responsibly 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report  ===== PAGE 19 ===== Diversity, equity and inclusion  We are building a diverse, equitable and inclusive  workforce to enable their full potential and reflect  and better serve the diverse needs of our customers.  We believe everyone deserves to be respected for  their differences, valued for their contributions, and  celebrates for being their best self.  Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Policy   provides the framework for achieving measurable  DEI objectives. This is complemented by our  Discrimination, Bullying, Harassment and   Victimisation Policy which outlines our   commitment to providing a safe and inclusive   working environment where we treat each other   with respect.  We’re committing to increasing representation of  women in executive leadership at Telstra as a signatory  of the 40:40 Vision. By signing up to this alongside  other ASX300 organisations, we’re seeking to achieve  gender balance in executive leadership, by reaching   40 per cent female representation, 40 per cent male,  and 20 per cent identifying as any gender, by 2030.  We’re taking our commitment one step further and  extending the 40:40:20 goal to our overall workforce.  For more information, see the ‘DEI’   section in our 2024 Corporate Governance  Statement available on our reports page.  Providing leading   employment conditions  We consult with our people before we implement any  significant changes to the way we work. We regularly  engage with Telstra’s three main employee unions—  the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union  of Australia (CEPU), the Community and Public Sector  Union (CPSU) and Professionals Australia (APESMA).  Our people have the freedom to form or join a trade  union, to bargain collectively and to engage in trade  union activities. We do not monitor union membership  by our people. Our aim is to maintain an open and  constructive relationship with the representatives   of these unions.  In FY24, we conducted more than 20 formal  consultation meetings with unions and Telstra  employees. In Australia, we currently have four  enterprise agreements (EAs) covering all our  workforce, other than senior managers and lawyers.  Our EAs provide a range of industry-leading terms and  conditions, such as 15 days personal leave, a 36.75  hour working week, 16 weeks parental leave for all new  parents (including foster parents), flexible working  arrangements, gender affirmation leave and 20 days  paid leave for employees experiencing the effects of  family and domestic violence. If our employees are  impacted by job losses (redundancies), Telstra offers  up to 80 weeks’ pay.  In February 2024, Telstra commenced bargaining  in good faith with our unions and over 40 individual  bargaining representatives to replace our EAs. In July,  the majority of our people supported our proposed EA  offers by voting Yes to all four EAs. We have submitted  the EAs to the Fair Work Commission for consideration  and approval. After approval, our new EAs will maintain  our industry-leading terms and conditions and provide  certainty on pay, superannuation, allowances and  conditions for the next three years.   19 Doing business responsibly 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report  ===== PAGE 20 ===== Promoting health, safety   and wellbeing  We are committed to the health, safety and   wellbeing of our people, partners, customers and   the communities in which we operate. With our people  working in a range of different environments, from  enclosed spaces on network sites to retail stores and  contact centres, we are committed to enabling a safe  workplace through dedicated support to our teams.  Health, safety and wellbeing continues to be one of   our top managed company risks. We have no appetite  for behaviours or actions that lead to actual or  potential serious injury, illness, environmental harm,  loss of accreditation or reputational damage. Key health and safety   performance indicators We actively campaign on the importance of   reporting as a critical way to prevent harm and  to access support from our safety and health  management teams. The more our people report,   the better we are able to identify and understand   the risks in our business, providing us with the  opportunity to develop tailored support mechanisms  and effective mitigation measures. In FY24, we observed a strong reporting culture   across Telstra, including both work and non-work  related incidents and hazards. We thoroughly analyse  our data, both lead and lag indicators, to identify  emerging risks and enable development of targeted  interventions and initiatives. Total recordable  injuries remain comparable to FY23, whilst lost time  injuries have increased slightly.  We recognise that  our definition of lost time refers to any time lost  (regardless of whether medical treatment has been  received or whether there is a formal certificate of  capacity); this includes preventative mental health  days and rest time following sprains or strains.   In FY25, lost time will only refer to injuries where a  worker has received medical treatment or has been  deemed unfit by a medical professional. We are also committed to eliminating sexual  harassment and sex-based discrimination from   our workplaces. In FY24, we strengthened our existing  processes and put in place new initiatives to address  the Positive Duty under the Sex Discrimination Act  (Cth), including a multi-year plan to enhance our  controls and support mechanisms. There was an  increase in reported and substantiated cases of   sexual harassment in FY24 than in FY23, which   reflects increasing awareness of these issues in our  workplaces. We will continue to support all employees  affected by these behaviours and work to eliminate  them from our business. 10.

Reported number per million hours worked of all work-related injuries or diseases that result in one or more days of lost time (for Australian-based   Telstra employees). Protecting our field teams on the road Each year our operational field teams travel millions  of kilometres to help us stay connected. Driver and  vehicle safety is one of our critical risks at Telstra   and we are committed to the safety of our field teams.  Throughout FY24, we have implemented targeted  campaigns to address driver behaviours (including  fatigue management programs) and developed  extensive analytics (including vehicle telematics   to identify speeding and excessive breaking) to   enable us to monitor the safe driving practices of   field teams and target areas for improvement.

As we implement necessary organisational changes,  we are cognisant of the impact this can have on  our people who may also be feeling the effects of  socioeconomic factors. We continue to mature our  approach in identifying psychosocial risks, developing  and implementing appropriate control measures and  monitoring their effectiveness. Our risk mitigation  strategy considers each stage of the change life-cycle  (including planning, implementation and post change  support). We have implemented targeted initiatives to  strengthen mental health literacy among our people,  identify employees who are more vulnerable or at high  risk and implement supports for individuals and teams.  Pleasingly, our Employee Assistance Program (EAP)  utilisation rate by our people remains at 7.9 per cent,  significantly higher than the industry average of   6.1 per cent, indicating that our people are increasingly  more comfortable in proactively seeking support. Recovery following injury or   illness: equitable access to   support irrespective of cause Equitable access to prompt and timely treatment   and support is the foundation of Telstra’s early  intervention program for both work-related and  personal injury and illness.  With access to occupational rehabilitation, general  practitioners, psychology and physiotherapy services  as well as financial support for a range of diagnostics  and aides, our people can focus on their recovery while  they remain at (or return to) safe and sustainable  work. During FY24, Telstra’s return to work program  was recognised with two awards: the National Safety  Council of Australia (NSCA) Best Return to and  Recovery at Work System Award and a Comcare  National Work Health and Safety Award for Recovery  and Return to Work. Licences, accreditations   and compliance Telstra Limited, Telstra InfraCo, and Amplitel are  self-insured under the Safety Rehabilitation and  Compensation Act (Cth). The Telstra Group is  also accredited by the Office of the Federal Safety  Commissioner (OFSC) to work on federal government  building contracts. Our Telstra Health, Safety,  Wellbeing and Environment Management System is  applicable globally and is certified to international  standards ISO14001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018. We  continue to review and improve our management  system in response to current and emerging risks   and changing legislation.

Australian Digital Inclusion Index. As a leading telecommunications company, we are  working to create a better digital world by leveraging  our advanced network and technology capabilities to  connect people, businesses and communities. We work  hard to connect everyone and make sure they have the  skills and tools to get the most out of their tech and  stay safe online.  We do this by: •   connecting regional and remote communities  through network leadership and investment  •   building responsible tech skills to increase digital  inclusion safely and help close the digital divide  •  supporting customers in vulnerable circumstances,  including those experiencing financial stress,  domestic and family violence, natural disasters  and human conflict •  advancing online safety, privacy and security. Our approach is informed by data and insights from   the Australian Digital Inclusion Index (ADII).12 For more information, see our In focus:  Creating a better digital world paper  available on our reports page.  This year, we contributed   $112.3 million  through social and community  investment.

As the digital world continues to transform the  way we live and work, having access to reliable  telecommunications, through mobile networks,   fixed broadband or satellite services is critical.   We are constantly investing in technology   innovation to improve our network capabilities   and enhance the digital experience of our customers.  By enabling people and businesses to access the  connectivity they want and need, we are making it  easier for them to access information and services,  across more of Australia. For more information, see the Maintaining  our network leadership and planning for  the future section under ‘Strategy and  performance’ in our 2024 Annual Report  available on our reports page.  Network resilience   and reliability As society continues to expand its reliance on  connectivity to cater to the evolving nature of   work and education, the demand for resilient   networks and technology has never been more  pronounced. Given so many customers and  stakeholders depend on the quality of our   network, we recognise the significant impacts   that flow from network congestion, outages and  natural disasters. For more information, see the Networks  and technology resilience section under  ‘Material Risks’ in our 2024 Annual Report  available on our reports page.  In preparation for our 3G network closure, we have been  upgrading areas that have 3G-only coverage to ensure  they have equivalent 4G coverage available before the  network closes.13 As customers have increasingly moved  from 3G to take up the benefits of newer technology,  we have seen a significant decline in 3G usage across  our national network. 3G accounts for less than one per  cent of our total mobile network traffic, highlighting  why now is a good time to repurpose its spectrum to  bolster our 4G and 5G networks.  For details on how we’ve engaged with  customers to prepare for the 3G network  closure, see the Providing ongoing support  to customers migrating to 4G section of  this report. For more information on our 3G network  closure, visit our website.  Disaster preparedness   and response  We work year-round, preparing for and responding to  emergency and disaster threats. In FY24, our priorities  continued to be ensuring the safety of our people,  protecting and maintaining our infrastructure, keeping  our customers connected and providing short and   long-term assistance measures.  This year, we provided disaster support to customers  in 122 postcodes following severe weather events with  437,700 instances of support, with customers receiving  additional data. Pre-paid customers also received free  calls and text in addition to extra data. In response to  international events, we made free calls available to  Israel and Palestine territories and New Caledonia due  to unrest, and Afghanistan and Papua New Guinea due  to natural disasters.   ===== PAGE 25 ===== 25 Creating a better digital world 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report Mobile health and  communications  As we continue our rollout of 5G technology around  Australia, we're committed to sharing information   on our real-world tests of 5G Electromagnetic Energy  (EME) levels and demonstrating compliance with   the EME safety standards. This year, we focused   on working with local communities, providing safety  reassurance by demonstrating live EME testing   where small cells have been installed to improve  mobile reception.  We also continue to contribute to the development  of international EME testing standards and global  EME testing programs for 5G. This year we were  appointed as Chair of the Global System for Mobile  Communications Association (GSMA) Electromagnetic  Fields (EMF) group. Each year we also support the  Australian Government mobile network deployment and  EME compliance priorities which in FY24 included the  assessment of 5G millimetre wave (mmWave) exposure.  For more consumer information on wireless  connectivity and EME, watch this Australian  Government video featuring Telstra.    Regional and   remote engagement  We have maintained our focus on connecting with  regional and remote communities across the country.   This year, key priority areas for our engagements  included our 3G network closure, Universal Service  Obligation (USO) modernisation, the emergence of new  technologies, including our new Telstra Satellite Home  Internet and the resilience and performance of regional  networks. We participated in two roundtables hosted  by the Regional Tech Hub to discuss connectivity  literacy and how connectivity awareness amongst  people in regional areas can be improved. We also had  a presence at key regional events across the country  including Beef Australia (QLD), Farmworld (VIC),  Agfest (TAS) and Henty (NSW). In addition, our CEO met with stakeholders and  customers in the Adelaide Hills (SA), the Newcastle/ Hunter region (NSW) and the Gippsland region (VIC).  Other members of our Executive Leadership Team also  travelled to and met with stakeholders and customers  as part of our commitment to connect with regional  communities in locations including Aurukun (QLD), Wagga  Wagga (NSW), Wheatbelt (WA) and King Island (TAS). In the second half of FY24, we attended all  regional community forums held by the 2024  Regional Telecommunications Independent Review  Committee to listen and respond to questions from  the communities. This work will flow into FY25  as the community engagement continues, with  the Committee due to report to the Minister for  Communications by 31 December 2024.  This year we announced Round Two  recipients of the Telstra Connected  Communities grant program. To see the  recipients, visit Telstra Exchange. Providing ongoing support to  customers migrating to 4G  Being one of our top priorities for regional  and remote engagement, this year there were  more than 1,000 community and stakeholder  engagement activities and regional and remote  events at which the 3G network closure was  discussed. We’ve listened to our customers’  needs and have provided support by:  •  creating a simple SMS tool to help  customers identify if their device is  impacted  •   activating a Recorded Voice Announcement  (RVA) on outgoing calls for customers who  have impacted devices to ensure that they  are aware their device may not operate  correctly after the closure  •   proactively sending 12,000 complimentary  devices to customers experiencing  vulnerable circumstances. For more information on our 3G network  closure, visit our website.    ===== PAGE 26 ===== 26 Creating a better digital world 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report Technology innovation We continue to invest and incubate with strategic  partners and start-ups that are aligned to Telstra’s  NextGen growth focus areas. Telstra muru-D Labs  continued to explore and validate cutting-edge  products and technologies including 5G slicing,  artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT),  virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR), Fibre   Optic Sensing (FOS) and energy harvesting. muru-D Labs launched several significant   Australian leading developments, including   the Telstra Application Testing Environment.   This comprises a fully automated software and   radio environment that empowers third-party  technology companies to rapidly test and validate   their software or applications in various simulated   radio environments. Customers and technology  partners can bring their mobile applications and test  them under congested cellular network conditions,  receiving reports with quantitative metrics around  quality of experience for their prospective end users. Additionally, we developed a new transport insights  capability that leverages Distributed Fibre Sensing  (DFOS). Working with Melbourne University and Ava  Risk group, as well as our Networks and Fibre asset  groups, we were able to turn existing optical fibre  runs into continuous passive acoustic sensors. Given  Telstra's extensive 8 million kilometre fibre footprint,  primarily under footpaths adjacent to roads, we  implemented AI and ML (Machine Learning) on this  sensor data to provide: vehicle counting, anonymised  speed detection, vehicle classification and generation  of traffic composition statistics. This ‘infrastructure- less’ offering makes use of fibre already in the  ground, out of sight and out of mind, with the sensing  technology residing in exchange buildings where the  fibre terminates. This makes DFOS ideal for locations  where it is not feasible to install new infrastructure. Our engagement with the startup ecosystem this   year led to innovative projects and follow-on  investments, exemplifying our commitment to  growth and technological advancement. Notable  collaborations include capability developed with  Flaim Solutions, which utilised Telstra’s 5G and edge  computing to enhance their VR firefighting training,  allowing remote instruction and interactive classes.  The muru-D investment portfolio continued to grow,  with ownership in rapidly scaling start-ups across  industries such as Agritech, Insuretech and Supply  Chain. Highlights include investments through active  trials and Commonwealth grant participation with   Zetifi and Farmbot. With our Telstra Data Hub, we continued our trial   with Charles Sturt University (CSU) and Food Agility  CRC to develop the Smart Data Ecosystem. This  ecosystem leverages Telstra's connectivity and IoT  capabilities, combined with the research expertise   of CSU and the industry insights of Food Agility CRC,  to enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability.  The ecosystem was a finalist at the 2024 Australian   IoT Impact Awards.   ===== PAGE 27 ===== 27 Creating a better digital world 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report Building responsible tech skills  Our commitment to building responsible tech skills  is underpinned by our long-term partnerships with  governments and non-profit organisations. Through  collaboration, we deliver digital literacy programs with  our community partners to help people of all ages and  backgrounds develop the skills and knowledge they  need to use technology safely and responsibly. Collectively, our digital literacy  programs supported more than  168,000 Australians to build digital  skills in FY24; and 423,000 over  the past three years, putting us  on track to meet our T25 target  to build digital skills for 500,000  Australians by FY25. For more information on our approach   to digital inclusion, see our In focus:  Creating a better digital world paper  available on our reports page.  Digital Sisters  This year, we joined forces with Microsoft and  Good Things Foundation for the Digital Sisters  Building AI Literacy Program. The program aims  to empower women, especially those from  migrant and refugee backgrounds, to harness  the potential of cutting-edge technology  for personal and professional growth. By  collaborating with AI experts, community  organisations, government and media, this  partnership will result in AI literacy programs  that are replicable at scale, ensuring that  individuals in vulnerable situations can access  invaluable digital resources and support. Justice Connect  We've collaborated with Justice Connect to  enhance digital inclusion and legal resilience   for those affected by disasters and crises.   This year, we co-launched Get ePrepared, a  free online self-help tool offering step-by-step  guidance on securely storing electronic copies  of essential documents. This way, no matter  their situation, people can prove who they are,  where they live and what they own. Since its  launch, Get ePrepared has already empowered  over 9,600 active users to safeguard their  important information.     ===== PAGE 28 ===== 28 Creating a better digital world 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report Remote First Nations  communities  In FY24, the Community Services Program   (CSP), a telecommunications literacy initiative,   was delivered in 20 remote communities across   the Northern Territory, South Australia and Western  Australia, engaging with over 3,250 First Nations  customers. The CSP is being delivered in the same  locations between June 2024–November 2024. 14.  Australian Digital Inclusion Index data dashboards. Older Australians    Adults aged over 65 are the least digitally included  age group in Australia14. We continue to support older  Australians through our digital literacy programs,  giving older people, particularly those in regional areas,  the opportunity to develop the skills and confidence  to safely embrace digital technology. This year, we  provided 10,958 digital literacy training places for older  Australians through the Tech Savvy Seniors program,  delivered in partnership with NSW Government and  State Library of NSW. In addition, we provide a range   of concession offers for eligible older Australians. Life opens up when seniors learn  new digital skills  Today’s seniors need essential digital skills for   so many different aspects of everyday life  including being able to buy chicken feed online!

Mapping the Digital Gap Mapping the Digital Gap is a four-year research  project conducted by the Australian Research  Council Centre of Excellence for Automated  Decision-Making and Society in partnership  with Telstra. Data in the Australian Digital  Inclusion Index, currently in its ninth year,  now includes data from the first report of the  Mapping the Digital Gap project.  Research from the two projects has come  together to give the public and decision   makers our most comprehensive picture yet   of the digital inclusion challenge faced by   First Nations people in remote communities.  Telstra is funding a further four-year term,  which includes three visits each to 8-10 remote  and very remote First Nations communities  between 2025 and 2028.

Includes some programs that have a related legislative requirement. 16. Includes Access for Everyone package programs. We believe that everyone deserves access to the  digital world, regardless of their location, circumstance  or socio-economic status. We keep communities  connected by providing them with affordable and  accessible connectivity options and ensuring we always  support our customers in a way that meets their needs.15 16 This year, we helped more than   1.4 million customers   in vulnerable circumstances   stay connected.  For more information on the programs and  services15,16 included in FY24, see our 2024  Data Pack available on our reports page.  Customers needing   extra care We are committed to helping those facing cost-of- living pressure and experiencing vulnerability by  continuing to offer a range of products, services   and programs to improve digital inclusion outcomes   for our customers and communities.  Our Access for Everyone package includes:  •  concession offers for those on a low income •   a range of payment assistance options for   those experiencing financial hardship, including  access to safe and secure communications for  victims of domestic and family violence •   expanding the pre-paid Top Up program to   offer up to six-months of free pre-paid credit •   free Telstra mobile calls to crisis lines and  unmetered mobile data access to Ask Izzy, a  mobile website that connects people in crisis   with the support services they need  •   free calls to standard national numbers from   all Telstra public payphones and free Wi-Fi   access available at designated payphones  •   ability to pay bills via Centrepay for those in  receipt of welfare payments.  Our dedicated contact centre teams provide specialised  support and assistance to customers in vulnerable  circumstances, including those recently bereaved,  experiencing domestic and family violence or life- threatening medical conditions.  We also provide multilingual services over the phone  and in select stores to customers whose first language  is not English. Deaf and hearing-impaired customers  can contact Telstra through the National Relay Service. Additional support for   First Nations customers  In October 2023, we launched two new micro call  centres in Queensland to support First Nations  customers. Located in Jumbun and on Palm Island   the community-owned and run call centres provide  jobs and training for community residents and bolster  the customer support we provide from our established  First Nations Connect hotline in Darwin via an agency  agreement. The hotline and new micro-call centres are  staffed by First Nations customer care team members  who provide a culturally appropriate service for First  Nations customers. Calls to the hotline are now  whitelisted for Telstra pre-paid customers, meaning  calls from pre-paid accounts can be made free of  charge even if the account is out of credit.  In May 2024, we received approval from the Australian  Communications and Media Authority to trial a First  Nations Identity Referral form that we are currently  piloting in six stores across Western Australia and  the Northern Territory for customers who are new  to Telstra. Similar to referee statements offered by  Services Australia and the banking sector, this form  can be used when First Nations customers don’t have  the required form of ID to activate a pre-paid service  in their name. The trial concluded in August 2024, we  are currently reviewing the process to evaluate future  implementation and identify areas for improvement. For more information on how we support  customers, see the Chief Customer  Advocate Report on Customer  Vulnerability available on our website. For details on how we're handling past  product mis-sales to First Nations  customers, see the Responsible selling  section of this report.

Our Accessibility and Inclusion Action   Plan (AIAP) FY23-FY25 presents actions we are   taking as a business to encourage, recognise and  promote an active commitment to eliminating   disability discrimination.  Seven of our eight AIAP actions for FY24 have   been completed, with our in-store accessible   marketing strategy action still in progress. We   remain committed to ensuring retail signage and  wayfinding are accessible in stores and have   developed an accessibility template for existing   retail store design. The rollout of compliance   audits in existing stores has commenced with  accessibility top of mind for new store design.   This work will also continue into FY25.  This year, we partnered with gradWISE to recruit  talented candidates with disability into graduate   roles. We also completed an integration pilot with   a disability-focused recruitment platform for all   other career roles. We will continue to engage   with disability recruitment agencies on scaling   our recruitment solutions. Although we have delivered several key initiatives   this year, we don’t always get it right. In FY24, we  received 12 complaints of disability discrimination   from the Australian Human Rights Commission.  Of these complaints, 11 have been closed and one  is in progress. Complaints that have uncovered  any systemic issues are escalated and are used for  continuous improvements to our customer service. We continue to maintain our commitment to the  Disability Enquiry Hotline, Directory Assistance  Helpline and Disability Equipment Program.   How we’re connecting Australia's  hard-of-hearing community The Konnekt Captioning Videophone began   as a communications solution for the deaf   and hard-of-hearing. After two years of piloting,   it’s delivering communications that are  accessible to anyone with arthritis, poor   vision or cognition challenges. Visit Telstra Exchange to read more.  Safety The tech safety of customers is not just a responsibility  but an important aspect of how we do business. This  year, we launched a digital hub to support parents,  families, children and others stay safe online. Our  Online Safety and Wellbeing Hub provides resources  to help protect users from cyber bullying, harmful  online content and provides guidance on how to stay  safe online. It also provides information on how users  can report harmful online content and behaviour to  the eSafety Commissioner. The hub is aligned with  the requirements of the Online Safety Act 2021 that  focuses on protecting Australians from online harm.  For women experiencing domestic and family violence  (DFV), our dedicated SAFE team is specially trained  to help victim-survivors stay safely connected to their  Telstra services. We also provide replacement devices  to those experiencing DFV. Delivered in partnership  with WESNET, the Safe Connections program has  distributed more than 40,000 smart phones with   pre-paid credit since its inception in 2014, including  more than 6,500 in FY24. For more information about how we   support customers experiencing DFV,   visit Telstra Exchange.   ===== PAGE 31 ===== 31 Creating a better digital world 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report Advancing online safety,   privacy and security As more of our lives move online, online safety and  cyber security is becoming increasingly important. We  take our role as custodian of customer data seriously  and invest heavily in cyber security measures to help  protect our customers’ data and privacy. We also  invest in cyber security training for our employees and  educational resources for our customers to help them  understand the risks associated with using technology  and how to better protect themselves and their data.  Privacy  We are committed to being transparent with our  customers about how we collect, use and manage their  personal information. We take a global approach to  privacy management and apply the Australian Privacy  Act, the European Union General Data Protection  Regulation and local legislation where applicable.  We manage privacy and data access through our  Code of Conduct, Privacy Statements and other  relevant policies and security controls. These set strict  standards relating to privacy and confidentiality and  protect customer data from interference, misuse and  unauthorised access.   We may use or disclose personal information in  accordance with our Privacy Statements, consumer  expectations and the Privacy Act. We may also be  required by law to share personal information in certain  situations, such as to provide assistance to emergency  services organisations in life-threatening and time- critical situations or to assist government agencies   for law enforcement related activities. We acknowledge the role our products and services  can play in enabling the free exchange of opinions  and ideas and access to information. Our commitment  to privacy guides and supports our respect for the  right to freedom of expression and how we respond  to requests by government agencies for data we hold.  In these circumstances we take into account the  legality of the request, balancing the request against  peoples’ privacy and criteria such as reasonableness,  proportionality and necessity. We undertake regular  reviews of our Privacy Statements to ensure they  remain fit-for-purpose and consider customer privacy  and data protection in the design and development of  our organisational processes, products and initiatives.   We aim to ensure that privacy-related risks are  considered and assessed from the outset of every  concept, project, product, service, program or IT  system enhancement or development by completing  Privacy Impact Assessments.  In line with Telstra’s Compliance Framework, the Board,  Audit and Risk Committee, our CEO and Executive  Leadership Team is committed to meeting all our legal  and regulatory obligations. They are accountable for  ensuring everyone at Telstra understands and complies  with these requirements within the jurisdictions where  Telstra conducts business. Accountable Executives  within our business units are also responsible for  specific privacy compliance requirements related to  functions they perform.  This year, we had five privacy incidents requiring  notification to the Office of the Australian Information  Commissioner. In all cases, we directly contacted  the impacted customers to discuss any concerns and  offered solutions appropriate to their situation, such as  updating customer accounts, covering costs of credit  enquiry monitoring services (for customers whose  identity or credit history may be at risk) or referral to  third-party identity and cyber support services.   We also took action to manage or remediate the  incidents, which included reviewing policies and  procedures, implementing additional controls and  providing additional training and guidance to staff  members to ensure processes are correctly followed.   ===== PAGE 32 ===== 32 Creating a better digital world 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report Cyber security Over the past year, we have significantly bolstered   our cyber security capabilities to address the  increasingly sophisticated threat landscape.   While comprehensive preparations and robust  defense mechanisms are essential, it is important  to recognise that not every potential threat can be  entirely mitigated. Our efforts encompass advanced  measures to effectively identify and detect potential  threats, implement robust protection strategies and  swiftly respond to incidents. We have also enhanced  our recovery protocols to help ensure rapid restoration  of normal operations following any security breaches.  These improvements enable us to manage a diverse  array of cyber security threats and vulnerabilities more  efficiently, ensuring the integrity and resilience of our  systems against both known and emerging risks.  Our approach  Policy and governance: Our approach to   safeguarding Telstra from cyber threats is driven   by our Cyber Security Strategy and supported by   Group Policies. Oversight is provided by our Chief  Information Security Officer, with regular reports  presented to Telstra’s Audit and Risk Committee. Risk management, supply chain and third-party   risk: We adhere to rigorous standards, including   the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard  (PCI DSS) and the US National Institute of Standards  and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST   CSF), to guide our risk management practices.   Our commitment to compliance extends to relevant  cyber security regulations and standards, such as  ISO 27001, the Australian Privacy Principles and  the Essential Eight mitigation strategies developed  by the Australian Cyber Security Centre. Our cyber  security framework includes extensive cyber assurance  activities, such as third-party assessments, to fortify  information security within our supply network. Threat intelligence: We have a mature threat  intelligence capability and actively engage in threat  intelligence sharing to build a holistic view of the  landscape in which we operate. We continue to invest  in our Cleaner Pipes Initiative to help protect our  network and our customers from scams and fraud.  On average in FY24, we  successfully blocked more than    10 million scam calls   and 14 million SMS   messages every month. Building a security culture: We invest in employee  training and awareness programs to help our  employees understand their role in protecting Telstra,  our network and our customers. Our innovative   Cyber Security Influence program builds our security  culture and behaviours in the organisation and includes  security news, advisories, videos and gamified   learning. Our program also has a large, highly   engaged employee community for security enthusiasts  and we conduct regular simulated phishing campaigns  to test and improve employee awareness. Monitoring and incident response: Our state-of- the-art Security Operations Centre (SOC) provides  continuous 24/7 monitoring and incident response.  Staffed by highly-skilled security professionals,  the SOC uses advanced tools like SIEM (Security  Information and Event Management), EDR (Endpoint  Detection and Response) and NTA (Network Traffic  Analysis) solutions. We maintain a comprehensive  incident response plan detailing procedures for  incident reporting, containment, analysis, remediation  and mitigation. This plan is regularly tested and  updated to ensure its effectiveness in countering  emerging threats. Industry collaboration: Telstra collaborates with a  number of organisations globally to strengthen our  cyber security capability and share our expertise with  others. The collaboration between Commonwealth  Bank of Australia (CBA) and Quantium-Telstra (QT)  to develop scam and fraud prevention products, such  as Scam Indicator, continues to deliver results. The  initiative leverages data science to detect phone  scams in real-time, significantly improving fraud  prevention and enhancing protection for consumers.  Since inception, Scam Indicator has detected and  prevented millions of dollars in scams. In late FY24,  Scam Indicator was also extended to include landlines  and Boost Mobile, helping to protect more Australians  from scams.    ===== PAGE 33 ===== 33 Creating a better digital world 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report Ethical AI and data Telstra’s vision is to be a data-driven and AI-fuelled  organisation and a leader in responsible AI adoption,  helping unlock better outcomes for our people,  our customers and society. From helping protect  Australians from scams to improving customer  experience, we believe the use of data with AI has the  ability to significantly enhance how we operate but  ethics must be at the centre.  Telstra has a Responsible AI Policy which outlines   a set of principles, practices and accountabilities,  standards and expectations intended to govern the  development, deployment and use of AI systems,  which is closely aligned to the Artificial Intelligence   (AI) Ethics Framework. We also operate robust  governance policies and guardrails internally, including  our Risk Council for AI and Data (RCAID) that provides  a single dedicated body to provide advice and approval.  RCAID is a cross-functional body with experts from  across Telstra’s business, including our legal, data,  cyber security, privacy, risk and communications teams.   Any AI systems (including third-party systems) must  be reviewed and approved by RCAID. This year, we refined our operational procedures to  embed the implementation of our Responsible AI  Policy more deeply. This included:     •  ensuring our RCAID governance process covered  all Telstra entities •   upgrading our AI Model Register, which records all  Telstra AI use cases, to enhance the accountability  model so that it remains current during this period  of rapid change and development •   conducted a future state risk assessment to   inform future continuous improvement and  automated AI assurance •   defining and improving guidelines for the use of  generative AI within Telstra.    Joining UNESCO’s Business  Council to promote ethical AI Telstra is the first Australian organisation, and  the sixth globally, to join the United Nations  Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization  (UNESCO)’s Business Council to promote  the implementation of its Recommendation  on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence. The  Recommendation advocates for AI technologies  to be governed by values that promote  human rights, dignity and environmental  sustainability, with an emphasis on transparency,  accountability and adherence to the rule of law.  We will work with UNESCO and other member  organisations, to support policy development  in critical areas such as data governance and  diversity. The Business Council will also work   to develop an ethical impact assessment tool,   as well as joint initiatives to ensure AI serves   the public good.    ===== PAGE 34 ===== 34 Creating a better digital world 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report Telstra Foundation Creating a better digital world   for children and young people   For over two decades, Telstra Foundation has supported  children and young people to thrive in the digital  world. We want children and young people to be more  included, empowered and connected, to feel heard and  have a say in the kind of digital world they want.    In FY24, we committed $5.5 million through the  Foundation and $0.8 million from Telstra shareholder  and customer donations. This funding supported  impactful community programs and partnerships for  underserved or vulnerable children and young people,  ensuring they were:     •  Included: We believe in the power of technology   to open doors for young people. However, access  to opportunity is not equally distributed. To  address this, we focus on programs to help ensure  all children and young people have the skills to  create and succeed in the digital world. In FY24,  six projects received funding with a focus on First  Nations young people, regional students, girls   and AI, migrant and refugee young people.  •  Empowered: We believe all young people should  enjoy the benefits of being connected, whether  they're playing, learning or just living life. In a  society that is digital by default, we want children  and young people to have healthy lives online  and support programs that help them navigate  their digital experiences confidently, smartly and  safely. In FY24, three partner projects were funded  to improve youth digital safety and wellbeing  for early learning centres, regional students and  children and young people across Australia.  •   Connected: We want all children and young people  to be connected to essential digital services when  and where they need them. Through our support  of five partnerships in FY24: digital youth mental  health and wellbeing resources (including for  LGBTQI+ young people); innovative and accessible  communication devices for young people with  profound disability; and device lending/donations  programs for young people experiencing digital  exclusion (including First Nations communities   in remote Australia).  This year the Telstra Foundation approved a new  philanthropic mission to support one million children  and young people by 2030; follow our progress here.   To inform this goal, we have started work on our first  Digital Youth Index project which will connect with over  4,000 young people annually to learn more about and  report on their experiences with technology. Our newly  appointed Youth Advisory Council has also shared their  experiences and perspectives to shape this work.    Enabling young people to have   a say in shaping the digital world In FY24, Telstra Foundation launched its  inaugural Youth Advisory Council (YAC).   The purpose of the Council is to elevate youth  voices across all aspects of the Foundation’s  work. Council members have provided crucial  feedback on our projects, bringing a deeper  understanding of how young people experience  digital technology and its impact on their lives.   The Council, formed via a public Expression of  Interest in partnership with youth engagement  experts PROJECT ROCKIT, includes 19  representatives aged from 12 to 20 from across  Australia and brings a wide range of experiences  and perspectives to the Foundation’s work.

Digicel Pacific has been excluded from Telstra’s emissions reporting and targets in FY24 as we have not  yet been able to compile data that aligns to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol and meets assurance standards. A multi-year program of education, capability  and capacity building is in progress to uplift data quality and associated data management systems. In the interim, Telstra has reported Digicel Pacific emission  estimates for FY24 and FY19 within our 2024 Data Pack.  18. In June 2024 we increased our scope 1+2 emissions reduction target from ‘reduce our absolute emissions by at least 50% by 2030’ from an FY19 baseline. 19.  This is ahead of the trajectory required to reach our target of 50 per cent by 2030, however there is still some risk relating to our scope 3 target – see the Managing  our scope 3 emissions section of this report. In addition, in FY24, improved and more granular investment data allowed us to identify that one entity’s emissions  were duplicated in our scope 3 emissions reporting. As a result, category 15 and total scope 3 emissions differ from those reported in previous years. 20.  From 1 July 2024 Telstra Group will no longer be offsetting the emissions from our operations through the use of carbon credits. We will continue to offset  emissions associated with mobile phone plans and mobile broadband plans until 31 August 2024.  21.  We are committed to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, through the Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign. We are in the process of  validating our science-based net-zero target to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Corporate Net-Zero Standard. 22.  The Digicel Pacific acquisition completed in FY23. Digicel Pacific has been excluded from Telstra’s circular economy reporting in FY24 as we are still working to  compile timely and suitable data.

We are committed to achieving net-zero emissions  by 2050, through the Business Ambition for 1.5°C  campaign. Towards this, we have set near-term  emissions reduction targets aligned to a trajectory   to limit global warming to 1.5°C. Our near-term  climate-related targets are to:  •  reduce our absolute scope 1+2 emissions by at least 70 per cent by 2030 (from a FY19 baseline) •  reduce our absolute scope 3 emissions by at least 50 per cent by 2030 (from a FY19 baseline) • enable renewable energy generation equivalent to 100 per cent of our consumption by 2025. In June 2024, we announced a significant change to our  climate ambition, increasing our scope 1+2 emissions  reduction target from 50 per cent to 70 per cent by  2030 (from a FY19 baseline) and ceasing offsetting our  residual emissions through the use of carbon credits. In 2024, we joined the Australian Climate Leaders  Coalition (CLC), a cross-sectoral group of Australian  CEOs supporting the Paris Agreement commitments  and the road to decarbonisation. In 2024, we  participated in two working groups: Credible Transition  to Net-Zero and Integrating Nature into Business  Strategy. This work will assist us to continue to develop  our Climate Transition Action Plan and our nature  commitments. In 2023, our work to develop clear and  transparent process for green claims was featured in  the CLC’s Credible Transition to Net-Zero guide.23   Decarbonise Telstra In FY24, we achieved a 10 per cent reduction in our  scope 1+2 GHG emissions compared to the previous  year, a cumulative 37 per cent reduction against our  baseline year of FY19.  We achieved this primarily by decommissioning   legacy technology, improving the energy efficiency   of our network and our infrastructure and leveraging  the reduced emissions intensity of the electricity grid  as the use of renewable energy increases.

This network includes over  250,000 kilometres of existing fi bre and 14,000  kilometres of new fi bre optic cable. We worked  with Prysmian Group’s research and design  team to develop a high-spec fi bre optic cable  that is smaller in diameter. Using a smaller and  lighter cable (214 kilograms per kilometre lighter  than its predecessor) will result in 10,000 tonnes  less plastic over the course of the project once  complete. This also means that more cable  can be fi tted onto the delivery drums, resulting  in less trucks on the road, reduced storage  requirements and less waste.  We have also made changes to the deployment  of the fi bre cable using a dual plough method  that delivers effi  ciencies in fuel for installation,  minimising earth disturbance and impact to  fl ora and fauna across the route. In recognition of this work, we were chosen as  a fi nalist for the Net-Zero Action Award in the  35th National Banksia Sustainability Awards.  We also received the CommsDay Edison Award  Best Sustainability Initiative for our emissions  reduction program. 24.   The National Greenhouse Gas and Energy Reporting (NGER) determination is used for calculating Australian based scope 1+2 emissions, while the  GHG Protocol is used for calculating international based scope 1+2 emissions. 25.

We will also be submitting certification materials  for FY24. Over the course of FY24 we changed the  language we use in relation to this certification from  being 'carbon neutral in our operations' to 'offsetting  the emissions from our operations'. This was to more  clearly describe and disclose our action in using  carbon credits to offset the residual emissions from  our operations after accounting for our emissions  reduction activities.  From FY25, we will no longer be offsetting the  emissions from our operations, our products and   for our brands like Belong. We continued to offset  emissions associated with Telstra and Belong mobile  phone plans and mobile broadband plans until the   end of August 2024. Until now, the use of carbon credits has formed one  part of our climate change strategy and they have  been used to counteract the emissions that remained  after achieving emissions reduction each year. In FY24,  we used carbon credits, mostly from Verified Carbon  Standard (VCS) certified renewable solar power  projects in India to offset our emissions. We certified  our carbon offsetting status via the Climate Active  program for our Telstra organisational certification   as well as product certifications for Telstra Energy,  Telstra Mobiles and Belong. From FY25, we will no longer be seeking Climate Active  certification or market our products and services as  carbon neutral or as having their emissions offset.  With our purchases of carbon credits, we’ve invested  in projects that have avoided or removed over eight  million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions.  Within Australia we have supported the development  of a carbon farm in regional New South Wales where we  trialled new and innovative technology applications like  drone seeding, weed management and drone mapping.  The carbon farm is expected to remove 150,000 tonnes  of carbon emissions from the atmosphere through the  planting of native trees which should also increase  biodiversity in the region.  We will continue to play a role in Australia’s transition  to a renewable energy-dominated electricity grid,  including by supporting investments in new solar  and wind farms worth more than $1.4 billion. These  investments now mean Telstra is contracted to enable  renewable energy equivalent to 100 per cent of its  forecast electricity consumption by 2025. We are  committed to continuing to evolve our sustainability  commitments to remain at the forefront of action  against climate change. Managing our electricity  consumption Electricity consumption from our network, data  centres, offices and other buildings accounts for  around 96 per cent of our total FY24 scope 1+2  emissions. We strive to reduce energy consumption  across every aspect of our business through considered  planning, equipment modernisation, monitoring and  energy optimisation.  Our network sites, including fixed network sites and  data centres, are our largest consumers of electricity.  Our investment in energy reduction projects including  both energy efficiency and decommissioning in FY24  was $23 million.  In FY24, our energy efficiency programs delivered   a collective annualised saving of 6,295 tCO2e and   8,082 MWh electricity. In addition to our energy  efficiency projects, we saved a further 54,659 tCO2e  and 73,694 MWh annualised through decommissioning  legacy network equipment and network energy  efficiency enhancements. For a detailed breakdown of our emissions  and energy consumption, see our 2024  Data Pack available on our reports page.    ===== PAGE 39 ===== 39 Sustaining our planet 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report Hydrogen fuel cells   and generators We have partnered with the Victorian Government’s  Renewable Hydrogen Commercialisation Pathways  Fund program to trial the use of hydrogen fuel cells  as backup power at five mobile sites in place of diesel  generators. The fuel cells use green hydrogen fuel  which is generated from renewable energy sources.  These renewable hydrogen systems will provide   72 hours of backup power – many times more than  current battery backup power at these sites. The  project aims to demonstrate the technical and  commercial viability of renewable hydrogen as   a zero-emissions fuel for generator backup power.  The project, completed in June 2024, deployed   a 10-kilowatt renewable hydrogen generator at five  sites across Victoria that suffered outages after   the 2021 storms – Coldstream, Kinglake, Christmas  Hills, Chum Creek and Neerim North. This facilitated  rapid changeover to allow continuous operation   of site load and mobile connectivity when mains   power outages occur.  Chilled water optimisation  We have continued to deliver significant energy   savings through the installation of demand flow   chilled water optimisation systems. In FY24, this  included one additional upgrade, which means we   now have six chilled water-cooling systems optimised  with demand flow technology. This project has reduced  the energy consumption of the chiller systems across  the sites by an average of 21 per cent. Telstra InfraCo  was presented an award for energy efficiency and  decarbonisation at the Siemens Beyond 1% Summit   for our implementation of the demand flow technology  to optimise the chilled water-cooling systems in six   of our largest fixed network sites.   Electric and hybrid vehicles Telstra has an overall fleet of almost 7,000 assets,  consisting of 3,000 operational vehicles, 800 trucks  and 3,000 staff salary-sacrifice vehicles. Telstra  fleet vehicles made up approximately three per cent  of our FY24 scope 1+2 emissions. Over the past 36  months, we have transitioned over 20 per cent of our  operational fleet to hybrid models to reduce our fleet  emissions. Driven by the Australian Government’s  Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) exemption on Electric Vehicles  (EVs), we have also seen the uptake of EVs in our salary  sacrifice fleet grow from 48 vehicles to almost 600  vehicles (20 per cent of our salary sacrifice fleet).  Telstra’s partnership with Green Fleet continued in  FY24 with all salary-sacrificed fleet vehicle deductions  including a contribution to Green Fleet. Telstra also  participated in a tree planting event at Green Fleet’s  site in the Strzelecki Ranges. We are currently running our first trial of ten  operational EVs with the Toyota BZ4x being selected  as the trial vehicle. This trial also includes installing EV  chargers in the homes of the technicians participating  in the trial. If successful, we anticipate a further  increase in EVs in our operational fleet in FY25.  In addition, we have expanded our charging footprint  over FY24 with EV chargers and seven EV pool cars now  available at four of our head office locations as well as  one hydrogen pool car in our Melbourne head office.  Our goal is to convert the bulk of our metro and some  regional operational vehicles to electric when fit-for- purpose commercial EV fleet market options increase  and charging facilities expand.  FY24 energy efficiency and decommissioning initiatives Initiative Description Annualised  energy savings  (MWh) Annualised  emissions savings  (tCO2e) HVAC  optimisation We conduct physical inspections of our network sites to identify faults affecting  power consumption and review equipment performance to identify optimisation  opportunities 900 732 Building services  energy efficiency  upgrades Our capital works program includes the installation of fresh air cooling systems,  high-efficiency air conditioners, improved cooling control strategies and building  management and electronically commutated fans 3,486 2,685 LED lighting We are currently undertaking a large multi-year program to remove over 100,000  old fluorescent lights across hundreds of our facilities and install new LED lights  with inbuilt motion sensors 3,696 2,878 Decommissioning  legacy network We are actively rationalising and decommissioning our legacy network  equipment, reducing both direct energy consumption from the equipment as  well as associated energy for cooling 62,218 46,474 Network  energy efficiency  enhancements We are driving energy-efficient technology enhancements with our strategic  partners. We modernised selected mobiles sites and several technology trials are  in progress, across the Mobiles, Transport and IP entities, trialling various sleep  modes, coherent pluggable optics and liquid-cooled technologies. 11,476 8,185 Total 81,776 60,954  ===== PAGE 40 ===== 40 Sustaining our planet 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report Managing our scope   3 emissions We have a responsibility to contribute to reducing  the emissions produced by our supply chain when  providing us with goods and services and by our  customers when using our products. We are committed  to reducing our scope 3 emissions by at least 50 per  cent by 2030 (from a FY19 baseline). We continued  to make significant progress in reducing scope 3  emissions during FY24. However, there is still some  risk to our 2030 scope 3 target, including from Digicel  Pacific, expansion of low earth orbit (LEO) satellite  services and other product growth. In addition, key  suppliers may not decarbonise as quickly as expected.   Working together to   reduce scope 3 emissions Scope 3 represents Telstra’s largest emissions source,  making up 66 per cent of our total footprint. Our scope  3 emissions have already decreased by 37 per cent  since FY19. Scope 3 emissions, particularly in the Information  Communication and Technology sector where there   are complex supply chains, is an area that requires  cross-sector collaboration. Of our total scope 3  emissions, approximately 76 per cent comes from   our supply chain (categories 1, 2 and 4). We are   working with suppliers to identify, prioritise and  execute emissions reduction opportunities and   drive improvements in environmental practices  throughout the global supply chain. This includes  providing training and support to suppliers on how   to reduce their emissions footprint, including our  climate commitments in commercial agreements   and considering emissions reduction opportunities   in the delivery of their goods and services to us.  This year we co-led a project jointly developed by  the GSM Association (GSMA) and the Technical  Standardization Bureau of the International  Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) to develop  and launch industry-specific scope 3 guidance  for telecommunication operators. This guidance  is intended to harmonise methods for telecom- munication operators to assess and report their  scope 3 emissions and to increase their coverage and  transparency. We also continue to work with other  telecommunications operators as part of the Joint  Audit Cooperation (JAC) to engage common suppliers   on their emissions reduction targets and plans.   This includes delivering training and performing   site audits by independent third-party auditors.  In FY24, we were recognised with a 2023 CDP A rating  for the second year in a row putting us in the top 1.6  per cent of respondents globally. We work closely with  CDP to uplift the disclosures of our suppliers. In FY24,  295 Telstra suppliers disclosed their CDP questionnaire  to Telstra. We were also recognised in the 2023 CDP  Supplier Engagement Leaderboard. Find out more here. In 2022, we launched our standard climate change  clauses and guidance for purchases. These clauses  require suppliers to understand, report, verify,   reduce and track their emission impacts in support   of our 2030 target. These clauses are now being  rolled out to our major suppliers through our sourcing  and contracting process. By the end of FY24, 91  suppliers had signed up to these new clauses which  contractually committed them to disclosing and  reducing their absolute emissions, an increase   of 122 per cent from FY23, representing over   $3 billion of our FY24 spend. Find out more here. Collaborating with Australia Post We partner with Australia Post to deliver   our products to our customers. This year   we worked with Australia Post to distinguish  emissions between air vs road freight. As a  result we now have a way forward to capture  emissions reductions when shifting to freight  transport with a lower emissions impact. In  FY24, this resulted in an emissions reduction  of approximately 1700 tCO2e or approximately  13 per cent of the services which Australia Post  provide to Telstra.   ===== PAGE 41 ===== 41 Sustaining our planet 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report Decarbonise the grid Telstra is focused on decarbonising the grid through  greater investment in renewable energy thereby  reducing reliance on non-renewable energy from   fossil fuels.  As one of Australia’s largest electricity users,   in 2020 we set a target to enable renewable  energy generation equivalent to 100 per cent of  our consumption by 2025. To meet this target, we  are supporting the development of new Australian  renewable generation capacity (such as solar parks   and wind farms) through long-term renewable energy  contracts (Power Purchase Agreements, or PPAs).   By the end of FY24, the operational output of   projects we support was equivalent to 27 per   cent of our consumption.  To date, we have supported investment in   renewable energy projects which are worth more   than $1.4 billion under long term PPAs. These  commitments have enabled the construction of  renewable energy projects across Queensland,   Victoria and New South Wales.  Telstra’s Power Purchase Agreements Site Location Telstra contracted  amount / Total output* Year  signed Murra Warra Wind Farm Victoria 96 MW / 226 MW 2017 Emerald Park Solar Farm Queensland 72 MW / 72 MW 2017 Crookwell III Wind Farm NSW 58 MW / 58 MW 2021 MacIntyre Wind Farm Queensland ~111 MW / 923 MW 2022 Munna Creek Solar Farm Queensland 60 MW / 120 MW 2023 Bundaberg Solar Farm Queensland 100 MW / 100 MW 2023 Glenellen Solar Farm NSW 130 MW / 260 MW 2023 *Telstra's contracted portions of the above sites vary from site to site as  indicated above. PPAs location map Telstra’s PPAs also provide protection against   volatile wholesale electricity prices and help us   to manage our costs. During FY24, we signed a PPA for a new solar farm in  Bundaberg, Queensland. That agreement is for 153  GWh per annum of renewable energy output to the  electricity grid. We also contracted our seventh PPA,  for the Glenellen Solar Farm in NSW, with expected  renewable energy generation of 210 GWh per year.   We have now contracted renewable energy generation  which, once fully up and running, should be equivalent  to more than 100 per cent of our forecast consumption  by the end of 2025.    Crookwell wind farm In June 2021, Telstra signed a PPA for a 58 MW  capacity wind farm near Crookwell in NSW.   The Crookwell III site is made up of 16 wind  turbines, each with a 126 metre (diameter)   rotor and a 3.6 MW generator. The project is  nearing completion and once operational will  contribute 14 per cent towards our commitment  to enable renewable energy generation  equivalent to our consumption by 2025. In FY24, the project was registered as a  renewable energy generator and connected to  Australia’s mainland electricity grid. Full output  from the wind farm into the national grid is  expected to be complete in Q1 FY25, providing  the equivalent of the electricity used by more  than 30,000 homes each year. However, there is risk that the overall amount of  renewable energy generated from our contracted  projects may not meet 100% of our forecast  consumption by the end of 2025. Utility-scale  renewable energy projects have long lead times to  become operational, with complexity in planning,  construction and grid connection. In addition,  operational output may be impacted by faults, market  and environmental conditions and electricity grid  constraints. We will continue working to mitigate the  risk to this target, including by further reducing our  own energy consumption.    For more information, see the ‘Acting on  climate and nature’ section in our 2024  Annual Report available on our reports page.     ===== PAGE 42 ===== 42 Sustaining our planet 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report Climate adaptation   and resilience As climate events become increasingly widespread,  frequent and intense, we continue to look for ways  to improve our power independence and maintain  connectivity for our customers when they need it most.   We continue to rollout our targeted program of  lifecycle battery replacements, uplifting backup   power capacity to enable sites to operate through  short-term mains power interruptions. In FY24,   we invested nearly $60 million across more than   3,200 battery lifecycle replacement projects, which   included power system replacements and rebuilds.   To further support communities across Australia,   we are investing $7.5 million in the upgrade of   1,000 payphones in disaster-prone areas by the end  of FY25, with 491 upgrades completed to the end  of FY24. Alongside free calls, the upgrades provide  USB charging for personal devices, free Wi-Fi and  have extended battery backup power to maintain  connectivity. This investment was partly funded by our  commitment to spend $75 million from the proceeds  of the part sale of Amplitel to further enhance regional  connectivity, guided by the recommendations of the  2021 Regional Telecommunications Independent  Review Committee (RTIRC) report. This year we have also made it easier for our   customers to stay connected in the event of a   disaster. We provided disaster support to customers   in 112 postcodes following severe weather events   with 437,700 customers receiving additional data.   Pre-paid customers also received free calls and   text in addition to extra data.   For more information on how we’re managing  climate risk, see the ‘Acting on climate and  nature’ section of our 2024 Annual Report  available on our reports page.  Ericsson partnership Telstra has worked with Ericsson to deploy   their latest energy-saving software features   and hardware to reduce the energy usage   across our networks. Telstra has recorded   energy savings of around 26 MWh per day  through the network-wide deployment of  RAN (Radio Access Network) software energy  features, whilst also avoiding negative impacts  on customer experience.  Through the site modernisation between   2019 and 2023, Telstra has been able to achieve  around 11 MWh per day energy savings. These  RAN hardware/software energy-saving initiatives  yield a combined total of around 37 MWh savings  per day – equivalent to powering over 2,000  typical Australian homes. The next phase of this  program is to introduce AI-based algorithmic  control of these features to optimise energy  savings and customer experience.   ===== PAGE 43 ===== 43 Sustaining our planet 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report Protecting nature and biodiversity 27. For more information, see the World Economic Forum article here. 28. Water withdrawal and consumption data is only available for Australia. 29. This metric does not include water consumption from sites where water is paid for by third-parties. At Telstra, we interact with nature every day – when   we construct or maintain our telecommunications  network, or when we provide technology solutions   to customers. We have infrastructure in every  ecosystem – from deserts to rainforests to   remote islands. We also depend on resources from  nature – such as the metals and minerals used to  manufacture technology and the wood used to   make cardboard for our product packaging. Nature underpins our global economy, with more than  half of the world’s economic output dependent on it27.  Nature gives us clean air, food, medicines, fibres and  resources to power and support our way of life. It also  helps to regulate the climate and protect us from its  impacts – like floods. Also important is the spiritual  connection that wild places, wildlife and natural  ecosystems provide. We believe it’s critical to protect our natural assets   – not just because we depend on them, but because   we want to protect these special places and  ecosystems for generations to come.  We are taking a whole-of-business approach to  addressing our impact and improving nature-related  outcomes in a climate changed world. In FY24, we  signed up as an early adopter of the Taskforce on  Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). We have  published our first TNFD disclosure in the ‘Acting on  climate and nature’ section of our 2024 Annual Report  available on our reports page. This framework has  guided a dedicated program to review and improve  the way we govern and manage nature-related risk,  consider nature as an integral element of our strategy  and engage with stakeholders to understand and  mature our management of nature dependencies  across the organisation. Protecting nature and biodiversity is a key pillar   of our sustainability strategy. In FY24, we began   a program to apply the TNFD’s Locate, Evaluate,  Assess and Prepare (LEAP) methodology. LEAP  provides a structured approach to identify key   nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks and  opportunities. Our LEAP assessment covers our  Australian operations. In FY24, we profiled our  interface with nature, captured the environmental  assets we are dependent upon and commenced the  evaluation of nature-related risks and opportunities. We believe that technology and innovation are   critical to improving the way natural ecosystems   are protected, conserved and revitalised. For example,  IoT devices can be used to provide in-time data on  water use, or the usage of waste bins, to help inform  better decision-making and reduce impact on the  environment. AI can also be used to review video  monitoring of animals – helping to inform research  or action to control pest species to protect natural  ecosystems. Through the Integrating Nature in Business Strategy  group of the Climate Leaders Coalition (CLC), we have  worked with peers to build knowledge and skills of  nature and the TNFD disclosure – including materiality,  community interface and risk. We are also part of the  GSMA Biodiversity Project Group. We track our water-related dependencies and impacts  using metrics including freshwater withdrawal.  Telstra’s direct use of water is limited. In FY24, we  withdrew 898 ML of water28. Future analysis of our  supply chain’s impact on nature and biodiversity will  likely reveal further reliance on water within that supply  chain, such as in the manufacture of semiconductors  and energy sourcing.

InfraCo As part of the initial planning to build our  intercity fibre network, we undertake ecological  studies to profile and identify management  actions to reduce the impacts of construction  on the environment. During the ecological study  of a remote area of Western Australia near  Balladonia, the team discovered an isolated  population of the Chequered Copper butterfly  – the first time this species has been recorded  in Western Australia. It is more than 1,700 km  west of the nearest known population in South  Australia. The discovery was reported in a paper  authored by Sujan M. Henkanaththegedara and  published in the Western Australian Naturalist  Journal in 2023. Ecological studies such as  this one provides us with vital information to  measure and remediate our impact and can also  deliver opportunities to better understand the  breadth of ecological diversity across Australia.   ===== PAGE 44 ===== 44 Sustaining our planet 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report Progressing a circular economy 30. Estimated number of electronic products stored in Australian homes sourced from MobileMuster. Telstra is committed to embedding circular economy  principles in how we design, develop, manage and  operate our networks – as well as the products we  put out to market. This year, we further developed our  eco-design standards, stepped up our environmental  ambition to reduce waste and recycle devices and  expanded our modem refurbishment program.  To take tangible action on circular economy we have  focused on both the resources we use and the waste  generated by our operations, as well as the waste we  generate from the manufacturing, distribution and  use of our products. By improving our use of natural  resources across our organisation, we can also help   our customers, suppliers, contractors and partners   do the same. In recognition of this leadership we were awarded  highly commended status in the category 'Best  stewardship outcomes – individual business or brand  (Large Company)' at the Product Stewardship Awards. In FY24, we started a program to embed sustainability  across our planning, procurement and product design  processes, including a focus on eco-design.  For more information on our work to   embed sustainable practices in  procurement, see the Sustainability   at Telstra section of this report.  Devices  Australians are storing an estimated 22 million30 phones  in their homes. We are helping our customers reduce  the number of unwanted devices in their homes and  businesses by making it easier for this technology to  be reused or recycled. Keeping valuable precious  metals and materials in circulation reduces reliance on  extracting virgin materials, thereby protecting nature.  In FY24, we increased our device target, to reuse or  recycle 650,000 mobile phones, modems and other  devices each financial year to FY25. Our previous target  was 500,000 devices a year. We met this increased  target in FY24, reusing or recycling 710,341 mobile  phones, modems and other devices.  We are designing solutions based on circular economy  principles for our products so we can keep materials   in circulation for as long as possible. We are working   to increase the lifespan of mobile devices and modems  through our repair, refurbish, reuse and trade-in  programs and responsibly recycling devices that have  reached the end of their useful life. We do this via the  Telstra eCycle program, which offers solutions for  electronic devices – recovering materials for recycling,  all while ensuring any data is securely wiped.  We have made it easier for our customers to recycle  their old devices by accepting more types of devices.  They can do this at any Telstra store or via our free  eParcel option if they can’t make it into one of   our stores.    ===== PAGE 45 ===== 45 Sustaining our planet 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report In December 2023, we joined MobileMuster in  celebrating 25 years of excellence in electronic  recycling. MobileMuster is a free, not-for-profit  recycling program that is voluntarily funded by the  Australian telecommunications industry. We are a  founding member of MobileMuster, delivering on   our commitment to enable an environmentally  sustainable industry, that provides a safe, trusted   and environmentally sound product stewardship  program in Australia. This work is all part of supporting a more circular  economy for the resources we consume – from the  phones, tablets and other electronic devices we put  out to market to the equipment we operate that our  customers rely on to access our network. We are continuing to increase the lifespan of mobile  devices by finding ways they can be reused, repurposed  and resold through several different programs. This  year, through the Telstra eCycle program, we launched  the Telstra trade-in program powered by Assurant. Our  consumer and enterprise customers can trade in their  pre-loved phones, tablets or smartwatches, turning  their old devices into credits towards the purchase of  a new device. Not only does this increase the useful  life of these devices but it gives them a second life at  affordable prices. This helps to keep these devices in  circulation for longer whilst reducing the need to use  the planet’s limited and precious natural resources. For more information about what   devices you can recycle and how visit   our website. Recovering equipment from  our enterprise customers Telstra Enterprise has implemented a circular   economy program to recover Telstra managed   CPE (Customer Premises Equipment) that has been  decommissioned at a customer site by our Field  Services team. These devices are then recovered,  assessed and either recycled or – if required –  refurbished prior to being made available for   reuse by a new Enterprise Managed Service   customer. In FY24, we recycled or reused 2,700   devices through this program. Partnership with social  enterprises In FY24, we continued our partnership with   social enterprise PonyUp for Good to reuse and  recycle devices. In September 2023, we recycled  more than four tonnes of technology from our  warehouse in Sydney, bringing the total diverted  from landfill under this partnership to more than  36 tonnes. PonyUp was able to reuse 100 per cent  of this equipment which resulted in a donation  of 37,500 fresh meals to SecondBite, also adding  2,216 devices to our device reuse and recycling  target. Telstra's on-going partnership with  PonyUp has now delivered 162,247 fresh meals   to people in need via SecondBite. Sustainable packaging In October 2022, we met our commitment for   100 per cent of Telstra branded packaging to be  made of renewable or recycled material and be  fully recyclable. We have continued to meet that  commitment on 100 per cent of Telstra branded  packaging for all new products released in FY24.  Since 2021, we have removed more than 200 tonnes  of packaging from Telstra modems and eliminated  1.7 million plastic bags from landfill by redesigning  our packaging. We have also undertaken work to  optimise our modem packaging, reducing the number  of components in the package by 50 per cent. This  includes reducing the weight by a further nine per   cent since FY23. We want to help and inform our customers to  responsibly reuse or recycle our packaging rather   than it ending up in landfill. Our packaging sustainability metrics are fully  integrated into all key operations and processes.  These include procurement, supplier engagement  and briefing, material assessments and collecting  packaging information from suppliers throughout the  design process. We assess all packaging components  and use information from assessments to optimise  packaging and design application as part of our  concept work across all product categories. We also  use the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation’s  (APCO) Packaging Recyclability Evaluation Portal  (PREP) Analysis Tool for all new and upcoming product  packaging which is a key tool for communicating the  recyclability of our packaging with customers. We continue to research, investigate and evaluate   new sustainable packaging technologies and innovative  materials. We have successfully redesigned packaging  that had components previously made from soft  plastics. These were replaced using recyclable fibre- based materials. We continue to work with suppliers  and manufacturers to drive innovation and   sustainable solutions.   ===== PAGE 46 ===== 46 Sustaining our planet 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report Telstra Safe Connections  packaging In FY24, we undertook a review of the  components of the Telstra Safe Connections  packaging. We worked with program partners  and found that the packages needed an  increased level of confidentiality for their  contents. We removed the print on the outer  carton, switched to paper-based seals, moved  to corrugated cardboard with a higher post- consumer recycled content and condensed the  package size by 33 per cent. The new design  is significantly condensed aligning with our  packaging requirements and optimised for  confidentiality and discretion for customers in  vulnerable circumstances. For more information  on the Telstra Safe Connections program, see  the Creating a better digital world section of   this report.    Improving network waste   and recycling One of our key targets is to increase network waste   we are diverting to a recycling facility to 90 per cent   by June 2025. In FY24, we diverted 95 per cent of our  network waste to a recycling facility.  This result has been achieved by developing a deeper  understanding of our waste streams and deploying  targeted initiatives to make available appropriate  disposal options to ensure our waste is channelled  through recycling pathways. Our FY24 network waste  data includes our copper recovery program31, battery  lifecycle replacement, active network equipment   and other operational waste.  As our recycling program matures and we are becoming  more sophisticated in understanding the end-to-end  impacts of recycling by-products, we are continuing  to refine our reporting to include additional scopes of  work and this work will continue into FY25.  31.   In FY24, we reassessed the definition supporting the target to 'Increase our network waste recycling rate to 90% by 2025' to include waste diverted to recyclers,  captured via our Copper Recovery Program. We have adjusted the historical figures to ensure the data is complete, accurate and comparable   from our FY19 baseline year onwards. This refinement provides greater transparency and consistency on the network waste we manage as an organisation   at our exchanges. Our focus remains on areas where we can effect   the greatest change for our people and stakeholders,  including reviewing our waste infrastructure and  building awareness and education within our teams,  external delivery partners and customers who use   our sites. To elevate our network waste recycling rate to   90 per cent by FY25, a steering committee comprising  senior cross-functional representatives was formed.  This group is dedicated to defining and implementing  a roadmap and prioritising initiatives aligned with the  principles of the waste hierarchy. To meet our network waste target, we are working  with industry partners and customers to recover  technology and other e-waste for reuse and  recycling. Acknowledging the substantial cultural  and behavioural shifts needed within our internal  and supplier workforces, we have partnered with  major suppliers to implement Telstra’s sustainability  objectives throughout the supply chain. In FY24,   we launched the Fixed Network Site Champion  initiative which involves appointing local field  technicians at key waste-producing sites. These  champions play a crucial role in overseeing waste  practices at the site level and providing direct  leadership in the field. We are also recovering e-waste as we upgrade our  network, identifying reuse opportunities for legacy  technology, working with suppliers to extend the life  of network technology and exploring opportunities to  recycle industry-specific equipment.  As we continue to investigate the waste lifecycle  beyond collection we continue to identify opportunities  for improvement. These challenges include a lack of  local recycling providers for key waste streams as   well as refining and adjusting reporting mechanisms.  We continuously audit our recycling processes and our  target of 90 per cent includes a heavy dependency on  battery, active network and copper recycling tonnage  to achieve this result. We will continue to work with  partners and finesse our processes to address these  new challenges.  FY24: 95% Network waste recycled Total network waste 24,977 tonnes: >   Total diverted to recyclers:      23,617 tonnes (95%) >   Total landfill:  1,361 tonnes (5%)  ===== PAGE 47 ===== 47 Sustaining our planet 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report Waste from network sites (tonnes)   and recycling (%)   Recycling SIM cards In FY24, we implemented a program to recycle  SIM cards. The components of the SIM cards   are broken down and recycled through our  partners. We recycled more than 2.5 million   SIM cards, including over 25 tonnes of paper   and over five tonnes of plastic. Recovering network  technology As technology advances and telecommunications  needs change at a rapid pace, the equipment we  need to operate our network also changes. We are  committed to identifying and recovering valuable  resources for reuse or recycling and, where we can,  recovering these materials back into our operations   for reuse. A dedicated program was launched with a focus  on recovering and recycling depowered legacy  infrastructure. The project’s initial focus was on  recycling printed circuit boards (PCB) within Fixed  Network Sites. Through this program, we determine  whether there is opportunity for repurposing these  PCBs in our business, reusing them in the secondary  market or recycling them. By refining the recovered  materials to key base metals we can reduce the metals  that need to be mined.  In FY24, the program has recycled 1,047 tonnes across  205 sites, and recovered 11,603 parts for internal spares  reuse (approximately 1.8 tonnes). An FY25 program  has been established to continue recycling and reusing  depowered PCBs, with additional opportunities being  explored to expand the program beyond PCBs. Furthermore, in FY24, we recovered over 9,000 spares  (more than 38 tonnes) to be reused internally in our  network through various initiatives32. In addition to this,  32.  Spares are classified as parts recovered to meet demand shortfall also providing financial savings through minimising purchase or repairs. 832 items (over four tonnes) were sold to be reused   by other telecommunications companies, with a further  79 tonnes of recovered items and surplus materials  that were no longer required recycled.  Additionally, four main areas were targeted to support  demand and/or to bolster inventory levels to reduce  fault restoration timelines and build network resilience: •   Transmission mining: A targeted recovery was  instigated from decommissioned parts from field  installations to increase safety stock levels and  fulfil vendor non-returns. Over 3,300 parts with   a weight of more than 2 tonnes were recovered. •   RIM cabinet mining: This program facilitates the  reuse of spare parts from legacy RIM (Remote  Integrated Multiplexer) cabinets. RIM spare parts  are mined in a manner that removes the need  for repairing, further reducing the environmental  impact associated to returning these items to a  repair vendor. Over 7,600 parts were recovered with  over 7.5 tonnes of material diverted from landfill. •   3G cabinet mining: This includes recovery of  parts for sparing, including parts which are cross  compatible with newer generations of equipment.  Over 3,400 parts were recovered resulting in more  than 27 tonnes of material being reused. •   Spares recovery: Parts recovered to meet demand  shortfall also provide financial savings through  minimising purchase or repairs. A total of 1,693  parts (almost 2 tonnes) have been recovered into  spares from this program. In alignment with our commitment to environmental  stewardship, we strategically partner with certified  recyclers who specialise in the safe handling and  disposal of hazardous substances found in network  equipment. This approach not only mitigates potential  environmental risks but also reinforces our dedication  to fostering a healthier ecosystem. Small changes can have   a big impact This year we included a reminder on our  customer bills to encourage customers to go  paperless. Over 60,000 customers switched  to paperless bills between November 2023  and June 2024. With an average of two sheets  of paper per bill, the initiative has saved  approximately 1 million sheets of paper a year,  the equivalent of 180 trees a year.  ===== PAGE 48 ===== 48 Sustaining our planet 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report Enabling the transition   for our customers 33.   In June 2024, Telstra Ventures rebranded to Titanium Ventures, reflecting Telstra’s strategic decision to explore selling its current investment in Telstra Ventures’  funds.  Digital technologies play a crucial role in helping  businesses to reduce their emissions and protect the  natural resources they rely on.  As Australia’s leading telecommunications provider,  we see a significant opportunity to help our customers  and society transition to a lower carbon future by  accelerating the adoption of innovative emissions- avoiding technologies. The Enabling Positive Climate Action Report by  Deloitte Access Economics analysed the impact of  Telstra’s products and services by looking at our  enablement potential. This quantifies the emissions  avoided by our customers using our products and  services when compared to our own emissions. The  report found that by 2030 we could help customers   to reduce or avoid emissions by almost seven times   the emissions we release. For more information, see the Enabling  Positive Climate Action Report available  on our reports page.  Supporting businesses   to lower emissions In FY24, Titanium Ventures (formerly Telstra  Ventures33) led a funding round for Pexapark,   a trusted provider of reference prices and   market intelligence for renewable energy.   Pexapark’s daily, market-representative prices for  PPAs are accessed by over 200 renewable energy  sellers and offtakers, as well as leading data providers,  consultancies, government and industry bodies.  Between September and December 2023, Pexapark  facilitated 2.1 GW of PPAs across Europe. These  agreements serve as financial hedging mechanisms,  enabling the financing and construction of renewable  energy assets. The supported technologies include  onshore and offshore wind, solar and co-located   assets with storage. In FY24, Titanium Ventures also led a funding round   in OpenSolar, a leading all-in-one solar design,  sales and management software, enabling solar  professionals to grow their businesses profitably  with class-leading tools, completely free-of-charge.  OpenSolar is currently used by over 23,000 solar  professionals in over 150 countries, and OpenSolar  estimates that the systems designed and sold to date  (May 2019-Feb 2024) with OpenSolar globally avoids  49Mt of CO2e emissions over their lifetimes. Titanium Ventures’ investments in Pexapark and  OpenSolar enable decarbonisation by supporting   the continued rollout of renewable energy. In FY24, we also developed a Telstra Emissions  Calculator to assist our Enterprise customers to  estimate emissions associated with the usage of  Telstra products. This tool is currently being piloted  with some of our Enterprise customers to test and  improve the calculator in use.   ===== PAGE 49 ===== 49 Sustaining our planet 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report Responsible space  In FY24, Telstra became the first reseller in the   world to offer consumers a home phone service with   a broadband service using Starlink consumer, voice   and data services. We also made the first voice call   on-air using the Eutelsat OneWeb’s LEO solution.   Both technologies utilise low earth orbit (LEO)  satellites and we anticipate considerable growth   in the use of LEO-based infrastructure and services  in future. By utilising LEO constellations for mobile  backhaul we can potentially extend our mobile network  to communities which are currently outside of our  terrestrial infrastructure footprint.  While LEO technology presents many opportunities,  we are also mindful of potential environmental and  broader sustainability impacts. In FY24, we undertook   a program of work to explore what ‘Responsible   Space’ means to Telstra and identify material  sustainability issues. We identified two priority areas for further review   and analysis: •   impacts to our scope 3 emissions reduction target •   light pollution impacting both First Nations  peoples’ cultural connection to sky and the  scientific community. As part of our reporting of scope 3 emissions we  calculate the emissions associated with the use of  our products. This includes estimating the lifetime  electricity consumption of the product in the  customer’s home. LEO satellite broadband requires  both a modem and satellite receiver. These satellite  receivers can be up to four times as energy intensive   as our Telstra Smart Modem 3. In addition, there are  emissions associated with the manufacture, logistics,  launch and ongoing operation of LEO satellites.  To calculate these emissions, we use industry  standard emissions factors. In FY24, we worked  with an independent subject matter expert to better  understand the emissions of our LEO satellite services.   For information on our scope 3 emissions  reduction target, see the ‘Acting on climate  and nature’ section in our 2024 Annual  Report and 2024 Data Pack available on  our reports page.  Many First Nations communities have a deep-  rooted connection to dark skies with the celestial  positioning and space between stars holding   spiritual, agricultural and navigational significance.  Scientific observation of the night sky is  also undertaken across the full range of the  electromagnetic spectrum, often using large   aperture arrays and long exposure times.  Due to their lower orbit, LEO satellites operate   in constellations of hundreds or thousands of units.  Increasing the number and density of objects orbiting  the Earth has the potential to impact terrestrial  observations of the night sky. In addition, the   frequency and bandwidth LEO satellites use to  transmit data has the potential to interfere with  scientific instruments like radio telescopes.  We will work to better understand and advocate   for positive outcomes and promote sustainable and  responsible growth in this developing technology.   ===== PAGE 50 ===== 50 Sustaining our planet 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report Environmental  compliance Protecting the environment remains a key priority  and we have set minimum performance standards  for managing current and emerging environmental  issues. Our Health, Safety, Wellbeing and Environment  (HSWE) management system is certified to the  International Standard ISO14001:2015 and applies   to Telstra’s global operations.  We continue to review and improve our   environmental management system in response   to current and emerging environmental requirements,  changing legislation and increasing shareholder,  customer and community expectations. In FY24,  we continued to undertake work to uplift our  environmental compliance program including   updating our environment compliance standards. As a minimum standard, Telstra seeks to comply   with all operationally relevant and applicable  environmental laws. We have not been prosecuted  for, or convicted of, any significant breaches of  environmental regulation in FY24. We advocate on climate and nature matters   directly and indirectly with government and industry.  This includes through bilateral engagement  with regulators, submitting responses on policy  development in industry consultation, contributing  to the policy work of industry groups aligned with  our goals and by responding to regulatory initiatives,  business developments and market practices.   For more information on our approach   to advocating on environment and   climate policy, and our principles for  engaging with government and industry  associations on those views, see our  Environmental Advocacy document  available on our reports page.  Intercity fibre network Additionally, as part of Telstra’s approach to our  telecommunications and infrastructure construction  projects, such as the $1.6 billion investment into  building the intercity fibre network, we are focused on: •   robust and efficient building techniques   that minimise environmental disturbance •   durability and energy efficiencies in our   assets (such as high thermal performance   and airtightness reducing energy costs, and  stronger, more disaster-resistant structures that  are ideal for protecting sensitive customer and  telecom equipment) •   reducing our carbon footprint and increasing the  sustainability of the fibre optic cable we deploy  (such as deploying smaller cables requiring less  plastic or increasing cable lengths on drums   to reduce truck rolls and associated emissions). Key components of our construction activity include: •   planning and design:    –   evaluation of sites for suitability, considering  factors like soil type, climate and accessibility   –   incorporating these factors into overall designs  to assess compatibility with telecommunications  and infrastructure requirements •   materials selection: including enhanced equipment  and cable design to suit project needs •   flora, fauna and cultural heritage: conducting  environmental and cultural heritage surveys  to identify areas or species of significance and  employing monitors to protect and preserve  identified sites during construction where required •   enhanced construction methods: leveraging a  dual-plough construction method (laying two  cables simultaneously into one trench) that  minimises the number of heavy machines required  – reducing ground disturbance and associated  impacts to native flora and fauna •   quality control and testing: regular inspection   of construction to ensure compliance with   design specification and standards or to  verify structural integrity and performance.   ===== PAGE 51 ===== Telstra Sustainability  "

At Telstra, we reject  modern slavery in all its forms, including debt bondage, deceptive  recruitment, forced labour, forced marriage, servitude, slavery,  people trafficking and child labour.  2.  Walk Free 2023, The Global Slavery Index 2023, Minderoo Foundation.  We are committed to supporting and respecting human rights   for all people and aligning our efforts with the United Nations  Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. This year, we have taken significant steps to better integrate risk  processes into our daily operations and equip our teams with the  tools and understanding to manage modern slavery risk. Our goal  is to ensure that our teams are not just aware, but actively  involved in mitigating these risks.  To support this, we have developed guidance for our teams   on how to engage in conversations with suppliers on modern  slavery risks. We’ve clearly outlined expected risk management  responsibilities including making it easier to understand how   to assess mergers and acquisitions (M&A) transactions for any  human rights risks.  We also continue to deepen our engagement with our subsidiaries  and suppliers on modern slavery risks and their responses.  To enhance our modern slavery response, we have started working  to understand and incorporate the experiences of those affected  by these inhumane practices, initially by integrating this  perspective into our training.  Modern slavery will not be tolerated anywhere in our business   or supply chain. We are committed to continuous improvement,  transparency and collaboration in our efforts to find and address  this abuse of human rights. We are pleased to present this statement and we welcome   any feedback.

In FY24, we did not identify any instances of modern slavery in  our operations or supply chain.  However, we recognise that not finding instances of modern  slavery does not guarantee its absence, particularly considering  the challenges in identifying modern slavery deeper in the supply  chain. We remain committed to ongoing due diligence to identify,  prevent and mitigate instances of modern slavery.  We have, however, identified some labour practices and behaviours  that concerned us and which we have taken action, or worked with  suppliers, to remediate.3 Finding these issues demonstrates that  our processes are generally effective in identifying situations that  could escalate into modern slavery. They also alert us to areas  where we may need to review and reinforce our risk management  approach. As part of our commitment to transparency, we have  chosen to report them and our responses to them in this statement. The activities described in this statement generally apply across  the Telstra Group as a whole. The businesses of the Reporting  Entities Telstra Health, Digicel Pacific and Versent, and certain  owned or controlled entities in the Telstra Group, such as Fetch   TV, are not fully integrated into Telstra operations.

Our workforce is comprised   of Telstra employees and workers   engaged through industry partners.  Most of our indirect workforce supports  Telstra in delivering both customer-facing  and back-office processing services. Our  main centres for indirect workers outside  Australia are India and the Philippines.45 4. All people data in this statement is expressed as headcount, not full-time equivalents (FTE) and is as at 30 June 2024. 5.   We have undertaken a review of our workforce location data sources to more accurately reflect worker location. This has resulted in a higher number of indirect  workforce locations compared to previous years. Of these, 25 locations have fewer than 10 workers. This data also includes the workforce of controlled entities   that were not previously captured within our HR system (e.g. Digicel Pacific and Fetch TV), and the workforce from new acquisitions such as Versent, which has  resulted in a higher headcount number compared to previous years.

We rely on our direct suppliers (tier 1) for a wide array of products  and services. These suppliers in turn, are supplied by their own  suppliers (tier 2, 3, 4 suppliers and so on). As we move down   the supply chain, gaining visibility gets progressively harder.6  Most of our supplier spend is on Information and communications  technology (ICT) and network infrastructure, including electronics   and network components. We do not manufacture our own  products. Instead, we procure finished goods from large  multinational companies and work with original design  manufacturers to produce Telstra-branded devices.  The services we procure are predominantly provided from  Australia, India and the United States. The goods we procure,  while predominantly purchased in Australia, are manufactured  across the world. Major manufacturing locations include China,  Vietnam and Indonesia. Approximately 84 per cent of what we spend directly is with  suppliers based in low risk countries.7 However, we recognise  these suppliers may be headquartered, or manufacture, overseas.  Therefore, we look at both the risk posed by a direct supplier and  by suppliers further down the supply chain, including their  location, to identify potential risks.8 9, 10 6.     These figures capture Telstra Group entities who use Telstra’s centralised procurement processes. These figures do not include Telstra’s owned or controlled entities   who do not use Telstra’s centralised procurement processes. See the ‘How we consult within our group’ section on page 25 for examples. 7.   See “Risk rating” in the Glossary. 8.   The 4% increase in International roaming spend from FY23 is due to a change in our reporting methodology, now including roaming charges that were previously    categorised as non-addressable. Non-addressable spend is excluded from this spend analysis as it typically includes payments such as company, payroll, and     telecommunications taxes, etc. 9.   In FY24, we revised the spend categorisation to more accurately distinguish between Property & fleet and Field services, reallocating some spend from Property   & fleet to Field services. This led to decreased spend in Property & fleet and increased spend in Field services. In addition, there was also an aggregate spend  reduction across these categories.    10.

Our behaviours and habits are what we strive to practice   every day so we can be our best.  Each behaviour is supported by specific habits which can be   done by every employee, every day, and are the things we are  seeking to emphasise within our culture. These behaviours   and habits support our people to deliver on our compliance  obligations and achieving our environment, inclusion and  responsible business ambitions. Working to prevent modern slavery in our operations and   supply chains is necessary to support our purpose and   company objectives and embody our behaviours and habits. Modern slavery governance  Modern slavery risks relating to our direct workforce are managed  through our compliance framework. Our compliance framework  defines how we manage our obligations, compliance and controls,  including those relating to wages and benefits and provision of a  healthy, safe and sanitary workplace. Modern slavery reporting is  also managed as an obligation under our compliance framework.  Modern slavery risk relating to our supply chain is managed  through our risk management framework.  Further detail on our compliance and risk  management framework is provided in our 2024  Corporate Governance Statement and the ‘Our  material risks’ section of our 2024 Annual Report  available on our annual results page.  Management of modern slavery issues at Telstra is also   supported by a Human Rights Working Group sponsored by the  Chief Sustainability Officer. This is a cross-functional group  comprising representatives from legal, workplace relations,  supplier services and compliance and risk teams which meets  quarterly to consider and address human rights issues and areas  of focus and how they are managed across Telstra, including  issues relating to labour rights in the supply chain. Our behaviours and habits  ===== PAGE 9 ===== 8 Telstra Modern Slavery Act Statement 2024 Our policies Telstra’s Group Policies support our commitment to respect   human rights and manage the risk of modern slavery in our  operations and supply chain.

Workers at retail partners  and partner business  centres Risk that delivery partners may take advantage of  vulnerable workers (e.g. migrant workers or visa  holders). Telstra has limited visibility and does not have  direct control over the conditions of these workers. Supply Chain ICT products (e.g.   devices, accessories) May be produced by low-skilled and low-wage labour,  which may include vulnerable workers such as migrant  workers or children in artisanal mines. ICT Products and  their components are often manufactured and mined in  high-risk countries. Devices (non-ICT), including  medical devices and energy  metering devices May be produced by low-skilled and low-wage labour,  which may include vulnerable workers in high-risk  countries. Construction and physical  network infrastructure  maintenance May involve low-skilled, low-wage and temporary labour  which may include vulnerable workers (e.g. migrant workers  or visa holders) and high levels of subcontracting, leading to  poor visibility over the supply chain. Products used to build,  support and maintain  physical network  infrastructure Produced by low-skilled and low-wage labour, which may  include vulnerable workers in high-risk countries. Usually  produced by lower tier suppliers where Telstra has  limited visibility. Common exploitation practices include  forced and child labour and unsafe conditions. Branded apparel and  marketing merchandise Produced by low-skilled and low-wage labour, which   may include vulnerable workers in high-risk countries. Cleaning and waste  management Involves low-skilled and low-wage labour, with a high  proportion of temporary migrant workers and high levels  of subcontracting. Common exploitation practices in this  industry include withholding wages, excessive overtime  and dangerous or sub-standard working conditions. Transport/logistics Involves low-skilled, low-wage and temporary labour  often relying on subcontracting. Workers may be prone  to exploitation by recruiters making it harder to have  transparency over worker conditions. Pressure on supply  chains caused by increased online shopping, COVID-19  and other world events has increased the potential for  exploitation of workers in this industry. Solar panels and batteries Higher risk industry subject to modern slavery risks,  including the risk of state-imposed forced labour and  exploitation of minority groups. Supply chain pressures  caused by the increased demand for solar and batteries  heightens modern slavery risk. Carbon offsets Projects targeted can be in high-risk developing  countries and may utilise vulnerable workers in high-risk  industries (e.g. solar power project). Renewable energy   projects via Power   Purchase Agreements Higher risk industry subject to modern slavery risks.  Products required for renewable energy projects may be  produced by vulnerable workers in high-risk countries.  This includes risks of: • state-imposed forced labour and exploitation of  minority groups in the solar supply chain • exploitation of workers producing balsa wood or  extracting minerals used in the manufacture of wind  turbines.  Supply chain pressures caused by the increased  demand for renewable energy projects and products  heightens modern slavery risk. The United Nations Guiding Principles on  Business and Human Rights (UNGPs)  expect businesses to carry out human  rights due diligence to assess both actual  and potential human rights impacts.  Labour risk in the supply chain is a salient  human rights issue for Telstra.  For information on our full   list of salient human rights  issues see the 'Human rights'  section in our 2024 Bigger  Picture Sustainability Report  available on our reports page. Our relationship to modern slavery   risk has been assessed using the UNGPs’  continuum of involvement, which explains  how a business may be involved in  potential or actual human rights impacts  such as modern slavery, by causing,  contributing to, or being directly linked   to it.11 The nature of our involvement  informs our response. Our assessment  indicates Telstra is most likely to be  directly linked to modern slavery impacts  in our identified risk areas, through our  business relationships, rather than causing  or contributing to them. However, we  recognise there is a potential risk we might  cause or contribute to modern slavery if  the risk management controls outlined   in this statement were not in place.  Our modern slavery risk identification   is informed by an initial FY20 modern  slavery risk review by an independent  third-party of our global operations and  supply chain to identify areas of higher   risk for modern slavery. Building on this  initial risk assessment we undertake  periodic modern slavery risk assessments  to capture changes to Telstra’s operations  and operating context as our business  evolves. In line with the UNGPs, we use  four key modern slavery risk factors when  assessing risk: country/region, categories/ sectors, business models and vulnerable  populations to assess where, in relation to  Telstra’s business units and procurement  categories, there is potential risk of  modern slavery practices. We also regularly assess our highest   risk areas using insights drawn from   our supplier due diligence process and  screening tools, grievance tracking, active  engagement in human rights forums,  stakeholder feedback, media sources and  subject matter experts within our teams.  We leverage diverse inputs to prioritise  and address key risks effectively. 11. Guiding Principle 13 of the UNGPs. Our modern slavery risks Telstra’s main modern slavery risks are:  ===== PAGE 12 ===== 11 Telstra Modern Slavery Act Statement 2024 How we address   modern slavery risks In our operations Employees We have a global employment framework covering all Telstra Group direct employees. This includes direct employees of owned or   controlled entities, even where they have separate policies and processes (such as different leave entitlements and allowances). Compliance  with laws Collective bargaining  and consultation Online recruitment  management system Telstra’s global employment  framework: • requires compliance with  local laws as a minimum. • covers core employment  conditions such as minimum  wages, hours of work and  leave entitlements. Telstra has in place payroll  systems and compliance  controls to help ensure that our  employees are paid correctly  and in a timely way. This includes  wage-related payments such  as penalties and allowances and  (in Australia) superannuation.  Our payroll arrangements are  regularly audited to help ensure  ongoing compliance. Major  changes to our payroll systems  are the subject of rigorous  controls and testing.  Telstra periodically reviews the  labour laws in locations where  we operate to check we meet  these requirements. If we identify  any gaps in a particular location,  we promptly remedy these. The online recruitment  management system applies  to the Main Employing Entities  and has formal approval gates  to help make sure our policies  and processes are correctly  followed. This includes: • verifying candidates’ identity  • requiring evidence to conﬁrm  their right to work status  • requiring evidence to conﬁrm  they meet minimum  employment age • generating contracts that  comply with Telstra’s policies  and processes, including in  relation to pay rates, working  hours, beneﬁts and relevant  enterprise agreements.  In Australia: • our direct workforce generally  has working conditions set  by enterprise agreements • more than 77 per cent are  covered by these collective  agreements.   Worldwide: • we consult with our people  before we implement any  signiﬁcant changes to the  way we work  • our people have the freedom  to form or join a trade union,  to bargain collectively and  to engage in trade union  activities. Treating our people well Our global employment  framework provides  conditions and employment  processes that go beyond  what is required by local  law to help us respect and  support the human rights  of employees and provide  a safe and fair working  environment. This includes  recruitment procedures to  support diverse candidates.  The Telstra Group entities that employ the majority of our direct workforce  have additional processes in place to support fair recruitment: Telstra’s Main Employing Entities have recruitment policies  to help ensure: • all recruitment decisions are in line with the Telstra  behaviours and habits  • recruitment and selection practices are fair and equitable • all recruitment processes support diversity and inclusion • we act fairly and consistently when considering rehiring  individuals previously made redundant. Policy The Main Employing Entities and Telstra Purple have  a formal recruitment process for our permanent and  contingent workforces that all recruiters are required  to follow.  When agencies are engaged, we require them to follow  these recruitment processes. Process For more information on how we respect and support our people, including our approach to health, safety and  wellbeing, see the ‘Our people’ section in our 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report available on our reports page. Telstra’s global employment framework  ===== PAGE 13 ===== 12 Telstra Modern Slavery Act Statement 2024 Management of higher   risk operational   activities and locations Some of the activities we undertake and  some of our service delivery models are  higher risk because we do not have  visibility of the working conditions of  workers engaged in these. We recognise  that when workers are not employed  directly by us, we need to implement a  robust risk management framework to  help ensure worker rights are upheld and  appropriate grievance mechanisms are  accessible to workers.  Specific risk mitigations   for our delivery partners  outside Australia Around 37 per cent of Telstra’s   workforce is indirect. These workers are either engaged as  contingent workers or through longer   term delivery partnership arrangements.  The indirect delivery partner service model  carries heightened risks for workers as  they are not directly engaged by Telstra.  This is particularly so where the delivery  partners are outside Australia in higher   risk countries.  12.  See “Risk rating” in the Glossary. Telstra engages indirect workers: • to undertake high-volume repeatable  activities, such as billing, assurance,  activations, people services, payroll,  data and analytics, supply chain and  procurement • to manage customer relationships  across all assisted and unassisted  channels, including contact centres and  digital platforms   • in construction, maintenance and  design, security, operation of our  networks and technology solutions  (including Information Technology (IT)  applications and operational technology  used in our network) • to provide professional services,  including consulting and IT support  services. The largest groups of indirect workers   are in Australia, followed by India and the  Philippines. India and the Philippines are  considered higher risk locations for  modern slavery.12 To mitigate the risk presented by the  indirect delivery partner service model: • all our delivery partners must sign up   to our Supplier Code of Conduct,  and can be asked to demonstrate  compliance through questionnaires,  desktop audits and site visits  • our partners are contractually obliged  to comply with the law, including local  laws relating to terms and conditions  of employment. In India and the  Philippines this includes having their  own functioning ombudsperson and  providing workers with contracts in a  language they can understand. Terms  and conditions of employment must be  clearly set out in employment contracts • in India, working conditions and benefits  must be physically displayed in the  workplace, in a language the workers  can understand. We collect copies of  employment contracts from vendors  providing property and facilities  management for their workers who work  at Telstra premises and arrange for a  third-party to audit them on a monthly  basis for compliance with labour laws.  For larger vendors operating within  Telstra premises, we require a monthly  declaration that they comply with all  applicable labour laws • employees of our delivery partners  with direct access to Telstra systems  must complete our Business Essentials  Training or lose access to these Telstra  systems. This alerts workers to how  Telstra expects workers to be treated  and to Telstra’s Whistleblowing  Service should they need to report  mistreatment.   ===== PAGE 14 ===== 13 Telstra Modern Slavery Act Statement 2024 Specific risk mitigations  for our retail network  We use a network of stores and business  centres across Australia to sell to our  consumer and small business customers.  All Telstra branded retail stores, and   76 per cent of Telstra’s business centres,  are Telstra-owned and operated. We also  have dealership agreements with partner  business centres and retail partners,  including independently run T-Partner  dealers who generally operate smaller  dealerships and support regional and  Language Other Than English customers.  We also have independent dealership  agreements with retail partners such   as JB Hi-Fi and The Good Guys to sell   Telstra products.  We take steps to mitigate the risk presented by our partner business  centres and retail partners business model: Annual attestation We request our partner business centres and smaller retail partners to  complete an annual attestation of compliance with certain terms of their  agreement, including compliance with employment and labour obligations.  We are progressively rolling out these requests to additional partners. Training Partners must complete mandatory training to access Telstra systems.   The training sets out the standards and behaviours we expect, and how   to raise a concern if these standards are not being met. Grievance  mechanisms Telstra representatives manage each partner and provide a channel   where partners and their employees can raise issues with us. Partners   and their employees can also raise issues using the partners’ own   grievance mechanisms or Telstra’s Whistleblowing Service. Audits We have a contractual ability to audit partners if there are concerns about  a partner’s compliance with the terms of their agreement, including the  requirement to comply with applicable laws. Failure to comply We have contractual remedies if a partner fails to comply with relevant  Telstra policies (such as the Supplier Code of Conduct), laws or regulations  applicable to their operations. Such a failure constitutes breach of the  relevant agreement, and depending on the seriousness of the breach,  Telstra’s recourse may include termination of the agreement, clawback   of amounts paid or suspension of the partner’s ability to undertake certain  sales or service activities. Dealership and  business centre  agreements In FY24, we started to roll out a new standard dealership agreement for  our enterprise partners and partner business centres which requires our  partners to comply with modern slavery legislation. Case study: Ensuring fair treatment of agency workers This year we investigated a complaint  from a Telstra agency worker in Australia  who claimed following their resignation  that their employer was demanding  reimbursement for visa sponsorship  related costs and withholding their pay.  The individual was employed by a   tier 3 supplier to Telstra and both a  tier 2 and tier 1 supplier were involved  with their engagement at Telstra. The  demands to the worker came from   both the tier 2 and tier 3 suppliers.   The individual later confirmed the   issues relating to their employer were  resolved following interaction with the  Fair Work Commission.  This issue represented a breach of  Telstra’s Supplier Code of Conduct.   We investigated the circumstances  around this breach with the Telstra  partner (tier 1 supplier) involved and  identified a few underlying issues,  including a lack of transparency  and controls around subcontracting  arrangements and due diligence  processes that were not robust enough  in this case.  We have worked with the Telstra partner  to confirm they have implemented  additional controls to manage  transparency and control around  subcontracting.  We continue to work with the Telstra  partner to confirm: • whether the findings relating to the  matter are systemic  • how they will raise awareness  of workers’ rights and grievance  processes amongst all workers,  including contracted workers • what additional controls and due  diligence will be implemented to help  ensure subcontractors comply with  Telstra’s Supplier Code of Conduct  • the existence of relevant policies  and training specifically prohibiting  charging workers for visa sponsorship  related costs.  ===== PAGE 15 ===== 14 Telstra Modern Slavery Act Statement 2024 In our supply chain  Constructive engagement with suppliers We regularly work with our suppliers to assess their adherence to  our standards. Many of our suppliers have robust risk management  processes in place and collaborate with us to meet our requirements. Where we identify concerns about supplier performance, we engage  constructively with the supplier, driving improvements to deliver  the best outcomes for the workers we are seeking to protect, the  community and the environment. In instances where suppliers are  not willing to co-operate, despite our attempts at engagement,   we may terminate their contracts or switch to alternate suppliers. Compliance with the Supplier Code of  Conduct and contractual risk mitigation The Telstra Limited standard Telstra Supply Agreement is in place  with most suppliers to Telstra and requires suppliers to: • comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct and laws   regarding modern slavery • put in place policies and procedures to manage their   supply chain’s compliance with relevant policies and laws  • provide evidence of their compliance on request. Telstra has the right to terminate the contract if these   provisions are breached.   When making procurement decisions, we consider suppliers’  ability to meet the standards in our Supplier Code of Conduct,  regardless of whether the Supplier Code of Conduct has been  formally incorporated into the relevant contract. We may   include additional social, environment or ethical contractual  requirements based on the inherent risk of the agreement.   For example, we may dictate a specified frequency for  sustainability audits where the risk profile warrants.   We provide an online portal specifically for suppliers to disclose  conflicts of interest relating to Telstra employees and concerns  about working conditions. We review all disclosures relating to   the Supplier Code of Conduct provided through the online portal,   via whistleblowing reports or otherwise. Our policies and processes require our team members to  manage human rights risks posed by suppliers, including  labour rights risks. This includes engaging with suppliers  on these risks where they are identified. To assist with this,  we developed a guide this year for deeper engagement on  these issues. This was a recommended action from a  human rights gap analysis completed by external experts  in FY23. The guide sets out: • specific human rights questions to ask at supplier  meetings  • potential responses that would indicate the need for  further investigation  • actions team members can take to support suppliers  to improve their human rights practices • resources that can be shared with suppliers to support  their human rights response.  Case study: Engaging   with suppliers Throughout this year we proactively engaged with one  of our suppliers in response to allegations of worker  mistreatment within their supply chain. The allegations  centred around disputes over working conditions and  pay. We took the initiative to express our concerns to the  supplier, seeking clarity on how they were managing the  risk of worker mistreatment in their supply chain, both  generally and specifically in relation to the allegations. The supplier was cooperative, providing us with a thorough  understanding of their labour rights risk management  processes, as well as specific details about the allegations  and their response to them. We were reassured to find  their handling of the incidents was consistent with their  robust public statements on managing labour rights risks  in their supply chain. Our experience with this supplier reaffirms the importance  of open dialogue and collaboration in promoting fair  labour practices in the supply chain, and the benefits of  actively engaging with our suppliers, so we can better  understand and manage the risk of modern slavery.   ===== PAGE 16 ===== 15 Telstra Modern Slavery Act Statement 2024 Governance  and reporting  in accordance  with the  Human Rights  and Modern  Slavery  governance  structure Supplier Code of Conduct Risk-based identiﬁcation of suppliers to undergo further  engagement, worker voice surveys or site audits Supplier Governance Framework** Supplier selection and contract renewal Risk Management  Framework Telstra Group  Policies* Telstra Group  Code of Conduct Sets out the minimum  standards we expect  from our suppliers Sets out principles  for how we govern  our suppliers Sets out the minimum risk  management activities that  must be performed, using  a risk-based approach,  to meet the principles Processes to implement  the framework Program to audit  higher risk suppliers   Monitoring  Ongoing monitoring  and management of the  supplier’s performance,  as well as sanctions and  adverse media alerts Contract clauses which  set out the supplier’s risk  management obligations to         Telstra, including compliance  to our Supplier Code of  Conduct and modern  slavery requirements Supplier due diligence  reviews, including KYS  questionnaires, use of  external supplier  screening tools and  desktop reviews Supplier risk  assessment against  12 categories  of risk, including  labour practices • Site audits and worker voice surveys • Corrective action plans • Veriﬁcation and closure of corrective actions The Supplier Governance Framework supports our Dealing  with Suppliers and Other Third Parties Policy and sets out the  minimum requirements team members must meet to effectively  manage risks associated with their supplier engagements.   It requires them to: • identify and assess the inherent risks associated with their  supplier engagement, considering the Supplier Risk   Categories (see diagram to the right)  • complete due diligence on the supplier using our KYS   platform and sanctions and adverse media screening tools,  to validate the supplier’s practices and risk management  capabilities against Telstra’s requirements, including our  Supplier Code of Conduct  • undertake monitoring and management of the supplier’s  performance, including ongoing sanctions and adverse   media alerts, to help assess compliance to contract  requirements. Where warranted, worker voice surveys and/or  site audits may also be conducted at the supplier site.    The Supplier Governance Framework governs our centralised  procurement process, used by the majority of Telstra’s   controlled entities13. We work with our controlled entities on  adopting the Supplier Code of Conduct and the requirements   of the Supplier Governance Framework.   13.   The specific procurement process adopted by a controlled entity will depend on the level of Telstra’s ownership, the relevant entity’s circumstances, the nature of its  operations and its jurisdiction. Telstra Health, Digicel Pacific, Fetch TV and Versent are examples of entities that do not utilise the Telstra Group procurement function or  centralised procurement processes. The Supplier Governance Framework         a                                                            Supplier Risk Categories For further information about our subsidiary  governance model and consultation within the  Telstra Group, see the ‘Our approach’ section on  page 7 and ‘How we consult within our group’   section on page 25. *    Telstra Group policies such as Health, Safety and Wellbeing, Anti-bribery and Anti-corruption, Conflicts of Interest, Dealing with Suppliers and Other Third Parties   and our Human Rights Policy. ** Elements of the Supplier Governance Framework have been updated throughout this year, see below for further detail of updates.   ===== PAGE 17 ===== 16 Telstra Modern Slavery Act Statement 2024 In FY24, we reviewed and updated our Supplier Governance  Framework to address key learnings and improvement  opportunities identified in the 12 months prior. Changes included: • restructuring the presentation of our Framework to make it  easier for our people to read and understand their roles and  responsibilities • simplifying the risk management requirements to improve  alignment with our buying methods. To address regulatory changes and technology advancements  impacting our risk landscape, we also:  • refreshed our guidance on our Supplier Risk Categories • developed and ran training for our contract owners on how to  perform effective risk assessments. Recordings of the training  and the accompanying guidance and resources are available to  our contract owners to access on demand via our intranet • developed additional guidance to support our contract owners  with meeting the requirements of the Framework, such as  guidance on supplier onboarding and offboarding.  As part of our continuous improvement of supplier governance  across Telstra, we are looking to uplift the technology and  operating model underpinning our supplier governance and   third-party risk management systems in FY25. Supplier due diligence Know Your Supplier Platform We use an online KYS platform to support our due diligence  process for domestically contracted suppliers. The KYS platform  hosts our supplier questionnaires relating to our Supplier Risk  Categories, including labour practices. Internal and external  supplier subject matter experts designed these questions based  on industry standards. The platform allows suppliers to: • respond to our supplier questionnaire through a secure portal  • upload and maintain information about their compliance with  Telstra’s Supplier Code of Conduct and their risk management  practices, including those relating to labour practices • provide evidence of their accreditations.  Completion of our KYS questionnaire is a mandatory step for  domestically contracted suppliers on both new contracts and  contract variations. We continue to work on onboarding our   pre-existing domestic contracts to the KYS platform. We focus  our efforts on our domestically contracted suppliers as they  represent more than 80 per cent of our total spend. KYS onboarded suppliers 14                                                T 14.   Figures in this infographic are as at 30 June of the relevant year. New suppliers are added to the platform weekly and may complete the questionnaire in the financial  year following onboarding. In FY24, we reviewed our supplier list in KYS removing those with no active engagements. For this reason, there are fewer total suppliers  showing in FY24, compared to previous years. 15.  Sustainability issues relate to health and safety, labour practices, environmental practices, bribery and corruption and modern slavery.  We periodically revise the questions in the KYS platform to  respond to supplier feedback, regulatory changes and other  emerging issues to increase the breadth and depth of oversight  into our supply chain. This year we implemented a modern slavery risk profile rating   on the KYS platform. The rating reflects a supplier’s inherent  modern slavery risk level, based on their industry and location.   We also implemented a compliance check process within the   KYS platform to assess modern slavery risk management  practices and help identify whether a supplier meets our  minimum requirements for labour practices. Using this  information and the modern slavery risk profile rating, we   identify high-risk suppliers and determine if additional   measures are required to address any elevated risks. Enhanced due diligence In addition to utilising the KYS platform, we engage a   third-party to complete enhanced due diligence (EDD)   screening of higher risk suppliers. This includes: • screening suppliers using publicly available sources  • mapping findings to Telstra’s Supplier Risk Categories   in a report for review and remediation • monitoring screened suppliers on an ongoing basis for  subsequent adverse findings. In FY24, we obtained 55 EDD reports on identified suppliers. Ongoing monitoring We have an ongoing monitoring program for all active  domestically contacted suppliers to identify potential risks by  monitoring against public records, including media reports and  civil litigation, regulatory, criminality and bankruptcy checks.  This year our ongoing monitoring program made us  aware of: The high-risk alerts are reviewed by the respective functions,  contract owners and supplier relationship owners, and may  lead to further due diligence in accordance with the Supplier  Governance Framework.15 For instances where allegations are raised publicly about  unacceptable practices such as forced labour in parts of our  supply chain, we engage with suppliers to help ensure workers’  rights are appropriately respected. Pending the outcome of   the engagement we may undertake additional actions such   as conducting an on-site audit or a worker voice survey. 15 high-risk alerts around sustainability   issues for 14 active suppliers15  Out of these, five active suppliers had   high-risk alerts relating to labour practices  No active suppliers had high-risk alerts  relating to modern slavery  ===== PAGE 18 ===== 17 Telstra Modern Slavery Act Statement 2024 Sustainability audit program Our sustainability audit program identifies suppliers for   further engagement, worker voice initiatives or site audits,   based on risks identified through: • EDD reports • the KYS platform • whistleblowing reports • feedback and reporting of supplier performance and   actions from the business • participation in industry groups focused on human   rights and modern slavery • feedback from stakeholders such as investors • media attention on instances of exploitation practices.  Worker voice surveys Telstra uses worker voice surveys to obtain feedback   directly from workers on their sentiments relating to: • grievance mechanisms available at their workplace  • environment, health and safety • wages and working hours • gender equality in the workplace • how they are treated and whether they have   experienced harassment • job satisfaction. We use an online mobile phone survey, provided and managed   by a third-party. The survey questions test whether workers’  working conditions meet Telstra’s expectations as set out in   the Supplier Code of Conduct.  The worker voice survey is anonymous and offers insights  on topics that can otherwise be difficult to identify, such as  harassment. It can be used independently or to complement  audits undertaken at sites. Using mobile technology, the survey  can cover a much wider sample size of employees than engaged  through the audit process. It allows workers to share their  viewpoints and provides Telstra and the supplier who employs  them with better visibility of worker wellbeing. We ask the relevant supplier to promote the survey to its workers  ahead of time. This can include: • printing and distributing cards containing a QR code to workers  • displaying posters prominently before the survey launch  • explaining the survey to workers as anonymous, confidential,  fast and easy  • providing the estimated time to respond to the survey.  Where worker dissatisfaction is identified, Telstra works with  the supplier to respond to the findings and get assurances that  Telstra’s expectations outlined in our Supplier Code of Conduct  are met. Telstra then verifies completion of these actions.

The audits include worker interviews, site visits   to assess labour conditions and documentation reviews. 16.  Telstra reports the number of audits conducted by Telstra and JAC peers (under the JAC framework) on suppliers to Telstra. In FY24, there were no supplier led audits.  The disclosed metric is derived from audits reported by JAC. From this we extract the subset which pertains only to Telstra suppliers that have been conducted during  this financial year.   17. For more information about JAC, see the ’Industry cooperation on combatting modern slavery’ section on page 23.  18.  In FY24, audits in the ICT sector led by Telstra were conducted on contact centres. JAC peer led audits comprised of audits on manufacturing facilities of devices and  network products. 19.  In FY24, audits in the construction and physical network infrastructure maintenance category comprised of an audit on an infrastructure field services provider led by  Telstra. 20.  In FY24, audits in the other category comprised of a Telstra led audit on a merchandise provider. JAC peer led audits comprised of audits on suppliers providing  professional services, as well as those in media and marketing. 21. Audits identify 3 tiers of findings: priority being the most serious, followed by major and then minor.

The surveys identified dissatisfaction  across all nine sites regarding wages,  working hours, grievance mechanisms  and job satisfaction. Workers felt their  wages were not fair for the work they  do and that wages calculation was not  clear. Workers also noted management’s  unresponsiveness to their feedback and  expressed unhappiness with training and  overall job contentment.  To respond to these findings the contact  centre supplier has agreed to: • increase wage transparency,   job flexibility and coaching • introduce new training and   training spaces • improve communication with  employees through new systems   and a leader feedback mechanism. The indirect business process  outsourcing supplier has agreed to: • increase wage transparency and  awareness of wellness programs • promote skill uplift programs and  nominate representatives to support  with workplace issues • make grievance mechanisms more  easily accessible to employees. The suppliers have also been required  to provide regular updates to Telstra on  the progress of their actions to address  workers' concerns.  The worker voice surveys showed  better results in other areas, including  the workers' perception of their  safety at work, understanding of  emergency procedures, openness to  share complaints, existence of trusted  feedback channels and freedom   from sexual harassment and   abusive behaviour.  Worker voice surveys are a useful tool for  gaining insights directly from workers on  their working conditions and sentiments.  It not only benefits Telstra, but also  the supplier, guiding them on where  to improve to help create a fair and  sustainable work environment.                                              ===== PAGE 20 ===== 19 Telstra Modern Slavery Act Statement 2024 FY24 site audits with priority and major findings by location As well as relying on third-party audits, our Quality, Health,  Safety, Wellbeing and Environmental auditors undertake internal  audits on our construction and physical network infrastructure  maintenance suppliers where health and safety is a significant  risk. This includes contract management system audits and   onsite health, safety and environment audits.  In FY24, we undertook 45 management system audits and more  than 3,460 health, safety and environment audits. Acting on our due diligence findings We review the findings of all our site audits. Where we identify  an issue, we work with the supplier to develop remediation plans  with agreed timeframes. We then verify the supplier has carried  out the corrective actions. We did not identify any instances of modern slavery through our  sustainability audit program in FY24. Findings from the FY24 audits conducted identified: 259 priority and major findings 79% of sites or 83% of suppliers audited  had priority or major findings FY24 site audits: priority and major findings by type Health and safety and working hours are the most common   areas of concern. Excessive work hours and poor health and  safety practices can lead to further risk of harm to people if   they are not remediated.  In FY24: 201 corrective actions relating to priority  and major findings reported in this or  previous years’ findings were closed This includes closing 140 (54%) of  corrective actions relating to priority   and major findings identified in this   year’s audits. Where suppliers are not willing to improve their   performance in a timely manner, despite our attempts at  engagement, we may terminate supply contracts or switch   to alternate suppliers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             T                         T                                   L           ===== PAGE 21 ===== 20 Telstra Modern Slavery Act Statement 2024 Update on our previous   audit case studies In FY22 and FY23, we reported on audits  we undertook on various suppliers. While  we have been able to close some of the  corrective actions, we have encountered  challenges with others and have not been  able to close out all the findings. The lack  of progress and unwillingness to address  findings by one of the audited facilities   has led us to decline the use of that site   to supply to us. With the remaining sites, we are actively  engaging with both tier 1 and tier 2  suppliers through regular meetings to  track progress. In addition, an independent  third-party auditing firm is undertaking  document reviews to verify the closure  of corrective actions and, if necessary,  we will conduct further on-site audits to  identify if these issues have been resolved  or are ongoing.  Despite the challenges involved, where  suppliers show a willingness to engage  with us on these matters, we remain  committed to working collaboratively   to improve and safeguard the working  conditions of our supply chain workers.  Case Study: Protecting workers in our   contact centres In FY24, Telstra conducted site audits  on four facilities operated by a tier  1 supplier providing contact centre  outsourcing services. These facilities  handle consumer faults, sales and  service, small business operations,  messaging, and back-of-house  operations on behalf of Telstra,   forming a crucial part of Telstra's  service ecosystem. The decision to audit this supplier  stemmed from past concerns regarding  the supplier's labour practices, which  were highlighted through worker voice  surveys and other communication  channels. Engaging an independent  third-party auditing firm, Telstra  conducted on-site audits of the four  tier 1 facilities located in both Australia  and India. While the audits did not  reveal any labour-related issues, they  did pinpoint areas for improvement in  health and safety and environmental  practices, particularly within the  Australian facilities. In response to these findings,  corrective actions have been agreed  with the audited facilities. These  include enhancing health and safety  training, reviewing and enhancing  existing policies, devising emergency  response strategies and addressing  environmental concerns. To date,   36 per cent of priority and major  corrective actions have been closed. Telstra remains actively involved in  overseeing the resolution process,  maintaining regular communication  with the supplier on these matters,  conducting progress-tracking meetings  and facilitating documentation reviews  by the independent auditing firm.   We may also conduct follow-up audits  if necessary. This supplier has been responsive and  prompt to address the findings and  issues raised. This gives us assurance  that we have a willing partner in this  supplier to improve treatment of  workers in line with Telstra’s Supplier  Code of Conduct. Case Study: design in breakout box Case Study: Improving labour practices in our promotional products   supply chain In FY24, we undertook a site audit  on Telstra’s primary promotional  merchandise supplier. Branded  promotional items such as event  gifts and store uniforms help shape  Telstra’s distinctive brand identity.  We recognise the heightened risk of  worker exploitation at facilities that  manufacture promotional products,  particularly in regions with higher  modern slavery risk.  In addition to operating in a high-risk  industry, Telstra’s KYS questionnaire  assessed the risk related to this supplier  as high in the areas of health and safety,  business ethics, environment and labour.  Consequently, additional due diligence  was deemed necessary and an onsite  audit was carried out on the supplier.  The audit was conducted by an  independent third-party auditing firm  and focused on a tier 2 facility located  in Asia. Both our tier 1 supplier who  facilitated the audit for us and the tier 2  supplier being audited were cooperative  throughout the audit process. The audit  found numerous findings particularly in  the categories of labour practices and  health and safety.  Labour practices issues ranged from  excessive overtime to employee rules  stating wages may be deducted for  disciplinary reasons (such as absenteeism  and smoking). The audit also noted an  absence of written work agreements and  inadequate record-keeping. Health and  safety concerns included inadequate or  no policies, unsafe work practices and  workers not wearing provided personal  protective equipment. In response to these findings, a corrective  action plan has been agreed with the  facility, outlining specific measures and  timelines for rectifying the identified  issues. This includes putting in place  legally compliant written labour contracts  for all workers, implementing measures  to reduce excessive overtime, revising  wage policies, ceasing wage deductions  for disciplinary purposes, enhancing  safety training and establishing formal  policies addressing various workplace  issues. To date, progress has been made  in closing 63 per cent of priority and  major corrective actions which equates  to 50 per cent of total corrective actions  identified during the audit. Telstra has put ongoing monitoring  mechanisms in place for the remaining  corrective actions. This includes  continuous engagement with our tier 1  supplier to influence the tier 2 supplier,  regular meetings with the tier 1 supplier  to track progress, documentation review  by the independent auditing firm and,  if necessary, follow-up audits. Telstra  is also taking the learnings from the  audits to work with our tier 1 supplier  to strengthen how they support their  suppliers with meeting labour practices  and health and safety standards as set  out in Telstra’s Supplier Code of Conduct. Working with this supplier has  underscored the inherent risks  associated with the promotional  products industry. However, despite  the higher than usual number of  findings in this audit, the supplier has  been collaborative and committed  to improving their practices and  labour conditions. This constructive  engagement provides Telstra with the  incentive to keep engaging this supplier  whilst actively driving improvements   in the working conditions of the   affected workers.   ===== PAGE 22 ===== 21 Telstra Modern Slavery Act Statement 2024 Specific risk mitigation   for carbon offsets  We recognise that carbon offset projects  can be vulnerable to human rights abuses  such as modern slavery.  We have limited influence over how  projects are operated, as we have  purchased carbon offsets primarily  through third parties from existing  projects. For this reason, our due diligence  in this area follows different processes to  those set out in in our Supplier Governance  Framework. The most significant influence  we have is our decision whether to proceed  to buy the offsets following due diligence. Telstra has a Carbon Offset Acquisition  Guideline to support investment in high- integrity offsets. We consider modern  slavery through two principles: • Telstra aligned – alignment to Telstra  sustainability strategy, policies and  brand by ensuring compliance with  Telstra’s Supplier Code of Conduct • sustainable development – positive  environmental and social impact,  by ensuring social safeguards such  as community engagement and  consultation. Due diligence includes country risk  assessments and database searches  for litigation and adverse media. If any  concerns have been uncovered in this due  diligence, including relating to exploitation  of workers, Telstra has not proceeded with  the acquisition of the carbon offsets.  From 1 July 2024 Telstra Group will no  longer be offsetting the emissions from  our operations. We will continue to offset  emissions associated with mobile phone  plans and mobile broadband plans until   31 August 2024.  For more information on our  climate strategy see the  ‘Sustaining our planet’  chapter of the 2024 Bigger  Picture Sustainability Report  available on our reports page. Specific risk mitigation for  renewable energy projects  Telstra has made a commitment to enable  renewable energy generation equivalent  to 100 per cent of its consumption by  2025. As part of this commitment, Telstra  enters into long-term power purchase  agreements with new renewable energy  projects. To assess the potential for  modern slavery risks, Telstra undertakes  due diligence by: • using a supplier questionnaire which  addresses modern slavery risk   • reviewing a supplier’s relevant policies • asking specific questions on modern  slavery risk management at the request  for proposal stage and assessing the  responses • incorporating clauses into its power  purchase agreements that require  suppliers to comply with its Supplier  Code of Conduct, and relevant Telstra  Group Policies, including its human  rights policy, which addresses modern  slavery risk  • Telstra’s contract management team  regularly assessing ethical business  risks through the course of management  of the contract.  If our due diligence process identifies  that a counterparty is not adequately  managing modern slavery risk, we do not  proceed with the project. We have, for  example, disengaged from projects due  to factories located in higher risk areas,  corruption charges and weak anti-slavery  commitments. Specific risk mitigation   for solar panel purchases Telstra buys and installs solar panels  each year as part of our mobile equipment  installations and network upgrades across  Australia and the wider region. Our tier 1  suppliers in Australia source their panels  overseas. We are aware of the risk of  state sponsored forced labour and worker  exploitation in the solar panel supply chain  and have encountered challenges when  seeking to audit solar panel manufactures  beyond tier 1. Our experience highlights  the lack of transparency in the solar panel  industry and the exposure to modern  slavery risks with lower tier suppliers.  To mitigate this risk, we have additional  controls to assess whether suppliers  adhere to our standards, including: • cross-referencing potential solar panel  suppliers against suppliers already  audited by us or other JAC members,  and those with past allegations of  worker exploitation  • engaging with tier 1 solar panel  suppliers on this issue early in the  procurement process. We do this by  explaining that worker conditions, and  difficulties auditing, are a concern to  Telstra and asking suppliers how they  plan to manage this, prior to committing  to the supplier. In FY24, we developed guidance on how  to raise our modern slavery concerns with  solar panel suppliers and how to identify  solar panel suppliers and manufacturers  with known risks. Despite ongoing efforts, we have been  unable to complete audits on a number  of lower tier manufacturers, identified  for audits in previous years. As a  result, Telstra has made the decision  to not accept supply from lower tier  manufacturers that declined our requests  to audit their facilities. In these instances,  we continue to engage with the relevant  tier 1 supplier on its management of  modern slavery risk in its supply chain.   ===== PAGE 23 ===== 22 Telstra Modern Slavery Act Statement 2024 Our training  We have several mandatory training courses in place so our people can help us prevent modern slavery in our operations and   supply chains.  Training Description FY24 completion rate Business  Essentials  Training This training: • is completed by all our employees, directors and most of our contractors, consultants and partners  • covers key obligations under our Code and Group Policies including Telstra’s Human Rights Policy • includes a human rights module to increase awareness and capability of our people in relation  to human rights and modern slavery risks relevant to Telstra and their roles.   Consequences for not completing training by the due date, without a valid reason, range from  system access suspension through to an impact on the individual’s annual performance rating  which in turn can impact remuneration reviews. 99.9% of our total target  audience completed the  mandatory refresher training.  Supplier  Governance  Framework  Training This training: • is mandatory for all staff who have direct contact with suppliers and our executive   leadership team  • helps our staff apply our Supplier Governance Framework effectively  • raises awareness of our policy requirements impacting supplier management, including   our Supplier Code of Conduct • offers an overview of staff responsibilities and the resources available to manage   suppliers across the Supplier Risk Categories, including labour practices • is usually completed on a yearly basis. However, in FY24, this training was not run while   the Supplier Governance Framework was updated. Refreshed training content aligning   with the updated Framework will be rolled out in FY25. N/A Addressing  Modern  Slavery  Training  This training:  • is mandatory for our procurement team, as well as others within the business who approve  spending or labour hire decisions or deal with high-risk areas • helps our people understand what modern slavery might look like in our value chain, identify  red flags and explain how to take action if they suspect there is a risk of modern slavery • has previously been done on a yearly basis. However, In FY24, we transitioned to a biennial  training model. Under this model, all existing targeted roles undergo training every two   years, while new hires in high-risk roles are trained in the intervening years. FY24 was a year  targeting new hires only.  95% of people in roles  targeted for mandatory  training completed the  training.22  Procurement  Principles  Training This training: • is mandatory for all the procurement specialists who support us with complex high-value  purchases  • helps procurement specialists understand their responsibilities. These responsibilities   include assessing potential supplier risks, such as labour rights risk, and supporting our   social commitments including those relating to human rights and modern slavery   • provides information on ensuring compliance with our Dealing with Suppliers and Other   Third Parties Policy. 100% of procurement  specialists completed   the training. 22.   Remaining 5% are individuals who haven’t completed training as at 30 June but are still within the 4-week timeframe allowed for completion.  Moving towards a survivor-centric approach We acknowledge the importance of understanding the experience of survivors in shaping our risk mitigation  processes. This year, we collaborated with a charity supporting survivors to refine our Addressing Modern Slavery  Training. We aimed to understand the insights of those working with survivors, to help design our training so it is  respectful of survivors and fosters an outcome-driven mindset in Telstra team members. For instance, we updated  some of our case studies to highlight not just the narrative of victimhood and rescue, but also the survivor’s journey  of reclaiming their personal freedom, achieving their ambitions, and at times leveraging their experience to  advocate against modern slavery and campaign for change.  ===== PAGE 24 ===== 23 Telstra Modern Slavery Act Statement 2024 Grievance  mechanisms   and remediation  We are committed to providing for or  cooperating in the remediation of any  human rights impacts, including those  related to modern slavery which we have  caused or contributed to. The grievance  mechanisms we have provide an avenue  for affected individuals and others to raise  concerns with us directly and enable  remediation. Telstra supports a culture  where everyone has a voice, can contribute  and is able to speak up if they see  something that is not right. Internal procedures We encourage employees to raise any  concerns they have with their one-up  manager or alternatively via the ‘Ask  HR’ tool or a dedicated intranet page.  The dedicated intranet page includes  information and links to report concerns  relating to: • employment conditions • discrimination, bullying, harassment,  sexual harassment and victimisation in  the workplace • work-related health, safety, wellbeing,  environment and physical security. Issues are recorded securely and assessed  by subject matter experts and operational  management with support from the Chief  Risk Office where required.   Where possible, we keep relevant  employees informed of the outcome   and what we are going to do differently. Issues relating to modern slavery  are investigated in consultation  with representatives from Telstra’s  sustainability team, procurement team,  legal team and other key stakeholders   as required. Whistleblowing We have a confidential Whistleblowing  Service where people can report their  concerns anonymously via phone or  webform. The service is supported by  our Whistleblowing Policy. Professional  investigators and case managers  investigate eligible reports. Telstra’s  Whistleblowing Committee, which is  chaired by the Group Company Secretary,  receives whistleblowing disclosures,  oversees the related investigations   and reports to the Audit and Risk  Committee of the Board. We received 213 whistleblowing reports   in FY24. Of these, allegations in 40 reports  were substantiated in whole or in part.  None substantiated an instance of   modern slavery.  For more information on   our whistleblowing process,  see our 2024 Bigger Picture  Sustainability Report available  on our reports page. To report a matter, please   visit Telstra’s Whistleblowing  Service.  Telstra’s Whistleblowing Service can be  used effectively for raising and addressing  issues beyond Telstra’s direct workforce.  There have been instances where reports  received via Telstra’s Whistleblowing  Service have related to working conditions  of Telstra’s indirect workforce and  prompted audits or investigations of  suppliers and corrective actions.   Grievance mechanisms   in our supply chain We recognise the challenges in raising  awareness of Telstra’s Whistleblowing  Service to workers across our supply  chain. Therefore, we expect and check  our suppliers have their own effective  grievance mechanisms through:  • our Supplier Code of Conduct which  requires suppliers to provide their  workers with grievance mechanisms  that are accessible, culturally  appropriate and communicated in   a language that workers understand • site audits which verify that such  grievance mechanisms are available and  have been communicated to workers  • our worker voice surveys which include  questions on grievance mechanisms  and how comfortable workers feel about  using the grievance mechanism.  Industry cooperation on combatting modern slavery We work with the following organisations as members to combat modern slavery and drive improvements in industry sustainability  practices, including in relation to modern slavery risk.  Organisation Detail Joint Alliance for Corporate  Social Responsibility (JAC) • JAC is an association of 27 global telecommunications operators that share resources and best practices to develop  long-term corporate social responsibility implementation within the ICT supply chain globally.  • JAC pools the results of site audits of common suppliers. JAC’s audits aim to verify that suppliers comply with  internationally recognised sustainability standards within global supply chains, including in relation to labour rights  and the prohibition of modern slavery.  • Telstra joined JAC in 2018 and has two current JAC board appointments. Global System for  Mobile Communications  Association (GSMA) • GSMA is a global organisation unifying the mobile ecosystem to deliver innovation that helps business and society thrive.  • This year we continued to work with GSMA to support the adoption of their mobile industry ESG reporting  framework specific for mobile operators by sharing best practice and learnings with other GSMA members. The  Metrics for Mobile framework features ten industry specific key performance indicators, including sustainable supply  chain. Telstra reported against the new framework in FY23, as an early adopter. Telco Together Foundation  (TTF) • TTF is an Australian telecommunications industry foundation with 30 Australian telco members. It was founded in  2012 to enable the telecommunications industry to make a significant social contribution within Australia. Modern  slavery is one of three focus areas for TTF.  • We work cooperatively with TTF and its members to reduce the risk of modern slavery, share best practice cases  and explore ways we can jointly combat modern slavery risk in the telecommunications industry’s supply chains.  UN Global Compact  Network Australia  (UNGCNA) Modern Slavery  Community of Practice • The UNGCNA Modern Slavery Community of Practice is a small interactive forum that meets quarterly to enable sharing,  learning and discussion on the opportunities and challenges we face in relation to managing modern slavery risk.  • This forum helps us to understand how to improve our modern slavery risk management program. Members come  from different industries allowing us to learn and share across the Australian business community.   ===== PAGE 25 ===== 24 Telstra Modern Slavery Act Statement 2024 How we check the   effectiveness of our actions The table below explains how we assess the effectiveness of our actions across what we identify as the six key components of an  effective response. Key component We assess the effectiveness of actions in this area by: Coordinated internal  response • Monitoring the progress of our response to modern slavery through our Human Rights Working Group and relevant  reporting to the Audit and Risk Committee of the Board.  • Reporting material worker exploitation related compliance breaches to the Audit and Risk Committee of the Board.  • Consulting with entities/business units across the Telstra Group as part of the preparation of this statement.   This helps us to identify any gaps in coordination, communication and our response across our corporate group.  Clear and embedded  policies • Regularly reviewing relevant policies to assess their ongoing relevance and applicability. These reviews   include a consideration of identified breaches or investigations of misconduct. • Auditing selected suppliers to assess their implementation of our Supplier Code of Conduct. Training for our people • Regularly reviewing the target training audience.  • Monitoring training completion rates to understand awareness levels across the Telstra Group.  • For role specific Addressing Modern Slavery Training, we ask participants to rate the training’s impact on their  understanding. Robust risk assessment  and supplier engagement  processes • Annually reviewing our Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier Governance Framework to confirm they effectively  mitigate modern slavery risk in our supply chain. • Monitoring supplier issues (including those identified during our onsite audits). • Monitoring metrics around each step of the due diligence process, including the number of suppliers monitored in  our EDD program, onboarded via our KYS platform, identified for further due diligence via the sustainability audit  program and audited.  • Tracking site audit results (both number of findings and number of resolutions), score rating of audits (excellent,  good, conditionally accepted or poor), corrective action plans to confirm they have been remediated and overdue  corrective action plans. Trusted and accessible  grievance mechanisms • Tracking the number and types of complaints (including complaints relating to modern slavery) received through   our whistleblowing reports and HR grievance mechanism and any trends.  • Tracking the number of investigations and substantiated claims from whistleblowing reports and HR grievance  mechanism. • Checking supplier grievance mechanisms as part of site audits and worker voice surveys.  Focus on continuous  improvement • Reviewing expert third-party analysis of statements to assist us to benchmark and improve our modern slavery  response. • Identifying good practice trends through our participation in JAC, TTF and UNGCNA.   ===== PAGE 26 ===== 25 Telstra Modern Slavery Act Statement 2024 Consultation  In FY24, we continued our consultation process with a   number of our owned or controlled entities including Versent,  which we acquired in FY24.  We prioritise Telstra Group owned or controlled entities   for engagement on modern slavery risk based on: • whether they are reporting entities • extent of their integration with Telstra systems • whether they have employees • the nature of their activities.  The consultation process may include: • requesting the subsidiary complete a self-assessment  questionnaire to assess how effectively they are managing   the risk of modern slavery in their operations and supply chain  • meetings with key persons to support a modern slavery   risk assessment • providing guidance on risk level and possible actions   to mitigate identified risk areas • supporting modern slavery risk mitigation uplift efforts.  Before this statement was prepared, we informed directors   from all entities within the Telstra Group about Telstra’s  responsibilities under the modern slavery legislation and   our reporting process. In addition, management of Telstra   Group entities reviewed and approved the sections that   pertained to them. New acquisitions We consider modern slavery risk when we make significant  acquisitions. We assess modern slavery risk before we make  an offer and, where appropriate, undertake confirmatory due  diligence and put in place uplift measures after we acquire a  target entity. This process may include the steps set out in the  'Consultation' section above. Newly acquired entities may also  adopt Telstra Group Policies and processes in accordance with  our Group Policy Governance Framework and Group Governance  Operating Model. Human rights due diligence   guidance for M&A In FY24, we launched a guide to assist Telstra’s  central M&A team and supporting teams identify  and address human rights issues, including modern  slavery during diligence. This was a recommended  action from a human rights gap analysis completed  by external experts in FY23. The guide sets out  specific actions to be taken to identify and manage  human rights risks in M&A transactions. It links to  resources that can be used by these teams to assist  human rights due diligence. It also includes  background information on what are human rights,  why it is important to consider them when  undertaking M&A transactions and how human  rights risks might arise in an M&A transaction in a  Telstra context.  How we consult within our group  ===== PAGE 27 ===== 26 Telstra Modern Slavery Act Statement 2024 Case study: Fetch TV After acquiring a 51 per cent controlling interest in   Fetch TV in FY23, we consulted with key personnel   to understand its modern slavery risk. We worked with   Fetch TV to put in place additional steps for a plan   which built on its pre-acquisition modern slavery risk  mitigation work. In FY24, we continued to consult with   Fetch TV to support its uplift efforts.  Fetch TV has now: • adopted or aligned the majority of its policies with the  Telstra Group Policies • progressed its implementation of a supplier questionnaire  with questions relating to modern slavery. Fetch TV has  finalised the form of the questionnaire and will roll it out   in FY25  • rolled out modern slavery training to all executives and  managers whose role involves Fetch TV’s supply chain.   This training had a 100 per cent completion rate in FY24 • engaged with its set top box manufacturers (a higher risk  area in its supply chain) to satisfy itself of their modern  slavery risk. Fetch TV confirmed their compliance with  SA8000 standard and reviewed a summary of a JAC audit  relating to one of these suppliers. While the information  provided did not raise any modern slavery concerns, Fetch  TV will work with Telstra to source the full version of the  audit to satisfy itself that the supplier has no corrective  action plans outstanding    • implemented an updated standard agreement for   key areas of the business which contains provisions  addressing modern slavery risk, including where   applicable provisions for site visits and requirements  for audits. These modern slavery-specific provisions  are included in its new contract with a set top box  manufacturer, an area that it identified as having higher  modern slavery risk • set up processes to track completion rates of modern  slavery training.  In FY25, Fetch TV will continue its uplift efforts by: • finalising the implementation of a supplier code of   conduct aligned with Telstra’s Supplier Code of Conduct  • rolling out the new supplier questionnaire to new suppliers  and to existing suppliers at the point in time at which new  terms and conditions of agreement are entered into with  questions relating to modern slavery risk, and embedding   it in its supplier onboarding processes • providing annual refresher training to identified relevant  employees on modern slavery and ensuring that new  employees are trained • ensuring all agreements issued by Fetch TV contain  provisions addressing modern slavery risk, and on a case   by case basis, contracts include terms providing for site  visits and audits • working with Telstra to source the full version of the JAC  audit of its set top box manufacturer to satisfy itself that  the supplier has no corrective action plans outstanding • implementing a process to report compliance breaches  to the applicable management representative, track any  incidences of modern slavery concerns and formally   consult with other entities in the Telstra Group on   modern slavery risk.  ===== PAGE 28 ===== 27 Telstra Modern Slavery Act Statement 2024 Differences in the Telstra Group Certain Reporting Entities and owned or controlled entities in the  Telstra Group are not fully integrated and have taken different  actions to assess and address modern slavery risk. See the  'Consultation' section above for how we address differences in our  owned or controlled entities. Details of the key differences in the  approach of the Reporting Entities are set out below. Telstra Health Who Telstra Health is  • Leading provider of digital health solutions, including clinical  and administrative systems, health data analytics, population  health solutions and information exchange platforms.  • Works with care providers in the hospital, health service,  pharmacy and aged and disability care sectors to connect  health information, clinicians and consumers. • Has a direct workforce of 1,347 people across Australia, India,  the United Kingdom, Canada, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,   the Philippines, Vietnam, Ukraine and Bahrain.  • Has approximately 500 active suppliers located in 22 countries.  • Main categories of spend are contracted workers (mostly  software developers, engineers and data analysts), an  Australian-based contact centre, medical equipment,   IT hardware and spend related to its offices. Telstra Health's modern slavery risks • In FY22, Telstra Health undertook a risk assessment of its  operations and supply chain. • Telstra Health identified the procurement of medical devices  as a higher risk area along with the international operations  (especially in the Middle East) of its owned or controlled  entities. Otherwise, its risk areas are consistent with the   Telstra Group.  • Telstra Health has prioritised medical devices and marketing  merchandise for further due diligence. See ‘Telstra Health’s  FY25 commitments’ below.  • Telstra Health acquired two significant entities with increased  modern slavery risk in FY22: • MedicalDirector develops and supplies practice and clinic  management software solutions and publishes AusDI, an  Australian medical information database. It has certain  outsourced IT development labour arrangements in India,  Vietnam and Ukraine, countries with heightened modern  slavery risk  • PowerHealth develops and supplies cost management  software solutions designed for hospitals and healthcare  providers and operates in higher risk jurisdictions such as  Bahrain and Saudi Arabia as well as lower risk jurisdictions  including Australia and Canada.   How Telstra Health addresses modern slavery risks • Internal policies: Telstra Health has adopted some of the  Telstra Group Policies including the Code, Human Rights  Policy, Supplier Code of Conduct and Whistleblowing Policy.  Telstra Health does not utilise the Telstra Group procurement  function or centralised procurement processes, however it  leverages some Telstra suppliers and contracts for purchases.  • Vendor onboarding: Telstra Health conducts due diligence  on all its suppliers including requiring each new supplier to  complete a questionnaire covering their approach to and  mitigations against modern slavery risks.  In FY24, Telstra Health: • embedded the review and assessment of the modern slavery  questionnaire into its Accounts Payable process by including  this in its new vendor form, and created a more detailed  questionnaire for higher risk suppliers. Payment of suppliers  is contingent on receiving a completed vendor form with no  flags. The detailed questionnaire is provided to international  suppliers and local suppliers that it considers to be high-risk • rolled out an updated vendor form which includes guidelines  on when to use the longform or shortform questionnaire, the  review and escalation process • launched guidance material for its procurement team on  how to assess whether a supplier is high-risk, and set up  quarterly meetings with relevant internal stakeholders to  track completion rates and the effectiveness of the detailed  questionnaire  • issued the detailed questionnaire to all new marketing  merchandise and medical devices suppliers. • Audit: In FY23, Telstra audited one of Telstra Health’s two  marketing merchandise suppliers as part of a broader Telstra  Group-wide audit. In FY24, Telstra Health reviewed the results  of the completed supplier audit. Telstra Health is working with  Telstra to help rectify some issues that were identified. See  ‘Case Study: Improving labour practices in our promotional  products supply chain’ on page 20 for the Telstra Group  response to this audit.   • MedicalDirector: Telstra Health integrated MedicalDirector  into Telstra Health from a policy and governance perspective in  FY23.  • PowerHealth: In FY24, all Australian PowerHealth employees  moved to Telstra Health employment contracts and  PowerHealth adopted Telstra Health internal and supplier- facing policies for domestic operations. PowerHealth will adopt  relevant Telstra Group Policies applicable to its international  operations in FY25.  • Subsidiary uplift: The Telstra Health legal and risk teams  regularly consult with all its subsidiaries on modern slavery risk  to help ensure compliance with Telstra Health’s expectations.  • Specific risk assessments: Telstra Health completed the  risk assessments of both subsidiary groups and found that  they generally have similar risk profiles to Telstra Health.  Exceptions include that PowerHealth procures office services  and accommodation services in Bahrain and accommodation  services in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which Telstra Health  identified as higher risk. In FY25, it will roll out its longform  modern slavery questionnaire to these suppliers to better  assess this risk. PowerHealth and MedicalDirector also  have an indirect workforce of high-skilled professional staff,  and professional services (including recruitment services)  suppliers, in higher risk jurisdictions. Telstra Health has  initiated a review of its recruitment services providers to  confirm they do not engage in any unacceptable recruitment  practices and will continue this monitoring in FY25.   • Training: Telstra Health employees undertake Business  Essentials Training on a yearly basis (and achieved a 100 per  cent completion rate for FY24). Relevant employees undertake  Addressing Modern Slavery Training.  ===== PAGE 29 ===== 28 Telstra Modern Slavery Act Statement 2024 How Telstra Health checks the effectiveness   of its actions • Reports any known or suspected compliance breaches to   the internal Telstra Health risk and legal team and to the   wider Telstra Group as required. • Regularly reviews policies and incorporates supplier and   Telstra feedback into its modern slavery response. • Tracks any complaints received via whistleblowing and   HR mechanisms. • Telstra Health legal and risk teams record and track   material human rights incidents should they arise. • Holds quarterly meetings between the legal, risk and   accounts payable teams to monitor completion of supplier  modern slavery questionnaires, check that all flags are dealt  with and monitor process effectiveness. • Monitors completion rates for relevant training. How Telstra Health consults within its group Telstra Health’s owned or controlled entities were included   in the consultation processes carried out by the broader   Telstra Group. Telstra Health’s progress FY24 commitment Progress Embed review and assessment of the existing modern slavery  questionnaire into its accounts payable process.  Telstra Health embedded the shortform questionnaire into its Accounts  Payable process and launched guidance material on the use of these forms  to its relevant teams. See ‘How Telstra Health addresses its modern slavery  risks’ above for further details. Assess the results of the in-progress audit of one of Telstra  Health’s higher risk suppliers.

Achieved       In progress      Not achieved   ===== PAGE 30 ===== 29 Telstra Modern Slavery Act Statement 2024 Digicel Pacific Who Digicel Pacific is   • Biggest mobile operator in the South Pacific, providing  mobile phone, ICT services and operates telecommunications  infrastructure in the South Pacific region. • Has a direct workforce of approximately 2,000 employees  across Papua New Guinea (PNG), Fiji, Nauru, Samoa, Tonga  and Vanuatu. • Has approximately 1,400 active suppliers located in more   than 47 countries. • Main categories of spend are network equipment, customers’  devices, bandwidth, field operations, electricity and fuel   and logistics services. Digicel Pacific's modern slavery risks This year we completed a modern slavery risk assessment   for Digicel Pacific. The risk assessment used four key modern slavery risk   factors: country/region, categories/sectors, business models   and vulnerable populations to assess where, in relation to   Digicel Pacific’s business units and procurement categories,   there is potential risk of modern slavery practices. Risk areas for Digicel Pacific in its operations are: PNG • Casual employment of child actors for voice over media  content   • Commission based Feet on the Streets (FOTs). These   FOTs are engaged to promote mobile financial services   and assist with customer queries (e.g. SIM registration,  activate mobile wallets) • Workers employed by Digicel Pacific distributors and   their partners and distribution channels (such as  wholesalers and resellers) • Office maintenance and gym trainer contractors • Interns • Workers at Digicel branded retail stores not operated   by Digicel Pacific • Security and IT contingent workforce Hubs (Fiji, Nauru, Samoa, Tonga & Vanuatu) • Workers employed by Digicel Pacific distributors,   wholesale point of sales and resellers • Interns • IT contingent workforce Risk areas for Digicel Pacific in its supply chain are: • Handsets and SIM cards • IT workstations and accessories  • Field Services  • Construction and maintenance of network infrastructure  • Facilities and warehousing  • Media hardware  • Construction related to the Digicel Foundation  • Security  • Logistics • Construction and maintenance of retail stores/kiosks.

Case study: Protecting workers in the security services sector Recently, we investigated whether   a supplier of security services to   Digicel Pacific had complied with the  requirements of Telstra’s Supplier Code  of Conduct, including in relation to  labour practices. The investigation  identified there were areas of concern  and further investigation was required   to make sure the supplier was managing  its workforce in a way that met our  standards. Areas of concern related to  pay rates and late payment, unpaid work,  personal funding of work expenses and  deductions for benefits never received by  workers. Additional areas of concern  related to inadequate training and  resourcing of security guards.  Digicel Pacific is working with the  supplier to remedy any breaches of the  Telstra Supplier Code of Conduct and  will review its processes to address any  learnings to improve how it identifies,  assesses and mitigates risks posed by  its suppliers’ activities.

Versent's modern slavery risks • Telstra acquired the Versent Group in FY24.  • In FY22, Versent assessed its modern slavery risk as   low based on a high-level desktop review of its suppliers.   The review considered Versent’s spend with each supplier   and whether the supplier had published a modern slavery  policy or a modern slavery statement. • Post-acquisition, Telstra has begun a review of Versent’s  policies and processes and will assist Versent with   conducting a more detailed risk assessment in FY25,   to identify its key modern slavery risk areas. How Versent addresses modern slavery risks • Internal policies: Versent adopted Telstra’s Human Rights  Policy, Whistleblowing Policy and the Code in FY24. It is  currently reviewing the Versent Group’s operations to check  compliance with these policies. Versent also has policies  relating to conduct, procurement and grievances in place to  support its modern slavery risk mitigation measures, including  a Grievance Policy.  • Employee management: Versent has a framework in place  to check it complies with labour laws applicable to its direct  employees, including by monitoring hours worked through a  timesheet system in line with applicable law and annual review  of employment contracts to confirm legal compliance. Versent  regularly assesses its compliance with local employment laws  in the jurisdictions it operates, including by engaging external  advisors to assess compliance with law outside Australia. • Contracts: Versent rolled out new standard supply and partner  contracts with specific clauses requiring compliance with  modern slavery legislation. These contracts are used for all  new suppliers and partners, and existing suppliers and partners  roll over to the new standard contracts when their contracts  are renewed.  How Versent checks the effectiveness of   its actions Versent has prioritised putting in place risk mitigation measures  to date and will identify and implement appropriate processes to  measure their effectiveness in FY25. How Versent consults within its group Versent's owned or controlled entities were included in the  consultation processes carried out by the broader Telstra Group. Versent’s progress Prior year commitments Progress Further assess and review Versent’s existing supplier and   partner network’s compliance with the law and their reputation  and issue a supplier/partner questionnaire.     Versent was not able to progress this in FY24. In FY25, it will issue a supplier/ partner questionnaire to enable Versent to perform targeted modern slavery  diligence on its supplier and partner network going forward. Front-end Versent’s awareness of partner and supplier  compliance, amend our current third-party risk assessment   to include questions aimed at uncovering potential modern  slavery and human trafficking issues and eliciting minimum  commitments with respect to ongoing compliance.      Versent discontinued this workstream due to its sale process to Telstra.  Instead, Versent will start the process of aligning its supplier governance  framework with that of the Telstra Group to the extent appropriate in   FY25. It will also implement a supplier/partner questionnaire covering  modern slavery.    Ensure Versent’s policies and recruitment processes are  appropriate to protect against modern slavery and human  trafficking, conduct a review and prepare a first draft of a new  modern slavery policy which will (when finalised) be dispersed   to Versent personnel.   Versent adopted Telstra’s Human Rights Policy, Whistleblowing Policy and  Code of Conduct in FY24. See ‘How Versent addresses modern slavery risks’  above for more details. In FY25, it will review its recruitment processes and  start the process of aligning its supplier governance framework with that of  the Telstra Group to the extent appropriate.

Telstra Group FY24 Commitments Commitment Progress Formally review the Supplier Governance Framework to identify   and address any gaps/learnings from the implementation of the  Framework in FY23.  Using learnings from our FY23 implementation, the Supplier Governance  Framework was updated in FY24.  See the ‘Supplier Governance Framework’ section on page 15 for further detail. Improve our supplier onboarding processes to ensure  consistent review and assessment of supplier responses to   KYS questions, including in relation to labour practices.  We implemented a compliance check process in our KYS platform to improve  how we review and assess our supplier responses in relation to labour  practices.  See the ‘Know Your Supplier Platform’ section on page 16 for further detail. Develop guidance documentation and accompanying training  for contract owners undertaking supplier risk assessments  (which encompass labour practices), to ensure more effective  supplier risk assessments.  We held training sessions in FY24, for our contract owners, on how to  undertake more effective risk assessments and developed accompanying  guidance and resources.  See the ‘Supplier Governance Framework’ section on page 15 for further detail. Incorporate the use of third-party supplier modern slavery risk   profiling into our due diligence processes.  We have implemented a third-party modern slavery risk profile rating in our  KYS platform.   See the ‘Know Your Supplier Platform’ section on page 16 for further detail Update our salient human rights issues assessment.  In FY24, Telstra updated its salient human rights assessment with the help of  an external human rights consultancy. Human rights risks were identified and  assessed for severity and indicative likelihood. Labour rights in the supply  chain continues to be one of Telstra’s salient human rights issues. See the ‘Human rights' section in our 2024 Bigger Picture Sustainability Report  available on our reports page for detail on our updated salient human rights  issues and our response to these.  Develop guidance for our M&A team on human rights issues,   including modern slavery risk, to consider in the M&A process.

Vicki Brady We’ve all experienced the world changing dramatically  in recent years and know the rate of change is only  increasing. The disruption of the next decade is  already on our doorstep – we're all grappling with  macroeconomic headwinds, cost of living challenges,  geopolitical shifts and instability, supply chain  disruption, climate change, rapid technology change  and the growing threat from cyber-crime. We also have a transition and disruption underway in  regional Australia, thanks to COVID-driven migration,  the impacts of a changing climate, and industry  transformation. Telstra is a purpose-led organisation – our role in using  technology to create a more sustainable and inclusive  world underpins all the work we do in order to: •   help ensure communities in cities and   regions prosper  •   transform industries to be more productive,  competitive, and sustainable  •   build foundations to support emerging  technologies that will fuel growth and help  address challenges, like the impacts of   a changing climate.  We see the future as one where connected  technologies and services will provide the foundation  for our economy and our society. The telco industry  is an essential enabler of this future, and we've been  vocal in encouraging our industry to think about the  larger opportunities we can create by working together.  Technologies like machine learning, data and   artificial intelligence, IoT and high-speed networks   can help address many of the challenges our world  is facing – especially as they all work together to  increase their impact. These technologies also need   to be carefully managed to ensure they create positive  change, with minimal negative effects, and the   benefits are shared widely.  This means working closely with our partners to  drive sustainability, and in turn be driven by their  innovations. Collaboration is key to creating a more  sustainable and inclusive world, and we're leveraging  our resources, expertise, and networks to drive  meaningful change beyond our own operations.  We know that we play a role in driving sustainability in  the wider community, and so we actively engage with  customers, employees, suppliers, and stakeholders  to promote sustainable practices and collaborate on  sustainability initiatives.  This report shows how the principles of sustainability  are fundamental to the way we operate.    ” ” Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 4 Sustainabiity at Telstra  ===== PAGE 5 ===== Our commitment and  contribution takes many forms:  Facing climate challenges together  The science is clear. Climate change is adversely  impacting our economy, environment, communities  and individuals. The time to turn things around is now,  and it can be done if we work together. As Australia’s  largest telecommunications provider, we remain  focused on delivering on our climate change and  energy use goals. We are also helping our customers  and society transition to a lower carbon future by  accelerating the adoption of innovative emissions- avoiding technologies.  Designing for a better environment  Each year, we use 970,000 kilograms worth of  packaging to deliver our products to customers.  As we move towards being more sustainable and  environmentally aware, this is an area where we can  continue to make significant impact with some small  changes. In FY23, we achieved our goal of having  all Telstra branded packaging made of renewable or  recycled material and fully recyclable. These changes  to packaging are just the start for us – we’re also  aiming to recycle or reuse over 650,000 phones,  modems and other devices each year to 2025.   Our second goal is to increase our network waste  recycling rate to 90 per cent by 2025. Leading the way with reconciliation   and inclusion  We recognise and accept that we've not always   lived up to the ambition in our vision for reconciliation.  In our Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) launched in  July 2022, we talk about our past mistakes, how our  previous RAP was revoked, and the comprehensive  corrective steps we've taken in response to  inappropriate selling to Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander customers. The RAP also includes wide  ranging initiatives to improve connectivity, to build  cultural awareness amongst our people, and increase  employment and procurement opportunities for  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This is  all part of getting us back on the right path. Telstra  supports the Uluru Statement from the Heart, which  calls for the establishment of a First Nations Voice to  Parliament in the Australian Constitution. Guided by  our First Nations Strategy, we're taking a leadership  position in educating our people on the Voice to  Parliament, to increase understanding and recognition  of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures,  histories, knowledge, and rights.   Advancing online safety, privacy and security  Cyber-crime is on the rise, but so are the cyber security  and safety capabilities developed by us, our peers and  government. We know that it’s critical we take action  to help our customers trust in the connectivity we  provide, so we’re driven every day to help make digital  experiences safer. This has included reviewing and  changing how we retain personal ID data, and joining  forces with CBA to help protect customers from phone  scams. We’ve also blocked hundreds of millions of  scam calls and texts from reaching our customers  each year. We recently introduced a way for Telstra  customers who receive scam texts to forward them to  7226 (SCAM) to help us identify and block emerging  scam techniques. Building partnerships to collectively   drive change  Our strategic partnership with Microsoft was   expanded into a five-year agreement to drive  growth and value for customers and Australia as a  nation. We're working together to boost Microsoft’s  connectivity on Telstra’s leading Asia-Pacific subsea  cable network, harness cloud capabilities and  collaborate on new product offerings and future  ways of working. Our collaborations aim to improve  sustainability outcomes in Australia and enable Telstra  to meet its own commitments. We also announced a  deal with Quantium in December 2022 to form a new  venture aligned to Telstra’s T25 strategy, which will  help unlock the value of data and artificial intelligence  for Telstra and its customers. Working to build digital inclusion  While the digital economy is generating incredible  social, cultural and economic benefits for many  Australians, these benefits are not being shared  equally. Too many Australians, and particularly those  in vulnerable circumstances, are at risk of being left  behind in the digital age, thus becoming even more  marginalised. The challenges and barriers to increased  digital inclusion need to be addressed by us all,  including governments and businesses, communities  and individuals. Telstra contributes to meeting this  challenge by building access through our network  investment, ensuring affordable products and services  are available, and supporting a range of programs to  build digital skills, particularly for people aged over  65 and First Nations communities who are among the  least digitally included Australians.  Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 5 Sustainabiity at Telstra  ===== PAGE 6 ===== Providing more coverage to more people in  regional and remote places  As the digital world continues to transform the  way we live and work, having access to reliable  telecommunications, whether through mobile  networks, broadband, or satellite services is critical.  Our mobile footprint stretches across more than   2.7 million square kilometres – around 1 million square  kilometres more mobile network coverage than our  nearest competitor – and reaches 99.6 per cent of the  Australian population. Over the seven years to the  end of FY22, Telstra invested $11 billion in our mobile  network nationally with $4 billion of this invested  in our regional mobile network. We also continue to  participate in co-investment programs, including  drawing upon the $200 million co-investment fund   (for FY22-26) that we announced in May 2021.  Supporting our communities during times   of critical need  As well as serving the community, we're a part of  it. We’re proud of our track record in helping our  customers through the good times and the not so  good. We understand the importance of communities  needing access to network connectivity, especially   in times of crisis. That's why we work extensively   to prepare for disaster seasons. In FY23, our priorities  continued to be ensuring the safety of our people,  protecting and maintaining our infrastructure,   keeping our customers connected and providing   short and long-term assistance measures. We are  also offer international relief packages, helping our  customers stay in touch with friends and family   who are experiencing natural disasters or living in   a conflict zone. We are also committed to helping  people facing cost-of-living pressures by continuing   to offer a range of products, services and programs   to support customers experiencing temporary hardship  or longer-term financial challenges. Lastly, our contribution includes an   ongoing commitment to transparency   and transformation We continue to proudly support the United Nations  Sustainable Development Goals and make progress  towards them. We're a signatory to the United Nations  Global Compact (UNGC) and we are engaged in  supporting its principles – on human rights, labour  rights, environment and anti-corruption – wherever   we operate.  We work to ensure our business and   our business partners operate with respect for   human rights and report our progress in our annual  Human Rights and Modern Slavery Statement.   We continue to align our climate change reporting   with the recommendations of the Taskforce on  Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD),  integrating this disclosure into our Annual Report   for the first time this year as a part of building  readiness for upcoming mandatory reporting of  sustainability-related financial disclosures.  We choose to make these contributions because  they will help us create positive outcomes for all  our stakeholders – outcomes that are long term,  sustainable and transformative. It means holding  ourselves to a higher standard and getting the basics  right in all aspects of our operations. We recognise   our success is intrinsically linked to the digital  economy, and that our support helps it grow and  deliver on its potential for the nation.  We continue to be proud of our progress, and our  increasing pace, in shaping Telstra as a responsible  business and a sustainable and community-driven  organisation. The challenges we face continue to  evolve, but our commitment to face them head on is  strong and resilient.   We hope you enjoy reading about our progress and  welcome your feedback.

A detailed program of work has been launched to align  environment data processes and controls with the aim to quantitatively disclose the Digicel Pacific impact in our FY24 reporting. 3   This is significantly ahead of the trajectory required to reach our target of 50 per cent by 2030, however there is still some risk relating to the scope 3 target   – see the Understanding our climate risk section of our 2023 Annual Report for more information.  4   In addition, we have now contracted renewable energy volumes equivalent to over 80 per cent of our consumption. There is a risk that the operational output  of those projects will not reach the equivalent of 100 per cent of our consumption by the end of 2025. At this stage we believe it is more likely than not that this  target will be achieved by that date. See the Understanding our climate risk section of our 2023 Annual Report for more information. 5   The Digicel Pacific acquisition closed in FY23. Digicel Pacific has been excluded from Telstra’s circular economy reporting in FY23 as we have not yet been able  to compile timely and suitable data. A detailed program of work has commenced with the aim of progressively reporting relevant Digicel Pacific circular economy  data in future periods.  6   From September 2023, we are increasing our device recycling target to reuse or recycle 650,000 mobile phones, modems and other devices each year to 2025 (our  previous target was 500,000 each year).  7  From September 2023, we are increasing our network waste recycling rate target to 90 per cent by 2025 (our previous target was 85 per cent by 2025).

We believe every company  has a responsibility to operate sustainably and  actively consider the impact it creates for customers,  communities and the environment. This is why ‘doing  business responsibly’ is one of the key pillars in our  T25 strategy and the foundation of our refreshed  sustainability strategy.   Our purpose is to build a connected future so   everyone can thrive. This underpins our belief that  Telstra has a real opportunity to play a leadership   role in creating a more sustainable and inclusive world.  We are harnessing technology to create a better digital  world and minimise our impact on the planet, as well   as helping our customers, our suppliers and Australia   do the same.

In 2023,   we refreshed our SDG alignment and identified eight  SDG priorities. These SDGs reflect the sustainability  areas Telstra is best placed to contribute to,  given our role as a large employer and a leading  telecommunications and technology provider.   In 2023, we have been trialling new ways of embedding  sustainability into our business, our decision making  and our culture. We know that building organisational  resilience and capacity to respond to emerging  challenges will position us well to anticipate and  manage the future risk landscape more effectively.   It accelerates innovation by driving the development  of new products, services and solutions that lead to  new customers and market opportunities. As a purpose  driven organisation, it helps attract and retain the   best talent, builds our reputation and strengthens   our stakeholder relationships. For more information on how we are contributing   to the SDGs through our work, please see the  Contributing to the Sustainable Development   Goals: In focus paper and 2023 Data Pack available   on our reports page.  We're managing sustainability at Telstra by: •  Doing better as a business – delivering on   our commitment to do business responsibly  and being transparent, ethical and accountable,  wherever we operate.  •  Doing better for communities – technology  connects us all. We are working to create a better  digital world by leveraging our advanced network  and technology capabilities to connect people and  support them to access the skills and tools to get  the most out of their tech and stay safe online.   •  Doing better by the environment – we take bold  climate action, protect nature and biodiversity and  contribute to a circular economy. We work with our  customers and suppliers to minimise the impact   of climate change and enable the transition to a  low-carbon future.

Social and environmental  partnerships In place for over a decade, Telstra’s social and  environmental partnerships have delivered critical  business objectives, community outcomes and  employment opportunities. We continue to work with  supplier enterprises that support people with disability  or people experiencing disadvantage. This year, our  Supported Workforce Program created opportunities  for 155 people who performed cleaning and grounds  maintenance activities at 5,080 sites across the  nation. Our Indigenous Workforce Program (IWP)  also continues to deliver results with around 40 First  Nations enterprises undertaking maintenance at over  1,500 regional and remote sites. Our FY23 spend across  the cleaning and grounds vendors was $3.09 million. In FY23 we also spent over $20 million with over 30  First Nations businesses, certified or registered by  Supply Nation, further improving on our last year's  spend of $14 million. We continue to build our strategy  at a category level and actively work with our strategic  partners to promote supplier diversity more broadly  throughout our supply chain.  We also actively work with our suppliers to gain better  insights into our emissions and identify reduction  opportunities. We have partnered with CDP through  their Supply Chain Program to engage our suppliers  to more effectively account for and address their  climate change impacts.  This partnership enables us  to deliver training, tools and support on environmental  disclosures to over 400 suppliers, an increase from  approximately 200 suppliers in 2022. This covers   80 per cent of our spend. See the Taking bold climate  action section of this report to learn more.  We also work with various partners to improve our use  of resources, reduce waste going to landfill and create  innovative solutions to reduce our environmental  impact across the lifecycle of our networks and  products. See the Progressing a circular economy   section of this report to learn more.

This involves multiple programs and initiatives  including a focus on the needs of First Nations  customers and communities in remote areas.  Underpinning our First Nations strategy is   strong internal and external governance. Reconciliation Our vision for reconciliation will be achieved by  embedding reconciliation outcomes and system  changes into our organisation. This involves working  with First Nations peoples and harnessing the  strengths of our organisation to build digital   futures, providing employment opportunities to   lift economic participation and making Telstra a  culturally inclusive and engaged organisation. In July 2022, we launched our fifth Reconciliation  Action Plan (RAP). The RAP outlines more than   90 actions built around better connectivity, digital  literacy, employment, training and more spending   with First Nations businesses. Our RAP is based on   a theme of truth telling, which is a fundamental   starting point for reconciliation and we have   committed to some important steps to talk about   our past and the impact of our decisions on First  Nations people. We also outline our commitment to   the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full. For more information on our commitment and   action towards reconciliation, please see our   2022-2025 Stretch Reconciliation Action Plan.   First Nations   Voice to Parliament  Telstra accepts the invitation of the Uluru Statement  from the Heart, to walk with First Nations people in a  movement of the Australian people for a better future.   Securing a First Nations Voice to Parliament is the   first of three actions called for by the Uluru Statement.  Telstra believes that a First Nations Voice enshrined  in the Australian constitution ensures First Nations  peoples’ experiences and perspectives are included   in the development of policies and laws that affect  their communities. Truth Telling at National  Communications Museum Telstra is funding a new research project that  will acknowledge the full history of the Overland  Telegraph Line (OTL). The research is part of our  commitment to truth telling and is included in  our 2022-2025 RAP.   This First Nations led project, through the  National Communications Museum (NCM)  and supported by Professor Marcia Langton  AO, Associate Provost, Melbourne University,  will use archival material and community  consultation to document the impact on First  Nations people, in the construction of the OTL.  The project outcome will be a short film and a  comprehensive guide to the way the film was  made, highlighting the strength of culturally  respectful, collaborative and community-led  methodologies.  Reconciliation and   First Nations advocacy Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 21 Doing business responsibly  ===== PAGE 22 ===== Fair and transparent   products and services Customer experience In FY23, we continued our emphasis on the  importance of experience for our customers,  as reflected in one of the strategic pillars for  our T25 strategy, ‘an exceptional customer  experience you can count on.’ A key aspect   of this is designing and measuring customer  experience to ensure our customers can  access and use the best products and  services when and where they need them. Customer experience   built into design Our Customer Experience (CX) Design Framework   is a set of 16 principles that defines what good,   better and brilliant experiences look like for Telstra  customers and underpins key product experience  investment decisions. The framework helps our teams design customer- centric products and services, focusing on  sustainability and accessibility, to create offers   that are responsible and easy to understand.   We continue to evolve the framework, making   multiple updates to standards and further   embedding them in key governance processes.  We embed the framework in our operations by   utilising a CX assessment tool. The tool guides   teams through a series of prompts where they  articulate how their activity meets our CX principles.  With a few exceptions, all activities that have  an impact on our customers must complete this  assessment. In September 2022, the framework   was used to assess the experience of all our   products currently in market and helped inform  roadmaps for an improved customer experience.    Connecting Telstra leaders to  customers and frontline teams In March 2022, we launched the Experience Connect  portal to connect Telstra's leaders with our customers  and frontline teams. The portal is a one-stop shop for  leaders to easily access synthesised customer data and  research, curated with relevant insights, engagement  opportunities and actionable pathways. In FY23,  we made improvements to the portal including the  introduction of several new immersion opportunities  for our leaders. In Q1, Experience Connect was short- listed for the Ashton Media CX Awards Best Employee  Experience Initiative. Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 22 Doing business responsibly  ===== PAGE 23 ===== Measuring customer experience     We measure customer experience using the Net  Promoter Score (NPS) system. NPS enables us to  measure our customers’ experiences and respond   to their feedback. We measure NPS in two ways:  1.  Strategic NPS is a measure of customers' feedback  on their overall perceptions of and experience with  Telstra, relative to experiences they have with other  organisations, including competitors.  2.  Episode NPS measures feedback from customers   in relation to a specific service experience othey   have with Telstra, such as moving home or  connecting a service.  This year, we improved our Group Episode NPS by   6 points and finished at +43, exceeding our +40   target. Positive movements were observed across   all episodes in FY23 for both Consumer Small   Business and Enterprise segments.  Both Consumer and Small and Medium Businesses  achieved historic highs this year, but we did see  softening in the last quarter due to the challenging  macro-economic environment and recent price  rise communications, which impacted customers’  perceptions on seeing Telstra as worth what they   pay for.  The Enterprise segment experienced changes to the  service model which impacted their results, recording  a nine point drop in the first half of the financial year,  only starting to recover slowly in the second half of  the financial year. Our Group Strategic NPS for FY23  improved +4 points.   Design and accessibility  excellence  Telstra's accessibility program is committed to   creating a more inclusive future so everyone can   thrive. We believe it is our responsibility to ensure   our experiences are accessible and inclusive, rather  than burdening users to find workarounds. As our program expands, we continue to improve  existing initiatives associated with digital accessibility  and expanded our research and training programs. Digital accessibility  This year, we expanded our team of accessibility  specialists. Now, 40 of our team are people living   with a disability. This dedicated capability resulted in  our core digital assets achieving Band 1 Accessibility  Maturity Scores, which means more than 90 per cent  defects found have been fixed. The Accessibility  Maturity Scoring system allows us to continuously  monitor the maturity of each digital asset and target  training and resources where needed. We pair this data  with results from our major audits, using third-party  vendors to provide us with certification. This year,  the MyTelstra app maintained a Website Compliance  Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 level A/AA  certification, while our Telstra.com.au website   achieved WCAG 2.1 level A certification. This year, we placed an emphasis on ensuring all  customer documents are accessible. We improved  5 million dynamic invoices for consumers, 15,000  documents for Enterprise customers each month   and remediated and republished 1,200 legacy  documents on our website. Additionally, we ensured  that approximately 700 new static documents met  WCAG AA standards. Our brand refresh played a key role in improving  accessibility by introducing a new set of inclusive  colours, a custom font designed specifically for   people with dyslexia, low vision and cognitive  impairments, along with several other design traits  aligned with our branding guidelines. These new   design guidelines were tested with people living   with disability and shared with disability advocacy  groups for feedback and input. Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 23 Doing business responsibly  ===== PAGE 24 ===== Research and testing Our ‘push left’ initiative embeds accessibility  interventions into the beginning of the product   cycle and improves accessibility through more   rigorous testing and research methodologies. We   also introduced ‘People with Disability’ personas,  which aligns with a needs-based servicing model and  has enabled us to identify user communication needs  sooner, even before the design phase. Additionally,   our accessibility automation tool has allowed us to   test at scale, identifying 20-30 per cent of defects  earlier in the research and testing process. Lastly,   we have empowered our designers to conduct their  own user testing. Currently, 19 per cent of user testing  participants are people living with disability.  In FY23, we updated our procurement processes,  systems and templates to provide the necessary  guidance and rigour to ensure compliance.   Specifically, our tendering materials – e.g. Request   for Proposal (RFP) and Request for Tender (RFT),  now contain accessibility standards and requirements  in line with the Australian ISO standard AS EN 301  549, which specifies accessibility requirements for  Information Communication Technology (ICT)   products and services. Our Telstra Service Agreement  (TSA) template also contains appropriate base  contractual clauses. Training and support This year, we continued our work to federate  accessibility and inclusive skills through a series of  40 online modules and facilitated training sessions  to up-skill our designers developers and staff in other  product design roles. Each module was designed to  provide general disability awareness, combined with  role-specific skills.  In addition to our core training programs, we   developed custom modules to enhance the skills   of Telstra employees in creating accessible documents  and presentations using Word, PowerPoint and  InDesign. Additionally, we provided training on Easy  Reading and Plain Language to our content writers   and Accessibility team, integrating these practices   into our content guidelines.  We continued our Inclusive Tech Lab this year,  engaging 1,000 senior members of Telstra in  experiences that simulated disabilities and   showcased how technology and design can   both help and hinder accessibility.  For more information on accessibility, please   see the Supporting our customers section of   this report. Products and plans  We’re committed to helping Australians get the most  out of connectivity, whether at home, at work or on  the go. To enable this, we focus on delivering products  and plans that meet the needs of our customers while  being transparent about changes in service and pricing. From 4 July 2023, we increased prices on our   in-market post-paid mobile and data plans in line   with the Consumer Price Index (CPI), rounded to   the nearest dollar. This means a monthly increase   of between $3 to $6, depending on the plan.  We know price rises can be hard for some people,  especially when cost of living pressures are high.   We will continue to provide options for customers  to help them manage their mobile plan costs. This  includes the ability to bundle mobile and data plans   for better value, the ability to pay less with Telstra   Plus points, as well as the ability to trade in old   devices and get credit on a Telstra account. We’ve   also increased concession discounts for eligible  customers affected by these changes. Moreover,  the Telstra Top-up program, in partnership with  Infoxchange, provides complimentary mobile credit  recharges to pre-paid customers doing it tough.  As our customers’ home and work lives increasingly  converge, Internet connectivity is more important   than ever. Our Internet Optimiser lets customers  prioritise what matters most on their network. It’s  included at no extra cost for Telstra NBN customers  with a compatible Smart Modem. For more information on how we support customers  when times are tough, please see the Supporting our  customers section of this report.  User testing with people   with disability We work directly with people living with  disability. This includes user testing that  provides feedback straight to the designers  and stakeholders and goes well above WCAG  standards. For example, user testing with  people living with visual impairments provided  critical insights about how to improve video  transcripts to make them more useful. We  also experimented with ways to make digital  experiences accessible to individuals who  face limitations interacting with non-digital  environments. Applying techniques like ‘The  Wizard of Oz’ and tactile wireframes allowed   us to include individuals with visual impairments  in the process. Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 24 Doing business responsibly  ===== PAGE 25 ===== Trust and reputation Our goal, to grow trust and operate responsibly, is  one of the foundations of our reputation. Having a  positive reputation is fundamental to achieving our  T25 growth ambitions, meeting the expectations  of our shareholders and customers and attracting  and retaining the best talent. We use the reputation  measurement platform RepTrak to understand how  customers and the broader community think and feel  about us. The model tracks a range of drivers including  innovation, conduct, products and services and  citizenship to provide data and insights that help   us better serve our customers and stakeholders. In 2023, we increased our RepTrak reputation score   by 1.3 points from 62.2 to 63.5, for a total uplift of   2.2 points from our FY21 baseline of 61.3. This keeps   us on track to achieve our goal to uplift scores by at  least 4 to 7 points by FY25. Improving our approach   to responsible selling Maintaining fair sales practices and ensuring we  provide products and information to customers  responsibly is extremely important to us. In most  cases, our sales ecosystem works well. However,   when we become aware of issues that affect our  customers, we resolve to listen to their feedback.   We want to ensure our processes and policies, as   well as the actions of our people, reflect our  commitment to learn from our mistakes, listen   to feedback and continually improve. We seek to find a balance between what customers  want, need and can comfortably commit to. In FY23,  we continued to engage in responsible sales and  affordability conversations with customers and took  steps to embed this approach through ongoing   training for our frontline employees.  Our approach is supported by tools, processes and  systems so customers can understand their spend  limit. For example, when a customer is not eligible   to buy a specific device on repayment due to a spend  limit, we will offer them options, including buying the  device outright, making a part payment upfront to  reduce the monthly repayment terms or purchasing   a plan only. Customers are also able to trade-in   old devices.  For more information on affordability and how we  support customers in vulnerable circumstances,   please see the Supporting our customers section of  this report. We also continue to implement mandatory training  courses including, but not limited to; ‘Customers in  Vulnerable Circumstances‘, ‘Responsible Business’   and ‘Priority Assistance’ for our people who serve or  sell to consumer or small business customers. Frontline  employees who fail to complete the training within the  required timeframe are suspended from accessing our  core systems. This ensures that only trained staff sell  to and serve customers. First Nations Connect  This year, our First Nations Connect Hotline  celebrated its second birthday. The First Nations  Connect Hotline is a dedicated ‘1800’ phone line  and service centre that was set up to assist our  First Nations and remote customers. The centre is  currently based in Darwin and all agents along with  the leadership team are of Aboriginal and/or Torres  Strait Islander descent. The First Nations Connect  Hotline has access to interpreter services with  approximately 50 different First Nations languages  and dialects. The team listens to and understands  the needs of customers and works to deliver an  exceptional, tailored experience. While our First Nations Connect team continued to  grow this year, we also entered a partnership with  the Queensland Government to set up micro call  centres in First Nations communities in Far North  Queensland. This will create local employment  opportunities and support self-sustained local  businesses. The first micro call centres will be  set up on Palm Island and Jumbun in FY24, in  partnership with the Palm Island Community  Company (PICC) and Jumbun Limited. Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 25 Doing business responsibly  ===== PAGE 26 ===== When we don't get it right  It is important that we provide our customers with  products and services that are safe, easy to understand  and meet their underlying needs. To help ensure  customers are treated fairly, including those in  vulnerable circumstances, our Telstra Chief Customer  Advocate works across Telstra and aims to ensure the  voice of the customer is considered in the design of  products and processes and to enhance our customer  experience and complaint resolution.  We acknowledge that sometimes we don’t deliver   the experience our customers deserve. We’re  continuously working to improve our performance   and engage openly with regulators in industry wide  audits and investigations and proactively report to  regulators when we find we’ve failed to meet our  regulatory obligations and had a significant impact   on our customers.    Responding to industry  wide audits    In May 2023, the Australian Communications and  Media Authority (ACMA) published its research   report on financial hardship in the telco sector.   Telstra provided information to ACMA as an input   into the research report. The report found that  the telco sector has some way to go to meet the  reasonable expectations of consumers facing hardship.  We know that some of our customers experience  financial hardship and they may need assistance from  us, such as arrangements to help them pay their bills.  We understand how important it is to help these  customers meet their financial obligations and to   stay connected. For this reason, we continue to offer   a range of products, services and programs to help  keep these customers connected and afford the  products and services they need. We know further   work is required, so we’re committed to helping   people facing cost-of-living pressures.  For more information on affordability and how we  support customers in vulnerable circumstances,   please see the Supporting our customers section   of this report. Proactive self-reporting  Even when we think our systems and processes are  working as expected, there is always a chance that  things do not go as planned. As a large company, we  recognise that our errors can impact many customers  and, in some instances, have a significant impact on  a group of customers. This is especially serious when  customers in vulnerable circumstances are affected.  Where we identify a significant issue, we self-report   to our regulators in line with community expectations  and our obligations. For example, we self-reported   to ACMA after we found that we had not followed  aspects of our Priority Assistance Policy. Following  ACMA’s investigation of the issue and subsequent  findings, they accepted an Enforceable Undertaking  from us to implement remedial actions designed  to rectify the failings which related to the provision  of information about Priority Assistance to eligible  customers. We continue to report regularly to the  ACMA on our progress. In another example, we self-reported incorrect credit  management actions we had identified. The ACMA  found that we had not fully complied with clause   7.7 of the Telecommunications Consumer Protection  (TCP) Code, requiring suppliers to suspend credit  management actions for arrangements covered under  financial hardship policies and in August 2022 issued  us with a direction to comply with this provision. We continue to review all elements of our business,  address issues as we find them and proactively report  issues to ACMA to strengthen our operations. Telecommunications  Industry Ombudsman   (TIO) complaints In an industry as complex as ours, things sometimes  go wrong. When they do, we work with customers to  resolve issues as quickly as possible. If the customer  remains dissatisfied with the response, external  dispute resolution can be accessed through an industry  funded scheme: the Telecommunications Industry  Ombudsman (TIO).  In FY23, we continued to see reductions in complaints  escalated to the TIO. Following the reduction of TIO  referral complaints by 40 per cent in FY22, we achieved  35 per cent this financial year and remain committed  to reducing the drivers of customer dissatisfaction and  aim to reduce TIO referral complaint volumes further.  In FY21, we set the ambition to halve TIO complaints  by FY25. Through a strong focus on addressing the root  cause of complaints and initiatives such as insourcing  our retail network and simplification of our products  and services, we have seen a significant improvement  in our customer service and a reduction of complaints  to the TIO. Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 26 Doing business responsibly  ===== PAGE 27 ===== Ethical   supply chain Working with our suppliers In FY23, Telstra Group engaged directly with more than  5,800 suppliers from 92 countries and approximately  78 per cent of the total spend was with our top 100  suppliers. Our direct (tier 1) suppliers often have many  suppliers of their own, who then also rely on their own  suppliers. These indirect suppliers who are also known  as tier 2, tier 3 and tier 4 suppliers also contribute  significantly to Telstra’s large and complex supply chain.   To mitigate the risk presented by the indirect delivery  partner service model, we have implemented a range  of procedures and programs to ensure the high labour  management standards we expect are being met.   Our Supplier Code of Conduct sets out the minimum  standards we expect from our suppliers and forms   part of our standard purchasing terms. Through our  policies, Supplier Governance Framework, training   and audit program, we work with our suppliers to  assess whether they are meeting our standards.   Our SCOC is aligned with 10 universally accepted  principles of the UN Global Compact, Responsible  Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct and Joint  Alliance for CSR (JAC) Supply Chain Sustainability  Guidelines, as well as legislative obligations such as  the UK MSA and the Australian MSA.   Our Know Your Supplier platform (KYS), is a secure  web-based platform targeting domestically contracted  suppliers which we engage regularly. The KYS platform  provides a central repository for suppliers to respond to  Telstra’s questions about the 12 supplier risk categories  and monitors onboarded suppliers against public  records, including media reports and civil litigation,  regulatory, criminality and bankruptcy checks. In FY23 we matured our Know Your Supplier (KYS)  processes to drive better governance of supplier risk  and increase the number of suppliers onboarded via  KYS. As of 30 June 2023, we have onboarded 1,204  suppliers on the KYS platform, up from 1,055 in  FY22. Of these, 53 per cent have completed the KYS  Questionnaire, up from 38 per cent completed in FY22. Every year we apply our risk-based approach to help  us identify suppliers for site audits. Site audits include  and align with industry standards such as those set by  Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and Joint Alliance  for CSR (JAC) for onsite compliance verification and  effective, shareable audits. The audits are conducted  using independent auditors and focus on health and  safety, environment, human rights including labour  rights and modern slavery indicators and business  ethics. Site audits also include worker interviews.  This year 41 sites across 16 suppliers were selected   to complete site audits by independent auditors.   These audits identified 239 priority and major findings.  Ninety-five per cent of sites, or 88 per cent of  suppliers, audited had priority or major findings. Health  and safety and working hours are the most common  areas of concern. In FY23, 116 corrective actions  relating to the priority and major findings reported in  this and previous years’ audits were closed. For more information on our supplier spend, where  we source our products and services, as well as our  supply chain risk areas, grievance mechanisms and  remediation practices, please see our 2023 Human  Rights and Modern Slavery Act Statement available  on our reports page.   Supplier diversity: Coast   to coast with Kooya Fleet We are proud to partner with Supply Nation   certified supplier Kooya Fleet Solutions, Australia’s  largest Aboriginal-owned Fleet Management company.  At the inception of the commercial arrangement, Kooya  joined our fleet finance and leasing panel, growing from  20 vehicles in FY18 to over 1,400 vehicles nationwide  in FY23. The partnership continues to develop in  conjunction with our First Nations procurement  strategy, expanding their offering to novated leasing  services for Telstra employees. This has generated an  additional $1 million in revenue in FY23 for Kooya,   with projections to more than double this in FY24.   Read more in our article on Telstra Exchange. Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 27 Doing business responsibly  ===== PAGE 28 ===== Our people  Building culture and  capabilities Sustainable engagement Our workplace culture is a critical enabler for us to  deliver on our purpose and business strategy and is  underpinned by a strong commitment to our values.  We measure employee engagement through our  Experience Pulse, which provides insights into how  our people feel about their experience of working at  Telstra. In FY23, we engaged a new survey provider  who provides greater language processing capability  to deepen our understanding of the experience of  our people.  We set an ambitious target to achieve an  annual employee engagement in the 90th percentile  for global companies, which equates to an engagement  score of 82. We finished FY23 with an engagement  score of 80 which means we didn’t meet our target,  but this still puts us above the global 75th per cent  employee engagement and on track to achieve our   T25 objective of 82.  Throughout the year, our employees told us that  they highly value flexibility (including the ability to  choose when and where they work, and the work- life balance opportunities provided) and the strong  working relationships that they have with their people  leader and the team of people they work with day to  day. The focus on our people and workplace strategies  (including our flexibility policies, our ways of working,  employee wellbeing and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion  (DE&I) initiatives) comes through strongly in our  engagement survey results and are known to create  positive experiences for our people. We also identified areas that we can focus on to  improve our employees’ engagement and experience  at work. Our people want to know more about our T25  strategy and how we’ll achieve our ambitions. They also  told us we need to keep simplifying our processes and  how our work is organised, so it’s easy for them to do  their job well. To address the feedback from employees, we  prioritised actions for leaders at all levels of the  organisation in order to make Telstra the place they  want to work. In addition to the localised actions team  leaders have committed to, we developed a set of  company and function-wide action plans to improve  persistent issues impacting engagement. For example,  we are investing in AI-driven talent technology to help  people identify potential career paths and promoting  job mobility and upskilling to improve how we support  people to build unique and fulfilling careers. This  ongoing work has been communicated to all employees  and is being led and tracked by our Senior Leadership  teams to the completion of T25. Additionally, through feedback from employees on   our current culture we identified three areas where   we wish to drive change over the next few years and   are developing a program of actions for employees   and leaders around three culture areas:  •  ensuring team members intimately understand   our customers’ world •  driving accountability and achievement on our  priorities •  ensuring we show up as one Telstra team through  effective cross-team and cross-functional  collaboration.  Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 28 Doing business responsibly  ===== PAGE 29 ===== Flexible working  Our employees continue to value our market-leading  approach to hybrid working. We recognise our  commitment to flexibility is a significant drawcard   for us with our ‘remote possible’ job ads receiving   2.4 times the applications compared with our   onsite/hybrid ads. Our employee engagement surveys tell us that when  our people have the flexibility to manage their work  and home commitments, they are more engaged and  feel a greater sense of belonging. Our Agile ways of  working have allowed us to manage work via outcomes  delivered through team prioritisation and collaboration.   Our workplaces are an ecosystem of hubs, developed  in response to the changing needs of our people who  no longer wish to work in the same way they once  did. We are responding to evolving work habits by  creating spaces that foster social connections and  collaboration, but also support our people’s desire to  work flexibly where possible.  We applied external research and insights from our  surveys to create guidelines and behaviours to help  people embrace hybrid working. We implemented  shorter default meetings via Outlook and organisation- wide meeting-free times and integrated wellbeing   into technology with Headspace, virtual commute   and focus time on MS Teams.  We will continue evolving our approach to hybrid   work based on insights from our people and how   we can support them to be engaged, productive and  collaborative. We want to understand more about  how hybrid working and our physical workplace can  contribute positively to our culture by enhancing  belonging and growth for our people and   effectiveness for our teams. Learning and capability To build the capability to deliver our ambitions  to create a workplace where people are engaged,  productive and collaborative, we invested $20 million  in training and development in FY23, with an additional  $3.5 million invested in our Future Ready program.  Within the total investment of $23.5 million, there   was over $6.9 million invested in technology training  and $6.2 million in leadership training.  We invested $6.3 million in developing critical  capability in the areas of Human-Centred design,  Gallup Strengths Teaming, High Performance  Mindfulness, Industry masterclasses and the   Future Ready curriculum, along with $1 million   for all company access to LinkedIn learning. Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 29 Doing business responsibly  ===== PAGE 30 ===== Continued investment   in technical skills Over the past year, we have continued to invest in our  employees by building new technical skill programs   for Software Engineering, Data and Analytics and  Cyber Security including skills assessments and  Capstone projects. We built and deployed our first  virtual internships in Cyber Security Malware and  Software Engineering in partnership with Forage.   This is a four-to-five-hour practical immersion for  current university, TAFE and high school students  and anyone considering changing their career. We  had 3,200 enrolments for Cyber Security and 2,133  enrolments in Software Engineering. It is at no cost   for the student and available globally.  We launched Achieve Business Excellence, a skills  program to drive operational excellence in maintaining  or enhancing business performance. It includes  two new credentials developed in partnership with  the University of Melbourne: Process Thinking &  Improvement and Managing Strategic Performance.  Over 2,500 employees have now been issued  micro-credentials across Data & Analytics, Product  Management, Security, Innovation & Entrepreneurship  and Process Thinking & Improvement or Managing  Strategic Performance.  We also invested over $2 million in FY23 in digital  learning platforms to build cloud, data, cyber security,  software engineering and network skills with over  80,000 hours of consumed learning across videos,  books, labs, live experiences, exam practice and digital  testing environments. We spent over $1 million on  upskilling our technical workforce in vendor training  and technologies including VMWare, Red Hat, AWS,  Microsoft and Cisco. Building a high-performance  culture We continue to embed our annual and quarterly  planning and performance approach to deliver on  company level objectives and key results (OKRs).  Company level OKRs provide clarity of prioritised   work so we can be more responsive to customer   needs. It also means we stop or pause work that  doesn’t align to our priorities, so we stay focused  on the work that will have the greatest impact. Our  people’s strengths in various skills and capabilities  guide the prioritisation of work to which they are  allocated. We encourage our people to have regular,  at minimum quarterly conversations with their  leaders about how they have performed against their  OKRs, about their development/career needs and  feedback from peers. We continue to invest in our  leaders’ capability to ensure these conversations are  meaningful and effective.   Our pay-for-performance philosophy means that at  the end of the financial year, our people receive an  individual performance rating based on their outcomes  and behaviours. These performance ratings are an  important input to Fixed and Incentive pay outcomes  for the majority of our people.  For more information on our remunerations, please   see our 2023 Remuneration Report, which forms part   of our 2023 Annual Report. Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 30 Doing business responsibly  ===== PAGE 31 ===== Diversity, equity and inclusion  Every day, Telstra provides services to millions of  customers from diverse backgrounds. We believe that  everyone deserves to be respected for their differences,  valued for their contributions, celebrated for being  their authentic self and can reach their full potential.  We are building diverse teams and creating inclusive  environments to enable our employees to be their   best, which enables us to provide better service   to our customers and community.  Our diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) ambitions   are powered through collective action and allyship.   We have five Employee Representative Groups (ERGs)  – Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Peoples, MOSAIC  (Culture & Language), Rise (Gender Equity), Spectrum  (LGBTQ+) and TelstrAbility (Accessibility) – which  include over 4,500 members and are sponsored by  a member of our CEO leadership team. The ERG  member’s consultation and advocacy provide us with  insights into the lived experiences of marginalised  groups. These ERGs provide awareness and help  strengthen our culture of inclusion and belonging   for Telstra team members.  Our DEI Policy provides the framework for the Telstra  Board to set our measurable objectives for diversity.   Throughout the year, management and the Board  (including through the Nomination and People &  Remuneration Committees) assess our progress in  achieving our objectives.    Diversity objectives are included in monthly business  reports and in Group Executive scorecards. Chaired  by our CEO Vicki Brady, our organisation-wide DEI  Council supports each function to meet their diversity  objectives, understand the importance of DEI and  creates a safe space to collaborate and innovate. In addition to our inclusive recruitment practices   that resulted in a gender representation increase   from 33.5 per cent in FY22 to 35.2 per cent in FY23,  Telstra continues to invest in developing and retaining  women through multiple programs. For more information about diversity and inclusion,  please see our 2023 Corporate Governance Statement  available on our reports page.  Providing leading   employment conditions  We consult with our people before we implement   any significant changes to the way we work. We  regularly engage with our three employee unions   – the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union  of Australia (CEPU), the Community and Public Sector  Union (CPSU) and Professionals Australia (APESMA).  Our people have the freedom to form or join a trade  union, to bargain collectively and to engage in trade  union activities. We do not monitor union membership  by our people. Our aim is to maintain an open and  constructive relationship with the representatives   of these unions.  In FY23, we conducted more than 15 formal consultation  meetings with unions and Telstra employees. This  included discussions about how we have continued to  protect the health, safety and wellbeing of our people in  response to COVID-19 and what our Telstra Group legal  restructure would mean for our employees.  We currently have four enterprise agreements (EAs)  covering 73 per cent of our workforce in support of our  new legal structure. These EAs cover Telstra InfraCo,  Amplitel, Telstra Limited and one specifically for our  Retail business that covers people working in our retail  stores. All EAs will nominally expire in September 2024  and Telstra is committed to commencing discussions  for new EAs with our unions and employees, no later  than May 2024. Our EAs provide a range of industry-leading terms and  conditions, such as payment of superannuation on  periods of unpaid parental leave, gender affirmation  leave and 20-days paid leave for permanent employees  experiencing the effects of family and domestic violence.  In-person cultural learning We are committed to delivering in-person   cultural learning for 1,500 employees by June  2025. In-person learning will ensure employees  experience a deeper learning about Aboriginal   and Torres Strait Islander cultures, histories,  knowledge and rights. In FY23, we partnered   with a First Nations training provider to deliver  workshops that build on our journey of cultural  capability. This program is complemented by   other company-wide cultural competency training. For more information about our approach to  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at Telstra, please  see our 2023 Corporate Governance Statement  available on our reports page.  Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 31 Doing business responsibly  ===== PAGE 32 ===== Additionally, from February 2023, we introduced the  same paid arrangements to our casual workforce and  discretionary paid leave to any employee who may  be supporting a family member or member of their  household experiencing this type of violence.  In December 2022, we also recognised our employees’  contribution to our T22 success and ongoing focus in  FY23, by providing a one-off $1,000 bonus payment  to EA-covered employees, lawyers and many of our  international teams. Promoting health,   safety and wellbeing  Our people are the heart of all we do. With the   world around us changing at such a rapid rate and  social and economic conditions challenging many  across our communities, it has never been more  important to support and enable our people to be   safe and resilient in times of change. Our mental health strategy Over the past 12 months, we have increased our  strategic focus on a psychosocial risk-based approach  to preventing work-related harm. On 1 April 2023,  changes to the Commonwealth Workplace Health and  Safety (WHS) Regulations clarified the already existing  requirement on employers to manage psychosocial  hazards and risk. Telstra has invested significant  resources and dedicated expertise so that our systems,  processes and supports meet these obligations. Our evidence-based approach considers many factors  that can both positively and negatively impact mental  health. Our programs and initiatives are delivered  under three strategic pillars: •  Capability of care – our people understand the  factors that can positively and negatively impact  mental health, know the importance of connection,  have the courage to check-in with each other and  know where to access available support. •  Psychological risk management – a robust,  integrated, and embedded risk management  approach that supports our people to understand  and manage risk. •  Support and recovery – best practice and  easily accessible support services which enable  our people to remain at or return to safe and  sustainable work, minimising the human and  financial impact of ill-health. There is no single metric which can accurately   measure how well an organisation supports its  people and manages mental health risk. For this  reason, Telstra uses a suite of data points including  psychosocial risk profiling, including the number,  nature and location of reported mental health  incidents; contributing factors to mental health  incident reports and the demographics of our   injured/ill workforce; the strength of our reporting  culture; the uptake of our targeted support services,  participation rates in mental health-related   education and training and our Culture and   Employee Engagement Survey responses.  Our campaign to reduce the stigma associated   with mental health and encourage reporting has  resulted in a positive upward trend in mental health  reporting, particularly non-work-related incidents.  Pleasingly, our Employee Assistance Program (EAP)  utilisation rate remains significantly higher than the  industry average at 8.4 per cent, indicating that   our people are increasingly more comfortable in   proactively seeking support.   Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 32 Doing business responsibly  ===== PAGE 33 ===== Key health and safety  performance indicators We actively campaign on the importance of reporting  as a critical way to prevent harm and access support  from our safety and health management teams. The  more our people report, the better our understanding  of the risks in our business and the earlier we can  provide tailored support.  In FY23, we recorded the highest level of incident  reporting on record, which we broadly view as positive.  It reflects a strong health, safety and wellbeing culture  where our people exhibit a high awareness of the  importance of accurate and timely reporting and feel  comfortable reporting incidents. Our FY23 incident  reporting is particularly positive as it shows a material  decrease in the proportion of our incidents resulting in  a high severity outcome (i.e., medical treatment, work  restrictions or time away from work). This is further  evidenced in marginal reductions in both our Total  Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) and Lost Time  Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) which is calculated against  hours worked, meaning the higher incident reporting was  not correlated to an increase in TRIFR and LTIFR. High severity outcomes recorded Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate  Recovery following injury or  illness: equitable access to  support irrespective of cause Equitable access to early treatment and support is  the foundation of Telstra’s early intervention program  for both work-related and personal injury and illness.  With access to occupational rehabilitation, general  practitioners, psychology, physiotherapy services as  well financial support for a range of diagnostics and  aides, our people can focus on their recovery, while  they remain at (or return to) safe and sustainable work.                                                                                                                   Case Study Building a brighter   future after injury  John joined Telstra 25 years ago as a 17-year-old  apprentice linesman after leaving school in year  10. In 2008, John injured his back after falling  off a ladder, with treatment including a number  of operations over the years. He subsequently  developed a secondary mental health condition  due to his chronic pain and changes to his life, for  which Telstra accepted liability under his workers  compensation claim. John has had permanent  restrictions, both physically and psychologically  for many years and prior to 2021, was given a  range of ad hoc duties to 'keep him busy'. John’s team and rehabilitation program were  unable to secure any substantive permanent  employment for him, which left him slowly  declining in his employability, confidence and  work satisfaction. He had few transferrable  skills, was self-described as computer illiterate,  had minimal customer service experience and   no vocational desires that he could identify.   John felt his only way forward was to separate  from Telstra and commence early retirement. Through regular collaboration with John,  his medical team, the business, union  representatives and John’s workplace  rehabilitation providers, new realistic vocational  opportunities were identified. This collaborative  approach considered his injuries, limitations,  skills, training opportunities and the rapidly  changing labour market. John undertook training  programs designed to improve his health and  wellbeing and his transferable skills and was  successful in obtaining (and maintaining) a new  permanent role in Telstra as a Virtual Technician. Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 33 Doing business responsibly  ===== PAGE 34 ===== Supporting our people during  natural disasters, both locally   and internationally In responding to significant weather events across  Australia, our people worked to support affected  communities and to restore services in flood affected  areas. We worked with our partners to provide  specialist mental health support for employees  personally impacted by the floods, in addition to  providing leave provisions, financial support and  temporary accommodation for our impacted people.   Supporting our   international teams  Our support for Telstra’s international workforce  through FY23 has included: •  developing a culturally relevant and region- specific roadmap to understand and support a  safe, secure and healthy workplace for Digicel  Pacific employees and their partners following  Telstra’s acquisition of Digicel Pacific •  providing international employees with   appropriate ergonomic equipment to safely   work from home, equivalent to the support   we provide Australian employees •  a no-cost flu vaccine program for international  employees, where there is no local government  funded flu vaccine program •  training our International Regional Response   and in-country teams to effectively respond   to incidents that have potential people and  security impacts. Evolving our response   to COVID-19 COVID-19 had unprecedented impacts on our   people and operations, globally. In FY23, we continued  to review and evolve our response accordingly. We  removed the mandatory vaccination for roles where  it made sense to do so, while maintaining vaccination  requirements for our workforce attending vulnerable  settings (including aged care facilities, hospitals and  remote communities), employees working at our 000  call centres and employees travelling internationally  for work-related purposes. We continue to monitor  government and expert medical advice to test and  review the appropriateness of our response and  vaccination policy.  Licences, accreditations   and compliance To support Telstra’s legal restructure, Telstra   Limited, Telstra Infraco and Amplitel are now  self-insured under the Safety Rehabilitation and  Compensation Act (Cth).  Our Workplace Health, Safety and Environment  Management System is applicable globally and is  certified to International Standards ISO14001: 2015   and ISO 45001:2018. We continue to review and  improve our management system in response to  current and emerging risks and changing legislation.

This commitment lies at the heart of our ‘doing  business responsibly’ pillar of our T25 strategy. Today, more than 2 million Australians are still highly  digitally excluded8 and may miss out on the social  and economic benefits that come with being online.  Our commitment to creating a better digital world  is underpinned by our long history of responding  to digital exclusion by improving digital access,  affordability and ability across Australia. We want   to see Australians connect, participate and interact  safely in the digital world, irrespective of age, income,  ability or location.  We do this by: •  connecting regional and remote communities  through network leadership and investment  •  building responsible tech skills to increase digital  inclusion safely and help close the digital divide  •  supporting customers in vulnerable   circumstances, including those experiencing  financial hardship, domestic and family violence,  natural disasters and human conflict •  advancing online safety, privacy and security.  Our approach is informed using data and insights   from the Australian Digital Inclusion Index (ADII)1  which guides our decision making. For more information, please see our Creating a   better digital world: In focus paper available on our  reports page. To view the breakdown of our community contribution  for FY23, please see our 2023 Data Pack available on  our reports page.  8  www.digitalinclusionindex.org.au/interactive-data-dashboards In FY23, we contributed   $93.1 million through social   and community investment.   ===== PAGE 37 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 37 Creating a better digital world Giving back with purpose Our people are encouraged to use their annual Connection Day to support a cause in their community.   In June, our international team got together for their inaugural Changemakers Week, a global week of   45 volunteering events in over 30 locations. Over 900 employees across Europe, United States, Australia,   Asia and the Pacific Islands participated; including teams in India who spent time teaching kids about  environment conservation, and a team in Japan who volunteered at a local orphanage. During the   week, our people collected 508kg of plastic waste, reached 330 students and assembled 3,811 meals.

We are constantly investing in technology innovation  to improve our network capabilities and enhance the  digital experience of our customers. By enabling people  and businesses to access the connectivity they want  and need, we are making it easier for them to access  information and services, across more of Australia. Our mobile footprint stretches more than 2.7 million  square kilometres, around 1 million square kilometres  more mobile network coverage than our nearest  competitor, and reaches 99.6 per cent of the   Australian population.  In FY23, our main areas of focus were increasing our  5G coverage and expanding our 4G footprint so more  Australians can access a network that’s fit for the way  we use technology now and into the future.  Our 5G footprint now covers 85 per cent of the  population, and there are more than 4,700 Telstra   5G sites on-air across the country, providing coverage  in more than 400 cities and towns. Our customers   are increasingly accessing this technology with the  number of 5G devices connecting our network   growing each week.  We continued the expansion of our 4G footprint to  establish coverage equivalent to current 3G coverage,  ahead of 3G network closure in June 2024. This year,  we added 4G to 106 sites that were previously 3G only,  with more customers transitioning from 3G to 4G.  For more information about the 3G network closure,  please visit our website. Importantly, this transition will  free up the low-band (850MHz) spectrum for 5G. The  use of this low-band spectrum can extend 5G further  and deeper into buildings and facilitate 5G expansion  sooner in regional areas. For more information, read   our regional coverage FAQs on Telstra Exchange. Through national, state, territory and local   government programs, we have co-invested hundreds  of millions of dollars. We have delivered around  930 new mobile base stations through the Federal  Government’s Mobile Black Spot Program (MBSP),  over 200 small cells at Telstra’s own expense and more  than 130 projects through the Regional Co-investment  Program (RCP). In FY23, we delivered 34 MBSPs sites  and 36 projects across RCP 1 and 2 providing new  and improved coverage and increased transmission  capacity to ensure customers continue to have the   best mobile experience. Bringing low earth satellite  connectivity to regional   Australia with Starlink We’re working with Starlink to deliver Low Earth   Orbit (LEO) satellite connectivity to provide voice   and fixed broadband services in remote and hard  to reach places. In a world-first offering, we will be  able to provide a home phone service and Starlink  broadband services to consumers as a bundle  offer, as well as local tech support and the option  of professional installation. We will also provide  connectivity options for business customers, with  a higher bandwidth business option available in  areas without fixed and mobile connectivity. We’re  expecting to be able to offer services to customers  and businesses towards the end of 2023.  Read our article on Telstra Exchange.  ===== PAGE 39 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 39 Creating a better digital world Disaster preparedness   and response  We know the importance of access to network  connectivity for communities, especially in times of  crisis. We work extensively to prepare for disaster  seasons. In FY23, our priorities continued to ensure the  safety of our people, protecting and maintaining our  infrastructure, keeping our customers connected and  providing short and long-term assistance measures.  Email, SMS and My Telstra banners were used to   reach approximately 180,000 customers who might   be affected by disaster, providing pre-disaster  support to those previously impacted by a disaster  or classified as Priority Assistance customers. These  communications provide tips on how customers can  prepare for a disaster event.   During FY23, we activated disaster relief for customers  in 101 postcodes following severe weather events  across the country, such as flooding and cyclones.   We sent 353,000 SMS messages to inform customers  that Telstra, Belong and Boost assistance was available  to them. We provided 58,065 short-term assistance  packages, which included additional data for post- paid and pre-paid services. We also applied long-term  assistance packages or discretionary credits to 5,300  consumer and small business customers. This totalled  over $1.26 million and assisted customers who may  have been displaced to relocate their services or  provide bill relief.  Three international initiatives were also announced,  providing free calls from fixed and mobile services to  customers contacting loved ones in Turkiye and Syria,  Vanuatu and New Zealand following floods, cyclones  and earthquakes. Free calls to friends and family in  the Ukraine, Poland, Hungary, Moldova, Slovakia and  Romania were also extended until March 2023.  We continued to provide emergency response leave   for our people who volunteer for emergency services.   ===== PAGE 40 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 40 Creating a better digital world Network resilience   and reliability We recognise the importance of network resilience,  especially in times of disasters, but we are also  mindful of the risk of sole reliance on a mobile  network, particularly in disaster-prone areas, where  power supply cannot be guaranteed. This is why  we participate in the Australian Government’s  Strengthening Telecommunications Against Natural  Disasters (STAND) program. In FY23, we completed  70 committed STAND projects to deliver a mix of  battery upgrades, permanent generators and portable  generators at locations across Australia. Supply  interruption of equipment continues to impact the  physical build; however, we forecast an additional   128 projects to be completed in FY24. In addition, we have an ongoing program to improve  battery life at our mobile network sites. The program  focuses on battery replacement, power resilience  and reliability using disaster risk data to prioritise  battery replacement. In FY23, we completed battery  lifecycle replacement at 640 mobile sites throughout  the network. Battery lifecycle and upgrade works were  carried out at around 1,455 network transmissions  sites, as well as the deployment of 125 Automatic  Transfer Units (ATU) – which allow the pre-deployment  of generators at sites in anticipation of outages.   This is critical in supporting services to mobile sites  and legacy customer services.  In FY23, we also had a focus on wet season  preparation, performing targeted vegetation   clearances across our site portfolio; and planned  maintenance on standby generator plant and DC   power systems – including advance generator fuelling  and bulk fuel tank inspections at high priority sites. We are also taking a leading role across industry, the  Australian Government and the Australian Competition  and Consumer Commission on the development  and adoption of an emergency mobile roaming  capability for disaster situations. This capability will  allow customers at risk in disaster-affected areas to  temporarily roam onto another network if their regular  provider’s network is disrupted or does not provide  coverage in their area. There are technical challenges  and risks to resilience that need to be carefully  managed in any technical solution and implementation,  but we believe these are surmountable. At our  suggestion, the industry is exploring the development  of this temporary disaster roaming capability (TDR). Delivering new satellite   solutions with OneWeb  This year we signed a strategic agreement with  OneWeb to deliver one of the world’s largest rollouts  of OneWeb Low Earth Orbit (LEO) backhaul for a  commercial mobile network. As part of the plan,  we’ll move hundreds of existing remote mobile base  stations that use satellite backhaul to the OneWeb’s  LEO solution over the next few years resulting  in a better customer experience for customers,  especially enterprise customers and those in rural  and remote Australia. As well as added redundancy,  it means a better experience when using real-time  applications like voice and video calling.  For more information, read the media release.  ===== PAGE 41 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 41 Creating a better digital world Mobile health and  communications  As we continue our rollout of 5G technology around  Australia, we're committed to sharing information on  our real-world tests of 5G Electromagnetic Energy  (EME) levels and demonstrating compliance with   the EME safety standards.  With the increased deployment of 4G and 5G small  cells in residential areas in FY23, community concerns  relating to EME and health continue. This year, we   met with concerned residents in New South Wales   and Victoria to undertake EME surveys and  measurements both inside and outside the home.   The initiative demonstrated that EME levels were   well below the Australian Radiation Protection and  Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) safety standard.  We continue to offer an EME Help Desk for anyone  seeking further information. Enquiries made to the Australian Communications   and Media Authority (ACMA) increased in FY23  compared with the past two years due to increased  small cell rollout and our Mobile Base Station  Deployment C564:2020 obligations. Most enquiries  were in relation to notification obligations. We continue  to drive compliance with stakeholder engagement  through transparent consultation and notification with  councils and communities by providing information  on 5G, EME and the EME testing results. For more  consumer information on 5G, EME and small cells,  please visit our website.  Telstra continues to contribute to the development  of international EME standards and chairs the  International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)  committee. We also support stakeholders, including  ARPANSA and ACMA in areas including assessment   of millimetre wave (mmWave) exposure.  Regional and remote  engagement  We maintained our focus on connecting with regional  and remote communities across the country while  continuing to invest in our regional networks and  improve how we support our customers. This year, we continued to support and run Regional  Advisory Councils in Queensland, Victoria, Western  Australia and New South Wales (NSW) through  virtual and face-to-face meetings including with our  CEO and Board Members. Members of our Executive  Leadership Team (including our CEO) and Board met  with stakeholders and customers face-to-face in  locations across Australia including Darwin, Nhulunbuy,  Karratha, Townsville, Wagga Wagga, Bundaberg, Albury,  Shepparton, Mooroopna and Wangaratta. In FY23, we continued to facilitate discussions  with representative bodies and communities from  across Australia. This included hosting a regional  telecommunications policy workshop in Sydney  in October 2022 with 33 representatives across  a range of stakeholder groups, industries and  regions. The workshop focussed on three themes:  the mix of technologies that underpin regional  telecommunications now and into the future; getting  the policy settings right; and collectively addressing  connectivity literacy needs in regional Australia. In partnership with AgForce, Telstra toured regional  Queensland hosting 'Innovation in Ag' Field Days   along with agritech start-ups to discuss regional  connectivity concerns and demonstrate the latest  digital solutions for farms. This program has been  extended to reach NSW farmers in late FY23/early  FY24. We also engaged with stakeholders on the  awareness and understanding of the proposed Multi- Operator Core Network (MOCN) agreement between  Telstra and TPG Telecom.  During the year, we continued to deliver on the  commitments we made in response to the 2021  Regional Telecommunications Independent Review  Committee (RTIRC). This includes seven initiatives   we are investing into, from $75 million allocated from  the part sale of our Amplitel business, to further  enhance connectivity in regional Australia. This year we also announced round one recipients of  the Telstra Connected Communities grant program.   To see the recipients, please visit the program website.   ===== PAGE 42 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 42 Creating a better digital world Case Study Helping regional Australia shine on film  In FY23, we collaborated with production company Arenamedia   to overcome the challenge of limited connectivity in Bremer Bay,   a coastal hamlet in Western Australia’s Great Southern Region.  Arenamedia needed to create a reliable and extensive data  transmission to fulfil demanding technical needs during  production of the film, Blueback. We conducted a full analysis of  the location and provided an integrated communication solution  using Netgear Nighthawk portable 4GX modems and Netgear Orbi  stationary 4GX WiFi modems, coupled with external antennas,   to boost access to internet infrastructure. This allowed production  teams to access high-speed uplink and downlink data capabilities  from the existing Telstra mobile network, providing a platform for  regional communities to share their stories and culture.  With our support, Arenamedia was able to shoot Blueback entirely onsite, never missing a beat when transmitting  rushes or managing technical requirements. We enabled all production staff to stay connected and manage day- to-day activities, within timelines and budgets, despite teams being physically separated by large distances.  Watch the movie trailer here. Tech innovation This year, we continued to invest in technologies  that will dramatically transform Australia in the near  future. It takes a team of partners from the tech world,  academia, government, industry and the community   to make lasting, scalable change.  Our technology innovation efforts are centred   around the transformative potential of our  infrastructure and platforms. They range from   investing in Australia's largest quantum computing  company to collaborative efforts with the Australian  Football League (AFL) at Marvel Stadium, where we  are creating transformative ‘Stadium of the Future’  experiences. Additionally, we engage in 5G trials in  partnership with multiple organisations. We are also focusing our innovation efforts in key  industries that power the Australian economy. These  include agribusiness, where we collaborate closely  with industry bodies and major corporate partners like  Microsoft and IBM, and domestic Australian start-ups  like Farmbot, Smart Paddock and Zetifi to introduce  technologies that make agriculture more sustainable  and competitive. These include enhanced rural and  remote connectivity, the ability to monitor water   levels, keep track of livestock and even being able   to tell when a gate in a paddock has been left open.  Telstra Labs continued to explore and validate cutting- edge technologies including 5G, artificial intelligence  (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), augmented reality (AR)  and the metaverse, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) and  drone communications. In FY23, we completed a trial  with Rheinmetall under an Australian Government  5G Innovation Initiative grant. This trial showed the  feasibility of using drones to connect to Telstra’s  5G network and extend connectivity to a remotely  controlled fire-fighting vehicle. This approach could be  used to fight fires in regions where mobile coverage is  traditionally difficult to achieve, such as in a gully in a  rural location. These vehicles could deliver water when  it’s too dangerous for fire-fighters to get close to the  fire-front, and ultimately, save lives. We also partnered  with Field of Vision to create new experiences for vision  impaired AFL fans.  Our Telstra Data Hub platform allows companies  to securely share, view and exchange data that can  deliver real benefits to their productivity. In FY23, we  announced a 12-month trial with the Global Digital  Farm in Wagga Wagga to test our new integrated  agtech platform called Farm Data Services. Enabled  through our Data Hub, the Farm Data Services platform  provides a highly scalable and secure data sharing  platform to integrate, standardise and, with permission  of the data owner, distribute datasets from existing  agtech deployments. The platform aims to overcome  one of the biggest hurdles in modern, data-driven  agriculture – how to securely manage and integrate  data from multiple technologies across the farm. The  trial is a partnership between Telstra, Food Agility CRC  and Charles Sturt University.  ===== PAGE 43 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 43 Creating a better digital world Case Study Telstra Labs and Field of Vision create a new experience for   vision-impaired AFL fans  Having low vision shouldn’t stop anyone from playing sport, or being a die-hard club fan. However, it  can change how someone experiences it. As a person who is blind, Western Bulldogs supporter, Shaun  experiences AFL games predominantly through sound, using headphones to listen to commentary and   game sounds to visualise what’s happening on the field.  We want all fans to have access to the technology they need to bring a live AFL match to life. To do this,   we explored how technology, underpinned by the speed and responsiveness of our 5G mobile network,   could add a new element to AFL matches, allowing people with low vision experience more of the game   than they already do.  We have been working with the team from Field of Vision and our Telstra Labs to create a new experience  for vision-impaired AFL fans. It uses innovative technology that translates the movement of a ball on-field  to a physical device. Using magnetic technology that moves inside the body of the device, as the Sherrin is  kicked and handballed around the oval, a steel ring on the surface moves precisely to where the ball is on   the playing field. As the ball is run and passed around the field, the ring tracks its every motion. As it’s  kicked, the fast movement of the ring will match the intensity of noise from the field and the fans –  especially if that kick turns into a goal!

We were also the 2022  Principal Supporting Partner of Get Online  Week, through which we supported community  organisations to run over 1,000 digital skills   sessions reaching 19,000 people with minimal or   no digital skills. During this week, Telstra employees  volunteered as digital mentors, helping friends   and family members learn new skills and ran   digital skills events in their local communities. Image: Telstra’s Eva Colic and Michael Heydon at a Get Online  Week event in Mandurah, WA. Held in partnership with the  Senior's Recreation Council of WA.  Our commitment to building responsible  tech skills is underpinned by our long-term  partnerships with governments and non-profit  organisations. Through collaboration,   we deliver digital literacy programs with our  community partners to help people of all  ages and backgrounds develop the skills and  knowledge they need to use technology   safely and responsibly. Older Australians  Adults aged over 65 are the least digitally included   age group in Australia9. We continue to support   older Australians through our digital literacy programs,  giving older people, particularly those in regional areas,  the opportunity to develop the skills and confidence   to safely embrace digital technology.  This year, we launched a new Learning Digital online  hub offering short, self-guided content covering topics  such as using the internet, email, internet safety and  cyber security, and two-step verification. We also  refreshed educational content on the hub, introduced  free digital skills building sessions over the phone and  increased the digital skills support we provide in store.  In New South Wales, we have partnered with  government to deliver our Tech Savvy Seniors   program for ten years and in FY23, provided 15,287   face-to-face and virtual digital literacy training  places for older Australians in English, Auslan, Tamil,  Vietnamese, Hindi, Mandarin, Cantonese and more.  Read our article on Telstra Exchange.  In Victoria, we partner with the University of the  Third Age (U3A), Public Libraries Victoria and the  Department of Families, Fairness and Housing to  deliver Social Seniors. Social Seniors is a series of  workshops that have a ‘learn by doing’ approach to  technology and digital storytelling. The program builds digital confidence and capability in  older Australians, encouraging them to use technology  to connect with family, friends and community groups.  In response to COVID-19 and associated restrictions,  the program was refreshed to enable virtual delivery   to become a part of the program’s standard offering.   In FY23, Social Seniors engaged with 238 participants. 9  www.digitalinclusionindex.org.au/interactive-data-dashboards Collectively, our digital literacy  programs supported more  than 200,000 Australians to  build digital skills in FY23; and  more than 250,000 over the  past two years, putting us on  track to meet our T25 target to  build digital skills for 500,000  Australians, by FY25.  ===== PAGE 45 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 45 Creating a better digital world Justice Connect partnership  This year, we formed a new partnership with Justice  Connect, a leading Australian charity, to develop a  digital self-help resource hub that helps Australians  prepare and respond to disaster situations.  Using artificial intelligence and digital marketing   tools, Justice Connect will train people with low   digital skills to access and use online self-help  resources. The hub will go live in late 2023. First Nations communities  We have a range of established and leading   programs to improve digital literacy and accessibility  for First Nations people and communities across  Australia. These programs include:   •  InDigiMOB – a pioneering co-designed   digital inclusion project, funded by Telstra   and delivered by First Nations Media Australia.  The project addresses digital inclusion and cyber  safety awareness. This year, the program reached  245 people across locations in the Northern  Territory, South Australia and Western Australia.  IndigiMOB has employed 169 Digital Mentors   since the project started in 2016. For more  information, please visit inDigiMOB.  •  Deadly Digital Communities – an initiative  of State Library of Queensland and Telstra in  partnership with Queensland Local Governments  through their Indigenous Knowledge Centre   (IKC) and public library service. This year, we  introduced a series of ‘Who's Your Mob’ family  history research workshops which helped people  explore online resources to discover and share  their stories, get communities involved and  strengthen connections. This year, 50 people  gained new digital skills through Deadly Digital  Communities. For more information, please visit  Deadly Digital Communities. •  Mobile My Way – a telecommunications literacy  training project, funded by Telstra and delivered  by the Centre for Appropriate Technology. The  project delivered telecommunication literacy  to First Nations customers living in remote  communities in the Northern Territory in locations  where we had recently installed new or improved  telecommunications infrastructure. Throughout  FY23, Mobile My Way reached 778 people across   11 remote locations. Find the training resources   on our website. We continue to collaborate with the Australian  Government to improve digital inclusion outcomes   for First Nations peoples. In January 2023, Lauren  Ganley, Telstra’s Head of First Nations Strategy   & Engagement, was appointed to the First Nations   Digital Inclusion Expert Panel. The Panel supports  progress towards Target 17 of the National Agreement  on Closing the Gap which seeks to achieve equal levels  of digital inclusion for First Nations people by 2026.  Parents  For parents trying to keep their kids and families safe  online, we provide a range of practical tips, including  our add-on, Telstra Device Security subscription  service. To find out how you can protect yourself and  your loved ones, read our article on Telstra Exchange.   ===== PAGE 46 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 46 Creating a better digital world Case Study Closing the digital gap in Australia’s  least connected communities   While most Australian cities enjoy excellent internet   access, there is still a broad ‘digital gap’ between urban   and regional areas, which is even more pronounced   across 1,100 First Nations remote communities. Since 2021, Telstra has been working with the ARC Centre  of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and Society  to build the first-ever databank tracking internet access,  affordability and ability in remote communities. As well as  informing policy and programs to boost connectivity and  give First Nations peoples equal levels of digital inclusion by 2026,   the Mapping the Digital Gap (MTDG) project is helping 11 communities develop Digital Inclusion Plans to inform  local strategies and advocate for greater government and industry support to address specific challenges. In July, MTDG’s 2022 findings were included for the first time as part of the nationwide Australian Digital   Inclusion Index. The findings include 530 surveys, which show that while digital ability is relatively high across  remote communities, access and affordability remain low. Eighty-six per cent of people primarily use mobile  phones for internet use, with ninety per cent of these using pre-paid services. However, the MTDG team remains cautiously optimistic. The Australian Government recently established   a First Nations Digital Inclusion Advisory Group (with an MTDG member co-chairing), and in April, announced   an additional $25 million for First Nations communities through its Regional Connectivity Program. This has   led to proposals for more community mentors, digital training and free public Wi-Fi. Telstra has also made   calls free to standard national numbers from all Telstra public payphones and free Wi-Fi access available at  designated payphones. “It’s just a start,” says MTDG project lead Daniel Featherstone, “but the community reports are already having an  impact, highlighting diverse challenges and providing a critical baseline to inform policy and funding needed to  reduce the digital gap.” For more information, please visit the project website.  Measuring impact and   social value In 2023, the State Library of Queensland   commissioned the Queensland University of  Technology to develop a Digital Inclusion Programs  Evaluation examining the programs delivered  through Queensland’s public libraries and Indigenous  Knowledge Centres between 2016 and 2022. This  included Telstra’s Tech Savvy Seniors, Deadly   Digital Communities and Tech Savvy Communities.  The report found digital inclusion programming had  generated over $10.1 million in social value.   ===== PAGE 47 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 47 Creating a better digital world Customers needing   extra care We are committed to helping those facing cost- of-living pressure by continuing to offer a range  of products, services and programs to improve  digital inclusion outcomes for our customers and  communities. These activities include: •  providing lower-cost services for people on   a low income  •  support during times of financial hardship,  including access to safe and secure  communications for victims of domestic   and family violence •  free Telstra mobile calls to crisis lines and  unmetered mobile data access to Ask Izzy,   a mobile website that connects people in crisis  with the support services they need •  free calls to standard national numbers from   all Telstra public payphones and free Wi-Fi   access available at designated payphones •  providing disaster relief. Our CEO Consumer Roundtable plays an important  role in informing our approach to customers needing  extra care. Held twice a year, the Roundtable provides  an opportunity for the CEO and Executives to listen to  and learn from key consumer advocacy stakeholders  to improve the experiences of our sales and service  performance, particularly for customers doing it tough. Helping fund financial  counselling services This year, Telstra contributed to a cross-industry  initiative to provide a one-off $7.75 million  donation to the Financial Counselling Foundation.  The $7.75 million will enable the Foundation to  provide additional support to existing grants that  are expiring and to implement new projects to  support victims of family violence, tenants at risk  of homelessness, First Nations communities and  people in prison. Communications Alliance helped  facilitate the initiative, which was also supported  by the banking, finance, insurance, energy,  telecommunications and online gambling sectors.  Checking in with   First Nations customers The Telstra ‘Pink Bus’ has been visiting remote  communities for over two years. In FY23, the Pink  Bus visited 53 remote communities across   the Northern Territory, Queensland and New   South Wales and helped 7,680 customers. Services  include identifying and removing bad debt,  checking customers are on the most appropriate  plans, making sure customers can use the   My Telstra app and have information to connect to  our First Nations Connect hotline. Since November  2019, the Pink Bus has visited over 150 remote  communities, reaching more than 11,000 customers. Supporting customers  We believe that everyone deserves access to the digital world, regardless of their  location, circumstance or socio-economic status. We keep communities connected by  providing them with affordable and accessible connectivity options, and ensuring we  always support our customers in a way that meets their individual needs. Through these activities, we  helped 1.26 million customers  in vulnerable circumstances  stay connected this year.   ===== PAGE 48 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 48 Creating a better digital world Improving affordability  We recognise that affordable telecommunication  services are critical to staying connected and some  customers experience temporary hardship or longer- term financial challenges. We offer affordability  initiatives for people on low-incomes or for those  experiencing financial hardship by partnering with   local community organisations across Australia to  develop and deliver programs to assist our most  vulnerable customers and communities.  We partner with more than 2,000 local community  organisations across Australia to deliver our Access  for Everyone programs. This includes products and  services which address barriers to staying connected  and are designed to support people in financial  hardship, including people in crisis, experiencing  homelessness, pensioners and low-income families.  In FY23, we supported 10,489 customers impacted by  homelessness, domestic and family violence or natural  disaster with a free $40 pre-paid mobile recharge.  Responding to cost-of-living pressures, in May 2023,   we announced an expansion of the Telstra Top-Up  program to provide more support to more people.   In July 2023, The Top-Up value increased from three   $40 recharges expiring after 28 days to one $160  recharge that expires after six months. The program   is available to people experiencing or at risk of financial  difficulty, food insecurity, mental health, disability,  natural disaster, homelessness or domestic and   family violence. For more information, please visit   the InfoXchange website. We also provided 224,263 pensioners with a discount  on their Telstra services, 36,435 eligible customers   with a discount on their mobile plan and 2,866 low- income families with emergency bill assistance.  The low-income package concessional benefits  totalled $51.4 million in FY23, an increase of 28.5 per  cent compared to FY22 ($40 million). The increase  reflects changes made to the package in FY23 to  include our concession mobile plan to reflect the  increasing role of mobile and broadband connectivity.  In addition, this year, 205,435 customers were  connected through our Starter Internet Plan designed  with the needs of older Australians in mind. Availability  of this plan has been expanded to include any  customer starting their internet journey; they no   longer need to be receiving government benefits. For women experiencing domestic and family   violence, we provide access to safe and secure  communications – a smart phone, $30 pre-paid   starter kit and information to help them stay safely  connected. Delivered in partnership with the Women’s  Services Network (WESNET), Telstra Safe Connections  has distributed more than 38,000 phones to women  since its inception in 2014, including 1,400 in FY23.   To better assist victim-survivors, Telstra has a  designated customer service team in place, staffed   by specially trained agents who are equipped to   take a ‘high care’ approach. Supporting the School   Student Broadband Initiative This year, our Belong brand joined the Australian  Government’s School Student Broadband  Initiative, which will provide up to 30,000 free  home internet connections for low-income  families with school age children who do not  have access to the national broadband network  (nbn). Once eligible families are nominated by  participating schools, education authorities or  community organisations, we provide no-cost  internet for 12 months. This year, we connected  324 services.  For more information, please visit Belong.  ===== PAGE 49 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 49 Creating a better digital world Accessibility  We aspire to enable all Australians to enjoy a more  connected and accessible future so everyone can  thrive. Telstra’s accessibility journey began nearly  40 years ago with the introduction of specialised  products to assist people with disabilities to use a  standard telephone service. Since then, accessibility  has expanded into all areas of our business, from  products and digital services for our customers, to  new recruitment practices and workplace adjustments  for our employees. We continue to engage with peak  bodies and disability advocacy organisations through  our bi-annual disability stakeholder forum.  Our Accessibility and Disability Inclusion Action  Plan FY23-FY25 details how we continue to build  inclusion and equitable access to overcome barriers  that prevent full social and economic participation for  people with disability. The plan presents actions we  are taking as a business to encourage, recognise and  promote an active commitment to eliminating disability  discrimination. We consulted people with disability   in the creation of the plan. All 12 FY23 commitments  have been completed.  Both the My Telstra app and Telstra website have  been certified for meeting international web content  accessibility guidelines levels A and AA. We have  also worked hard to ensure that the over five million  documents we email our customers each month  incorporate key accessibility requirements. This  means the one in ten Australians who rely on assistive  technologies can better access their bills, invoices,  credit adjustments and debt letters. We celebrated another year of disability confidence  and, for the fourth year in a row, received Disability  Confident Recruiter accreditation from the Australian  Network on Disability. The program aims to remove  barriers for people with disabilities during the  recruitment process. Disability confident recruitment  is just one way we are working towards attracting  and retaining disability talent. Our Accessibility and  Inclusion Action Plan outlines ten commitments   to inclusive employment and support for people   with disability.  We continue to maintain our commitment to the  Disability Enquiry Hotline, Directory Assistance Helpline  and Disability Equipment Program. During FY23, we  provided 51 pieces of disability-specific equipment  through the program. This complements our standard  product range which includes devices with features to  support customers who have accessibility needs. Telstra also supports the Australian Communications  Consumer Action Network’s Accessible Telecoms  service. This service provides consolidated,  independent and up-to-date information about  accessibility features of telecommunications  equipment available to vulnerable consumer groups.  It plays an important role in industry by empowering  users, such as older Australians and people with  disability, to make informed choices regarding the  products and services best suited to their needs. Although we have delivered several key initiatives this  year, we don’t always get it right. In FY23, we received  18 complaints of disability discrimination from the  Australian Human Rights Commission and three from  the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. Of  these 21 complaints, 18 have been closed and three  are in progress. Complaints that have uncovered  any systemic issues are escalated and are used for  continuous improvements to our customer service. Empowering digital skills  through Auslan Deaf Connect has run nearly 150 Tech Savvy  Seniors classes since 2015. More than 1,100 seniors  have participated in the classes taking place at the  Deaf Connect offices in Parramatta and in libraries  and community centres across Sydney and regional  New South Wales. Deaf Connect has adapted the  Tech Savvy Seniors training to focus on graphic  ‘how-to’ lessons in Auslan – the national sign  language, used by at least 16,000 Australians.   The lessons demonstrate popular apps, video  platforms, and other programs, with clear  illustrations which lead participants through   steps for downloading and using apps. Participants  in the program have learnt how to use their devices  to connect with interpreting services as well as  becoming more confident in spotting scams.

We take our role as custodian of customer data  seriously and invest heavily in cyber security measures  to help protect our customers’ data and privacy. We  also deliver cyber security training to our employees  and customers to help them understand the risks  associated with using technology and how to better  protect themselves and their data.  Privacy  We are committed to being transparent with our  customers about how we collect, use and manage their  personal information. We take a global approach to  privacy management and apply the Australian Privacy  Act, the European Union General Data Protection  Regulation and local legislation, where applicable. We manage privacy and data access through our  Code of Conduct, Privacy Statements and other  relevant policies and security controls. These set strict  standards relating to privacy and confidentiality, and  protect customer data from interference, misuse and  unauthorised access.  We are committed to protecting and securing our  customers’ personal information and complying with  all applicable relevant privacy legislation. Our Privacy  Statements explain to our customers how we manage  the personal information they entrust to us. We  undertake regular reviews of our Privacy Statements to  ensure they remain fit for purpose. We do not share any  information with third parties that identifies or could  reasonably identify a customer, except in line with our  Privacy Statements, or if we are required or permitted  by law to do so.  We consider customer privacy and data protection  in the design and development of our organisational  processes, products and initiatives. We aim to  ensure that privacy related risks are considered and  assessed from the outset of every concept, project,  product, service, program or IT system enhancement  or development by completing Privacy Impact  Assessments.  In line with Telstra’s Compliance Framework, the Board,  Audit and Risk Committee, our CEO and Executive  Leadership Team is committed to meeting all our legal  and regulatory obligations. They are accountable for  ensuring everyone at Telstra understands and complies  with these requirements within the jurisdictions where  Telstra conducts business. Accountable Executives  within our business units are also responsible for  specific privacy compliance requirements related to  functions they perform.  In FY23, we had five privacy incidents requiring  notification to the Office of the Australian Information  Commissioner and one incident relating to  misalignment of data within our Directory Assistance  and Directory Listing databases, which we also   self-reported to the Australian Communications and  Media Authority.  In all cases, we directly contacted the impacted  customers to discuss any concerns and offered  solutions appropriate to their situation, such as  updating customer accounts, covering costs of credit  check subscriptions (for customers whose credit  history may be at risk) or referral to third party identity  and cyber support services. We also took action to  manage or remediate the breaches, which included  reviewing policies and procedures, implementing  additional controls, and providing additional training  and guidance to our people to ensure processes   are correctly followed.  ===== PAGE 51 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 51 Creating a better digital world Digital ethics, rights   and responsibilities At Telstra, we purchase, develop, use and sell   products that use artificial intelligence (AI) and  machine learning (ML). We also analyse our data to  gain insights into our network performance and how  our customers use our products and services. We  are conscious of the potential impacts of AI and ML  on our community and particularly those who are  most vulnerable. At the same time, we are aware of  the exciting opportunities they represent to deliver  enhanced network performance and a personalised  customer experience. We take our responsibility to  develop, deploy and monitor these products seriously.  We strive to do this in ways that respect the privacy  of our customers and the wider community, but also  consider broader ethical considerations.    Our approach is informed by our Responsible AI Policy  which is closely aligned to the Australian Framework  for Ethical AI. Our policy guides the responsibility and  care expected from the Telstra Group regarding these  technologies. The governance of this policy includes  oversight of Telstra data and AI initiatives   by Telstra’s Risk Council on AI and Data (RCAID)  chaired by our Data & AI Risk Management Principal.  In FY23, we refined our operational procedures to  embed the implementation of our policy more deeply.  This included: •  ensuring our RCAID governance process   covered the new Quantium Telstra venture from   its inception  •  upgrading our AI Model Register, which records all  Telstra AI use cases, to version two and reconciling  the registered cases with those in production   •  applying in-production monitoring controls to  higher-risk use cases on our major AI platforms  •  defining guidelines for the use of generative   AI within Telstra. Cyber security and   data protection Cyber security, privacy and data and artificial  intelligence management are material risks to our  organisation and our stakeholders. The past 12 months  have seen our cyber security capability continue to  grow in strength and demonstrate resilience in the   face of an ongoing dynamic threat landscape.  At Telstra, our approach to cyber security and data  protection is comprehensive, multi-layered and  underpinned by a Cyber Security Strategy, Group  Security Policy, Group Information Management   Policy and Group Privacy Policy. Our Chief Information  Security Office is responsible for global cyber security  and reports to our Audit and Risk Committee at least  twice a year, and to our Board as needed. This year, we intensified our attention on cyber   security and data protection with the declaration of   a company objective for FY24. This includes measures  to reduce our data holdings to legal minimums, to know  where our data is, its risk, and strengthen our security  protections for personal information. We employ a range of strategies and technologies   to help protect our customers' information and assets  from cyber threats. One key aspect of our approach   is risk management. We have a framework that allows  us to manage cyber security and data protection risks  effectively. This includes regular risk assessments,  threat modelling and asset inventory management.  We use various risk management standards, such as  the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard  (PCI DSS), ISO 27001 and the US National Institute of  Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework  (NIST CSF) to guide our efforts.  Our new data and AI venture This year, we formed a new partnership with  Quantium to unlock the full potential of data and   AI for Telstra and our customers. The venture will  bring together Quantium’s market-leading data  science and AI capabilities with Telstra’s customer,  product and network data assets. Called Quantium  Telstra, the new venture will not only provide  personalised and data-enabled products and   offers for Telstra’s customers, but it will also   embed proactive and predictive AI and machine  learning across Telstra’s core business.  For more information, read our media release.  ===== PAGE 52 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 52 Creating a better digital world Another important aspect of our approach is threat  intelligence. Our Threat Research and Intelligence  team leverages a range of internal and external sources  of intelligence to help stay ahead of emerging cyber  threats. We use machine learning and data analytics  to analyse and correlate threat data to identify and  prioritise potential threats. This intelligence allows us  to take proactive measures to help protect our network  and customers. From a data protection perspective, we recognise  that reducing and simplifying how much data we  hold makes the job of protecting it easier. Across the  company, we are in the process of streamlining and  reducing our data holdings wherever possible. We also implement various access control measures,  such as strong password policies, multi-factor  authentication (MFA), privileged access management  (PAM), and role-based access controls (RBAC), to   help prevent unauthorised access to our systems  and data. We employ network segmentation and  data encryption to ensure data is only accessible  by authorised personnel. Our cyber assurance  and enablement capabilities oversee third-party  assessments to enhance information security within  our network of third-party suppliers. At Telstra, we believe cyber security is as much about  people as it is technology. We invest in employee  training and awareness programs to help our  employees understand their role in protecting Telstra,  our network and our customers. Our innovative Cyber  Security Influence program builds our security culture  and behaviours in the organisation and includes  security news, advisories, videos and gamified learning.  Our program also has a highly engaged employee  community for security enthusiasts and we conduct  regular simulated phishing campaigns to test and  improve employee awareness.  Finally, we are committed to compliance with relevant  cyber security regulations and standards, including  ISO 27001, the Australian Privacy Principles, and the  Essential Eight mitigation strategies developed by the  Australian Cyber Security Centre. Telstra conducts  regular audits and assessments to ensure compliance  obligations are met.  When things go wrong  Our world-class Security Operations Center (SOC)  provides 24/7 monitoring and response to security  incidents. The SOC team is made up of highly skilled  security professionals who investigate and respond to  security incidents using advanced security tools, such  as SIEM (Security Information and Event Management),  EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) and NTA  (Network Traffic Analysis) solutions. We have a  comprehensive incident response plan that outlines  the steps to be taken in the event of a security incident.  This plan includes procedures for incident reporting,  containment, analysis, remediation and mitigation.  We regularly test and update the plan to ensure its  effectiveness in responding to emerging threats.  Keeping your personal   ID data safe  One of the lessons from the recent data breaches  in Australia, for all organisations, is the need to  continually assess what data needs to be stored,  and how and where we store it. This year, we kicked  off a review of our systems to challenge ourselves  to minimise the government ID data we hold, and  how long we hold it for, while continuing to meet our  existing legal obligations. While we will continue to  scan ID documents to check customer identity and  protect against fraud, we are reducing the time we  keep these scans from two years to six months.  For more information on how to keep your personal   ID data safe, read our article on Telstra Exchange.

This is why we launched our Cleaner Pipes  initiative, and why we’re helping all customers on the Telstra network join the fight against scammers by  reporting SMS and MMS scams to a national phone number. Customers who forward SMS and MMS scams to 7226 (SCAM) will help Telstra better protect millions of  Australians from receiving harmful SMS/MMS messages that may attempt to trick them into providing their  personal information, credit cards or downloading malicious apps. All customers need to do is forward the   SMS/MMS scam to 7226. We won’t send a reply message and customers won’t be charged for sending this SMS. Our Cleaner Pipes initiative helps block on average, 23 million scam SMS each month since it was introduced   in April 2022.  Our 7226 SCAM number is another keystone in the fight to stay ahead of scams and help Telstra’s internal   cyber security team more quickly identify and block emerging scam techniques or threats before they can affect  more Australians. While Telstra blocks millions of scam messages each month, we can’t catch everything. Our technology is  evolving, so it’s important everyone remains vigilant and alert to the rise in scam activity. We all have a part to  play in helping secure our personal and private data to help protect it from criminals who want to profit from it.

For more than   20 years Telstra Foundation, our registered  Australian charity, has supported Australian  initiatives focussed on youth education,  mental health and inclusion.  Via philanthropy, we bring Telstra’s purpose to life for  young people, particularly those who are marginalised  or face significant challenges and unfair barriers. Today, we fund technology-enabled projects that  tackle some of the biggest social challenges facing  young people with the goal to:   •  improve youth mental wellbeing (SDG Goal 3)    •  close the youth education and learning divide  (SDG Goal 4)    •  empower young people for climate action   (SDG Goal 13).  Underpinning this work is the belief that all young  people should have the same opportunity to thrive  and that where they live, their socio-economic status,  cultural background, gender and ability should never  be a barrier to them accessing education, to their  wellbeing or feeling empowered to act on climate.  All our projects and programs put young people in the  driver’s seat, empowering them to be the designers  and creators, as well as the consumers of the tech we  enable. We champion co-design approaches to ensure  the needs of disadvantaged young people shape the  digital products and services that are meant for them.  This year, we worked with eight charity and   social enterprise partners, committing $5.3 million  through the Foundation to support community  programs and partnerships. Over $840,000 from   Telstra shareholders and employees programs was   also donated to Foundation partners to amplify our  mission. Six longstanding partner projects were  acquitted, and we onboarded 12 new social innovation  projects as part of our new Young & Connected Fund  which focuses on youth wellbeing and education. We  scaled up our free, nationwide Code Club Australia  program, engaging more than 40,000 young people   via our Moonhack campaign to get kids coding.   We also continued to support the Healthy Country  AI Training initiative as part of Telstra Reconciliation  Action Plan (RAP) commitments. Innovation is the key to unlocking the technology’s  full potential. We invest in partners who develop  their own innovative ideas and solutions, providing  them with opportunities to tap into our time, talent  and resources to help bring those ideas to life. For  example, we teamed up with Telstra’s data science  community (Helix) via our Data4Good initiative to  host the ClimateWatch Validation Blitz. In June 2023,  Telstra volunteers validated over 3,000 community  data submissions, breaking last year’s record in an  extraordinary effort that will help scientists, policy  makers, environmental planners, land managers and  industry to make informed decisions on our climate.  This program won the international CDO magazine/ EDM Council Data 4 Good Award for Climate Action.  Collectively, our work continues to make a significant  contribution to Telstra’s target to lift the digital  skills of 500,000 Australians by FY25, and through  philanthropy, amplifies diversity and inclusion issues  supported by Telstra.   ===== PAGE 55 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 55 Creating a better digital world Case Study How we’re supporting youth   mental health and wellbeing  We partnered with Orygen Digital to fund the development  and pilot of Mello, a groundbreaking smartphone app to  empower young people to manage their mental health  proactively by using practical, science-backed techniques.  Developed alongside young people. Mello works by  addressing the root cause of anxiety and depression;  repetitive negative thinking, or 'stuck thinking.' The app  provides evidence-based activities that offer in-the-moment  relief from negative thoughts, while also building skills to break the cycle of negative thinking long term.   Users can track their mood and receive tailored therapy activity recommendations through check-ins and   access evidence-based therapy activities to improve their mental wellbeing.   Adverse mental health costs the Australian economy $40 billion annually, and young people represent the  demographic with the largest burden of disease. Almost 40 per cent of young Australians have experienced  a mental health disorder in the last year, with depression and anxiety being the most common. Young people  suffering from adverse mental health conditions are 40 per cent less likely to complete high school and three  times more likely to be unemployed in adulthood. It’s also known that seeking help, getting access to support,  and engagement with mental health treatment are major challenges for young people. Of the half that gain  access to evidence-based treatment, 40 per cent drop out.  In Mello’s randomised controlled trial, young people with clinical levels of depression and/or anxiety and  problems with repetitive negative thinking used the app for six weeks and the results were compared to a control  group. The study found that the Mello group showed greater relief from depression, anxiety, repetitive negative  thinking and wellbeing than the control group. 82 per cent of Mello users experienced less anxiety, 79 per cent  were less depressed, and 83 per cent had less repetitive negative thinking.  Users are welcome to download Mello and try the app out here.   Image: Mello – a smart phone app to manage “stuck thinking”   Case Study How we’re supporting digital skills  training for Indigenous Rangers Across the world, First Nations peoples manage more  than 80 per cent of vital ecosystems and threatened  species. In Australia, about four million square kilometres  of combined land and sea Country are Indigenous-titled  lands. That’s over half of Australia’s total land area. At the  same time, First Nations peoples face many challenges in  land management. Climate change, for one, is accelerating  species extinctions and ecosystem losses. Such threats   are also increasing in scale and urgency.   We are funding North Australian Indigenous Land & Sea Management Alliance (NAILSMA) and CSIRO, Australia's  leading science agency, to deliver the Healthy Country AI Training initiative. This multi-year partnership trains young  Indigenous Rangers and practitioners to use artificial intelligence (AI) in caring for Country in five First Nations  communities across Kakadu, Arnhem Land and Cape York in partnership with Indigenous Rangers, Traditional  Owners, and community practitioners. The training also empowers young Indigenous women rangers to engage with  digital technologies and data collection, analysis, and use their digital skills to adaptively manage their lands.

We are harnessing technology, digital and connectivity  solutions to accelerate action on climate change and  minimise our impact on the planet. We are committed  to leading by example and using our scale and voice  to accelerate the transition to a more environmentally  sustainable world. We are driven to make a difference  beyond our business by encouraging and enabling our  customers, suppliers and communities to do the same. Governance  The Telstra Board is responsible for overseeing our  environment strategy and monitoring our performance  against that strategy. In FY23, we incorporated our  scope 1+2 absolute emissions reduction target into  the performance measures for our Executive Variable  Remuneration Plan (EVP), making it a component  of senior executive short-term incentives under our  remuneration structure. This recognises the critical  nature of this target to our organisation’s success   and each team member’s role to achieve it.  For more information about our approach, please see  our Sustainability at Telstra: In focus paper available   on our reports page.  For information about our climate change governance,  please see the Understanding our climate risk (our  TCFD disclosure) section of our 2023 Annual Report  available on our reports page.  Risk management Telstra’s risk management framework provides  the foundations and key processes for identifying,  assessing and managing environmental risks. We  maintain a register of risks and plans to mitigate them.  Our risk register is a living document, and all risks are  reviewed on a regular basis. Climate change is a key  risk for Telstra and we are working to mitigate and  adapt to its impacts through our environment strategy. For information about our climate change risk  management, please see the Understanding our  climate risk (our TCFD disclosure) section of our   2023 Annual Report available on our reports page.

A detailed program of work has been launched to align  environment data processes and controls with the aim to quantitatively disclose the Digicel Pacific impact in our FY24 reporting. 11   This is significantly ahead of the trajectory required to reach our target of 50 per cent by 2030, however there is still some risk relating to the scope 3 target   – see the Understanding our climate risk section of our 2023 Annual Report for more information. 12   In addition, we have now contracted renewable energy volumes equivalent to over 80 per cent of our consumption. There is a risk that the operational output  of those projects will not reach the equivalent of 100 per cent of our consumption by the end of 2025. At this stage we believe it is more likely than not that this  target will be achieved by that date. See the Understanding our climate risk section of our 2023 Annual Report for more information. 13   The Digicel Pacific acquisition closed in FY23. Digicel Pacific has been excluded from Telstra’s circular economy reporting in FY23 as we have not yet been able  to compile timely and suitable data. A detailed program of work has commenced with the aim of progressively reporting relevant Digicel Pacific circular economy  data in future periods.  14   From September 2023, we are increasing our device recycling target to reuse or recycle 650,000 mobile phones, modems and other devices each year to 2025   (our previous target was 500,000 each year).  15  From September 2023, we are increasing our network waste recycling rate target to 90 per cent by 2025 (our previous target was 85 per cent by 2025).

They are measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent  emissions (tCO2e). The emissions inventory encompasses Telstra’s Australian and  international operations (other than Digicel Pacific). 17   The sum of individual entries may be slightly different to totals/subtotals due   to rounding. 18   Network category includes all network-related sites including unmetered sites and  data centre services hosted at Telstra exchanges. This consists of all scope 1+2  emissions allocated to the Telstra network, based on premises or activity end use. To us, addressing climate change means  taking ambitious steps to decarbonise our  business, and helping our customers and  suppliers do the same.   We are a member of the United Nations Global  Compact’s Business Ambition for 1.5°C, pledging   to help limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C above   pre-industrial levels.   We are committed to achieving net zero greenhouse  gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, aligned with the Paris  Agreement. To achieve this, we have set an emissions  reduction target that has been validated by the   Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as aligned   to a trajectory to limit global warming to 1.5°C.  Decarbonise Telstra In FY23, we achieved a 19 per cent reduction in our   scope 1+2 GHG emissions compared to the previous  year and have achieved a cumulative 30 per cent  reduction against our baseline year of FY19. We  achieved this by improving the energy efficiency of  our network and our infrastructure, accelerating the  decommissioning of legacy technology and leveraging  the reduced emissions intensity of the electricity grid  as the use of renewable energy increases.

During FY23, Telstra branded mobile plans and   mobile broadband plans were also certified carbon  neutral. This is in addition to our current product   level certification for Telstra’s Belong mobile   offering. Our investment complements our focus   on decarbonising our operations, the electricity   grid and the economy. For more information,   read our article on Telstra Exchange.  We consider the use of carbon credits to be a  useful mechanism for directing investment towards  accelerating action to avoid or reduce emissions  outside our control. While we are working to reduce   our own scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, we are committed  to offsetting any remaining emissions. The approach   of first reducing then offsetting emissions is aligned   to the Australian Government’s Climate Active  framework and is what we mean when we refer to  ourselves as carbon neutral. Each year, we retire   carbon credits to meet our current and projected  carbon neutral certification commitments.  In FY23, to maintain Telstra's carbon neutral  certifications we purchased approximately 2.26 million  carbon credits with over 99 per cent from wind, solar  and energy efficient manufacturing processes in   India, and the remaining volume from savanna burning  projects in Australia. Over the last four years we have  purchased a total of around 8.5 million carbon credits.  We invest in high integrity credits that are sourced  from projects that avoid, reduce or remove emissions  from the atmosphere and deliver positive sustainable  impact. With operations in Australian and international  markets, we recognise the importance of developing  a robust and mature market for sequestration in  Australia, and the value of channelling capital from  developed to developing countries in support of  climate resilience.   For more information about carbon neutral certification  and disclosures, including our carbon credit portfolio,  please see Telstra’s Climate Active Public Disclosure  Statement and Belong's Climate Active Public  Disclosure Statement. To view a detailed breakdown of our carbon credits,  please see our 2023 Data Pack available on our   reports page.  Carbon offset governance All carbon credit purchases follow our Carbon Credit  Acquisition Guideline and align to international best  practice principles, such as the Integrity Council for   the Voluntary Carbon Market’s core carbon principles  and assessment frameworks. This ensures our continued  investment in high integrity credits to achieve positive  sustainable impact. In FY23, our purchasing strategy  and due diligence approach was governed by our Carbon  Neutral Executive Group which consists of executives  from across the company. International and domestic  carbon projects go through a staged assessment  process which considers governance, emissions impact  and sustainable development outcomes. The initial  review ensures projects meet our minimum compliance  requirements regarding carbon credit programs, vintage,  country, methodology and supply chain. Projects are  then assessed against criteria that consider Telstra  policies and strategy, technical review, environment   and social impact, value for money and reputation risk  and exposure.  ===== PAGE 62 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 62 Sustaining our planet Case Study Carbon neutral mobile phone plans   and Telstra Plus points In February we announced that our mobile plans are   100 per cent carbon neutral, as certified by Climate Active.  Ongoing use of the Telstra mobile network connection is  carbon neutral for all Telstra mobile customers. This applies  to all Telstra branded consumer (pre- and post-paid), small  business and enterprise mobile plans and mobile broadband  plans. It includes the carbon emissions of a mobile plan,  including the SIM card and the energy that powers the  Telstra network to make calls and stream content. It does   not include the emissions associated with the physical  handset or device customers use. We also announced that customers could use their Telstra Plus points to help offset their own everyday carbon  emissions by supporting Australian and international climate projects. These offsets are for customers who want  to minimise their own impact and do not count towards our own carbon neutral targets. Customers have used 1.98 million Telstra Plus points to offset 295 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent   emissions in FY23. For more information on our carbon neutral plans please visit our website. For more information on how you can redeem your Telstra Plus points to help offset emissions please visit   our website. Case Study An update on our carbon farm  Our pilot carbon farm at Yarrowyck in northern NSW has  completed the first stage of planting. With our partner  AirSeed, we have planted over 400,000 seed pods across  110 hectares, tagging the location of each one for future  monitoring. By the end of 2023, our goal is to plant 158,000  trees and shrubs, capable of sequestering 160,000 tonnes   of carbon dioxide over the next 25 years. We have built an Internet of Things (IoT) network that  integrates sensors and data from a TAWN (Telstra Advanced  Weather Network) station - providing our planters with  precise information on environmental factors that could  influence their work, from approaching wind and rain to moisture levels in the soil. The farm at Yarrowyck serves a second purpose: the revitalisation and enhancement of the local nature and  biodiversity. Previously a sheep station, once the land is restored to a forest ecosystem, it will become a wildlife  corridor to local animals including wallaroos and wallabies as well as improve the land’s resilience to water   stress and drought. In 2022, we won an Australian Financial Review Sustainability Leaders Award for Innovation. This was in the  Technology, Media and Telecommunications category for our environment strategy and innovative use of   maggot fertiliser in drone seed planting on our carbon farm.

We strive to reduce energy consumption  across every aspect of our business through   considered planning, equipment monitoring and   energy productivity optimisation.   Our network sites, including fixed network sites and  data centres, are our largest consumers of electricity.  We increased our investment in energy reduction  projects, including both energy efficiency and  decommissioning, from $21.1 million in FY22 to over  $49 million in FY23. Our efforts have been recognised  by the National Energy Efficiency Council, who  awarded Telstra InfraCo the 2022 Leading Energy   User Award.  In FY23, these projects included: •  upgrade of 100 power systems with high   efficiency rectifiers •   almost 350 fans upgraded to electronically  commutated fans •   eighteen air conditioning controls and economy  cycle upgrades •   installation of over 170 monitoring and energy  efficiency alarming systems on heating, ventilation  and air conditioning (HVAC) systems  •   replacement of 59,510 fluorescent lights with  33,232 LED lights at 198 sites (recycling 152   tonnes of lighting waste) •   installation of 425 small site cooling managers   and five chilled water-cooling systems, optimised  with demand flow technology •   ninety-eight equipment floors upgraded with  blanking walls and in-rack blanking panels,  meaning our ‘hot aisles’ stay hotter, and our   ‘cool aisles’ stay cooler in our exchange buildings •   upgrade of 263 air conditioners and 245 economy  fans at 269 wireless network sites as well as  installing 781 high efficiency rectifiers. As part   of a trial, we have also installed 35 new model   air conditioning controllers with enhanced  monitoring functionality. In FY23, our energy efficiency programs delivered   a collective annualised saving of 23,485tCO2e and   30,177MWh electricity. In addition to our energy  efficiency projects, we saved a further 79,406tCO2e   and 100,566MWh annualised through decommissioning  network equipment. For a detailed breakdown of our GHG emissions and  energy consumption, please see our 2023 Data Pack  available on our reports page.   ===== PAGE 64 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 64 Sustaining our planet FY23 energy efficiency and decommissioning initiatives Initiative Description Annualised  energy savings  (MWh) Annualised  emissions savings  (tCO2e) HVAC optimisation We conduct physical inspections of our network sites to identify faults affecting power  consumption and review equipment performance to identify optimisation opportunities 3,650 2,872 Building services energy  efficiency upgrades Our capital works program includes the installation of fresh air cooling systems, high  efficiency air-conditioners, improved cooling control strategies and building management,  and electronically commutated fans 12,728 9,532 LED lighting We are currently undertaking a large multi-year program to remove over 100,000 old  fluorescent lights across hundreds of our facilities and install new LED lights with inbuilt  motion sensors 12,675 10,310 Upgrading rectifiers Rectifiers convert electricity from AC mains power to DC power, which is required to run  our telecommunications equipment.

The fuel cells use green hydrogen fuel, which is generated from renewable energy sources.  The trial will enable us to test the suitability of green hydrogen fuel cells to provide additional site power, and  assess their technical and commercial viability to provide reliable extended back up power should mains power  fail. If successful, this technology could enable emissions reductions by avoiding the need for less efficient  diesel-generated power, and reduce the associated risk of environmental harm should a generator leak or fail.  Five sites in regional Victoria are participating in the trial to demonstrate the reliability of renewable hydrogen as  a zero-emissions fuel for generator backup power. Construction is expected to be completed in October 2023.   This trial forms part of the Victorian Government’s aim to help kick-start investment in the renewable hydrogen  sector, working to meet ambitious climate change ambitions to reach its net-zero emissions target by 2045.  ===== PAGE 65 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 65 Sustaining our planet LED Lighting Following extensive trials of LED lighting options from  several suppliers in 2020, a solution was chosen that  provides individual movement sensing per individual  fitting. This reduces the amount of time lights are on  and allows for increased spacing of lights, aligned to  Australian Standards and illumination requirements.  Recycling is a key element of the initiative with the  recycling of redundant fluorescent tubes, batteries  that form part of emergency fittings and the metal   and plastic from the old light fittings. With help from our suppliers, the new lights were also  delivered to site without plastic packaging.  Since 2020, we have removed over 127,760 (71,315   in FY23) fluorescent lights from our fixed network   sites and replaced them with 64,630 (34,736 in FY23)  new LED fittings, reducing energy consumption by  23,522MWh per year. Electric vehicles Telstra has an overall fleet of 6,500 vehicles   consisting of 3,000 operational vehicles, 800 trucks  and 2,700 staff salary sacrifice vehicles. Telstra fleet  vehicles made up approximately two per cent of our   FY23 scope 1+2 greenhouse gas emissions. Over the  past 36 months, we have transitioned over 20 per cent  of our operational fleet to hybrid models to reduce our  fleet emissions. We have expanded our charging footprint over   FY23 with Electric Vehicle (EV) chargers and six EV   pool cars now available at four of our head office  locations, with plans to install additional chargers  across all state head offices by the end of FY24.   Our goal is to convert the bulk of our metro and   some regional operational vehicles to electric when  fit-for-purpose commercial EV fleet market options  increase and charging facilities expand. We have   also introduced the first operational hydrogen fuel   cell vehicle into our fleet. Across our salary sacrifice vehicle fleet, we have seen  exponential growth in EV take up in the last six months  due to changes in Fringe Benefit Tax legislation and  improved supply of consumer EVs. As of the end of  FY23 we had 226 EVs across our salary sacrifice fleet  with another 219 on order. Telstra continues to support  our staff as they purchase EVs for personal use.  Including Telstra pool vehicles and vehicles on order,  Telstra will have over 450 Zero Emissions Vehicles  (ZEVs), making up seven per cent of our fleet. In FY24, we will develop an EV transition strategy   for our metro and regional operational vehicle fleet   to transition from petrol/diesel vehicles to Zero  Emission Vehicles.   Chilled water system  optimisation at   Charlotte Exchange In 2022, we trialled a new chilled water  optimisation technology at Charlotte Exchange  in Brisbane.   The project delivered significant savings through  the installation of additional high accuracy  sensors. The sensors provide real-time feedback  on system performance and requirements.  Variable frequency drives on pumps and fans to  allow the system to optimise the entire chilled  water system in real time relative to load.  This project has reduced the energy consumption  of the chiller system by over 30 per cent. An  additional five systems have been installed in   our large fixed network sites in FY23.  ===== PAGE 66 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 66 Sustaining our planet Managing our scope 3  emissions We recognise that we have a responsibility to  contribute to reducing the GHG emissions produced  by our supply chain when providing us with goods  and services and by our customers when using our  products. These are our scope 3 emissions as defined  in the Corporate Value Chain Accounting and Reporting  Standard of the GHG Protocol. We are committed to  reducing our scope 3 emissions by at least 50 per cent  by FY30 (from a FY19 baseline).  Scope 3 represents Telstra’s largest emissions source,  making up 67 per cent of our total footprint. Of our  total scope 3 emissions, approximately 73 per cent  comes from our supply chain (categories 1, 2 and 4).  We are working with suppliers to identify, prioritise and  execute emissions reduction opportunities to achieve  this target. This includes providing training and support  to suppliers on how to reduce their emissions footprint,  including our climate commitments in commercial  agreements and considering emissions reduction  opportunities in the delivery of their goods and services  to us. Our scope 3 emissions have already decreased  by 28 per cent since FY19. Through decarbonising our supply chain, we have seen  a domino effect where businesses and customers who  operate downstream are now more likely to look for low  carbon alternatives. Suppliers who operate upstream  in our supply chain are more likely to supply low carbon  goods and services to businesses and customers  beyond our supply chain. This helps to drive broader,  sustained climate action across the industry. For more  information, read our article on Telstra Exchange. In 2022, we noted that we were assessing the impact of  retail energy growth in relation to our scope 3 emissions  reduction target. The scaling of our retail energy  products has since been paused. If we make a decision  to scale our energy retail products we will communicate  any material impacts to our scope 3 target.   Working together to   reduce scope 3 emissions Scope 3 emissions, particularly in the Information  Communication and Technology sector where there are  complex supply chains, is an area that requires cross  sector collaboration. We are working with key suppliers  and industry partners to reduce our scope 3 emissions  and drive improvements in environmental practices  throughout the global supply chain. We are co-leading a working group jointly developed  by the GSM Association (GSMA), Global Enabling  Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) and the Technical  Standardization Bureau of the International  Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) to draft industry  specific scope 3 guidance for telecommunication  operators. This guidance is intended to harmonise  methods for telecommunication operators to assess  and report their scope 3 emissions and to increase  its coverage and transparency. We also continue to  work with other telecommunications operators as  part of the Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC) to engage  common suppliers on their emissions reduction targets  and plans. This includes performing site audits by  independent third-party auditors.   Collaborating with our   strategic partners to   reduce emissions We believe that when we pair expertise from across  technology streams with connectivity knowledge,  and with industry and scientific know how, we  can find creative, innovative pathways to reduce  emissions across our network and wider business.  One of the ways we are doing this is through   our relationship with Ericsson, which provides  equipment and technologies that help our  telecommunications networks run. Together with  Ericsson, we are profiling our energy consumption  to better understand our energy baseline. This  has enabled us to understand where the largest  consumption occurs in the network and how we   can optimise efficiency by deploying the latest  hardware and energy saving software features.  With Ericsson, we are working to set commercial  commitments on the delivery of sustainable  hardware and software features across our radio  access network, transport and cloud technologies.  ===== PAGE 67 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 67 Sustaining our planet Supplier emissions  disclosures This year we extended our partnership with the   CDP for a further three years to continue engaging  our suppliers to account for and address their climate  change impacts more effectively. This partnership  enables us to deliver training, tools and support on  environmental disclosures to over 400 suppliers, an  increase from approximately 200 suppliers in 2022.  This covers approximately 80 per cent of our spend. Having a standardised process for disclosure and  a community of supply chain disclosers allows our  climate action to be even more impactful. This year   we joined CO2 AI and CDP to support the development  of the CO2 AI Product Ecosystem. This platform will  enable companies to collaborate and share product  level emissions data. We piloted this platform with   two of our suppliers, Vantiva and Accenture, who are  going further to define, measure and communicate   the carbon footprint associated with the products   they provide Telstra. These insights have enabled   us to improve the sustainability of products, such as  the Telstra Smart Modem 3. We hosted a webinar for  the industry to showcase how this technology can  help manage supply chain data in a smart way and  participated in the COP27 Finance Day to discuss   ways to better track, measure and reduce supply   chain emissions using technology.  In March 2023, we were recognised on the 2022 CDP  Supplier Engagement Leaderboard. We are among the  top eight per cent assessed for supplier engagement  on climate change, based on our 2022 CDP disclosure.  We were also shortlisted for The World Procurement  Awards in Environmental and Social Impact for working  together with suppliers towards a low carbon economy.  This award recognises the procurement function that  is significantly reducing the environmental impact of  their business through innovative and collaborative  approaches across the business and supply base. Most of our emissions are concentrated across a  relatively small number of suppliers. Meaningful  decarbonisation targets and plans from these   suppliers will contribute greatly towards achieving   our scope 3 target. In October 2022, we launched Telstra’s new   standard emissions reduction clause and guidance  for purchases. This new clause requires suppliers  to understand, report, verify, reduce and track their  climate change impacts in support of our 2030 target.  By the end of FY23, 41 suppliers had signed up to these  new clauses which contractually committed them to  disclosing and reducing their absolute emissions.  Decarbonise the grid Telstra is focused on decarbonising the grid through  greater investment in renewable energy, thereby  reducing reliance on non-renewable energy from   fossil fuels.  Our target is to enable renewable energy generation  equivalent to 100 per cent of our consumption by 2025.  To date, we have supported investment in  approximately $1.1 billion worth of renewable   energy under long term Power Purchase Agreements.  These commitments have enabled the construction   of renewable energy projects across Queensland,  Victoria and New South Wales. When these projects   are fully operational, our share of their renewable  energy output will be equivalent to more than   80 per cent of our consumption. In FY23, our renewable energy projects generated  the equivalent of 30 per cent of our consumption,  via output from Emerald Solar Park (70MW capacity  located in Queensland) and Murra Warra Wind Farm  (226MW capacity in Victoria, across all partners).  Construction on the Crookwell III Wind Farm (58MW  capacity in NSW) began in September 2022. In October 2022, we announced our fourth Power  Purchase Agreement for MacIntyre Wind Farm in  southeast Queensland, the largest wind farm in the  southern hemisphere. The agreement secured Telstra  a portion of the MacIntyre Wind Farm’s output with  construction well underway and first energy to the   grid expected in early 2024. The wind farm will use   162 turbines to produce a total of 923MW of renewable  electricity, enough to power the equivalent of   700,000 homes. Telstra will utilise 111MW of the  available 923MW. In June 2023, we contracted our fifth Power Purchase  Agreement for the Munna Creek Solar Farm near  Gympie in Queensland. This agreement secured Telstra  half of the output from the 120MW Munna Creek Solar  Farm. Construction is to commence later this year.  When constructed, the solar farm will produce enough  to power the equivalent of 50,000 homes.  ===== PAGE 68 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 68 Sustaining our planet With a power bill equivalent to 300,000 households,  Telstra’s Power Purchase Agreements also provide  protection against volatile wholesale electricity prices  and help us to manage our costs. We are working to finalise contracts supporting   new renewable energy projects that will be capable  of generating renewable energy equivalent to 100 per  cent of our consumption by 2025. However, utility- scale renewable projects have long lead times to  become operational, with complexity in planning,  construction, and grid connection. More recently, these  factors (especially supply chain issues) have been  exacerbated by COVID-19 and the Ukrainian conflict.  As a result there is a risk that full operational output  from our renewable energy projects may not reach the  equivalent of 100 per cent of our energy consumption  by the end of 2025. At this stage we believe it is more  likely than not that this target will be achieved by that  date and to help mitigate the risk to this target we   will continue to implement projects which reduce   our energy consumption.  For more information see the Understanding our  climate risk section of our 2023 Annual Report  available on our reports page.  Using technology to support   the National Electricity Grid We are continuing to explore innovative and  technology-driven pathways to secure access to  reliable, resilient forms of energy to power our network,  and support the energy grids in which we operate.  We partnered with the South Australian Government  in a Demand Management Pilot project to identify  new ways to utilise existing and new batteries to  support the grid at times of peak demand or instability,  while enhancing the reliability of our own network.  In Western Australia, we have continued our work  with Western Power and Horizon Power to allow the  installation of standalone power systems (largely  operated from renewable energy infrastructure).   This improves our power resilience at sites which   were at high risk of power outages caused by impacts  on the power distribution network, especially during  extreme weather events.    Decarbonise the economy The energy used by Telstra devices, including modems,  comprises approximately eight per cent of our scope  3 emissions. Part of our role in decarbonising the  economy is therefore to ensure we actively identify  opportunities to reduce the energy consumption of our  devices. Since FY19 we have reduced our scope   3 emissions by 28 per cent. The largest contributors  have been reductions in emissions reported by our  suppliers and from customer use of our modems. In FY22, we commissioned Deloitte to prepare an  Enabling Positive Climate Action Report, showcasing  how we can help our customers reduce their emissions.   The Enabling Positive Climate Action Report is  available on our reports page.  For more information, please see the Enabling the  transition for our customers section of this report.  Case Study Helping customers manage   their energy footprint Telstra’s Shapeshifting Hub was launched in 2022  helping 300 customers shift their energy consumption  from periods when renewable energy generation is  low and/or demand is high, to periods when renewable  energy generation is plentiful. In June 2022, we launched the Clean Energy Tracker   to show current and predicted renewable energy levels   in the grid. For more information on the Clean Energy Tracker,  please visit Telstra Energy.  ===== PAGE 69 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 69 Sustaining our planet Adapt to climate impacts Adaptation planning is a process of understanding  and adjusting to the impacts of climate change. This  includes taking action to reduce the negative impacts  of climate change and taking advantage of emerging  opportunities.  We use scenario analysis to understand how our  exposure to climate hazards might change in the  medium to long term. Qualitative and quantitative  scenario analysis has provided us with useful insights  into the nature, scale and impact of our climate related  risks. It has also given us valuable information about  the current and future dynamic change in these risks,  including an understanding of key signposts which  might indicate a change in short-term risk.  The scenario analysis process helps our operations  team understand and plan for the networks changing  exposure to physical climate-related risks.  Actions include:  •  assessing the risk exposure of network sites   to fire, flood and cyclones •   testing infrastructure design standards to   improve resilience •   revising the standards of backup power systems  with the aim of providing longer duration power  reserves to sites deemed at risk •   prioritising lifecycle funding to those sites  assessed at risk. Our exposure to climate-related transition risks is at  its highest in the short to medium term as the global  community accelerates action towards a decarbonised  economy. However, we view these challenges as  opportunities. Our transition to an Agile organisation  has optimised our ability to respond to changing  consumer preferences, embrace new technologies,   and pivot service offerings to better meet the needs  and values of our customers.  For more information on our scenario analysis   and climate risks and opportunities, please see the  Understanding our climate risk (our TCFD disclosure)  section of our 2023 Annual Report available on our  reports page.  Preparing for   natural disasters  Climate change is predicted to cause increasingly   more frequent and severe weather events. It will   impact power distribution networks and intensify   our reliance on portable generators. The increase in bushfire and flood frequency and  severity makes the health, safety and wellbeing of our  staff, contractors and community members the biggest  short-term consideration when assessing our climate  physical risks. We found over 30 per cent of our above ground assets  are currently exposed to at least one climate hazard.  During a severe weather event or disaster, when  connectivity is at its most vital, our infrastructure   can become affected by power outages. Our attempts to distribute backup generators may  be disrupted by the impacts of the natural disaster,  including not being able to get people with specific  skillsets onsite. The Automatic Transfer Unit (ATU) was developed  to improve the flexibility of how we use portable  generators at our sites during AC mains power outages  with the aim of reducing costs and improving power  resilience. The ATUs reduce fuel consumption, simplify  generator deployment process, enable more effective  pre-deployment before known events and improve  visibility of asset performance during events.  Four million dollars in funding has been allocated to  deliver 250 ATUs to sites at risk of natural disasters  over FY23 and FY24. As part of this target 102 ATUs  have been installed in FY23.  For more information on our scenario analysis and  climate risks and opportunities, please see the  Understanding our climate risk (our TCFD disclosure)  section of our 2023 Annual Report available on our  reports page.  ===== PAGE 70 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 70 Sustaining our planet Protecting nature and biodiversity 21    For more information, see the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures, Why nature-related risk and opportunity management matters » TNFD Nature underpins our global economy,   with more than half of the world’s economic  output dependent on it21.  We interact with nature daily, when we construct   or maintain our telecommunications network, or   when we provide technology solutions to customers.  We also depend on resources from nature, such as   the metals and minerals used to manufacture  technology and the wood used to make cardboard   for our product packaging.  As a company with infrastructure spanning across  Australia and overseas, from the most ecologically  rich environments to urban centres, Telstra can play a  unique role in protecting and restoring biodiversity. We  believe that smart data, connectivity and technology  solutions have the potential to help us all better  manage biodiversity loss. We are committed to  exploring ways we can best contribute to restoring and   renewing our natural environment. We continue to investigate our interactions with   nature, and the risks and opportunities they present  so we can better protect it. In FY24, we will assess  the nature-related risks and opportunities across  our business operations, value chain and assets,  with a view to including our most material risks and  opportunities in our FY24 disclosures.   Our ambition is to protect biodiversity in the  environments in which we operate and to harness  technology to regenerate nature. Our investment in  a carbon farm is one way we are trialling technology- based solutions to restore ecosystems and improve  biodiversity outcomes. More information about our carbon farm can be   found in the carbon farm case study on page 62   and in this video.   Project inception Construct Planning Design End-of-life Operate & maintain Opportunity: Connectivity enables enhanced  nature and biodiversity management Risk: Damage to land, habitat, ﬂora,  fauna or matters of cultural heritage Risk: Approvals and  reputational impacts from  works in environmentally or  culturally sensitive areas Opportunity: Design and  route management to avoid  damage to environmentally  or culturally sensitive areas Risk: Mismanagement  of waste during  decommissioning works Risk: Infrastructure failure  causing environmental harm  (diesel, hydraulic oil) Key nature and biodiversity risks and opportunities across the infrastructure lifecycle  ===== PAGE 71 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 71 Sustaining our planet Case Study Interacting with nature and biodiversity across our   infrastructure lifecycle From emus taking shelter in the shade of our buildings and vehicles, to bees making hives in our network   huts and snakes enjoying the warmth of our pits, our field techs encounter and interact with animals every   day while working to keep Australia connected.  We work in every environment you can imagine in Australia: the desert, the Daintree, remote National Parks,   the islands of the Torres Strait and under the sea on our subsea cable network. Connectivity solutions are   a powerful enabler of nature-positive outcomes, but they also take a lot of infrastructure and network  equipment to operate and that can present risks to nature and biodiversity.  The way we consider, plan for and work with nature looks different at each stage of our infrastructure lifecycle.  When we plan for new or major upgrades to existing infrastructure, we consider the need to work in  environmentally sensitive locations. This means employing the best methods for design and construction   to reduce the risk of harm to habitats, flora and fauna as well as areas of cultural significance. We also   consider how we can help regenerate nature by managing soil and erosion risk, and remediating and   revegetating land as we go.  We also interact with flora and fauna on a daily basis – our infrastructure can make a warm, safe home   for many animals. We help our people understand what to do when interacting with animals, to keep them   and the animals safe (and our infrastructure protected from damage, where we can).  As the climate changes, we are seeing increasingly frequent severe weather events. Connectivity and  technology solutions are key to monitoring weather, and to planning and effectively responding to natural  disasters. Our infrastructure can also offer access pathways to remote parts of the country to help respond   to bushfires and other events.  Modern biodiversity management and restoration relies on data, increasingly collected by sensors   and robots and processed by computers. By connecting Australia, we are also enabling researchers,  park rangers, conservation organisations and citizen scientists to carry out their important work.  ===== PAGE 72 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 72 Sustaining our planet Progressing a circular economy                        22     See About e-waste | Environment Protection Authority Victoria   (epa.vic.gov.au)                        23     Find out more about what devices can be recycled in stores here   Recycling (telstra.com.au)                        24     Estimated number of electronic products stored in Australian homes   sourced from MobileMuster. Telstra is committed to embedding circular  economy principles in how we design,  develop, manage and operate our networks -  as well as the products we put out to market.   This year, we stepped up our environmental ambition  to improve our use of resources, reduce waste going  to landfill and create innovative solutions to reduce  our environmental impact across the lifecycle of our  networks and products. E-waste is growing three times  faster than general waste streams.22 As a leader in the  telecommunications and technology sector, we are  committed to doing our part.   Our strategy has been designed to focus on both   the resources we use and the waste generated by our  operations, as well as the waste we generate from the  manufacturing, distribution and use of our products.  We are proud of our ambitious approach to improving  our use of natural resources, because we know that   by leading change across our organisation, we can   also help our customers, suppliers, contractors and   partners do the same.23 Devices and packaging  Australians are storing an estimated 38 million24  electronic devices in their homes. We are helping   our customers reduce the number of unwanted   devices in their homes and businesses by making it  easier for this technology to be reused or recycled.  Enabling valuable precious metals and materials in   old technology to re-enter the economy reduces  reliance on extracting raw materials, resulting in a  positive and wide-reaching environmental impact.  From FY24 we have increased our device target, to  reuse or recycle 650,000 mobile phones, modems  and other devices each year to 2025. Our FY23 target  was 500,000, which we exceeded, reusing or recycling  632,919 mobile phones, modems and other devices.  We are designing solutions based on circular economy  principles for our products so we can keep materials in  circulation for as long as possible. We are working to  increase the lifespan of mobile devices and modems  through our repair, refurbish, reuse and trade-in  programs and responsibly recycling devices that have  reached the end of their useful life. We do this via the  Telstra eCycle program, which offers solutions for  electronic devices - recovering materials for recycling,  all while ensuring any data is securely wiped.  We have made it easier for our customers to   recycle their old devices by accepting more types   of devices.  They can do this at any Telstra store or   via our free eParcel option if they can’t make it into   one of our stores.  This year the Telstra eCycle program collected 632,919  devices from customers to be reused or responsibly  recycled. We repurposed 254,133 customer devices  that were used and/or obsolete. We also recycled  378,786 devices through the Telstra eCycle program   via MobileMuster and other partners.   Devices that can be recycled23  •  mobiles •  tablets •  mobile batteries and chargers •  mobile wireless internet devices •  mobile accessories, such as headsets •  modems and routers •  home phones •  smart watches and fitness trackers •  VR headsets and accessories.   ===== PAGE 73 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 73 Sustaining our planet For example, in FY23 we: •  recycled 134,002 mobile phones, 18,619 modems  and 139,460 other devices (mobile accessories,  tablets, smart home devices, home phones and  Internet of Things devices) through MobileMuster •   collected 2,666 mobile phones, 20,671 modems  and 8,629 other devices through the Telstra’s   CT Muster program •   partnered with Kingfisher Mobile Australia via  trade-in and upgrade programs, empowering  customers to return 83,225 old or out of   contract devices  •   collected 67,917 mobile phones through   our Repurpose & Replace program for  refurbishment and reuse. We can utilise   this stock as customer replacement devices   in instances of warranty returns •   recycled 51,089 modems through our warehouse  inventory management program •   recovered 31,481 modems via our modem returns  and refurbishment program (launched in FY23)  aimed at extending the lifespan of our modems  •   collected 71,510 smartphones, tablets and other  information and communications technology (ICT)  through Moorup with 79 per cent reused and   21 per cent recycled •   recovered 3,291 enterprise customer managed  services equipment for reuse and recycling •   donated 359 repurposed phones to people in need.   This work is all part of supporting a more circular  economy for the resources we consume – from the  phones, tablets and other electronic devices we put  out to market to the equipment we operate that our  customers rely on to access our network. Case Study A smarter design for our   Smart Modem 3 As we find innovative ways to make tech more  sustainable and build on our environmental  commitments, we are excited to now be using   recycled plastics in our Smart Modem 3.  To minimise the environmental impact of the new  generation Telstra Smart Modem 3, we: •  reduced the number of ancillary items included   with the modem, including all the extra cables   that always end up in a junk drawer. The   cumulative length of these cables is equivalent   to the distance between Sydney and Byron Bay!25 •  removed all unnecessary plastics in our modems, right down to the clingfilm on the logo •  changed the enclosure from white to black, which allowed us to use more than 80 per cent recycled plastics  (being increased to 95 per cent) •  undertook a proof of concept where we used plastics from end-of-life modems, recovered by the   Telstra eCycle takeback program, to build new modems. To our knowledge, this proof of concept is an  industry/global first.  In 2023, we won an Australian Financial Review Sustainability Leaders Innovation Award, in the category of  Telecommunications, Media and Technology for the Telstra Smart Modem 3. This is the second year we have   won this category.   For more information, read our article on Telstra Exchange. 25  Calculations are based on the length of the ethernet cable which is 1.5m and the estimated number of smart modems shipped in FY22.   ===== PAGE 74 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 74 Sustaining our planet Modem refurbishment  program Customers can now return their old modems, at   no cost to them, using our newly launched modem  eParcel returns. All Telstra Smart Modem 2 and 3   units will now be assessed for refurbishment and   when they have reached the end of their useful life,  they’ll be recycled responsibly.  Customers who contact our Telstra team about a  modem fault and require a replacement will now  automatically receive an eParcel SMS and/or email   to return their faulty modem. In FY23, we refurbished, repackaged and redistributed  15,008 modems. To meet our strict privacy standards, customer data   is removed from the recovered modems. They are then  tested, cleaned, re-kitted and redeployed. This means  when customers have warranty issues, we can send  them a refurbished modem that is like new. Where a modem is unable to be refurbished for reuse,  customer data is removed, and it’s responsibly   recycled or disposed. These capabilities provide benefits to our customers,  our Telstra teams and the environment. For more information read our article on Telstra  Exchange.  Recovering equipment from  our enterprise customers  We partner with social enterprise, PonyUp for Good,  to recover Telstra and Telstra client technology and  uniforms for reuse or recycling. PonyUp then donates  50 per cent of profits to SecondBite, Australia’s largest  fresh food charity.  In FY23, we teamed up with PonyUp to recover over  9,252kg of obsolete Telstra equipment and we diverted  1,367kg of uniforms from landfill.  We recycled 6,364kg of company monitors. Ninety   two per cent of this equipment was reused, the  remainder recycled, enabling 95 per cent of material   to be recovered. Through this program alone, 12,954  meals were donated through SecondBite to help   those in need. We also donated 7,964 universal power cords weighing  2,705kg and 183kg of equipment from warehouses to  PonyUp ensuring they found a suitable reuse channel,  enabling 4,072 meals to be delivered via SecondBite   to people across Australia doing it tough.  Through our uniform recycling program we diverted  1,367kg of old Telstra uniform items from landfill.  Anything suitable for reuse has been debadged,  removing Telstra's logo and tags and a suitable next  use path found or donated to Vinnies to find another  home. Items not suitable for reuse will be shredded   and used as stuffing in couches and other furniture.  This program has donated 3,375 fresh meals to  SecondBite, which is five meals for every kilogram of  uniform items collected by our Field Services Team.  Telstra's on-going partnership with PonyUp has now  delivered more than 124,747 meals via SecondBite. Number of devices reused/recycled                       R R M      Image: In-store sustainability walls  ===== PAGE 75 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 75 Sustaining our planet Sustainable packaging Every year, we use over 970,000kg of packaging to  deliver our products. We want to help our customers  responsibly reuse or recycle our packaging rather  than it ending up in landfill. Packing our Telstra-branded  products We are committed to optimising the resources we   use, reducing consumption and waste across our  business, and investing in circular solutions that are  designed to be sustainable across their lifecycle. In October 2022, we met our commitment   for 100 per cent of Telstra branded packaging   to be made of renewable or recycled   material and be fully recyclable, two months  ahead of the December 2022 target.  Together with our design creative partners and  sustainability experts Birdstone, we transformed  packaging and branding of nearly 100 products to  ensure they are fully recyclable. We have integrated  sustainability metrics, including conducting material  assessments and collecting compliance information  from suppliers. We assess all packaging components  as part of this process and use this to build packaging  and design optimisation once we complete our concept  work. We also use the Australian Packaging Covenant  Organisation’s (APCO) Packaging Recyclability  Evaluation Portal (PREP) Analysis Tool for all new  and upcoming device packaging. All packs contain  APCO’s Australasian Recycling Label to make correct  disposal easy for our customers. We have introduced  sustainable packaging principles for our Telstra- branded products and released a new and improved  Telstra-branded packaging design to help customers  know what can be recycled and how. During the process we overhauled entire product  categories to redesign and simplify the unboxing  experience. An example of this is accessories  packaging where each pack was originally made of   11 separate components, weighed approximately   50g and was not kerbside recyclable. Our new  accessory packs are made up of an average of   2 components, weigh approximately 11g and are   100 per cent kerbside recyclable. Vantage and Frontline: Recycling and  marketing We want our customers’ experiences to reflect  our commitment to the environment. In August  2022, we hosted the Frontline conference  for our customer facing teams. We invited  attendees to bring in their old tech for recycling  and we collected 2,179 devices, including  handsets, accessories and modems. As we  achieved the target of 2,000 devices we set  ourselves, we donated $4,000 to EarthWatch   via the Telstra Foundation.  At Vantage, our conference for Enterprise  customers, we went fully digital with no paper  flyers, used edible coffee cups throughout  the event (avoiding 12,000 coffee cups from  landfill), designed our stands from paper  or cardboard and reused merchandise and  banners. Where banners couldn’t be reused  or recycled, we shredded them for reuse as  mattress filler. We also used washable utensils  and donated all excess food waste to the  Mathew Talbot Hostel. Sustainability Walls In FY23 we trialled eWaste Sustainability Walls  at four stores across the country: North Sydney  (NSW), Warriewood (NSW), Camberwell (VIC)  and Queen St Mall (VIC). These walls included  a collection box for people to recycle devices,  such as mobile phones, smartwatches and  more. We plan to extend this trial in FY24. Bring back bonus As part of our 2022 Christmas campaign,  customers were awarded an extra 5,000 Telstra  Plus points when they traded in or recycled an  eligible device. Customers could drop in store  or send end-of-life devices via eParcel. Across  November and December 2022, customers  recycled 35,000 devices.  ===== PAGE 76 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 76 Sustaining our planet   To improve the recyclability of our packaging,   we have included:  •   Kraft Board exteriors that are instantly  recognisable as recyclable and encourage  consumers to focus on kerbside recycling •   zero plastics. Hard plastics have been replaced  with fibreboard, plastic bags with tissue paper,  cable ties with fixed Velcro ties, and plastic  stickers with paper •   water-based inks and aqueous varnishes.   This means there won’t be any chemicals  restricting the recyclability of the cardboard •  an Australasian Recycling Label which helps  customers know how to do their part by   recycling safely. We have worked alongside many of our suppliers to  guide them towards more sustainable packaging. As a  result of our progress, we were asked by the APCO to  co-host a session for over 200 APCO members on our  success in achieving packaging optimisation through  sustainable design.  In FY23, we won the Telecommunications Industry  Sector Award for this year's APCO Annual Awards. We  have also been recognised by several packaging design  organisations around the world and won 11 awards for  our sustainability and design achievements. Telstra’s sustainable packaging has received awards  from: Australian Graphic Design Association Awards  (two), Australasian Packaging Innovation & Design  (PIDA) Awards (four), Australian Packaging Covenant  Organisation Industry Awards, Good Design Australia  Awards, Penta Awards, Transform Magazine Awards,  and WorldStar Global Packaging Awards. For more information read our article on Telstra  Exchange.  Improving waste   and recycling This year we increased our network waste recycling  rate target to 90 per cent by June 2025 (our previous  target was 85 per cent by June 2025).  In FY23, our network waste recycling rate was   79 per cent.  To meet this target, we are working with industry  partners and customers to recover technology and  other e-waste for reuse and recycling.  Our focus remains on areas where we can affect the  greatest change for our people and stakeholders,  including reviewing our waste infrastructure and  building awareness and education of our teams and  external delivery partners and customers who use  our sites. In FY23, we worked with partner Veolia to  improve our signage on bins to help identify correct  distribution practices, including recycling and landfill.  We are also recovering e-waste as we upgrade our  network, identifying reuse opportunities for legacy  technology, working with suppliers to extend the life  of network technology and exploring opportunities  to recycle industry-specific equipment. We have  conducted network equipment recycling trials at   seven network facility sites, recovering and recycling  55,723kg of metals and e-waste. Waste from network sites (tonnes)   and recycling (%)           R                                          ===== PAGE 77 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 77 Sustaining our planet Recovering network  technology As technology advances and telecommunications   needs change at a rapid pace, the equipment we need   to operate our network also changes. We are committed  to identifying and recovering valuable resources for  reuse or recycling and, where we can, recovering these  materials back into our operations for reuse. 3G recovery In FY22, we undertook work to recover 3G spares,  including radio access network (RAN) radios and  remote integrated multiplexer printed circuit boards  (RIM PCBs) to fulfill ongoing demand. These programs  continued through FY23.  In FY23, we have recovered more than 4,800 RAN  (3G) spares to fix network faults. This resulted in  over 31 tonnes of network waste being diverted from  landfill. Since 2021, more than 5,400 spares have been  recovered through this program resulting in almost  35,000kg of e-waste avoiding landfill. This program will deliver $2.2 million in savings, by  increasing our spares pool and avoiding operational  costs. In addition to this we are avoiding valuable  resources going into landfill, keeping materials in  circulation and creating commercial value by selling  surplus spares onto the grey market. Valuable materials are extracted from redundant 3G  equipment, assessed for damage, cleaned, labelled and  then stored at our warehouses for use as spare parts to  repair network faults. Through this process, more than  3,500 3G radios and other components were recovered,  and 1,800 components were supplied to fix network  faults and reused for network maintenance activities.  We also distributed almost 500 components nationally  with a focus on regional and remote areas to improve  network fault restoration times. We have also avoided  25 tonnes of equipment going to landfill recovering an  estimated value of $1.1 million of 3G equipment. Roadside cabinets A Remote Integrated Multiplexer (RIM) is a roadside  cabinet technology that provides PSTN services to  Telstra customers in non-nbn areas. The nbn rollout has  meant there is a decreasing need for this technology.  At the same time, Telstra still needs to maintain and  support more than 3,000 of these cabinets nationally,  predominantly in regional and rural areas. To maintain  reliability, Telstra has been undertaking a program to  recover spare components from unused RIMs for reuse.  In the past 12 months, we have recovered more than  4,600 spares to fix network faults. This resulted in 7.5  tonnes of network waste being diverted from landfill.  Since 2021, Telstra has fully supported 100 per cent of  RIM fault maintenance work without having to procure  or repair any spare parts. More than 6,600 spares have  been recovered through this program resulting in more  than 10,000kg of e-waste avoiding landfill. In total over 12,000 parts totalling over 45 tonnes have  been diverted from landfill through these initiatives. Copper recovery For most of our 140-year history we have used   copper to deliver our landlines and connect people  across our telecommunications network. We are  looking at ways to recycle copper that is no longer  required from our network. Our copper cable recovery program is underway and  resulted in 13,930 tonnes of metal recycled in FY23.   The various metals extracted (such as aluminium,  copper and lead) avoided emissions and waste from  mining new metals. Exchange e-waste recovery In April 2023, we ran a Clean Up Exchange Day  at all our Australian Exchanges. More than  250 people were involved across 65 different  sites. We partnered with PonyUp to engage,  clean and organise our exchanges, including  recycling branded Telstra uniforms and Small  Pair Gains Systems (SPGS). We recycled 375kg  of uniforms through PonyUp for Good.    ===== PAGE 78 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 78 Sustaining our planet Enabling the transition   for our customers 26 For more information see the Enabling Positive Climate Action Report available at our report website.  27  See the full report for further detail on key assumptions and qualifications across reported figures. To reduce our carbon footprint, we have been  changing the way we do business – from  piloting experimental tech at our carbon farm,  to leveraging smart solutions across our  operations, we believe digital technologies  have a crucial role to play in helping  businesses reduce their emissions. As Australia’s largest telecommunications and  technology provider, we see a significant opportunity  to help our customers and society transition to a  lower carbon future by accelerating the adoption of  innovative emissions-avoiding technologies. The Enabling Positive Climate Action Report by  Deloitte Access Economics analyses the impact of  Telstra’s products and services by looking at our  enablement potential. This quantifies the emissions  avoided by our customers using our products and  services when compared to our own emissions.   The calculations reveal the overall contribution   Telstra can make towards a lower carbon future. The results Deloitte determined that in 2021, we enabled our  customers to avoid 2.7 million tonnes of carbon   dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions, comparable  to taking 820,000 cars off Australian roads each  year. Deloitte’s findings estimate that by 2030 our  enablement factor will be 6.9. That means for every  tonne of CO2e we emit, we would help our customers  avoid 6.9 tonnes of CO2e emissions through the use  of our products and services26 – the equivalent of  reducing the number of cars on Australian roads by   1.3 million each year27. By 2030, it is estimated we   can cumulatively help customers avoid an incredible   41 million tonnes of CO2e. To put this into context, our potential contribution   to avoiding emissions is nationally significant – it’s   the equivalent of about one per cent of the average  annual reduction in emissions required to meet  Australia’s reduction target of 43 per cent below   2005 levels by 2030. Enablement framework                                                                                                                        M                                                         R     R       M         R                                                                                 In 2021, Telstra enabled its customers to avoid 2.4 tonnes of CO2e for every one tonne emitted in Australia. By 2030, Telstra’s enablement factor will increase to 6.9. That is,  6.9 tonnes of CO2e will be avoided for every one tonne emitted by Telstra in 2030. Avoided emissions: Telstra enables avoided emissions from 11 key uses of technology. These uses avoid emissions across six major sources of emissions in the economy. Telstra's emissions: Telstra’s Australian scope 1 and 2 emissions decrease from  1.1 MtCO2e in 2021 to 0.6 MtCO2e by 2030 to meet its climate targets by 2030 ©2022 Deloitte Access Economics. Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Deloitte profiled the impact of Telstra’s digital technologies  ===== PAGE 79 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 79 Sustaining our planet Breaking this down further While the science on climate change is clear,   for many businesses and government organisations,  the pathway to reducing emissions is not. Increasing  the adoption of new technologies such as smart  HVAC, fleet management, remote working and cloud  technologies are some of the ways Australia’s offices,  supply chains and warehouses can become greener.

Vicki Brady We’ve all experienced the world changing dramatically  in recent years and know the rate of change is only  increasing. The disruption of the next decade is  already on our doorstep – we're all grappling with  macroeconomic headwinds, cost of living challenges,  geopolitical shifts and instability, supply chain  disruption, climate change, rapid technology change  and the growing threat from cyber-crime. We also have a transition and disruption underway in  regional Australia, thanks to COVID-driven migration,  the impacts of a changing climate, and industry  transformation. Telstra is a purpose-led organisation – our role in using  technology to create a more sustainable and inclusive  world underpins all the work we do in order to: •	 	help ensure communities in cities and  regions prosper  •	 	transform industries to be more productive,  competitive, and sustainable  •	 	build foundations to support emerging  technologies that will fuel growth and help  address challenges, like the impacts of  a changing climate.  We see the future as one where connected  technologies and services will provide the foundation  for our economy and our society. The telco industry  is an essential enabler of this future, and we've been  vocal in encouraging our industry to think about the  larger opportunities we can create by working together.  Technologies like machine learning, data and  artificial intelligence, IoT and high-speed networks  can help address many of the challenges our world  is facing – especially as they all work together to  increase their impact. These technologies also need  to be carefully managed to ensure they create positive  change, with minimal negative effects, and the  benefits are shared widely.  This means working closely with our partners to  drive sustainability, and in turn be driven by their  innovations. Collaboration is key to creating a more  sustainable and inclusive world, and we're leveraging  our resources, expertise, and networks to drive  meaningful change beyond our own operations.  We know that we play a role in driving sustainability in  the wider community, and so we actively engage with  customers, employees, suppliers, and stakeholders  to promote sustainable practices and collaborate on  sustainability initiatives.  This report shows how the principles of sustainability  are fundamental to the way we operate.  ” ” Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 4 Sustainabiity at Telstra  ===== PAGE 5 ===== Our commitment and  contribution takes many forms:  Facing climate challenges together  The science is clear. Climate change is adversely  impacting our economy, environment, communities  and individuals. The time to turn things around is now,  and it can be done if we work together. As Australia’s  largest telecommunications provider, we remain  focused on delivering on our climate change and  energy use goals. We are also helping our customers  and society transition to a lower carbon future by  accelerating the adoption of innovative emissions- avoiding technologies.  Designing for a better environment  Each year, we use 970,000 kilograms worth of  packaging to deliver our products to customers.  As we move towards being more sustainable and  environmentally aware, this is an area where we can  continue to make significant impact with some small  changes. In FY23, we achieved our goal of having  all Telstra branded packaging made of renewable or  recycled material and fully recyclable. These changes  to packaging are just the start for us – we’re also  aiming to recycle or reuse over 650,000 phones,  modems and other devices each year to 2025.  Our second goal is to increase our network waste  recycling rate to 90 per cent by 2025. Leading the way with reconciliation  and inclusion  We recognise and accept that we've not always  lived up to the ambition in our vision for reconciliation.  In our Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) launched in  July 2022, we talk about our past mistakes, how our  previous RAP was revoked, and the comprehensive  corrective steps we've taken in response to  inappropriate selling to Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander customers. The RAP also includes wide  ranging initiatives to improve connectivity, to build  cultural awareness amongst our people, and increase  employment and procurement opportunities for  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This is  all part of getting us back on the right path. Telstra  supports the Uluru Statement from the Heart, which  calls for the establishment of a First Nations Voice to  Parliament in the Australian Constitution. Guided by  our First Nations Strategy, we're taking a leadership  position in educating our people on the Voice to  Parliament, to increase understanding and recognition  of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures,  histories, knowledge, and rights.   Advancing online safety, privacy and security  Cyber-crime is on the rise, but so are the cyber security  and safety capabilities developed by us, our peers and  government. We know that it’s critical we take action  to help our customers trust in the connectivity we  provide, so we’re driven every day to help make digital  experiences safer. This has included reviewing and  changing how we retain personal ID data, and joining  forces with CBA to help protect customers from phone  scams. We’ve also blocked hundreds of millions of  scam calls and texts from reaching our customers  each year. We recently introduced a way for Telstra  customers who receive scam texts to forward them to  7226 (SCAM) to help us identify and block emerging  scam techniques. Building partnerships to collectively  drive change  Our strategic partnership with Microsoft was  expanded into a five-year agreement to drive  growth and value for customers and Australia as a  nation. We're working together to boost Microsoft’s  connectivity on Telstra’s leading Asia-Pacific subsea  cable network, harness cloud capabilities and  collaborate on new product offerings and future  ways of working. Our collaborations aim to improve  sustainability outcomes in Australia and enable Telstra  to meet its own commitments. We also announced a  deal with Quantium in December 2022 to form a new  venture aligned to Telstra’s T25 strategy, which will  help unlock the value of data and artificial intelligence  for Telstra and its customers. Working to build digital inclusion  While the digital economy is generating incredible  social, cultural and economic benefits for many  Australians, these benefits are not being shared  equally. Too many Australians, and particularly those  in vulnerable circumstances, are at risk of being left  behind in the digital age, thus becoming even more  marginalised. The challenges and barriers to increased  digital inclusion need to be addressed by us all,  including governments and businesses, communities  and individuals. Telstra contributes to meeting this  challenge by building access through our network  investment, ensuring affordable products and services  are available, and supporting a range of programs to  build digital skills, particularly for people aged over  65 and First Nations communities who are among the  least digitally included Australians.  Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 5 Sustainabiity at Telstra  ===== PAGE 6 ===== Providing more coverage to more people in  regional and remote places  As the digital world continues to transform the  way we live and work, having access to reliable  telecommunications, whether through mobile  networks, broadband, or satellite services is critical.  Our mobile footprint stretches across more than  2.7 million square kilometres – around 1 million square  kilometres more mobile network coverage than our  nearest competitor – and reaches 99.6 per cent of the  Australian population. Over the seven years to the  end of FY22, Telstra invested $11 billion in our mobile  network nationally with $4 billion of this invested  in our regional mobile network. We also continue to  participate in co-investment programs, including  drawing upon the $200 million co-investment fund  (for FY22-26) that we announced in May 2021.  Supporting our communities during times  of critical need  As well as serving the community, we're a part of  it. We’re proud of our track record in helping our  customers through the good times and the not so  good. We understand the importance of communities  needing access to network connectivity, especially  in times of crisis. That's why we work extensively  to prepare for disaster seasons. In FY23, our priorities  continued to be ensuring the safety of our people,  protecting and maintaining our infrastructure,  keeping our customers connected and providing  short and long-term assistance measures. We are  also offer international relief packages, helping our  customers stay in touch with friends and family  who are experiencing natural disasters or living in  a conflict zone. We are also committed to helping  people facing cost-of-living pressures by continuing  to offer a range of products, services and programs  to support customers experiencing temporary hardship  or longer-term financial challenges. Lastly, our contribution includes an  ongoing commitment to transparency  and transformation We continue to proudly support the United Nations  Sustainable Development Goals and make progress  towards them. We're a signatory to the United Nations  Global Compact (UNGC) and we are engaged in  supporting its principles – on human rights, labour  rights, environment and anti-corruption – wherever  we operate.  We work to ensure our business and  our business partners operate with respect for  human rights and report our progress in our annual  Human Rights and Modern Slavery Statement.  We continue to align our climate change reporting  with the recommendations of the Taskforce on  Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD),  integrating this disclosure into our Annual Report  for the first time this year as a part of building  readiness for upcoming mandatory reporting of  sustainability-related financial disclosures.  We choose to make these contributions because  they will help us create positive outcomes for all  our stakeholders – outcomes that are long term,  sustainable and transformative. It means holding  ourselves to a higher standard and getting the basics  right in all aspects of our operations. We recognise  our success is intrinsically linked to the digital  economy, and that our support helps it grow and  deliver on its potential for the nation.  We continue to be proud of our progress, and our  increasing pace, in shaping Telstra as a responsible  business and a sustainable and community-driven  organisation. The challenges we face continue to  evolve, but our commitment to face them head on is  strong and resilient.   We hope you enjoy reading about our progress and  welcome your feedback.

In 2023,  we refreshed our SDG alignment and identified eight  SDG priorities. These SDGs reflect the sustainability  areas Telstra is best placed to contribute to,  given our role as a large employer and a leading  telecommunications and technology provider.   In 2023, we have been trialling new ways of embedding  sustainability into our business, our decision making  and our culture. We know that building organisational  resilience and capacity to respond to emerging  challenges will position us well to anticipate and  manage the future risk landscape more effectively.  It accelerates innovation by driving the development  of new products, services and solutions that lead to  new customers and market opportunities. As a purpose  driven organisation, it helps attract and retain the  best talent, builds our reputation and strengthens  our stakeholder relationships. For more information on how we are contributing  to the SDGs through our work, please see the  Contributing to the Sustainable Development  Goals: In focus paper and 2023 Data Pack available  on our reports page.  We're managing sustainability at Telstra by: •	 Doing better as a business – delivering on  our commitment to do business responsibly  and being transparent, ethical and accountable,  wherever we operate.  •	 Doing better for communities – technology  connects us all.

Our stakeholders are any group or individual who influences or is impacted by our business.  Our constructive and transparent engagement with them is a foundation of our approach to sustainability.  We are committed to engaging with our stakeholders and deeply value the meaningful relationships we have  created. Led by multiple specialised functions within Telstra, our teams regularly engage with key stakeholder  groups to ensure we understand their expectations and respond to their diverse interests and concerns.  In FY23, the following consumer and community focused stakeholder forums were convened by Telstra:  Stakeholder forums convened by  Telstra in FY23   Participants Consultations  held in FY23 CEO Consumer Roundtable  CEOs of peak consumer advocacy organisations  Two Disability Stakeholder Forum  Key disability advocates and consumer groups  Two Low Income Measures Assessment Committee (LIMAC) Social welfare organisations providing emergency  relief and policy advocacy One First Nations Expert Advisory Committee (FNEAC) Five First Nations Australians who are leaders in their  respective industries Three Financial Assistance Forum Financial Counsellors from all over the country One Regional Advisory Committees (RAC) 38 influential external regional stakeholders and 20  internal Telstra team members from across the business  contribute to the RAC and resolve community concerns  and issues across NSW, VIC, WA and QLD Ten For more information on our stakeholder engagement practices and partnerships, and a detailed list of our  stakeholders, information on how we engage with them and their key areas of interest, please see our Content  Index available on our reports page. Social and environmental  partnerships In place for over a decade, Telstra’s social and  environmental partnerships have delivered critical  business objectives, community outcomes and  employment opportunities. We continue to work with  supplier enterprises that support people with disability  or people experiencing disadvantage. This year, our  Supported Workforce Program created opportunities  for 155 people who performed cleaning and grounds  maintenance activities at 5,080 sites across the  nation. Our Indigenous Workforce Program (IWP)  also continues to deliver results with around 40 First  Nations enterprises undertaking maintenance at over  1,500 regional and remote sites. Our FY23 spend across  the cleaning and grounds vendors was $3.09 million. In FY23 we also spent over $20 million with over 30  First Nations businesses, certified or registered by  Supply Nation, further improving on our last year's  spend of $14 million. We continue to build our strategy  at a category level and actively work with our strategic  partners to promote supplier diversity more broadly  throughout our supply chain.  We also actively work with our suppliers to gain better  insights into our emissions and identify reduction  opportunities. We have partnered with CDP through  their Supply Chain Program to engage our suppliers  to more effectively account for and address their  climate change impacts.  This partnership enables us  to deliver training, tools and support on environmental  disclosures to over 400 suppliers, an increase from  approximately 200 suppliers in 2022. This covers  80 per cent of our spend. See the Taking bold climate  action section of this report to learn more.  We also work with various partners to improve our use  of resources, reduce waste going to landfill and create  innovative solutions to reduce our environmental  impact across the lifecycle of our networks and  products.

This involves multiple programs and initiatives  including a focus on the needs of First Nations  customers and communities in remote areas.  Underpinning our First Nations strategy is  strong internal and external governance. Reconciliation Our vision for reconciliation will be achieved by  embedding reconciliation outcomes and system  changes into our organisation. This involves working  with First Nations peoples and harnessing the  strengths of our organisation to build digital  futures, providing employment opportunities to  lift economic participation and making Telstra a  culturally inclusive and engaged organisation. In July 2022, we launched our fifth Reconciliation  Action Plan (RAP). The RAP outlines more than  90 actions built around better connectivity, digital  literacy, employment, training and more spending  with First Nations businesses. Our RAP is based on  a theme of truth telling, which is a fundamental  starting point for reconciliation and we have  committed to some important steps to talk about  our past and the impact of our decisions on First  Nations people. We also outline our commitment to  the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full. For more information on our commitment and  action towards reconciliation, please see our  2022-2025 Stretch Reconciliation Action Plan.   First Nations  Voice to Parliament  Telstra accepts the invitation of the Uluru Statement  from the Heart, to walk with First Nations people in a  movement of the Australian people for a better future.   Securing a First Nations Voice to Parliament is the  first of three actions called for by the Uluru Statement.  Telstra believes that a First Nations Voice enshrined  in the Australian constitution ensures First Nations  peoples’ experiences and perspectives are included  in the development of policies and laws that affect  their communities. Truth Telling at National  Communications Museum Telstra is funding a new research project that  will acknowledge the full history of the Overland  Telegraph Line (OTL). The research is part of our  commitment to truth telling and is included in  our 2022-2025 RAP.   This First Nations led project, through the  National Communications Museum (NCM)  and supported by Professor Marcia Langton  AO, Associate Provost, Melbourne University,  will use archival material and community  consultation to document the impact on First  Nations people, in the construction of the OTL.  The project outcome will be a short film and a  comprehensive guide to the way the film was  made, highlighting the strength of culturally  respectful, collaborative and community-led  methodologies.  Reconciliation and  First Nations advocacy Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 21 Doing business responsibly  ===== PAGE 22 ===== Fair and transparent  products and services Customer experience In FY23, we continued our emphasis on the  importance of experience for our customers,  as reflected in one of the strategic pillars for  our T25 strategy, ‘an exceptional customer  experience you can count on.’ A key aspect  of this is designing and measuring customer  experience to ensure our customers can  access and use the best products and  services when and where they need them. Customer experience  built into design Our Customer Experience (CX) Design Framework  is a set of 16 principles that defines what good,  better and brilliant experiences look like for Telstra  customers and underpins key product experience  investment decisions. The framework helps our teams design customer- centric products and services, focusing on  sustainability and accessibility, to create offers  that are responsible and easy to understand.  We continue to evolve the framework, making  multiple updates to standards and further  embedding them in key governance processes.  We embed the framework in our operations by  utilising a CX assessment tool. The tool guides  teams through a series of prompts where they  articulate how their activity meets our CX principles.  With a few exceptions, all activities that have  an impact on our customers must complete this  assessment. In September 2022, the framework  was used to assess the experience of all our  products currently in market and helped inform  roadmaps for an improved customer experience.   Connecting Telstra leaders to  customers and frontline teams In March 2022, we launched the Experience Connect  portal to connect Telstra's leaders with our customers  and frontline teams. The portal is a one-stop shop for  leaders to easily access synthesised customer data and  research, curated with relevant insights, engagement  opportunities and actionable pathways. In FY23,  we made improvements to the portal including the  introduction of several new immersion opportunities  for our leaders. In Q1, Experience Connect was short- listed for the Ashton Media CX Awards Best Employee  Experience Initiative. Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 22 Doing business responsibly  ===== PAGE 23 ===== Measuring customer experience   We measure customer experience using the Net  Promoter Score (NPS) system. NPS enables us to  measure our customers’ experiences and respond  to their feedback. We measure NPS in two ways:  1. Strategic NPS is a measure of customers' feedback  on their overall perceptions of and experience with  Telstra, relative to experiences they have with other  organisations, including competitors.  2. Episode NPS measures feedback from customers  in relation to a specific service experience othey  have with Telstra, such as moving home or  connecting a service.  This year, we improved our Group Episode NPS by  6 points and finished at +43, exceeding our +40  target. Positive movements were observed across  all episodes in FY23 for both Consumer Small  Business and Enterprise segments.  Both Consumer and Small and Medium Businesses  achieved historic highs this year, but we did see  softening in the last quarter due to the challenging  macro-economic environment and recent price  rise communications, which impacted customers’  perceptions on seeing Telstra as worth what they  pay for.  The Enterprise segment experienced changes to the  service model which impacted their results, recording  a nine point drop in the first half of the financial year,  only starting to recover slowly in the second half of  the financial year. Our Group Strategic NPS for FY23  improved +4 points.   Design and accessibility  excellence  Telstra's accessibility program is committed to  creating a more inclusive future so everyone can  thrive. We believe it is our responsibility to ensure  our experiences are accessible and inclusive, rather  than burdening users to find workarounds. As our program expands, we continue to improve  existing initiatives associated with digital accessibility  and expanded our research and training programs. Digital accessibility  This year, we expanded our team of accessibility  specialists. Now, 40 of our team are people living  with a disability. This dedicated capability resulted in  our core digital assets achieving Band 1 Accessibility  Maturity Scores, which means more than 90 per cent  defects found have been fixed. The Accessibility  Maturity Scoring system allows us to continuously  monitor the maturity of each digital asset and target  training and resources where needed. We pair this data  with results from our major audits, using third-party  vendors to provide us with certification. This year,  the MyTelstra app maintained a Website Compliance  Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 level A/AA  certification, while our Telstra.com.au website  achieved WCAG 2.1 level A certification. This year, we placed an emphasis on ensuring all  customer documents are accessible. We improved  5 million dynamic invoices for consumers, 15,000  documents for Enterprise customers each month  and remediated and republished 1,200 legacy  documents on our website. Additionally, we ensured  that approximately 700 new static documents met  WCAG AA standards. Our brand refresh played a key role in improving  accessibility by introducing a new set of inclusive  colours, a custom font designed specifically for  people with dyslexia, low vision and cognitive  impairments, along with several other design traits  aligned with our branding guidelines. These new  design guidelines were tested with people living  with disability and shared with disability advocacy  groups for feedback and input. Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 23 Doing business responsibly  ===== PAGE 24 ===== Research and testing Our ‘push left’ initiative embeds accessibility  interventions into the beginning of the product  cycle and improves accessibility through more  rigorous testing and research methodologies. We  also introduced ‘People with Disability’ personas,  which aligns with a needs-based servicing model and  has enabled us to identify user communication needs  sooner, even before the design phase. Additionally,  our accessibility automation tool has allowed us to  test at scale, identifying 20-30 per cent of defects  earlier in the research and testing process. Lastly,  we have empowered our designers to conduct their  own user testing. Currently, 19 per cent of user testing  participants are people living with disability.  In FY23, we updated our procurement processes,  systems and templates to provide the necessary  guidance and rigour to ensure compliance.  Specifically, our tendering materials – e.g. Request  for Proposal (RFP) and Request for Tender (RFT),  now contain accessibility standards and requirements  in line with the Australian ISO standard AS EN 301  549, which specifies accessibility requirements for  Information Communication Technology (ICT)  products and services. Our Telstra Service Agreement  (TSA) template also contains appropriate base  contractual clauses. Training and support This year, we continued our work to federate  accessibility and inclusive skills through a series of  40 online modules and facilitated training sessions  to up-skill our designers developers and staff in other  product design roles. Each module was designed to  provide general disability awareness, combined with  role-specific skills.  In addition to our core training programs, we  developed custom modules to enhance the skills  of Telstra employees in creating accessible documents  and presentations using Word, PowerPoint and  InDesign. Additionally, we provided training on Easy  Reading and Plain Language to our content writers  and Accessibility team, integrating these practices  into our content guidelines.  We continued our Inclusive Tech Lab this year,  engaging 1,000 senior members of Telstra in  experiences that simulated disabilities and  showcased how technology and design can  both help and hinder accessibility.  For more information on accessibility, please  see the Supporting our customers section of  this report. Products and plans  We’re committed to helping Australians get the most  out of connectivity, whether at home, at work or on  the go. To enable this, we focus on delivering products  and plans that meet the needs of our customers while  being transparent about changes in service and pricing. From 4 July 2023, we increased prices on our  in-market post-paid mobile and data plans in line  with the Consumer Price Index (CPI), rounded to  the nearest dollar. This means a monthly increase  of between $3 to $6, depending on the plan.  We know price rises can be hard for some people,  especially when cost of living pressures are high.  We will continue to provide options for customers  to help them manage their mobile plan costs. This  includes the ability to bundle mobile and data plans  for better value, the ability to pay less with Telstra  Plus points, as well as the ability to trade in old  devices and get credit on a Telstra account. We’ve  also increased concession discounts for eligible  customers affected by these changes. Moreover,  the Telstra Top-up program, in partnership with  Infoxchange, provides complimentary mobile credit  recharges to pre-paid customers doing it tough.  As our customers’ home and work lives increasingly  converge, Internet connectivity is more important  than ever. Our Internet Optimiser lets customers  prioritise what matters most on their network. It’s  included at no extra cost for Telstra NBN customers  with a compatible Smart Modem. For more information on how we support customers  when times are tough, please see the Supporting our  customers section of this report.  User testing with people  with disability We work directly with people living with  disability. This includes user testing that  provides feedback straight to the designers  and stakeholders and goes well above WCAG  standards. For example, user testing with  people living with visual impairments provided  critical insights about how to improve video  transcripts to make them more useful. We  also experimented with ways to make digital  experiences accessible to individuals who  face limitations interacting with non-digital  environments. Applying techniques like ‘The  Wizard of Oz’ and tactile wireframes allowed  us to include individuals with visual impairments  in the process. Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 24 Doing business responsibly  ===== PAGE 25 ===== Trust and reputation Our goal, to grow trust and operate responsibly, is  one of the foundations of our reputation. Having a  positive reputation is fundamental to achieving our  T25 growth ambitions, meeting the expectations  of our shareholders and customers and attracting  and retaining the best talent. We use the reputation  measurement platform RepTrak to understand how  customers and the broader community think and feel  about us. The model tracks a range of drivers including  innovation, conduct, products and services and  citizenship to provide data and insights that help  us better serve our customers and stakeholders. In 2023, we increased our RepTrak reputation score  by 1.3 points from 62.2 to 63.5, for a total uplift of  2.2 points from our FY21 baseline of 61.3. This keeps  us on track to achieve our goal to uplift scores by at  least 4 to 7 points by FY25. Improving our approach  to responsible selling Maintaining fair sales practices and ensuring we  provide products and information to customers  responsibly is extremely important to us. In most  cases, our sales ecosystem works well. However,  when we become aware of issues that affect our  customers, we resolve to listen to their feedback.  We want to ensure our processes and policies, as  well as the actions of our people, reflect our  commitment to learn from our mistakes, listen  to feedback and continually improve. We seek to find a balance between what customers  want, need and can comfortably commit to. In FY23,  we continued to engage in responsible sales and  affordability conversations with customers and took  steps to embed this approach through ongoing  training for our frontline employees.  Our approach is supported by tools, processes and  systems so customers can understand their spend  limit. For example, when a customer is not eligible  to buy a specific device on repayment due to a spend  limit, we will offer them options, including buying the  device outright, making a part payment upfront to  reduce the monthly repayment terms or purchasing  a plan only. Customers are also able to trade-in  old devices.  For more information on affordability and how we  support customers in vulnerable circumstances,  please see the Supporting our customers section of  this report. We also continue to implement mandatory training  courses including, but not limited to; ‘Customers in  Vulnerable Circumstances‘, ‘Responsible Business’  and ‘Priority Assistance’ for our people who serve or  sell to consumer or small business customers. Frontline  employees who fail to complete the training within the  required timeframe are suspended from accessing our  core systems. This ensures that only trained staff sell  to and serve customers. First Nations Connect  This year, our First Nations Connect Hotline  celebrated its second birthday. The First Nations  Connect Hotline is a dedicated ‘1800’ phone line  and service centre that was set up to assist our  First Nations and remote customers. The centre is  currently based in Darwin and all agents along with  the leadership team are of Aboriginal and/or Torres  Strait Islander descent. The First Nations Connect  Hotline has access to interpreter services with  approximately 50 different First Nations languages  and dialects. The team listens to and understands  the needs of customers and works to deliver an  exceptional, tailored experience. While our First Nations Connect team continued to  grow this year, we also entered a partnership with  the Queensland Government to set up micro call  centres in First Nations communities in Far North  Queensland. This will create local employment  opportunities and support self-sustained local  businesses. The first micro call centres will be  set up on Palm Island and Jumbun in FY24, in  partnership with the Palm Island Community  Company (PICC) and Jumbun Limited. Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 25 Doing business responsibly  ===== PAGE 26 ===== When we don't get it right  It is important that we provide our customers with  products and services that are safe, easy to understand  and meet their underlying needs. To help ensure  customers are treated fairly, including those in  vulnerable circumstances, our Telstra Chief Customer  Advocate works across Telstra and aims to ensure the  voice of the customer is considered in the design of  products and processes and to enhance our customer  experience and complaint resolution.  We acknowledge that sometimes we don’t deliver  the experience our customers deserve. We’re  continuously working to improve our performance  and engage openly with regulators in industry wide  audits and investigations and proactively report to  regulators when we find we’ve failed to meet our  regulatory obligations and had a significant impact  on our customers.    Responding to industry wide audits    In May 2023, the Australian Communications and  Media Authority (ACMA) published its research  report on financial hardship in the telco sector.  Telstra provided information to ACMA as an input  into the research report. The report found that  the telco sector has some way to go to meet the  reasonable expectations of consumers facing hardship.  We know that some of our customers experience  financial hardship and they may need assistance from  us, such as arrangements to help them pay their bills.  We understand how important it is to help these  customers meet their financial obligations and to  stay connected. For this reason, we continue to offer  a range of products, services and programs to help  keep these customers connected and afford the  products and services they need. We know further  work is required, so we’re committed to helping  people facing cost-of-living pressures.  For more information on affordability and how we  support customers in vulnerable circumstances,  please see the Supporting our customers section  of this report. Proactive self-reporting  Even when we think our systems and processes are  working as expected, there is always a chance that  things do not go as planned. As a large company, we  recognise that our errors can impact many customers  and, in some instances, have a significant impact on  a group of customers. This is especially serious when  customers in vulnerable circumstances are affected.  Where we identify a significant issue, we self-report  to our regulators in line with community expectations  and our obligations. For example, we self-reported  to ACMA after we found that we had not followed  aspects of our Priority Assistance Policy. Following  ACMA’s investigation of the issue and subsequent  findings, they accepted an Enforceable Undertaking  from us to implement remedial actions designed  to rectify the failings which related to the provision  of information about Priority Assistance to eligible  customers. We continue to report regularly to the  ACMA on our progress. In another example, we self-reported incorrect credit  management actions we had identified. The ACMA  found that we had not fully complied with clause  7.7 of the Telecommunications Consumer Protection  (TCP) Code, requiring suppliers to suspend credit  management actions for arrangements covered under  financial hardship policies and in August 2022 issued  us with a direction to comply with this provision. We continue to review all elements of our business,  address issues as we find them and proactively report  issues to ACMA to strengthen our operations. Telecommunications  Industry Ombudsman  (TIO) complaints In an industry as complex as ours, things sometimes  go wrong. When they do, we work with customers to  resolve issues as quickly as possible. If the customer  remains dissatisfied with the response, external  dispute resolution can be accessed through an industry  funded scheme: the Telecommunications Industry  Ombudsman (TIO).  In FY23, we continued to see reductions in complaints  escalated to the TIO. Following the reduction of TIO  referral complaints by 40 per cent in FY22, we achieved  35 per cent this financial year and remain committed  to reducing the drivers of customer dissatisfaction and  aim to reduce TIO referral complaint volumes further.  In FY21, we set the ambition to halve TIO complaints  by FY25. Through a strong focus on addressing the root  cause of complaints and initiatives such as insourcing  our retail network and simplification of our products  and services, we have seen a significant improvement  in our customer service and a reduction of complaints  to the TIO. Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 26 Doing business responsibly  ===== PAGE 27 ===== Ethical  supply chain Working with our suppliers In FY23, Telstra Group engaged directly with more than  5,800 suppliers from 92 countries and approximately  78 per cent of the total spend was with our top 100  suppliers. Our direct (tier 1) suppliers often have many  suppliers of their own, who then also rely on their own  suppliers. These indirect suppliers who are also known  as tier 2, tier 3 and tier 4 suppliers also contribute  significantly to Telstra’s large and complex supply chain.   To mitigate the risk presented by the indirect delivery  partner service model, we have implemented a range  of procedures and programs to ensure the high labour  management standards we expect are being met.   Our Supplier Code of Conduct sets out the minimum  standards we expect from our suppliers and forms  part of our standard purchasing terms. Through our  policies, Supplier Governance Framework, training  and audit program, we work with our suppliers to  assess whether they are meeting our standards.  Our SCOC is aligned with 10 universally accepted  principles of the UN Global Compact, Responsible  Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct and Joint  Alliance for CSR (JAC) Supply Chain Sustainability  Guidelines, as well as legislative obligations such as  the UK MSA and the Australian MSA.   Our Know Your Supplier platform (KYS), is a secure  web-based platform targeting domestically contracted  suppliers which we engage regularly. The KYS platform  provides a central repository for suppliers to respond to  Telstra’s questions about the 12 supplier risk categories  and monitors onboarded suppliers against public  records, including media reports and civil litigation,  regulatory, criminality and bankruptcy checks. In FY23 we matured our Know Your Supplier (KYS)  processes to drive better governance of supplier risk  and increase the number of suppliers onboarded via  KYS. As of 30 June 2023, we have onboarded 1,204  suppliers on the KYS platform, up from 1,055 in  FY22. Of these, 53 per cent have completed the KYS  Questionnaire, up from 38 per cent completed in FY22. Every year we apply our risk-based approach to help  us identify suppliers for site audits. Site audits include  and align with industry standards such as those set by  Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and Joint Alliance  for CSR (JAC) for onsite compliance verification and  effective, shareable audits. The audits are conducted  using independent auditors and focus on health and  safety, environment, human rights including labour  rights and modern slavery indicators and business  ethics. Site audits also include worker interviews.  This year 41 sites across 16 suppliers were selected  to complete site audits by independent auditors.  These audits identified 239 priority and major findings.  Ninety-five per cent of sites, or 88 per cent of  suppliers, audited had priority or major findings. Health  and safety and working hours are the most common  areas of concern. In FY23, 116 corrective actions  relating to the priority and major findings reported in  this and previous years’ audits were closed. For more information on our supplier spend, where  we source our products and services, as well as our  supply chain risk areas, grievance mechanisms and  remediation practices, please see our 2023 Human  Rights and Modern Slavery Act Statement available on our reports page.   Supplier diversity: Coast  to coast with Kooya Fleet We are proud to partner with Supply Nation  certified supplier Kooya Fleet Solutions, Australia’s  largest Aboriginal-owned Fleet Management company.  At the inception of the commercial arrangement, Kooya  joined our fleet finance and leasing panel, growing from  20 vehicles in FY18 to over 1,400 vehicles nationwide  in FY23. The partnership continues to develop in  conjunction with our First Nations procurement  strategy, expanding their offering to novated leasing  services for Telstra employees. This has generated an  additional $1 million in revenue in FY23 for Kooya,  with projections to more than double this in FY24.  Read more in our article on Telstra Exchange. Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 27 Doing business responsibly  ===== PAGE 28 ===== Our people  Building culture and  capabilities Sustainable engagement Our workplace culture is a critical enabler for us to  deliver on our purpose and business strategy and is  underpinned by a strong commitment to our values.  We measure employee engagement through our  Experience Pulse, which provides insights into how  our people feel about their experience of working at  Telstra. In FY23, we engaged a new survey provider  who provides greater language processing capability  to deepen our understanding of the experience of  our people.  We set an ambitious target to achieve an  annual employee engagement in the 90th percentile  for global companies, which equates to an engagement  score of 82. We finished FY23 with an engagement  score of 80 which means we didn’t meet our target,  but this still puts us above the global 75th per cent  employee engagement and on track to achieve our  T25 objective of 82.  Throughout the year, our employees told us that  they highly value flexibility (including the ability to  choose when and where they work, and the work- life balance opportunities provided) and the strong  working relationships that they have with their people  leader and the team of people they work with day to  day. The focus on our people and workplace strategies  (including our flexibility policies, our ways of working,  employee wellbeing and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion  (DE&I) initiatives) comes through strongly in our  engagement survey results and are known to create  positive experiences for our people. We also identified areas that we can focus on to  improve our employees’ engagement and experience  at work. Our people want to know more about our T25  strategy and how we’ll achieve our ambitions. They also  told us we need to keep simplifying our processes and  how our work is organised, so it’s easy for them to do  their job well. To address the feedback from employees, we  prioritised actions for leaders at all levels of the  organisation in order to make Telstra the place they  want to work. In addition to the localised actions team  leaders have committed to, we developed a set of  company and function-wide action plans to improve  persistent issues impacting engagement. For example,  we are investing in AI-driven talent technology to help  people identify potential career paths and promoting  job mobility and upskilling to improve how we support  people to build unique and fulfilling careers. This  ongoing work has been communicated to all employees  and is being led and tracked by our Senior Leadership  teams to the completion of T25. Additionally, through feedback from employees on  our current culture we identified three areas where  we wish to drive change over the next few years and  are developing a program of actions for employees  and leaders around three culture areas:  •	 ensuring team members intimately understand  our customers’ world •	 driving accountability and achievement on our  priorities •	 ensuring we show up as one Telstra team through  effective cross-team and cross-functional  collaboration.  Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 28 Doing business responsibly  ===== PAGE 29 ===== Flexible working  Our employees continue to value our market-leading  approach to hybrid working. We recognise our  commitment to flexibility is a significant drawcard  for us with our ‘remote possible’ job ads receiving  2.4 times the applications compared with our  onsite/hybrid ads. Our employee engagement surveys tell us that when  our people have the flexibility to manage their work  and home commitments, they are more engaged and  feel a greater sense of belonging. Our Agile ways of  working have allowed us to manage work via outcomes  delivered through team prioritisation and collaboration.   Our workplaces are an ecosystem of hubs, developed  in response to the changing needs of our people who  no longer wish to work in the same way they once  did. We are responding to evolving work habits by  creating spaces that foster social connections and  collaboration, but also support our people’s desire to  work flexibly where possible.  We applied external research and insights from our  surveys to create guidelines and behaviours to help  people embrace hybrid working. We implemented  shorter default meetings via Outlook and organisation- wide meeting-free times and integrated wellbeing  into technology with Headspace, virtual commute  and focus time on MS Teams.  We will continue evolving our approach to hybrid  work based on insights from our people and how  we can support them to be engaged, productive and  collaborative. We want to understand more about  how hybrid working and our physical workplace can  contribute positively to our culture by enhancing  belonging and growth for our people and  effectiveness for our teams. Learning and capability To build the capability to deliver our ambitions  to create a workplace where people are engaged,  productive and collaborative, we invested $20 million  in training and development in FY23, with an additional  $3.5 million invested in our Future Ready program.  Within the total investment of $23.5 million, there  was over $6.9 million invested in technology training  and $6.2 million in leadership training.  We invested $6.3 million in developing critical  capability in the areas of Human-Centred design,  Gallup Strengths Teaming, High Performance  Mindfulness, Industry masterclasses and the  Future Ready curriculum, along with $1 million  for all company access to LinkedIn learning. Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 29 Doing business responsibly  ===== PAGE 30 ===== Continued investment  in technical skills Over the past year, we have continued to invest in our  employees by building new technical skill programs  for Software Engineering, Data and Analytics and  Cyber Security including skills assessments and  Capstone projects. We built and deployed our first  virtual internships in Cyber Security Malware and  Software Engineering in partnership with Forage.  This is a four-to-five-hour practical immersion for  current university, TAFE and high school students  and anyone considering changing their career. We  had 3,200 enrolments for Cyber Security and 2,133  enrolments in Software Engineering. It is at no cost  for the student and available globally.  We launched Achieve Business Excellence, a skills  program to drive operational excellence in maintaining  or enhancing business performance. It includes  two new credentials developed in partnership with  the University of Melbourne: Process Thinking &  Improvement and Managing Strategic Performance.  Over 2,500 employees have now been issued  micro-credentials across Data & Analytics, Product  Management, Security, Innovation & Entrepreneurship  and Process Thinking & Improvement or Managing  Strategic Performance.  We also invested over $2 million in FY23 in digital  learning platforms to build cloud, data, cyber security,  software engineering and network skills with over  80,000 hours of consumed learning across videos,  books, labs, live experiences, exam practice and digital  testing environments. We spent over $1 million on  upskilling our technical workforce in vendor training  and technologies including VMWare, Red Hat, AWS,  Microsoft and Cisco. Building a high-performance  culture We continue to embed our annual and quarterly  planning and performance approach to deliver on  company level objectives and key results (OKRs).  Company level OKRs provide clarity of prioritised  work so we can be more responsive to customer  needs. It also means we stop or pause work that  doesn’t align to our priorities, so we stay focused  on the work that will have the greatest impact. Our  people’s strengths in various skills and capabilities  guide the prioritisation of work to which they are  allocated. We encourage our people to have regular,  at minimum quarterly conversations with their  leaders about how they have performed against their  OKRs, about their development/career needs and  feedback from peers. We continue to invest in our  leaders’ capability to ensure these conversations are  meaningful and effective.   Our pay-for-performance philosophy means that at  the end of the financial year, our people receive an  individual performance rating based on their outcomes  and behaviours. These performance ratings are an  important input to Fixed and Incentive pay outcomes  for the majority of our people.  For more information on our remunerations, please  see our 2023 Remuneration Report, which forms part  of our 2023 Annual Report. Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 30 Doing business responsibly  ===== PAGE 31 ===== Diversity, equity and inclusion  Every day, Telstra provides services to millions of  customers from diverse backgrounds. We believe that  everyone deserves to be respected for their differences,  valued for their contributions, celebrated for being  their authentic self and can reach their full potential.  We are building diverse teams and creating inclusive  environments to enable our employees to be their  best, which enables us to provide better service  to our customers and community.  Our diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) ambitions  are powered through collective action and allyship.  We have five Employee Representative Groups (ERGs)  – Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Peoples, MOSAIC  (Culture & Language), Rise (Gender Equity), Spectrum  (LGBTQ+) and TelstrAbility (Accessibility) – which  include over 4,500 members and are sponsored by  a member of our CEO leadership team. The ERG  member’s consultation and advocacy provide us with  insights into the lived experiences of marginalised  groups. These ERGs provide awareness and help  strengthen our culture of inclusion and belonging  for Telstra team members.  Our DEI Policy provides the framework for the Telstra  Board to set our measurable objectives for diversity.   Throughout the year, management and the Board  (including through the Nomination and People &  Remuneration Committees) assess our progress in  achieving our objectives.    Diversity objectives are included in monthly business  reports and in Group Executive scorecards. Chaired  by our CEO Vicki Brady, our organisation-wide DEI  Council supports each function to meet their diversity  objectives, understand the importance of DEI and  creates a safe space to collaborate and innovate. In addition to our inclusive recruitment practices  that resulted in a gender representation increase  from 33.5 per cent in FY22 to 35.2 per cent in FY23,  Telstra continues to invest in developing and retaining  women through multiple programs. For more information about diversity and inclusion,  please see our 2023 Corporate Governance Statement  available on our reports page.  Providing leading  employment conditions  We consult with our people before we implement  any significant changes to the way we work. We  regularly engage with our three employee unions  – the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union  of Australia (CEPU), the Community and Public Sector  Union (CPSU) and Professionals Australia (APESMA).  Our people have the freedom to form or join a trade  union, to bargain collectively and to engage in trade  union activities. We do not monitor union membership  by our people. Our aim is to maintain an open and  constructive relationship with the representatives  of these unions.  In FY23, we conducted more than 15 formal consultation  meetings with unions and Telstra employees. This  included discussions about how we have continued to  protect the health, safety and wellbeing of our people in  response to COVID-19 and what our Telstra Group legal  restructure would mean for our employees.  We currently have four enterprise agreements (EAs)  covering 73 per cent of our workforce in support of our  new legal structure. These EAs cover Telstra InfraCo,  Amplitel, Telstra Limited and one specifically for our  Retail business that covers people working in our retail  stores. All EAs will nominally expire in September 2024  and Telstra is committed to commencing discussions  for new EAs with our unions and employees, no later  than May 2024. Our EAs provide a range of industry-leading terms and  conditions, such as payment of superannuation on  periods of unpaid parental leave, gender affirmation  leave and 20-days paid leave for permanent employees  experiencing the effects of family and domestic violence.  In-person cultural learning We are committed to delivering in-person  cultural learning for 1,500 employees by June  2025. In-person learning will ensure employees  experience a deeper learning about Aboriginal  and Torres Strait Islander cultures, histories,  knowledge and rights. In FY23, we partnered  with a First Nations training provider to deliver  workshops that build on our journey of cultural  capability. This program is complemented by  other company-wide cultural competency training. For more information about our approach to  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at Telstra, please  see our 2023 Corporate Governance Statement  available on our reports page.  Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 31 Doing business responsibly  ===== PAGE 32 ===== Additionally, from February 2023, we introduced the  same paid arrangements to our casual workforce and  discretionary paid leave to any employee who may  be supporting a family member or member of their  household experiencing this type of violence.  In December 2022, we also recognised our employees’  contribution to our T22 success and ongoing focus in  FY23, by providing a one-off $1,000 bonus payment  to EA-covered employees, lawyers and many of our  international teams. Promoting health,  safety and wellbeing  Our people are the heart of all we do. With the  world around us changing at such a rapid rate and  social and economic conditions challenging many  across our communities, it has never been more  important to support and enable our people to be  safe and resilient in times of change. Our mental health strategy Over the past 12 months, we have increased our  strategic focus on a psychosocial risk-based approach  to preventing work-related harm. On 1 April 2023,  changes to the Commonwealth Workplace Health and  Safety (WHS) Regulations clarified the already existing  requirement on employers to manage psychosocial  hazards and risk. Telstra has invested significant  resources and dedicated expertise so that our systems,  processes and supports meet these obligations. Our evidence-based approach considers many factors  that can both positively and negatively impact mental  health. Our programs and initiatives are delivered  under three strategic pillars: •	 Capability of care – our people understand the  factors that can positively and negatively impact  mental health, know the importance of connection,  have the courage to check-in with each other and  know where to access available support. •	 Psychological risk management – a robust,  integrated, and embedded risk management  approach that supports our people to understand  and manage risk. •	 Support and recovery – best practice and  easily accessible support services which enable  our people to remain at or return to safe and  sustainable work, minimising the human and  financial impact of ill-health. There is no single metric which can accurately  measure how well an organisation supports its  people and manages mental health risk. For this  reason, Telstra uses a suite of data points including  psychosocial risk profiling, including the number,  nature and location of reported mental health  incidents; contributing factors to mental health  incident reports and the demographics of our  injured/ill workforce; the strength of our reporting  culture; the uptake of our targeted support services,  participation rates in mental health-related  education and training and our Culture and  Employee Engagement Survey responses.  Our campaign to reduce the stigma associated  with mental health and encourage reporting has  resulted in a positive upward trend in mental health  reporting, particularly non-work-related incidents.  Pleasingly, our Employee Assistance Program (EAP)  utilisation rate remains significantly higher than the  industry average at 8.4 per cent, indicating that  our people are increasingly more comfortable in  proactively seeking support.   Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 32 Doing business responsibly  ===== PAGE 33 ===== Key health and safety  performance indicators We actively campaign on the importance of reporting  as a critical way to prevent harm and access support  from our safety and health management teams. The  more our people report, the better our understanding  of the risks in our business and the earlier we can  provide tailored support.  In FY23, we recorded the highest level of incident  reporting on record, which we broadly view as positive.  It reflects a strong health, safety and wellbeing culture  where our people exhibit a high awareness of the  importance of accurate and timely reporting and feel  comfortable reporting incidents. Our FY23 incident  reporting is particularly positive as it shows a material  decrease in the proportion of our incidents resulting in  a high severity outcome (i.e., medical treatment, work  restrictions or time away from work). This is further  evidenced in marginal reductions in both our Total  Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) and Lost Time  Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) which is calculated against  hours worked, meaning the higher incident reporting was  not correlated to an increase in TRIFR and LTIFR. High severity outcomes recorded Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate Recovery following injury or  illness: equitable access to  support irrespective of cause Equitable access to early treatment and support is  the foundation of Telstra’s early intervention program  for both work-related and personal injury and illness.  With access to occupational rehabilitation, general  practitioners, psychology, physiotherapy services as  well financial support for a range of diagnostics and  aides, our people can focus on their recovery, while  they remain at (or return to) safe and sustainable work. 10 8 6 4 2 0 FY22 8.4 FY19 8.4 FY23 7.9 FY20 7.3 FY21 6.7 5k 6k 4k 3k 2k 1k 0 FY23 5,725 9.5% FY22 3,697 14.7% FY20 3,108 19.6% FY21 15.8% 3,583 Total Work-Related Incidents Reported Total % Resulting in a High Severity Outcome FY19 3,557 20.2% 4 3 2 1 0 FY22 3.9 FY19 2.3 FY20 2.3 FY23 3.8 FY21 2.7 Case Study Building a brighter  future after injury  John joined Telstra 25 years ago as a 17-year-old  apprentice linesman after leaving school in year  10. In 2008, John injured his back after falling  off a ladder, with treatment including a number  of operations over the years. He subsequently  developed a secondary mental health condition  due to his chronic pain and changes to his life, for  which Telstra accepted liability under his workers  compensation claim. John has had permanent  restrictions, both physically and psychologically  for many years and prior to 2021, was given a  range of ad hoc duties to 'keep him busy'. John’s team and rehabilitation program were  unable to secure any substantive permanent  employment for him, which left him slowly  declining in his employability, confidence and  work satisfaction. He had few transferrable  skills, was self-described as computer illiterate,  had minimal customer service experience and  no vocational desires that he could identify.  John felt his only way forward was to separate  from Telstra and commence early retirement. Through regular collaboration with John,  his medical team, the business, union  representatives and John’s workplace  rehabilitation providers, new realistic vocational  opportunities were identified. This collaborative  approach considered his injuries, limitations,  skills, training opportunities and the rapidly  changing labour market. John undertook training  programs designed to improve his health and  wellbeing and his transferable skills and was  successful in obtaining (and maintaining) a new  permanent role in Telstra as a Virtual Technician. Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 33 Doing business responsibly  ===== PAGE 34 ===== Supporting our people during  natural disasters, both locally  and internationally In responding to significant weather events across  Australia, our people worked to support affected  communities and to restore services in flood affected  areas. We worked with our partners to provide  specialist mental health support for employees  personally impacted by the floods, in addition to  providing leave provisions, financial support and  temporary accommodation for our impacted people.   Supporting our  international teams  Our support for Telstra’s international workforce  through FY23 has included: •	 developing a culturally relevant and region- specific roadmap to understand and support a  safe, secure and healthy workplace for Digicel  Pacific employees and their partners following  Telstra’s acquisition of Digicel Pacific •	 providing international employees with  appropriate ergonomic equipment to safely  work from home, equivalent to the support  we provide Australian employees •	 a no-cost flu vaccine program for international  employees, where there is no local government  funded flu vaccine program •	 training our International Regional Response  and in-country teams to effectively respond  to incidents that have potential people and  security impacts. Evolving our response  to COVID-19 COVID-19 had unprecedented impacts on our  people and operations, globally. In FY23, we continued  to review and evolve our response accordingly. We  removed the mandatory vaccination for roles where  it made sense to do so, while maintaining vaccination  requirements for our workforce attending vulnerable  settings (including aged care facilities, hospitals and  remote communities), employees working at our 000  call centres and employees travelling internationally  for work-related purposes. We continue to monitor  government and expert medical advice to test and  review the appropriateness of our response and  vaccination policy.  Licences, accreditations  and compliance To support Telstra’s legal restructure, Telstra  Limited, Telstra Infraco and Amplitel are now  self-insured under the Safety Rehabilitation and  Compensation Act (Cth).  Our Workplace Health, Safety and Environment  Management System is applicable globally and is  certified to International Standards ISO14001: 2015  and ISO 45001:2018. We continue to review and  improve our management system in response to  current and emerging risks and changing legislation. Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 34 Doing business responsibly  ===== PAGE 35 ===== Creating  a better  digital world Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 35  ===== PAGE 36 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 36 Creating a better digital world Approach As a leading telecommunications and technology provider, we are working to create  a better digital world by leveraging our advanced network and technology capabilities  to connect people and support them to access the skills and tools to get the most out  of their tech and stay safe online. This commitment lies at the heart of our ‘doing  business responsibly’ pillar of our T25 strategy. Today, more than 2 million Australians are still highly  digitally excluded8 and may miss out on the social  and economic benefits that come with being online.  Our commitment to creating a better digital world  is underpinned by our long history of responding  to digital exclusion by improving digital access,  affordability and ability across Australia. We want  to see Australians connect, participate and interact  safely in the digital world, irrespective of age, income,  ability or location.  We do this by: •	 connecting regional and remote communities  through network leadership and investment  •	 building responsible tech skills to increase digital  inclusion safely and help close the digital divide  •	 supporting customers in vulnerable  circumstances, including those experiencing  financial hardship, domestic and family violence,  natural disasters and human conflict •	 advancing online safety, privacy and security.  Our approach is informed using data and insights  from the Australian Digital Inclusion Index (ADII)1  which guides our decision making. For more information, please see our Creating a  better digital world: In focus paper available on our  reports page. To view the breakdown of our community contribution  for FY23, please see our 2023 Data Pack available on  our reports page.  8	 www.digitalinclusionindex.org.au/interactive-data-dashboards In FY23, we contributed  $93.1 million through social  and community investment.   ===== PAGE 37 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 37 Creating a better digital world Giving back with purpose Our people are encouraged to use their annual Connection Day to support a cause in their community.  In June, our international team got together for their inaugural Changemakers Week, a global week of  45 volunteering events in over 30 locations. Over 900 employees across Europe, United States, Australia,  Asia and the Pacific Islands participated; including teams in India who spent time teaching kids about  environment conservation, and a team in Japan who volunteered at a local orphanage. During the  week, our people collected 508kg of plastic waste, reached 330 students and assembled 3,811 meals.

We are constantly investing in technology innovation  to improve our network capabilities and enhance the  digital experience of our customers. By enabling people  and businesses to access the connectivity they want  and need, we are making it easier for them to access  information and services, across more of Australia. Our mobile footprint stretches more than 2.7 million  square kilometres, around 1 million square kilometres  more mobile network coverage than our nearest  competitor, and reaches 99.6 per cent of the  Australian population.  In FY23, our main areas of focus were increasing our  5G coverage and expanding our 4G footprint so more  Australians can access a network that’s fit for the way  we use technology now and into the future.  Our 5G footprint now covers 85 per cent of the  population, and there are more than 4,700 Telstra  5G sites on-air across the country, providing coverage  in more than 400 cities and towns. Our customers  are increasingly accessing this technology with the  number of 5G devices connecting our network  growing each week.  We continued the expansion of our 4G footprint to  establish coverage equivalent to current 3G coverage,  ahead of 3G network closure in June 2024. This year,  we added 4G to 106 sites that were previously 3G only,  with more customers transitioning from 3G to 4G.  For more information about the 3G network closure,  please visit our website. Importantly, this transition will  free up the low-band (850MHz) spectrum for 5G. The  use of this low-band spectrum can extend 5G further  and deeper into buildings and facilitate 5G expansion  sooner in regional areas. For more information, read  our regional coverage FAQs on Telstra Exchange. Through national, state, territory and local  government programs, we have co-invested hundreds  of millions of dollars. We have delivered around  930 new mobile base stations through the Federal  Government’s Mobile Black Spot Program (MBSP),  over 200 small cells at Telstra’s own expense and more  than 130 projects through the Regional Co-investment  Program (RCP). In FY23, we delivered 34 MBSPs sites  and 36 projects across RCP 1 and 2 providing new  and improved coverage and increased transmission  capacity to ensure customers continue to have the  best mobile experience. Bringing low earth satellite  connectivity to regional  Australia with Starlink We’re working with Starlink to deliver Low Earth  Orbit (LEO) satellite connectivity to provide voice  and fixed broadband services in remote and hard  to reach places. In a world-first offering, we will be  able to provide a home phone service and Starlink  broadband services to consumers as a bundle  offer, as well as local tech support and the option  of professional installation. We will also provide  connectivity options for business customers, with  a higher bandwidth business option available in  areas without fixed and mobile connectivity. We’re  expecting to be able to offer services to customers  and businesses towards the end of 2023.  Read our article on Telstra Exchange.  ===== PAGE 39 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 39 Creating a better digital world Disaster preparedness  and response  We know the importance of access to network  connectivity for communities, especially in times of  crisis. We work extensively to prepare for disaster  seasons. In FY23, our priorities continued to ensure the  safety of our people, protecting and maintaining our  infrastructure, keeping our customers connected and  providing short and long-term assistance measures.  Email, SMS and My Telstra banners were used to  reach approximately 180,000 customers who might  be affected by disaster, providing pre-disaster  support to those previously impacted by a disaster  or classified as Priority Assistance customers. These  communications provide tips on how customers can  prepare for a disaster event.   During FY23, we activated disaster relief for customers  in 101 postcodes following severe weather events  across the country, such as flooding and cyclones.  We sent 353,000 SMS messages to inform customers  that Telstra, Belong and Boost assistance was available  to them. We provided 58,065 short-term assistance  packages, which included additional data for post- paid and pre-paid services. We also applied long-term  assistance packages or discretionary credits to 5,300  consumer and small business customers. This totalled  over $1.26 million and assisted customers who may  have been displaced to relocate their services or  provide bill relief.  Three international initiatives were also announced,  providing free calls from fixed and mobile services to  customers contacting loved ones in Turkiye and Syria,  Vanuatu and New Zealand following floods, cyclones  and earthquakes. Free calls to friends and family in  the Ukraine, Poland, Hungary, Moldova, Slovakia and  Romania were also extended until March 2023.  We continued to provide emergency response leave  for our people who volunteer for emergency services.   ===== PAGE 40 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 40 Creating a better digital world Network resilience  and reliability We recognise the importance of network resilience,  especially in times of disasters, but we are also  mindful of the risk of sole reliance on a mobile  network, particularly in disaster-prone areas, where  power supply cannot be guaranteed. This is why  we participate in the Australian Government’s  Strengthening Telecommunications Against Natural  Disasters (STAND) program. In FY23, we completed  70 committed STAND projects to deliver a mix of  battery upgrades, permanent generators and portable  generators at locations across Australia. Supply  interruption of equipment continues to impact the  physical build; however, we forecast an additional  128 projects to be completed in FY24. In addition, we have an ongoing program to improve  battery life at our mobile network sites. The program  focuses on battery replacement, power resilience  and reliability using disaster risk data to prioritise  battery replacement. In FY23, we completed battery  lifecycle replacement at 640 mobile sites throughout  the network. Battery lifecycle and upgrade works were  carried out at around 1,455 network transmissions  sites, as well as the deployment of 125 Automatic  Transfer Units (ATU) – which allow the pre-deployment  of generators at sites in anticipation of outages.  This is critical in supporting services to mobile sites  and legacy customer services.  In FY23, we also had a focus on wet season  preparation, performing targeted vegetation  clearances across our site portfolio; and planned  maintenance on standby generator plant and DC  power systems – including advance generator fuelling  and bulk fuel tank inspections at high priority sites. We are also taking a leading role across industry, the  Australian Government and the Australian Competition  and Consumer Commission on the development  and adoption of an emergency mobile roaming  capability for disaster situations. This capability will  allow customers at risk in disaster-affected areas to  temporarily roam onto another network if their regular  provider’s network is disrupted or does not provide  coverage in their area. There are technical challenges  and risks to resilience that need to be carefully  managed in any technical solution and implementation,  but we believe these are surmountable. At our  suggestion, the industry is exploring the development  of this temporary disaster roaming capability (TDR). Delivering new satellite  solutions with OneWeb  This year we signed a strategic agreement with  OneWeb to deliver one of the world’s largest rollouts  of OneWeb Low Earth Orbit (LEO) backhaul for a  commercial mobile network. As part of the plan,  we’ll move hundreds of existing remote mobile base  stations that use satellite backhaul to the OneWeb’s  LEO solution over the next few years resulting  in a better customer experience for customers,  especially enterprise customers and those in rural  and remote Australia. As well as added redundancy,  it means a better experience when using real-time  applications like voice and video calling.  For more information, read the media release.  ===== PAGE 41 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 41 Creating a better digital world Mobile health and  communications  As we continue our rollout of 5G technology around  Australia, we're committed to sharing information on  our real-world tests of 5G Electromagnetic Energy  (EME) levels and demonstrating compliance with  the EME safety standards.  With the increased deployment of 4G and 5G small  cells in residential areas in FY23, community concerns  relating to EME and health continue. This year, we  met with concerned residents in New South Wales  and Victoria to undertake EME surveys and  measurements both inside and outside the home.  The initiative demonstrated that EME levels were  well below the Australian Radiation Protection and  Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) safety standard.  We continue to offer an EME Help Desk for anyone  seeking further information. Enquiries made to the Australian Communications  and Media Authority (ACMA) increased in FY23  compared with the past two years due to increased  small cell rollout and our Mobile Base Station  Deployment C564:2020 obligations. Most enquiries  were in relation to notification obligations. We continue  to drive compliance with stakeholder engagement  through transparent consultation and notification with  councils and communities by providing information  on 5G, EME and the EME testing results. For more  consumer information on 5G, EME and small cells,  please visit our website.  Telstra continues to contribute to the development  of international EME standards and chairs the  International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)  committee. We also support stakeholders, including  ARPANSA and ACMA in areas including assessment  of millimetre wave (mmWave) exposure.  Regional and remote  engagement  We maintained our focus on connecting with regional  and remote communities across the country while  continuing to invest in our regional networks and  improve how we support our customers. This year, we continued to support and run Regional  Advisory Councils in Queensland, Victoria, Western  Australia and New South Wales (NSW) through  virtual and face-to-face meetings including with our  CEO and Board Members. Members of our Executive  Leadership Team (including our CEO) and Board met  with stakeholders and customers face-to-face in  locations across Australia including Darwin, Nhulunbuy,  Karratha, Townsville, Wagga Wagga, Bundaberg, Albury,  Shepparton, Mooroopna and Wangaratta. In FY23, we continued to facilitate discussions  with representative bodies and communities from  across Australia. This included hosting a regional  telecommunications policy workshop in Sydney  in October 2022 with 33 representatives across  a range of stakeholder groups, industries and  regions. The workshop focussed on three themes:  the mix of technologies that underpin regional  telecommunications now and into the future; getting  the policy settings right; and collectively addressing  connectivity literacy needs in regional Australia. In partnership with AgForce, Telstra toured regional  Queensland hosting 'Innovation in Ag' Field Days  along with agritech start-ups to discuss regional  connectivity concerns and demonstrate the latest  digital solutions for farms. This program has been  extended to reach NSW farmers in late FY23/early  FY24. We also engaged with stakeholders on the  awareness and understanding of the proposed Multi- Operator Core Network (MOCN) agreement between  Telstra and TPG Telecom.  During the year, we continued to deliver on the  commitments we made in response to the 2021  Regional Telecommunications Independent Review  Committee (RTIRC). This includes seven initiatives  we are investing into, from $75 million allocated from  the part sale of our Amplitel business, to further  enhance connectivity in regional Australia. This year we also announced round one recipients of  the Telstra Connected Communities grant program.  To see the recipients, please visit the program website.   ===== PAGE 42 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 42 Creating a better digital world Case Study Helping regional Australia shine on film  In FY23, we collaborated with production company Arenamedia  to overcome the challenge of limited connectivity in Bremer Bay,  a coastal hamlet in Western Australia’s Great Southern Region.  Arenamedia needed to create a reliable and extensive data  transmission to fulfil demanding technical needs during  production of the film, Blueback. We conducted a full analysis of  the location and provided an integrated communication solution  using Netgear Nighthawk portable 4GX modems and Netgear Orbi  stationary 4GX WiFi modems, coupled with external antennas,  to boost access to internet infrastructure. This allowed production  teams to access high-speed uplink and downlink data capabilities  from the existing Telstra mobile network, providing a platform for  regional communities to share their stories and culture.  With our support, Arenamedia was able to shoot Blueback entirely onsite, never missing a beat when transmitting  rushes or managing technical requirements. We enabled all production staff to stay connected and manage day- to-day activities, within timelines and budgets, despite teams being physically separated by large distances.  Watch the movie trailer here. Tech innovation This year, we continued to invest in technologies  that will dramatically transform Australia in the near  future. It takes a team of partners from the tech world,  academia, government, industry and the community  to make lasting, scalable change.  Our technology innovation efforts are centred  around the transformative potential of our  infrastructure and platforms. They range from  investing in Australia's largest quantum computing  company to collaborative efforts with the Australian  Football League (AFL) at Marvel Stadium, where we  are creating transformative ‘Stadium of the Future’  experiences. Additionally, we engage in 5G trials in  partnership with multiple organisations. We are also focusing our innovation efforts in key  industries that power the Australian economy. These  include agribusiness, where we collaborate closely  with industry bodies and major corporate partners like  Microsoft and IBM, and domestic Australian start-ups  like Farmbot, Smart Paddock and Zetifi to introduce  technologies that make agriculture more sustainable  and competitive. These include enhanced rural and  remote connectivity, the ability to monitor water  levels, keep track of livestock and even being able  to tell when a gate in a paddock has been left open.  Telstra Labs continued to explore and validate cutting- edge technologies including 5G, artificial intelligence  (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), augmented reality (AR)  and the metaverse, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) and  drone communications. In FY23, we completed a trial  with Rheinmetall under an Australian Government  5G Innovation Initiative grant. This trial showed the  feasibility of using drones to connect to Telstra’s  5G network and extend connectivity to a remotely  controlled fire-fighting vehicle. This approach could be  used to fight fires in regions where mobile coverage is  traditionally difficult to achieve, such as in a gully in a  rural location. These vehicles could deliver water when  it’s too dangerous for fire-fighters to get close to the  fire-front, and ultimately, save lives. We also partnered  with Field of Vision to create new experiences for vision  impaired AFL fans.  Our Telstra Data Hub platform allows companies  to securely share, view and exchange data that can  deliver real benefits to their productivity. In FY23, we  announced a 12-month trial with the Global Digital  Farm in Wagga Wagga to test our new integrated  agtech platform called Farm Data Services. Enabled  through our Data Hub, the Farm Data Services platform  provides a highly scalable and secure data sharing  platform to integrate, standardise and, with permission  of the data owner, distribute datasets from existing  agtech deployments. The platform aims to overcome  one of the biggest hurdles in modern, data-driven  agriculture – how to securely manage and integrate  data from multiple technologies across the farm. The  trial is a partnership between Telstra, Food Agility CRC  and Charles Sturt University.  ===== PAGE 43 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 43 Creating a better digital world Case Study Telstra Labs and Field of Vision create a new experience for  vision-impaired AFL fans Having low vision shouldn’t stop anyone from playing sport, or being a die-hard club fan. However, it  can change how someone experiences it. As a person who is blind, Western Bulldogs supporter, Shaun  experiences AFL games predominantly through sound, using headphones to listen to commentary and  game sounds to visualise what’s happening on the field.  We want all fans to have access to the technology they need to bring a live AFL match to life. To do this,  we explored how technology, underpinned by the speed and responsiveness of our 5G mobile network,  could add a new element to AFL matches, allowing people with low vision experience more of the game  than they already do.  We have been working with the team from Field of Vision and our Telstra Labs to create a new experience  for vision-impaired AFL fans. It uses innovative technology that translates the movement of a ball on-field  to a physical device. Using magnetic technology that moves inside the body of the device, as the Sherrin is  kicked and handballed around the oval, a steel ring on the surface moves precisely to where the ball is on  the playing field. As the ball is run and passed around the field, the ring tracks its every motion. As it’s  kicked, the fast movement of the ring will match the intensity of noise from the field and the fans –  especially if that kick turns into a goal! Read the article on the AFL website.   ===== PAGE 44 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 44 Creating a better digital world Building responsible tech skills  Collaborating to bridge  the digital divide  This year, we participated in the Digital  Connectedness of Older Victorians Roundtable  hosted by the Commissioner for Senior Victorians  and the Council on the Ageing’s Positive Ageing  Alliance Roundtable 'Digital Inclusion: Older  Western Australians’. We were also the 2022  Principal Supporting Partner of Get Online  Week, through which we supported community  organisations to run over 1,000 digital skills  sessions reaching 19,000 people with minimal or  no digital skills. During this week, Telstra employees  volunteered as digital mentors, helping friends  and family members learn new skills and ran  digital skills events in their local communities. Image: Telstra’s Eva Colic and Michael Heydon at a Get Online  Week event in Mandurah, WA. Held in partnership with the  Senior's Recreation Council of WA.  Our commitment to building responsible  tech skills is underpinned by our long-term  partnerships with governments and non-profit  organisations. Through collaboration,  we deliver digital literacy programs with our  community partners to help people of all  ages and backgrounds develop the skills and  knowledge they need to use technology  safely and responsibly. Older Australians  Adults aged over 65 are the least digitally included  age group in Australia9. We continue to support  older Australians through our digital literacy programs,  giving older people, particularly those in regional areas,  the opportunity to develop the skills and confidence  to safely embrace digital technology.  This year, we launched a new Learning Digital online  hub offering short, self-guided content covering topics  such as using the internet, email, internet safety and  cyber security, and two-step verification. We also  refreshed educational content on the hub, introduced  free digital skills building sessions over the phone and  increased the digital skills support we provide in store.  In New South Wales, we have partnered with  government to deliver our Tech Savvy Seniors  program for ten years and in FY23, provided 15,287  face-to-face and virtual digital literacy training  places for older Australians in English, Auslan, Tamil,  Vietnamese, Hindi, Mandarin, Cantonese and more.  Read our article on Telstra Exchange.  In Victoria, we partner with the University of the  Third Age (U3A), Public Libraries Victoria and the  Department of Families, Fairness and Housing to  deliver Social Seniors. Social Seniors is a series of  workshops that have a ‘learn by doing’ approach to  technology and digital storytelling. The program builds digital confidence and capability in  older Australians, encouraging them to use technology  to connect with family, friends and community groups.  In response to COVID-19 and associated restrictions,  the program was refreshed to enable virtual delivery  to become a part of the program’s standard offering.  In FY23, Social Seniors engaged with 238 participants. 9	 www.digitalinclusionindex.org.au/interactive-data-dashboards Collectively, our digital literacy  programs supported more  than 200,000 Australians to  build digital skills in FY23; and  more than 250,000 over the  past two years, putting us on  track to meet our T25 target to  build digital skills for 500,000  Australians, by FY25.  ===== PAGE 45 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 45 Creating a better digital world Justice Connect partnership  This year, we formed a new partnership with Justice  Connect, a leading Australian charity, to develop a  digital self-help resource hub that helps Australians  prepare and respond to disaster situations.  Using artificial intelligence and digital marketing  tools, Justice Connect will train people with low  digital skills to access and use online self-help  resources. The hub will go live in late 2023. First Nations communities  We have a range of established and leading  programs to improve digital literacy and accessibility  for First Nations people and communities across  Australia. These programs include:   •	 InDigiMOB – a pioneering co-designed  digital inclusion project, funded by Telstra  and delivered by First Nations Media Australia.  The project addresses digital inclusion and cyber  safety awareness. This year, the program reached  245 people across locations in the Northern  Territory, South Australia and Western Australia.  IndigiMOB has employed 169 Digital Mentors  since the project started in 2016. For more  information, please visit inDigiMOB.  •	 Deadly Digital Communities – an initiative  of State Library of Queensland and Telstra in  partnership with Queensland Local Governments  through their Indigenous Knowledge Centre  (IKC) and public library service. This year, we  introduced a series of ‘Who's Your Mob’ family  history research workshops which helped people  explore online resources to discover and share  their stories, get communities involved and  strengthen connections. This year, 50 people  gained new digital skills through Deadly Digital  Communities. For more information, please visit  Deadly Digital Communities. •	 Mobile My Way – a telecommunications literacy  training project, funded by Telstra and delivered  by the Centre for Appropriate Technology. The  project delivered telecommunication literacy  to First Nations customers living in remote  communities in the Northern Territory in locations  where we had recently installed new or improved  telecommunications infrastructure. Throughout  FY23, Mobile My Way reached 778 people across  11 remote locations. Find the training resources  on our website. We continue to collaborate with the Australian  Government to improve digital inclusion outcomes  for First Nations peoples. In January 2023, Lauren  Ganley, Telstra’s Head of First Nations Strategy  & Engagement, was appointed to the First Nations  Digital Inclusion Expert Panel. The Panel supports  progress towards Target 17 of the National Agreement  on Closing the Gap which seeks to achieve equal levels  of digital inclusion for First Nations people by 2026.  Parents  For parents trying to keep their kids and families safe  online, we provide a range of practical tips, including  our add-on, Telstra Device Security subscription  service. To find out how you can protect yourself and  your loved ones, read our article on Telstra Exchange.   ===== PAGE 46 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 46 Creating a better digital world Case Study Closing the digital gap in Australia’s  least connected communities  While most Australian cities enjoy excellent internet  access, there is still a broad ‘digital gap’ between urban  and regional areas, which is even more pronounced  across 1,100 First Nations remote communities. Since 2021, Telstra has been working with the ARC Centre  of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and Society  to build the first-ever databank tracking internet access,  affordability and ability in remote communities. As well as  informing policy and programs to boost connectivity and  give First Nations peoples equal levels of digital inclusion by 2026,  the Mapping the Digital Gap (MTDG) project is helping 11 communities develop Digital Inclusion Plans to inform  local strategies and advocate for greater government and industry support to address specific challenges. In July, MTDG’s 2022 findings were included for the first time as part of the nationwide Australian Digital  Inclusion Index. The findings include 530 surveys, which show that while digital ability is relatively high across  remote communities, access and affordability remain low. Eighty-six per cent of people primarily use mobile  phones for internet use, with ninety per cent of these using pre-paid services. However, the MTDG team remains cautiously optimistic. The Australian Government recently established  a First Nations Digital Inclusion Advisory Group (with an MTDG member co-chairing), and in April, announced  an additional $25 million for First Nations communities through its Regional Connectivity Program. This has  led to proposals for more community mentors, digital training and free public Wi-Fi. Telstra has also made  calls free to standard national numbers from all Telstra public payphones and free Wi-Fi access available at  designated payphones. “It’s just a start,” says MTDG project lead Daniel Featherstone, “but the community reports are already having an  impact, highlighting diverse challenges and providing a critical baseline to inform policy and funding needed to  reduce the digital gap.” For more information, please visit the project website.  Measuring impact and  social value In 2023, the State Library of Queensland  commissioned the Queensland University of  Technology to develop a Digital Inclusion Programs  Evaluation examining the programs delivered  through Queensland’s public libraries and Indigenous  Knowledge Centres between 2016 and 2022. This  included Telstra’s Tech Savvy Seniors, Deadly  Digital Communities and Tech Savvy Communities.  The report found digital inclusion programming had  generated over $10.1 million in social value.   ===== PAGE 47 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 47 Creating a better digital world Customers needing  extra care We are committed to helping those facing cost- of-living pressure by continuing to offer a range  of products, services and programs to improve  digital inclusion outcomes for our customers and  communities. These activities include: •	 providing lower-cost services for people on  a low income  •	 support during times of financial hardship,  including access to safe and secure  communications for victims of domestic  and family violence •	 free Telstra mobile calls to crisis lines and  unmetered mobile data access to Ask Izzy,  a mobile website that connects people in crisis  with the support services they need •	 free calls to standard national numbers from  all Telstra public payphones and free Wi-Fi  access available at designated payphones •	 providing disaster relief. Our CEO Consumer Roundtable plays an important  role in informing our approach to customers needing  extra care. Held twice a year, the Roundtable provides  an opportunity for the CEO and Executives to listen to  and learn from key consumer advocacy stakeholders  to improve the experiences of our sales and service  performance, particularly for customers doing it tough. Helping fund financial  counselling services This year, Telstra contributed to a cross-industry  initiative to provide a one-off $7.75 million  donation to the Financial Counselling Foundation.  The $7.75 million will enable the Foundation to  provide additional support to existing grants that  are expiring and to implement new projects to  support victims of family violence, tenants at risk  of homelessness, First Nations communities and  people in prison. Communications Alliance helped  facilitate the initiative, which was also supported  by the banking, finance, insurance, energy,  telecommunications and online gambling sectors.  Checking in with  First Nations customers The Telstra ‘Pink Bus’ has been visiting remote  communities for over two years. In FY23, the Pink  Bus visited 53 remote communities across  the Northern Territory, Queensland and New  South Wales and helped 7,680 customers. Services  include identifying and removing bad debt,  checking customers are on the most appropriate  plans, making sure customers can use the  My Telstra app and have information to connect to  our First Nations Connect hotline. Since November  2019, the Pink Bus has visited over 150 remote  communities, reaching more than 11,000 customers. Supporting customers  We believe that everyone deserves access to the digital world, regardless of their  location, circumstance or socio-economic status. We keep communities connected by  providing them with affordable and accessible connectivity options, and ensuring we  always support our customers in a way that meets their individual needs. Through these activities, we  helped 1.26 million customers  in vulnerable circumstances  stay connected this year.   ===== PAGE 48 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 48 Creating a better digital world Improving affordability  We recognise that affordable telecommunication  services are critical to staying connected and some  customers experience temporary hardship or longer- term financial challenges. We offer affordability  initiatives for people on low-incomes or for those  experiencing financial hardship by partnering with  local community organisations across Australia to  develop and deliver programs to assist our most  vulnerable customers and communities.  We partner with more than 2,000 local community  organisations across Australia to deliver our Access  for Everyone programs. This includes products and  services which address barriers to staying connected  and are designed to support people in financial  hardship, including people in crisis, experiencing  homelessness, pensioners and low-income families.  In FY23, we supported 10,489 customers impacted by  homelessness, domestic and family violence or natural  disaster with a free $40 pre-paid mobile recharge.  Responding to cost-of-living pressures, in May 2023,  we announced an expansion of the Telstra Top-Up  program to provide more support to more people.  In July 2023, The Top-Up value increased from three  $40 recharges expiring after 28 days to one $160  recharge that expires after six months. The program  is available to people experiencing or at risk of financial  difficulty, food insecurity, mental health, disability,  natural disaster, homelessness or domestic and  family violence. For more information, please visit  the InfoXchange website. We also provided 224,263 pensioners with a discount  on their Telstra services, 36,435 eligible customers  with a discount on their mobile plan and 2,866 low- income families with emergency bill assistance.  The low-income package concessional benefits  totalled $51.4 million in FY23, an increase of 28.5 per  cent compared to FY22 ($40 million). The increase  reflects changes made to the package in FY23 to  include our concession mobile plan to reflect the  increasing role of mobile and broadband connectivity.  In addition, this year, 205,435 customers were  connected through our Starter Internet Plan designed  with the needs of older Australians in mind. Availability  of this plan has been expanded to include any  customer starting their internet journey; they no  longer need to be receiving government benefits. For women experiencing domestic and family  violence, we provide access to safe and secure  communications – a smart phone, $30 pre-paid  starter kit and information to help them stay safely  connected. Delivered in partnership with the Women’s  Services Network (WESNET), Telstra Safe Connections  has distributed more than 38,000 phones to women  since its inception in 2014, including 1,400 in FY23.  To better assist victim-survivors, Telstra has a  designated customer service team in place, staffed  by specially trained agents who are equipped to  take a ‘high care’ approach. Supporting the School  Student Broadband Initiative This year, our Belong brand joined the Australian  Government’s School Student Broadband  Initiative, which will provide up to 30,000 free  home internet connections for low-income  families with school age children who do not  have access to the national broadband network  (nbn). Once eligible families are nominated by  participating schools, education authorities or  community organisations, we provide no-cost  internet for 12 months. This year, we connected  324 services.

Telstra’s accessibility journey began nearly  40 years ago with the introduction of specialised  products to assist people with disabilities to use a  standard telephone service. Since then, accessibility  has expanded into all areas of our business, from  products and digital services for our customers, to  new recruitment practices and workplace adjustments  for our employees. We continue to engage with peak  bodies and disability advocacy organisations through  our bi-annual disability stakeholder forum.  Our Accessibility and Disability Inclusion Action  Plan FY23-FY25 details how we continue to build  inclusion and equitable access to overcome barriers  that prevent full social and economic participation for  people with disability. The plan presents actions we  are taking as a business to encourage, recognise and  promote an active commitment to eliminating disability  discrimination. We consulted people with disability  in the creation of the plan. All 12 FY23 commitments  have been completed.  Both the My Telstra app and Telstra website have  been certified for meeting international web content  accessibility guidelines levels A and AA. We have  also worked hard to ensure that the over five million  documents we email our customers each month  incorporate key accessibility requirements. This  means the one in ten Australians who rely on assistive  technologies can better access their bills, invoices,  credit adjustments and debt letters. We celebrated another year of disability confidence  and, for the fourth year in a row, received Disability  Confident Recruiter accreditation from the Australian  Network on Disability. The program aims to remove  barriers for people with disabilities during the  recruitment process. Disability confident recruitment  is just one way we are working towards attracting  and retaining disability talent. Our Accessibility and  Inclusion Action Plan outlines ten commitments  to inclusive employment and support for people  with disability.  We continue to maintain our commitment to the  Disability Enquiry Hotline, Directory Assistance Helpline  and Disability Equipment Program. During FY23, we  provided 51 pieces of disability-specific equipment  through the program. This complements our standard  product range which includes devices with features to  support customers who have accessibility needs. Telstra also supports the Australian Communications  Consumer Action Network’s Accessible Telecoms  service. This service provides consolidated,  independent and up-to-date information about  accessibility features of telecommunications  equipment available to vulnerable consumer groups.  It plays an important role in industry by empowering  users, such as older Australians and people with  disability, to make informed choices regarding the  products and services best suited to their needs. Although we have delivered several key initiatives this  year, we don’t always get it right. In FY23, we received  18 complaints of disability discrimination from the  Australian Human Rights Commission and three from  the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. Of  these 21 complaints, 18 have been closed and three  are in progress. Complaints that have uncovered  any systemic issues are escalated and are used for  continuous improvements to our customer service. Empowering digital skills  through Auslan Deaf Connect has run nearly 150 Tech Savvy  Seniors classes since 2015. More than 1,100 seniors  have participated in the classes taking place at the  Deaf Connect offices in Parramatta and in libraries  and community centres across Sydney and regional  New South Wales. Deaf Connect has adapted the  Tech Savvy Seniors training to focus on graphic  ‘how-to’ lessons in Auslan – the national sign  language, used by at least 16,000 Australians.  The lessons demonstrate popular apps, video  platforms, and other programs, with clear  illustrations which lead participants through  steps for downloading and using apps. Participants  in the program have learnt how to use their devices  to connect with interpreting services as well as  becoming more confident in spotting scams.

We take our role as custodian of customer data  seriously and invest heavily in cyber security measures  to help protect our customers’ data and privacy. We  also deliver cyber security training to our employees  and customers to help them understand the risks  associated with using technology and how to better  protect themselves and their data.  Privacy  We are committed to being transparent with our  customers about how we collect, use and manage their  personal information. We take a global approach to  privacy management and apply the Australian Privacy  Act, the European Union General Data Protection  Regulation and local legislation, where applicable. We manage privacy and data access through our  Code of Conduct, Privacy Statements and other  relevant policies and security controls. These set strict  standards relating to privacy and confidentiality, and  protect customer data from interference, misuse and  unauthorised access.  We are committed to protecting and securing our  customers’ personal information and complying with  all applicable relevant privacy legislation. Our Privacy  Statements explain to our customers how we manage  the personal information they entrust to us. We  undertake regular reviews of our Privacy Statements to  ensure they remain fit for purpose. We do not share any  information with third parties that identifies or could  reasonably identify a customer, except in line with our  Privacy Statements, or if we are required or permitted  by law to do so.  We consider customer privacy and data protection  in the design and development of our organisational  processes, products and initiatives. We aim to  ensure that privacy related risks are considered and  assessed from the outset of every concept, project,  product, service, program or IT system enhancement  or development by completing Privacy Impact  Assessments.  In line with Telstra’s Compliance Framework, the Board,  Audit and Risk Committee, our CEO and Executive  Leadership Team is committed to meeting all our legal  and regulatory obligations. They are accountable for  ensuring everyone at Telstra understands and complies  with these requirements within the jurisdictions where  Telstra conducts business. Accountable Executives  within our business units are also responsible for  specific privacy compliance requirements related to  functions they perform.  In FY23, we had five privacy incidents requiring  notification to the Office of the Australian Information  Commissioner and one incident relating to  misalignment of data within our Directory Assistance  and Directory Listing databases, which we also  self-reported to the Australian Communications and  Media Authority.  In all cases, we directly contacted the impacted  customers to discuss any concerns and offered  solutions appropriate to their situation, such as  updating customer accounts, covering costs of credit  check subscriptions (for customers whose credit  history may be at risk) or referral to third party identity  and cyber support services. We also took action to  manage or remediate the breaches, which included  reviewing policies and procedures, implementing  additional controls, and providing additional training  and guidance to our people to ensure processes  are correctly followed.  ===== PAGE 51 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 51 Creating a better digital world Digital ethics, rights  and responsibilities At Telstra, we purchase, develop, use and sell  products that use artificial intelligence (AI) and  machine learning (ML). We also analyse our data to  gain insights into our network performance and how  our customers use our products and services. We  are conscious of the potential impacts of AI and ML  on our community and particularly those who are  most vulnerable. At the same time, we are aware of  the exciting opportunities they represent to deliver  enhanced network performance and a personalised  customer experience. We take our responsibility to  develop, deploy and monitor these products seriously.  We strive to do this in ways that respect the privacy  of our customers and the wider community, but also  consider broader ethical considerations.    Our approach is informed by our Responsible AI Policy  which is closely aligned to the Australian Framework  for Ethical AI. Our policy guides the responsibility and  care expected from the Telstra Group regarding these  technologies. The governance of this policy includes  oversight of Telstra data and AI initiatives  by Telstra’s Risk Council on AI and Data (RCAID)  chaired by our Data & AI Risk Management Principal.  In FY23, we refined our operational procedures to  embed the implementation of our policy more deeply.  This included: •	 ensuring our RCAID governance process  covered the new Quantium Telstra venture from  its inception  •	 upgrading our AI Model Register, which records all  Telstra AI use cases, to version two and reconciling  the registered cases with those in production   •	 applying in-production monitoring controls to  higher-risk use cases on our major AI platforms  •	 defining guidelines for the use of generative  AI within Telstra. Cyber security and  data protection Cyber security, privacy and data and artificial  intelligence management are material risks to our  organisation and our stakeholders. The past 12 months  have seen our cyber security capability continue to  grow in strength and demonstrate resilience in the  face of an ongoing dynamic threat landscape.  At Telstra, our approach to cyber security and data  protection is comprehensive, multi-layered and  underpinned by a Cyber Security Strategy, Group  Security Policy, Group Information Management  Policy and Group Privacy Policy. Our Chief Information  Security Office is responsible for global cyber security  and reports to our Audit and Risk Committee at least  twice a year, and to our Board as needed. This year, we intensified our attention on cyber  security and data protection with the declaration of  a company objective for FY24. This includes measures  to reduce our data holdings to legal minimums, to know  where our data is, its risk, and strengthen our security  protections for personal information. We employ a range of strategies and technologies  to help protect our customers' information and assets  from cyber threats. One key aspect of our approach  is risk management. We have a framework that allows  us to manage cyber security and data protection risks  effectively. This includes regular risk assessments,  threat modelling and asset inventory management.  We use various risk management standards, such as  the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard  (PCI DSS), ISO 27001 and the US National Institute of  Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework  (NIST CSF) to guide our efforts.  Our new data and AI venture This year, we formed a new partnership with  Quantium to unlock the full potential of data and  AI for Telstra and our customers. The venture will  bring together Quantium’s market-leading data  science and AI capabilities with Telstra’s customer,  product and network data assets. Called Quantium  Telstra, the new venture will not only provide  personalised and data-enabled products and  offers for Telstra’s customers, but it will also  embed proactive and predictive AI and machine  learning across Telstra’s core business.  For more information, read our media release.  ===== PAGE 52 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 52 Creating a better digital world Another important aspect of our approach is threat  intelligence. Our Threat Research and Intelligence  team leverages a range of internal and external sources  of intelligence to help stay ahead of emerging cyber  threats. We use machine learning and data analytics  to analyse and correlate threat data to identify and  prioritise potential threats. This intelligence allows us  to take proactive measures to help protect our network  and customers. From a data protection perspective, we recognise  that reducing and simplifying how much data we  hold makes the job of protecting it easier. Across the  company, we are in the process of streamlining and  reducing our data holdings wherever possible. We also implement various access control measures,  such as strong password policies, multi-factor  authentication (MFA), privileged access management  (PAM), and role-based access controls (RBAC), to  help prevent unauthorised access to our systems  and data. We employ network segmentation and  data encryption to ensure data is only accessible  by authorised personnel. Our cyber assurance  and enablement capabilities oversee third-party  assessments to enhance information security within  our network of third-party suppliers. At Telstra, we believe cyber security is as much about  people as it is technology. We invest in employee  training and awareness programs to help our  employees understand their role in protecting Telstra,  our network and our customers. Our innovative Cyber  Security Influence program builds our security culture  and behaviours in the organisation and includes  security news, advisories, videos and gamified learning.  Our program also has a highly engaged employee  community for security enthusiasts and we conduct  regular simulated phishing campaigns to test and  improve employee awareness.  Finally, we are committed to compliance with relevant  cyber security regulations and standards, including  ISO 27001, the Australian Privacy Principles, and the  Essential Eight mitigation strategies developed by the  Australian Cyber Security Centre. Telstra conducts  regular audits and assessments to ensure compliance  obligations are met.  When things go wrong  Our world-class Security Operations Center (SOC)  provides 24/7 monitoring and response to security  incidents. The SOC team is made up of highly skilled  security professionals who investigate and respond to  security incidents using advanced security tools, such  as SIEM (Security Information and Event Management),  EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) and NTA  (Network Traffic Analysis) solutions. We have a  comprehensive incident response plan that outlines  the steps to be taken in the event of a security incident.  This plan includes procedures for incident reporting,  containment, analysis, remediation and mitigation.  We regularly test and update the plan to ensure its  effectiveness in responding to emerging threats.  Keeping your personal  ID data safe  One of the lessons from the recent data breaches  in Australia, for all organisations, is the need to  continually assess what data needs to be stored,  and how and where we store it. This year, we kicked  off a review of our systems to challenge ourselves  to minimise the government ID data we hold, and  how long we hold it for, while continuing to meet our  existing legal obligations. While we will continue to  scan ID documents to check customer identity and  protect against fraud, we are reducing the time we  keep these scans from two years to six months.  For more information on how to keep your personal  ID data safe, read our article on Telstra Exchange.

This is why we launched our Cleaner Pipes  initiative, and why we’re helping all customers on the Telstra network join the fight against scammers by  reporting SMS and MMS scams to a national phone number. Customers who forward SMS and MMS scams to 7226 (SCAM) will help Telstra better protect millions of  Australians from receiving harmful SMS/MMS messages that may attempt to trick them into providing their  personal information, credit cards or downloading malicious apps. All customers need to do is forward the  SMS/MMS scam to 7226. We won’t send a reply message and customers won’t be charged for sending this SMS. Our Cleaner Pipes initiative helps block on average, 23 million scam SMS each month since it was introduced  in April 2022.  Our 7226 SCAM number is another keystone in the fight to stay ahead of scams and help Telstra’s internal  cyber security team more quickly identify and block emerging scam techniques or threats before they can affect  more Australians. While Telstra blocks millions of scam messages each month, we can’t catch everything. Our technology is  evolving, so it’s important everyone remains vigilant and alert to the rise in scam activity. We all have a part to  play in helping secure our personal and private data to help protect it from criminals who want to profit from it.

For more than  20 years Telstra Foundation, our registered  Australian charity, has supported Australian  initiatives focussed on youth education,  mental health and inclusion.  Via philanthropy, we bring Telstra’s purpose to life for  young people, particularly those who are marginalised  or face significant challenges and unfair barriers. Today, we fund technology-enabled projects that  tackle some of the biggest social challenges facing  young people with the goal to:   •	 improve youth mental wellbeing (SDG Goal 3)    •	 close the youth education and learning divide  (SDG Goal 4)    •	 empower young people for climate action  (SDG Goal 13).  Underpinning this work is the belief that all young  people should have the same opportunity to thrive  and that where they live, their socio-economic status,  cultural background, gender and ability should never  be a barrier to them accessing education, to their  wellbeing or feeling empowered to act on climate.  All our projects and programs put young people in the  driver’s seat, empowering them to be the designers  and creators, as well as the consumers of the tech we  enable. We champion co-design approaches to ensure  the needs of disadvantaged young people shape the  digital products and services that are meant for them.  This year, we worked with eight charity and  social enterprise partners, committing $5.3 million  through the Foundation to support community  programs and partnerships. Over $840,000 from  Telstra shareholders and employees programs was  also donated to Foundation partners to amplify our  mission. Six longstanding partner projects were  acquitted, and we onboarded 12 new social innovation  projects as part of our new Young & Connected Fund  which focuses on youth wellbeing and education. We  scaled up our free, nationwide Code Club Australia  program, engaging more than 40,000 young people  via our Moonhack campaign to get kids coding.  We also continued to support the Healthy Country  AI Training initiative as part of Telstra Reconciliation  Action Plan (RAP) commitments. Innovation is the key to unlocking the technology’s  full potential. We invest in partners who develop  their own innovative ideas and solutions, providing  them with opportunities to tap into our time, talent  and resources to help bring those ideas to life. For  example, we teamed up with Telstra’s data science  community (Helix) via our Data4Good initiative to  host the ClimateWatch Validation Blitz. In June 2023,  Telstra volunteers validated over 3,000 community  data submissions, breaking last year’s record in an  extraordinary effort that will help scientists, policy  makers, environmental planners, land managers and  industry to make informed decisions on our climate.  This program won the international CDO magazine/ EDM Council Data 4 Good Award for Climate Action.  Collectively, our work continues to make a significant  contribution to Telstra’s target to lift the digital  skills of 500,000 Australians by FY25, and through  philanthropy, amplifies diversity and inclusion issues  supported by Telstra.   ===== PAGE 55 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 55 Creating a better digital world Case Study How we’re supporting youth  mental health and wellbeing  We partnered with Orygen Digital to fund the development  and pilot of Mello, a groundbreaking smartphone app to  empower young people to manage their mental health  proactively by using practical, science-backed techniques.  Developed alongside young people. Mello works by  addressing the root cause of anxiety and depression;  repetitive negative thinking, or 'stuck thinking.' The app  provides evidence-based activities that offer in-the-moment  relief from negative thoughts, while also building skills to break the cycle of negative thinking long term.  Users can track their mood and receive tailored therapy activity recommendations through check-ins and  access evidence-based therapy activities to improve their mental wellbeing.   Adverse mental health costs the Australian economy $40 billion annually, and young people represent the  demographic with the largest burden of disease. Almost 40 per cent of young Australians have experienced  a mental health disorder in the last year, with depression and anxiety being the most common. Young people  suffering from adverse mental health conditions are 40 per cent less likely to complete high school and three  times more likely to be unemployed in adulthood. It’s also known that seeking help, getting access to support,  and engagement with mental health treatment are major challenges for young people. Of the half that gain  access to evidence-based treatment, 40 per cent drop out.  In Mello’s randomised controlled trial, young people with clinical levels of depression and/or anxiety and  problems with repetitive negative thinking used the app for six weeks and the results were compared to a control  group. The study found that the Mello group showed greater relief from depression, anxiety, repetitive negative  thinking and wellbeing than the control group. 82 per cent of Mello users experienced less anxiety, 79 per cent  were less depressed, and 83 per cent had less repetitive negative thinking.  Users are welcome to download Mello and try the app out here.   Image: Mello – a smart phone app to manage “stuck thinking”  Case Study How we’re supporting digital skills  training for Indigenous Rangers Across the world, First Nations peoples manage more  than 80 per cent of vital ecosystems and threatened  species. In Australia, about four million square kilometres  of combined land and sea Country are Indigenous-titled  lands. That’s over half of Australia’s total land area. At the  same time, First Nations peoples face many challenges in  land management. Climate change, for one, is accelerating  species extinctions and ecosystem losses. Such threats  are also increasing in scale and urgency.   We are funding North Australian Indigenous Land & Sea Management Alliance (NAILSMA) and CSIRO, Australia's  leading science agency, to deliver the Healthy Country AI Training initiative. This multi-year partnership trains young  Indigenous Rangers and practitioners to use artificial intelligence (AI) in caring for Country in five First Nations  communities across Kakadu, Arnhem Land and Cape York in partnership with Indigenous Rangers, Traditional  Owners, and community practitioners. The training also empowers young Indigenous women rangers to engage with  digital technologies and data collection, analysis, and use their digital skills to adaptively manage their lands.

We are harnessing technology, digital and connectivity  solutions to accelerate action on climate change and  minimise our impact on the planet. We are committed  to leading by example and using our scale and voice  to accelerate the transition to a more environmentally  sustainable world. We are driven to make a difference  beyond our business by encouraging and enabling our  customers, suppliers and communities to do the same. Governance  The Telstra Board is responsible for overseeing our  environment strategy and monitoring our performance  against that strategy. In FY23, we incorporated our  scope 1+2 absolute emissions reduction target into  the performance measures for our Executive Variable  Remuneration Plan (EVP), making it a component  of senior executive short-term incentives under our  remuneration structure. This recognises the critical  nature of this target to our organisation’s success  and each team member’s role to achieve it.

For information about our climate change governance,  please see the Understanding our climate risk (our  TCFD disclosure) section of our 2023 Annual Report  available on our reports page.  Risk management Telstra’s risk management framework provides  the foundations and key processes for identifying,  assessing and managing environmental risks. We  maintain a register of risks and plans to mitigate them.  Our risk register is a living document, and all risks are  reviewed on a regular basis. Climate change is a key  risk for Telstra and we are working to mitigate and  adapt to its impacts through our environment strategy.

To us, addressing climate change means  taking ambitious steps to decarbonise our  business, and helping our customers and  suppliers do the same.   We are a member of the United Nations Global  Compact’s Business Ambition for 1.5°C, pledging  to help limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C above  pre-industrial levels.   We are committed to achieving net zero greenhouse  gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, aligned with the Paris  Agreement. To achieve this, we have set an emissions  reduction target that has been validated by the  Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as aligned  to a trajectory to limit global warming to 1.5°C.  Decarbonise Telstra In FY23, we achieved a 19 per cent reduction in our  scope 1+2 GHG emissions compared to the previous  year and have achieved a cumulative 30 per cent  reduction against our baseline year of FY19. We  achieved this by improving the energy efficiency of  our network and our infrastructure, accelerating the  decommissioning of legacy technology and leveraging  the reduced emissions intensity of the electricity grid  as the use of renewable energy increases.

During FY23, Telstra branded mobile plans and  mobile broadband plans were also certified carbon  neutral. This is in addition to our current product  level certification for Telstra’s Belong mobile  offering. Our investment complements our focus  on decarbonising our operations, the electricity  grid and the economy. For more information,  read our article on Telstra Exchange.  We consider the use of carbon credits to be a  useful mechanism for directing investment towards  accelerating action to avoid or reduce emissions  outside our control. While we are working to reduce  our own scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, we are committed  to offsetting any remaining emissions. The approach  of first reducing then offsetting emissions is aligned  to the Australian Government’s Climate Active  framework and is what we mean when we refer to  ourselves as carbon neutral. Each year, we retire  carbon credits to meet our current and projected  carbon neutral certification commitments.  In FY23, to maintain Telstra's carbon neutral  certifications we purchased approximately 2.26 million  carbon credits with over 99 per cent from wind, solar  and energy efficient manufacturing processes in  India, and the remaining volume from savanna burning  projects in Australia. Over the last four years we have  purchased a total of around 8.5 million carbon credits.  We invest in high integrity credits that are sourced  from projects that avoid, reduce or remove emissions  from the atmosphere and deliver positive sustainable  impact. With operations in Australian and international  markets, we recognise the importance of developing  a robust and mature market for sequestration in  Australia, and the value of channelling capital from  developed to developing countries in support of  climate resilience.   For more information about carbon neutral certification  and disclosures, including our carbon credit portfolio,  please see Telstra’s Climate Active Public Disclosure  Statement and Belong's Climate Active Public  Disclosure Statement. To view a detailed breakdown of our carbon credits,  please see our 2023 Data Pack available on our  reports page.  Carbon offset governance All carbon credit purchases follow our Carbon Credit  Acquisition Guideline and align to international best  practice principles, such as the Integrity Council for  the Voluntary Carbon Market’s core carbon principles  and assessment frameworks. This ensures our continued  investment in high integrity credits to achieve positive  sustainable impact. In FY23, our purchasing strategy  and due diligence approach was governed by our Carbon  Neutral Executive Group which consists of executives  from across the company. International and domestic  carbon projects go through a staged assessment  process which considers governance, emissions impact  and sustainable development outcomes. The initial  review ensures projects meet our minimum compliance  requirements regarding carbon credit programs, vintage,  country, methodology and supply chain. Projects are  then assessed against criteria that consider Telstra  policies and strategy, technical review, environment  and social impact, value for money and reputation risk  and exposure.  ===== PAGE 62 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 62 Sustaining our planet Case Study Carbon neutral mobile phone plans  and Telstra Plus points In February we announced that our mobile plans are  100 per cent carbon neutral, as certified by Climate Active.  Ongoing use of the Telstra mobile network connection is  carbon neutral for all Telstra mobile customers. This applies  to all Telstra branded consumer (pre- and post-paid), small  business and enterprise mobile plans and mobile broadband  plans. It includes the carbon emissions of a mobile plan,  including the SIM card and the energy that powers the  Telstra network to make calls and stream content. It does  not include the emissions associated with the physical  handset or device customers use. We also announced that customers could use their Telstra Plus points to help offset their own everyday carbon  emissions by supporting Australian and international climate projects. These offsets are for customers who want  to minimise their own impact and do not count towards our own carbon neutral targets. Customers have used 1.98 million Telstra Plus points to offset 295 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent  emissions in FY23. For more information on our carbon neutral plans please visit our website. For more information on how you can redeem your Telstra Plus points to help offset emissions please visit  our website. Case Study An update on our carbon farm  Our pilot carbon farm at Yarrowyck in northern NSW has  completed the first stage of planting. With our partner  AirSeed, we have planted over 400,000 seed pods across  110 hectares, tagging the location of each one for future  monitoring. By the end of 2023, our goal is to plant 158,000  trees and shrubs, capable of sequestering 160,000 tonnes  of carbon dioxide over the next 25 years. We have built an Internet of Things (IoT) network that  integrates sensors and data from a TAWN (Telstra Advanced  Weather Network) station - providing our planters with  precise information on environmental factors that could  influence their work, from approaching wind and rain to moisture levels in the soil. The farm at Yarrowyck serves a second purpose: the revitalisation and enhancement of the local nature and  biodiversity. Previously a sheep station, once the land is restored to a forest ecosystem, it will become a wildlife  corridor to local animals including wallaroos and wallabies as well as improve the land’s resilience to water  stress and drought. In 2022, we won an Australian Financial Review Sustainability Leaders Award for Innovation. This was in the  Technology, Media and Telecommunications category for our environment strategy and innovative use of  maggot fertiliser in drone seed planting on our carbon farm.

We strive to reduce energy consumption  across every aspect of our business through  considered planning, equipment monitoring and  energy productivity optimisation.   Our network sites, including fixed network sites and  data centres, are our largest consumers of electricity.  We increased our investment in energy reduction  projects, including both energy efficiency and  decommissioning, from $21.1 million in FY22 to over  $49 million in FY23. Our efforts have been recognised  by the National Energy Efficiency Council, who  awarded Telstra InfraCo the 2022 Leading Energy  User Award.  In FY23, these projects included: •	 upgrade of 100 power systems with high  efficiency rectifiers •	 	almost 350 fans upgraded to electronically  commutated fans •	 	eighteen air conditioning controls and economy  cycle upgrades •	 	installation of over 170 monitoring and energy  efficiency alarming systems on heating, ventilation  and air conditioning (HVAC) systems  •	 	replacement of 59,510 fluorescent lights with  33,232 LED lights at 198 sites (recycling 152  tonnes of lighting waste) •	 	installation of 425 small site cooling managers  and five chilled water-cooling systems, optimised  with demand flow technology •	 	ninety-eight equipment floors upgraded with  blanking walls and in-rack blanking panels,  meaning our ‘hot aisles’ stay hotter, and our  ‘cool aisles’ stay cooler in our exchange buildings •	 	upgrade of 263 air conditioners and 245 economy  fans at 269 wireless network sites as well as  installing 781 high efficiency rectifiers. As part  of a trial, we have also installed 35 new model  air conditioning controllers with enhanced  monitoring functionality. In FY23, our energy efficiency programs delivered  a collective annualised saving of 23,485tCO2e and  30,177MWh electricity. In addition to our energy  efficiency projects, we saved a further 79,406tCO2e  and 100,566MWh annualised through decommissioning  network equipment. For a detailed breakdown of our GHG emissions and  energy consumption, please see our 2023 Data Pack  available on our reports page.   ===== PAGE 64 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 64 Sustaining our planet FY23 energy efficiency and decommissioning initiatives Initiative Description Annualised  energy savings  (MWh) Annualised  emissions savings  (tCO2e) HVAC optimisation We conduct physical inspections of our network sites to identify faults affecting power  consumption and review equipment performance to identify optimisation opportunities 3,650 2,872 Building services energy  efficiency upgrades Our capital works program includes the installation of fresh air cooling systems, high  efficiency air-conditioners, improved cooling control strategies and building management,  and electronically commutated fans 12,728 9,532 LED lighting We are currently undertaking a large multi-year program to remove over 100,000 old  fluorescent lights across hundreds of our facilities and install new LED lights with inbuilt  motion sensors 12,675 10,310 Upgrading rectifiers Rectifiers convert electricity from AC mains power to DC power, which is required to run  our telecommunications equipment. We continue to upgrade older inefficient units to more  modern, high efficiency rectifiers. These are now achieving efficiency levels of 96–98 per cent 1,124 771 Decommissioning  legacy network We are actively rationalising and decommissioning our legacy network equipment, reducing  both direct energy consumption from the equipment as well as associated energy for cooling 99,006 78,326 Network facilities  efficiencies We identified energy efficiency opportunities at our wireless facilities including installing high efficiency rectifiers and economy fan cooling 1,560 1,079 Total 130,743 102,890 Case Study Hydrogen fuel cells We have partnered with the Victorian Government’s Renewable Hydrogen Commercialisation Pathways Fund  program to trial the use of hydrogen fuel cells as backup power at selective sites in place of diesel generators.  The fuel cells use green hydrogen fuel, which is generated from renewable energy sources.  The trial will enable us to test the suitability of green hydrogen fuel cells to provide additional site power, and  assess their technical and commercial viability to provide reliable extended back up power should mains power  fail. If successful, this technology could enable emissions reductions by avoiding the need for less efficient  diesel-generated power, and reduce the associated risk of environmental harm should a generator leak or fail.  Five sites in regional Victoria are participating in the trial to demonstrate the reliability of renewable hydrogen as  a zero-emissions fuel for generator backup power. Construction is expected to be completed in October 2023.   This trial forms part of the Victorian Government’s aim to help kick-start investment in the renewable hydrogen  sector, working to meet ambitious climate change ambitions to reach its net-zero emissions target by 2045.  ===== PAGE 65 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 65 Sustaining our planet LED Lighting Following extensive trials of LED lighting options from  several suppliers in 2020, a solution was chosen that  provides individual movement sensing per individual  fitting. This reduces the amount of time lights are on  and allows for increased spacing of lights, aligned to  Australian Standards and illumination requirements.  Recycling is a key element of the initiative with the  recycling of redundant fluorescent tubes, batteries  that form part of emergency fittings and the metal  and plastic from the old light fittings. With help from our suppliers, the new lights were also  delivered to site without plastic packaging.  Since 2020, we have removed over 127,760 (71,315  in FY23) fluorescent lights from our fixed network  sites and replaced them with 64,630 (34,736 in FY23)  new LED fittings, reducing energy consumption by  23,522MWh per year. Electric vehicles Telstra has an overall fleet of 6,500 vehicles  consisting of 3,000 operational vehicles, 800 trucks  and 2,700 staff salary sacrifice vehicles. Telstra fleet  vehicles made up approximately two per cent of our  FY23 scope 1+2 greenhouse gas emissions. Over the  past 36 months, we have transitioned over 20 per cent  of our operational fleet to hybrid models to reduce our  fleet emissions. We have expanded our charging footprint over  FY23 with Electric Vehicle (EV) chargers and six EV  pool cars now available at four of our head office  locations, with plans to install additional chargers  across all state head offices by the end of FY24.  Our goal is to convert the bulk of our metro and  some regional operational vehicles to electric when  fit-for-purpose commercial EV fleet market options  increase and charging facilities expand. We have  also introduced the first operational hydrogen fuel  cell vehicle into our fleet. Across our salary sacrifice vehicle fleet, we have seen  exponential growth in EV take up in the last six months  due to changes in Fringe Benefit Tax legislation and  improved supply of consumer EVs. As of the end of  FY23 we had 226 EVs across our salary sacrifice fleet  with another 219 on order. Telstra continues to support  our staff as they purchase EVs for personal use.  Including Telstra pool vehicles and vehicles on order,  Telstra will have over 450 Zero Emissions Vehicles  (ZEVs), making up seven per cent of our fleet. In FY24, we will develop an EV transition strategy  for our metro and regional operational vehicle fleet  to transition from petrol/diesel vehicles to Zero  Emission Vehicles.   Chilled water system  optimisation at  Charlotte Exchange In 2022, we trialled a new chilled water  optimisation technology at Charlotte Exchange  in Brisbane.   The project delivered significant savings through  the installation of additional high accuracy  sensors. The sensors provide real-time feedback  on system performance and requirements.  Variable frequency drives on pumps and fans to  allow the system to optimise the entire chilled  water system in real time relative to load.  This project has reduced the energy consumption  of the chiller system by over 30 per cent. An  additional five systems have been installed in  our large fixed network sites in FY23.  ===== PAGE 66 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 66 Sustaining our planet Managing our scope 3  emissions We recognise that we have a responsibility to  contribute to reducing the GHG emissions produced  by our supply chain when providing us with goods  and services and by our customers when using our  products. These are our scope 3 emissions as defined  in the Corporate Value Chain Accounting and Reporting  Standard of the GHG Protocol. We are committed to  reducing our scope 3 emissions by at least 50 per cent  by FY30 (from a FY19 baseline).  Scope 3 represents Telstra’s largest emissions source,  making up 67 per cent of our total footprint. Of our  total scope 3 emissions, approximately 73 per cent  comes from our supply chain (categories 1, 2 and 4).  We are working with suppliers to identify, prioritise and  execute emissions reduction opportunities to achieve  this target. This includes providing training and support  to suppliers on how to reduce their emissions footprint,  including our climate commitments in commercial  agreements and considering emissions reduction  opportunities in the delivery of their goods and services  to us. Our scope 3 emissions have already decreased  by 28 per cent since FY19. Through decarbonising our supply chain, we have seen  a domino effect where businesses and customers who  operate downstream are now more likely to look for low  carbon alternatives. Suppliers who operate upstream  in our supply chain are more likely to supply low carbon  goods and services to businesses and customers  beyond our supply chain. This helps to drive broader,  sustained climate action across the industry. For more  information, read our article on Telstra Exchange. In 2022, we noted that we were assessing the impact of  retail energy growth in relation to our scope 3 emissions  reduction target. The scaling of our retail energy  products has since been paused. If we make a decision  to scale our energy retail products we will communicate  any material impacts to our scope 3 target.   Working together to  reduce scope 3 emissions Scope 3 emissions, particularly in the Information  Communication and Technology sector where there are  complex supply chains, is an area that requires cross  sector collaboration. We are working with key suppliers  and industry partners to reduce our scope 3 emissions  and drive improvements in environmental practices  throughout the global supply chain. We are co-leading a working group jointly developed  by the GSM Association (GSMA), Global Enabling  Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) and the Technical  Standardization Bureau of the International  Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) to draft industry  specific scope 3 guidance for telecommunication  operators. This guidance is intended to harmonise  methods for telecommunication operators to assess  and report their scope 3 emissions and to increase  its coverage and transparency. We also continue to  work with other telecommunications operators as  part of the Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC) to engage  common suppliers on their emissions reduction targets  and plans. This includes performing site audits by  independent third-party auditors.   Collaborating with our  strategic partners to  reduce emissions We believe that when we pair expertise from across  technology streams with connectivity knowledge,  and with industry and scientific know how, we  can find creative, innovative pathways to reduce  emissions across our network and wider business.  One of the ways we are doing this is through  our relationship with Ericsson, which provides  equipment and technologies that help our  telecommunications networks run. Together with  Ericsson, we are profiling our energy consumption  to better understand our energy baseline. This  has enabled us to understand where the largest  consumption occurs in the network and how we  can optimise efficiency by deploying the latest  hardware and energy saving software features.  With Ericsson, we are working to set commercial  commitments on the delivery of sustainable  hardware and software features across our radio  access network, transport and cloud technologies.  ===== PAGE 67 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 67 Sustaining our planet Supplier emissions  disclosures This year we extended our partnership with the  CDP for a further three years to continue engaging  our suppliers to account for and address their climate  change impacts more effectively. This partnership  enables us to deliver training, tools and support on  environmental disclosures to over 400 suppliers, an  increase from approximately 200 suppliers in 2022.  This covers approximately 80 per cent of our spend. Having a standardised process for disclosure and  a community of supply chain disclosers allows our  climate action to be even more impactful. This year  we joined CO2 AI and CDP to support the development  of the CO2 AI Product Ecosystem. This platform will  enable companies to collaborate and share product  level emissions data. We piloted this platform with  two of our suppliers, Vantiva and Accenture, who are  going further to define, measure and communicate  the carbon footprint associated with the products  they provide Telstra. These insights have enabled  us to improve the sustainability of products, such as  the Telstra Smart Modem 3. We hosted a webinar for  the industry to showcase how this technology can  help manage supply chain data in a smart way and  participated in the COP27 Finance Day to discuss  ways to better track, measure and reduce supply  chain emissions using technology.  In March 2023, we were recognised on the 2022 CDP  Supplier Engagement Leaderboard. We are among the  top eight per cent assessed for supplier engagement  on climate change, based on our 2022 CDP disclosure.  We were also shortlisted for The World Procurement  Awards in Environmental and Social Impact for working  together with suppliers towards a low carbon economy.  This award recognises the procurement function that  is significantly reducing the environmental impact of  their business through innovative and collaborative  approaches across the business and supply base. Most of our emissions are concentrated across a  relatively small number of suppliers. Meaningful  decarbonisation targets and plans from these  suppliers will contribute greatly towards achieving  our scope 3 target. In October 2022, we launched Telstra’s new  standard emissions reduction clause and guidance  for purchases. This new clause requires suppliers  to understand, report, verify, reduce and track their  climate change impacts in support of our 2030 target.  By the end of FY23, 41 suppliers had signed up to these  new clauses which contractually committed them to  disclosing and reducing their absolute emissions.  Decarbonise the grid Telstra is focused on decarbonising the grid through  greater investment in renewable energy, thereby  reducing reliance on non-renewable energy from  fossil fuels.  Our target is to enable renewable energy generation  equivalent to 100 per cent of our consumption by 2025.  To date, we have supported investment in  approximately $1.1 billion worth of renewable  energy under long term Power Purchase Agreements.  These commitments have enabled the construction  of renewable energy projects across Queensland,  Victoria and New South Wales. When these projects  are fully operational, our share of their renewable  energy output will be equivalent to more than  80 per cent of our consumption. In FY23, our renewable energy projects generated  the equivalent of 30 per cent of our consumption,  via output from Emerald Solar Park (70MW capacity  located in Queensland) and Murra Warra Wind Farm  (226MW capacity in Victoria, across all partners).  Construction on the Crookwell III Wind Farm (58MW  capacity in NSW) began in September 2022. In October 2022, we announced our fourth Power  Purchase Agreement for MacIntyre Wind Farm in  southeast Queensland, the largest wind farm in the  southern hemisphere. The agreement secured Telstra  a portion of the MacIntyre Wind Farm’s output with  construction well underway and first energy to the  grid expected in early 2024. The wind farm will use  162 turbines to produce a total of 923MW of renewable  electricity, enough to power the equivalent of  700,000 homes. Telstra will utilise 111MW of the  available 923MW. In June 2023, we contracted our fifth Power Purchase  Agreement for the Munna Creek Solar Farm near  Gympie in Queensland. This agreement secured Telstra  half of the output from the 120MW Munna Creek Solar  Farm. Construction is to commence later this year.  When constructed, the solar farm will produce enough  to power the equivalent of 50,000 homes.  ===== PAGE 68 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 68 Sustaining our planet With a power bill equivalent to 300,000 households,  Telstra’s Power Purchase Agreements also provide  protection against volatile wholesale electricity prices  and help us to manage our costs. We are working to finalise contracts supporting  new renewable energy projects that will be capable  of generating renewable energy equivalent to 100 per  cent of our consumption by 2025. However, utility- scale renewable projects have long lead times to  become operational, with complexity in planning,  construction, and grid connection. More recently, these  factors (especially supply chain issues) have been  exacerbated by COVID-19 and the Ukrainian conflict.  As a result there is a risk that full operational output  from our renewable energy projects may not reach the  equivalent of 100 per cent of our energy consumption  by the end of 2025. At this stage we believe it is more  likely than not that this target will be achieved by that  date and to help mitigate the risk to this target we  will continue to implement projects which reduce  our energy consumption.  For more information see the Understanding our  climate risk section of our 2023 Annual Report  available on our reports page.  Using technology to support  the National Electricity Grid We are continuing to explore innovative and  technology-driven pathways to secure access to  reliable, resilient forms of energy to power our network,  and support the energy grids in which we operate.  We partnered with the South Australian Government  in a Demand Management Pilot project to identify  new ways to utilise existing and new batteries to  support the grid at times of peak demand or instability,  while enhancing the reliability of our own network.  In Western Australia, we have continued our work  with Western Power and Horizon Power to allow the  installation of standalone power systems (largely  operated from renewable energy infrastructure).  This improves our power resilience at sites which  were at high risk of power outages caused by impacts  on the power distribution network, especially during  extreme weather events.    Decarbonise the economy The energy used by Telstra devices, including modems,  comprises approximately eight per cent of our scope  3 emissions. Part of our role in decarbonising the  economy is therefore to ensure we actively identify  opportunities to reduce the energy consumption of our  devices. Since FY19 we have reduced our scope  3 emissions by 28 per cent. The largest contributors  have been reductions in emissions reported by our  suppliers and from customer use of our modems. In FY22, we commissioned Deloitte to prepare an  Enabling Positive Climate Action Report, showcasing  how we can help our customers reduce their emissions.   The Enabling Positive Climate Action Report is  available on our reports page.  For more information, please see the Enabling the  transition for our customers section of this report.  Case Study Helping customers manage  their energy footprint Telstra’s Shapeshifting Hub was launched in 2022  helping 300 customers shift their energy consumption  from periods when renewable energy generation is  low and/or demand is high, to periods when renewable  energy generation is plentiful. In June 2022, we launched the Clean Energy Tracker  to show current and predicted renewable energy levels  in the grid. For more information on the Clean Energy Tracker,  please visit Telstra Energy.  ===== PAGE 69 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 69 Sustaining our planet Adapt to climate impacts Adaptation planning is a process of understanding  and adjusting to the impacts of climate change. This  includes taking action to reduce the negative impacts  of climate change and taking advantage of emerging  opportunities.  We use scenario analysis to understand how our  exposure to climate hazards might change in the  medium to long term. Qualitative and quantitative  scenario analysis has provided us with useful insights  into the nature, scale and impact of our climate related  risks. It has also given us valuable information about  the current and future dynamic change in these risks,  including an understanding of key signposts which  might indicate a change in short-term risk.  The scenario analysis process helps our operations  team understand and plan for the networks changing  exposure to physical climate-related risks.  Actions include:  •	 assessing the risk exposure of network sites  to fire, flood and cyclones •	 	testing infrastructure design standards to  improve resilience •	 	revising the standards of backup power systems  with the aim of providing longer duration power  reserves to sites deemed at risk •	 	prioritising lifecycle funding to those sites  assessed at risk. Our exposure to climate-related transition risks is at  its highest in the short to medium term as the global  community accelerates action towards a decarbonised  economy. However, we view these challenges as  opportunities. Our transition to an Agile organisation  has optimised our ability to respond to changing  consumer preferences, embrace new technologies,  and pivot service offerings to better meet the needs  and values of our customers.  For more information on our scenario analysis  and climate risks and opportunities, please see the  Understanding our climate risk (our TCFD disclosure)  section of our 2023 Annual Report available on our  reports page.  Preparing for  natural disasters  Climate change is predicted to cause increasingly  more frequent and severe weather events. It will  impact power distribution networks and intensify  our reliance on portable generators. The increase in bushfire and flood frequency and  severity makes the health, safety and wellbeing of our  staff, contractors and community members the biggest  short-term consideration when assessing our climate  physical risks. We found over 30 per cent of our above ground assets  are currently exposed to at least one climate hazard.  During a severe weather event or disaster, when  connectivity is at its most vital, our infrastructure  can become affected by power outages. Our attempts to distribute backup generators may  be disrupted by the impacts of the natural disaster,  including not being able to get people with specific  skillsets onsite. The Automatic Transfer Unit (ATU) was developed  to improve the flexibility of how we use portable  generators at our sites during AC mains power outages  with the aim of reducing costs and improving power  resilience. The ATUs reduce fuel consumption, simplify  generator deployment process, enable more effective  pre-deployment before known events and improve  visibility of asset performance during events.  Four million dollars in funding has been allocated to  deliver 250 ATUs to sites at risk of natural disasters  over FY23 and FY24. As part of this target 102 ATUs  have been installed in FY23.  For more information on our scenario analysis and  climate risks and opportunities, please see the  Understanding our climate risk (our TCFD disclosure)  section of our 2023 Annual Report available on our  reports page.  ===== PAGE 70 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 70 Sustaining our planet Protecting nature and biodiversity 21	  For more information, see the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures, Why nature-related risk and opportunity management matters » TNFD Nature underpins our global economy,  with more than half of the world’s economic  output dependent on it21.  We interact with nature daily, when we construct  or maintain our telecommunications network, or  when we provide technology solutions to customers.  We also depend on resources from nature, such as  the metals and minerals used to manufacture  technology and the wood used to make cardboard  for our product packaging.  As a company with infrastructure spanning across  Australia and overseas, from the most ecologically  rich environments to urban centres, Telstra can play a  unique role in protecting and restoring biodiversity. We  believe that smart data, connectivity and technology  solutions have the potential to help us all better  manage biodiversity loss. We are committed to  exploring ways we can best contribute to restoring and  renewing our natural environment. We continue to investigate our interactions with  nature, and the risks and opportunities they present  so we can better protect it. In FY24, we will assess  the nature-related risks and opportunities across  our business operations, value chain and assets,  with a view to including our most material risks and  opportunities in our FY24 disclosures.   Our ambition is to protect biodiversity in the  environments in which we operate and to harness  technology to regenerate nature. Our investment in  a carbon farm is one way we are trialling technology- based solutions to restore ecosystems and improve  biodiversity outcomes. More information about our carbon farm can be  found in the carbon farm case study on page 62  and in this video.  Project inception Construct Planning Design End-of-life Operate & maintain Opportunity: Connectivity enables enhanced  nature and biodiversity management Risk: Damage to land, habitat, ﬂora,  fauna or matters of cultural heritage Risk: Approvals and  reputational impacts from  works in environmentally or  culturally sensitive areas Opportunity: Design and  route management to avoid  damage to environmentally  or culturally sensitive areas Risk: Mismanagement  of waste during  decommissioning works Risk: Infrastructure failure  causing environmental harm  (diesel, hydraulic oil) Key nature and biodiversity risks and opportunities across the infrastructure lifecycle  ===== PAGE 71 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 71 Sustaining our planet Case Study Interacting with nature and biodiversity across our  infrastructure lifecycle From emus taking shelter in the shade of our buildings and vehicles, to bees making hives in our network  huts and snakes enjoying the warmth of our pits, our field techs encounter and interact with animals every  day while working to keep Australia connected.  We work in every environment you can imagine in Australia: the desert, the Daintree, remote National Parks,  the islands of the Torres Strait and under the sea on our subsea cable network. Connectivity solutions are  a powerful enabler of nature-positive outcomes, but they also take a lot of infrastructure and network  equipment to operate and that can present risks to nature and biodiversity.  The way we consider, plan for and work with nature looks different at each stage of our infrastructure lifecycle.  When we plan for new or major upgrades to existing infrastructure, we consider the need to work in  environmentally sensitive locations. This means employing the best methods for design and construction  to reduce the risk of harm to habitats, flora and fauna as well as areas of cultural significance. We also  consider how we can help regenerate nature by managing soil and erosion risk, and remediating and  revegetating land as we go.  We also interact with flora and fauna on a daily basis – our infrastructure can make a warm, safe home  for many animals. We help our people understand what to do when interacting with animals, to keep them  and the animals safe (and our infrastructure protected from damage, where we can).  As the climate changes, we are seeing increasingly frequent severe weather events. Connectivity and  technology solutions are key to monitoring weather, and to planning and effectively responding to natural  disasters. Our infrastructure can also offer access pathways to remote parts of the country to help respond  to bushfires and other events.  Modern biodiversity management and restoration relies on data, increasingly collected by sensors  and robots and processed by computers. By connecting Australia, we are also enabling researchers, park rangers, conservation organisations and citizen scientists to carry out their important work.  ===== PAGE 72 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 72 Sustaining our planet Progressing a circular economy 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	    22    See About e-waste | Environment Protection Authority Victoria  (epa.vic.gov.au) 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	    23    Find out more about what devices can be recycled in stores here  Recycling (telstra.com.au) 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	    24    Estimated number of electronic products stored in Australian homes  sourced from MobileMuster. Telstra is committed to embedding circular  economy principles in how we design,  develop, manage and operate our networks -  as well as the products we put out to market.   This year, we stepped up our environmental ambition  to improve our use of resources, reduce waste going  to landfill and create innovative solutions to reduce  our environmental impact across the lifecycle of our  networks and products. E-waste is growing three times  faster than general waste streams.22 As a leader in the  telecommunications and technology sector, we are  committed to doing our part.   Our strategy has been designed to focus on both  the resources we use and the waste generated by our  operations, as well as the waste we generate from the  manufacturing, distribution and use of our products.  We are proud of our ambitious approach to improving  our use of natural resources, because we know that  by leading change across our organisation, we can  also help our customers, suppliers, contractors and  partners do the same.23 Devices and packaging  Australians are storing an estimated 38 million24  electronic devices in their homes. We are helping  our customers reduce the number of unwanted  devices in their homes and businesses by making it  easier for this technology to be reused or recycled.  Enabling valuable precious metals and materials in  old technology to re-enter the economy reduces  reliance on extracting raw materials, resulting in a  positive and wide-reaching environmental impact.  From FY24 we have increased our device target, to  reuse or recycle 650,000 mobile phones, modems  and other devices each year to 2025. Our FY23 target  was 500,000, which we exceeded, reusing or recycling  632,919 mobile phones, modems and other devices.  We are designing solutions based on circular economy  principles for our products so we can keep materials in  circulation for as long as possible. We are working to  increase the lifespan of mobile devices and modems  through our repair, refurbish, reuse and trade-in  programs and responsibly recycling devices that have  reached the end of their useful life. We do this via the  Telstra eCycle program, which offers solutions for  electronic devices - recovering materials for recycling,  all while ensuring any data is securely wiped.  We have made it easier for our customers to  recycle their old devices by accepting more types  of devices.  They can do this at any Telstra store or  via our free eParcel option if they can’t make it into  one of our stores.  This year the Telstra eCycle program collected 632,919  devices from customers to be reused or responsibly  recycled. We repurposed 254,133 customer devices  that were used and/or obsolete. We also recycled  378,786 devices through the Telstra eCycle program  via MobileMuster and other partners.   Devices that can be recycled23  •	 mobiles •	 tablets •	 mobile batteries and chargers •	 mobile wireless internet devices •	 mobile accessories, such as headsets •	 modems and routers •	 home phones •	 smart watches and fitness trackers •	 VR headsets and accessories.	  ===== PAGE 73 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 73 Sustaining our planet For example, in FY23 we: •	 recycled 134,002 mobile phones, 18,619 modems  and 139,460 other devices (mobile accessories,  tablets, smart home devices, home phones and  Internet of Things devices) through MobileMuster •	 	collected 2,666 mobile phones, 20,671 modems  and 8,629 other devices through the Telstra’s  CT Muster program •	 	partnered with Kingfisher Mobile Australia via  trade-in and upgrade programs, empowering  customers to return 83,225 old or out of  contract devices  •	 	collected 67,917 mobile phones through  our Repurpose & Replace program for  refurbishment and reuse. We can utilise  this stock as customer replacement devices  in instances of warranty returns •	 	recycled 51,089 modems through our warehouse  inventory management program •	 	recovered 31,481 modems via our modem returns  and refurbishment program (launched in FY23)  aimed at extending the lifespan of our modems  •	 	collected 71,510 smartphones, tablets and other  information and communications technology (ICT)  through Moorup with 79 per cent reused and  21 per cent recycled •	 	recovered 3,291 enterprise customer managed  services equipment for reuse and recycling •	 	donated 359 repurposed phones to people in need.   This work is all part of supporting a more circular  economy for the resources we consume – from the  phones, tablets and other electronic devices we put  out to market to the equipment we operate that our  customers rely on to access our network. Case Study A smarter design for our  Smart Modem 3 As we find innovative ways to make tech more  sustainable and build on our environmental  commitments, we are excited to now be using  recycled plastics in our Smart Modem 3.  To minimise the environmental impact of the new  generation Telstra Smart Modem 3, we: •	 reduced the number of ancillary items included  with the modem, including all the extra cables  that always end up in a junk drawer. The  cumulative length of these cables is equivalent  to the distance between Sydney and Byron Bay!25 •	 removed all unnecessary plastics in our modems, right down to the clingfilm on the logo •	 changed the enclosure from white to black, which allowed us to use more than 80 per cent recycled plastics  (being increased to 95 per cent) •	 undertook a proof of concept where we used plastics from end-of-life modems, recovered by the  Telstra eCycle takeback program, to build new modems. To our knowledge, this proof of concept is an  industry/global first.  In 2023, we won an Australian Financial Review Sustainability Leaders Innovation Award, in the category of  Telecommunications, Media and Technology for the Telstra Smart Modem 3. This is the second year we have  won this category.   For more information, read our article on Telstra Exchange. 25	  Calculations are based on the length of the ethernet cable which is 1.5m and the estimated number of smart modems shipped in FY22.   ===== PAGE 74 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 74 Sustaining our planet Modem refurbishment  program Customers can now return their old modems, at  no cost to them, using our newly launched modem  eParcel returns. All Telstra Smart Modem 2 and 3  units will now be assessed for refurbishment and  when they have reached the end of their useful life,  they’ll be recycled responsibly.  Customers who contact our Telstra team about a  modem fault and require a replacement will now  automatically receive an eParcel SMS and/or email  to return their faulty modem. In FY23, we refurbished, repackaged and redistributed  15,008 modems. To meet our strict privacy standards, customer data  is removed from the recovered modems. They are then  tested, cleaned, re-kitted and redeployed. This means  when customers have warranty issues, we can send  them a refurbished modem that is like new. Where a modem is unable to be refurbished for reuse,  customer data is removed, and it’s responsibly  recycled or disposed. These capabilities provide benefits to our customers,  our Telstra teams and the environment. For more information read our article on Telstra  Exchange.  Recovering equipment from  our enterprise customers  We partner with social enterprise, PonyUp for Good,  to recover Telstra and Telstra client technology and  uniforms for reuse or recycling. PonyUp then donates  50 per cent of profits to SecondBite, Australia’s largest  fresh food charity.  In FY23, we teamed up with PonyUp to recover over  9,252kg of obsolete Telstra equipment and we diverted  1,367kg of uniforms from landfill.  We recycled 6,364kg of company monitors. Ninety  two per cent of this equipment was reused, the  remainder recycled, enabling 95 per cent of material  to be recovered. Through this program alone, 12,954  meals were donated through SecondBite to help  those in need. We also donated 7,964 universal power cords weighing  2,705kg and 183kg of equipment from warehouses to  PonyUp ensuring they found a suitable reuse channel,  enabling 4,072 meals to be delivered via SecondBite  to people across Australia doing it tough.  Through our uniform recycling program we diverted  1,367kg of old Telstra uniform items from landfill.  Anything suitable for reuse has been debadged,  removing Telstra's logo and tags and a suitable next  use path found or donated to Vinnies to find another  home. Items not suitable for reuse will be shredded  and used as stuffing in couches and other furniture.  This program has donated 3,375 fresh meals to  SecondBite, which is five meals for every kilogram of  uniform items collected by our Field Services Team.  Telstra's on-going partnership with PonyUp has now  delivered more than 124,747 meals via SecondBite.

We want to help our customers  responsibly reuse or recycle our packaging rather than it ending up in landfill. Packing our Telstra-branded  products We are committed to optimising the resources we  use, reducing consumption and waste across our  business, and investing in circular solutions that are  designed to be sustainable across their lifecycle. In October 2022, we met our commitment  for 100 per cent of Telstra branded packaging  to be made of renewable or recycled  material and be fully recyclable, two months  ahead of the December 2022 target.  Together with our design creative partners and  sustainability experts Birdstone, we transformed  packaging and branding of nearly 100 products to  ensure they are fully recyclable. We have integrated  sustainability metrics, including conducting material  assessments and collecting compliance information  from suppliers. We assess all packaging components  as part of this process and use this to build packaging  and design optimisation once we complete our concept  work. We also use the Australian Packaging Covenant  Organisation’s (APCO) Packaging Recyclability  Evaluation Portal (PREP) Analysis Tool for all new  and upcoming device packaging. All packs contain  APCO’s Australasian Recycling Label to make correct  disposal easy for our customers. We have introduced  sustainable packaging principles for our Telstra- branded products and released a new and improved  Telstra-branded packaging design to help customers  know what can be recycled and how. During the process we overhauled entire product  categories to redesign and simplify the unboxing  experience. An example of this is accessories  packaging where each pack was originally made of  11 separate components, weighed approximately  50g and was not kerbside recyclable. Our new  accessory packs are made up of an average of  2 components, weigh approximately 11g and are  100 per cent kerbside recyclable. Vantage and Frontline: Recycling and  marketing We want our customers’ experiences to reflect  our commitment to the environment. In August  2022, we hosted the Frontline conference  for our customer facing teams. We invited  attendees to bring in their old tech for recycling  and we collected 2,179 devices, including  handsets, accessories and modems. As we  achieved the target of 2,000 devices we set  ourselves, we donated $4,000 to EarthWatch  via the Telstra Foundation.  At Vantage, our conference for Enterprise  customers, we went fully digital with no paper  flyers, used edible coffee cups throughout  the event (avoiding 12,000 coffee cups from  landfill), designed our stands from paper  or cardboard and reused merchandise and  banners. Where banners couldn’t be reused  or recycled, we shredded them for reuse as  mattress filler. We also used washable utensils  and donated all excess food waste to the  Mathew Talbot Hostel. Sustainability Walls In FY23 we trialled eWaste Sustainability Walls  at four stores across the country: North Sydney  (NSW), Warriewood (NSW), Camberwell (VIC)  and Queen St Mall (VIC). These walls included  a collection box for people to recycle devices,  such as mobile phones, smartwatches and  more. We plan to extend this trial in FY24. Bring back bonus As part of our 2022 Christmas campaign,  customers were awarded an extra 5,000 Telstra  Plus points when they traded in or recycled an  eligible device. Customers could drop in store  or send end-of-life devices via eParcel. Across  November and December 2022, customers  recycled 35,000 devices.  ===== PAGE 76 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 76 Sustaining our planet  To improve the recyclability of our packaging,  we have included:  •	 	Kraft Board exteriors that are instantly  recognisable as recyclable and encourage  consumers to focus on kerbside recycling •	 	zero plastics. Hard plastics have been replaced  with fibreboard, plastic bags with tissue paper,  cable ties with fixed Velcro ties, and plastic  stickers with paper •	 	water-based inks and aqueous varnishes.  This means there won’t be any chemicals  restricting the recyclability of the cardboard •	 an Australasian Recycling Label which helps  customers know how to do their part by  recycling safely. We have worked alongside many of our suppliers to  guide them towards more sustainable packaging. As a  result of our progress, we were asked by the APCO to  co-host a session for over 200 APCO members on our  success in achieving packaging optimisation through  sustainable design.  In FY23, we won the Telecommunications Industry  Sector Award for this year's APCO Annual Awards. We  have also been recognised by several packaging design  organisations around the world and won 11 awards for  our sustainability and design achievements. Telstra’s sustainable packaging has received awards  from: Australian Graphic Design Association Awards  (two), Australasian Packaging Innovation & Design  (PIDA) Awards (four), Australian Packaging Covenant  Organisation Industry Awards, Good Design Australia  Awards, Penta Awards, Transform Magazine Awards,  and WorldStar Global Packaging Awards. For more information read our article on Telstra  Exchange.  Improving waste  and recycling This year we increased our network waste recycling  rate target to 90 per cent by June 2025 (our previous  target was 85 per cent by June 2025).  In FY23, our network waste recycling rate was  79 per cent.  To meet this target, we are working with industry  partners and customers to recover technology and  other e-waste for reuse and recycling.  Our focus remains on areas where we can affect the  greatest change for our people and stakeholders,  including reviewing our waste infrastructure and  building awareness and education of our teams and  external delivery partners and customers who use  our sites. In FY23, we worked with partner Veolia to  improve our signage on bins to help identify correct  distribution practices, including recycling and landfill.  We are also recovering e-waste as we upgrade our  network, identifying reuse opportunities for legacy  technology, working with suppliers to extend the life  of network technology and exploring opportunities  to recycle industry-specific equipment. We have  conducted network equipment recycling trials at  seven network facility sites, recovering and recycling  55,723kg of metals and e-waste.

We are committed  to identifying and recovering valuable resources for  reuse or recycling and, where we can, recovering these  materials back into our operations for reuse. 3G recovery In FY22, we undertook work to recover 3G spares,  including radio access network (RAN) radios and  remote integrated multiplexer printed circuit boards  (RIM PCBs) to fulfill ongoing demand. These programs  continued through FY23.  In FY23, we have recovered more than 4,800 RAN  (3G) spares to fix network faults. This resulted in  over 31 tonnes of network waste being diverted from  landfill. Since 2021, more than 5,400 spares have been  recovered through this program resulting in almost  35,000kg of e-waste avoiding landfill. This program will deliver $2.2 million in savings, by  increasing our spares pool and avoiding operational  costs. In addition to this we are avoiding valuable  resources going into landfill, keeping materials in  circulation and creating commercial value by selling  surplus spares onto the grey market. Valuable materials are extracted from redundant 3G  equipment, assessed for damage, cleaned, labelled and  then stored at our warehouses for use as spare parts to  repair network faults. Through this process, more than  3,500 3G radios and other components were recovered,  and 1,800 components were supplied to fix network  faults and reused for network maintenance activities.  We also distributed almost 500 components nationally  with a focus on regional and remote areas to improve  network fault restoration times. We have also avoided  25 tonnes of equipment going to landfill recovering an  estimated value of $1.1 million of 3G equipment. Roadside cabinets A Remote Integrated Multiplexer (RIM) is a roadside  cabinet technology that provides PSTN services to  Telstra customers in non-nbn areas. The nbn rollout has  meant there is a decreasing need for this technology.  At the same time, Telstra still needs to maintain and  support more than 3,000 of these cabinets nationally,  predominantly in regional and rural areas. To maintain  reliability, Telstra has been undertaking a program to  recover spare components from unused RIMs for reuse.  In the past 12 months, we have recovered more than  4,600 spares to fix network faults. This resulted in 7.5  tonnes of network waste being diverted from landfill.  Since 2021, Telstra has fully supported 100 per cent of  RIM fault maintenance work without having to procure  or repair any spare parts. More than 6,600 spares have  been recovered through this program resulting in more  than 10,000kg of e-waste avoiding landfill. In total over 12,000 parts totalling over 45 tonnes have  been diverted from landfill through these initiatives. Copper recovery For most of our 140-year history we have used  copper to deliver our landlines and connect people  across our telecommunications network. We are  looking at ways to recycle copper that is no longer  required from our network. Our copper cable recovery program is underway and  resulted in 13,930 tonnes of metal recycled in FY23.  The various metals extracted (such as aluminium,  copper and lead) avoided emissions and waste from  mining new metals. Exchange e-waste recovery In April 2023, we ran a Clean Up Exchange Day  at all our Australian Exchanges. More than  250 people were involved across 65 different  sites. We partnered with PonyUp to engage,  clean and organise our exchanges, including  recycling branded Telstra uniforms and Small  Pair Gains Systems (SPGS). We recycled 375kg  of uniforms through PonyUp for Good.    ===== PAGE 78 ===== Bigger Picture 2023 Sustainability Report 78 Sustaining our planet Enabling the transition  for our customers 26	 For more information see the Enabling Positive Climate Action Report available at our report website.  27 	 See the full report for further detail on key assumptions and qualifications across reported figures. To reduce our carbon footprint, we have been  changing the way we do business – from  piloting experimental tech at our carbon farm,  to leveraging smart solutions across our  operations, we believe digital technologies  have a crucial role to play in helping  businesses reduce their emissions. As Australia’s largest telecommunications and  technology provider, we see a significant opportunity  to help our customers and society transition to a  lower carbon future by accelerating the adoption of  innovative emissions-avoiding technologies. The Enabling Positive Climate Action Report by  Deloitte Access Economics analyses the impact of  Telstra’s products and services by looking at our  enablement potential. This quantifies the emissions  avoided by our customers using our products and  services when compared to our own emissions.  The calculations reveal the overall contribution  Telstra can make towards a lower carbon future. The results Deloitte determined that in 2021, we enabled our  customers to avoid 2.7 million tonnes of carbon  dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions, comparable  to taking 820,000 cars off Australian roads each  year. Deloitte’s findings estimate that by 2030 our  enablement factor will be 6.9. That means for every  tonne of CO2e we emit, we would help our customers  avoid 6.9 tonnes of CO2e emissions through the use  of our products and services26 – the equivalent of  reducing the number of cars on Australian roads by  1.3 million each year27. By 2030, it is estimated we  can cumulatively help customers avoid an incredible  41 million tonnes of CO2e. To put this into context, our potential contribution  to avoiding emissions is nationally significant – it’s  the equivalent of about one per cent of the average  annual reduction in emissions required to meet  Australia’s reduction target of 43 per cent below  2005 levels by 2030.

Compliance Protecting the environment remains a key priority  and we have set minimum performance standards  for managing current and emerging environmental  issues. Our Health, Safety, Wellbeing and Environment  (HSWE) management system is certified to the  International Standard ISO14001:2015 and applies  to Telstra’s global operations.  We continue to review and improve our environmental  management system in response to current and  emerging environmental requirements, changing  legislation and increasing shareholder, customer  and community expectations. In FY23, we continued  to undertake work to uplift our environmental  compliance program. As a minimum standard, Telstra seeks to comply  with all operationally relevant and applicable  environmental laws. We have not been prosecuted  for, or convicted of, any significant breaches of  environmental regulation in FY23.  ===== PAGE 80 ===== Telstra Sustainability "
