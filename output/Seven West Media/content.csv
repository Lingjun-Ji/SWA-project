Seven West Media recognises its responsibility to all  our stakeholders to deliver sustainable environmental,  social, and governance (ESG) outcomes. Through our  partnerships with community organisations and charitable  groups, and our own initiatives, we are using the power of  our platforms to inspire a better us. ABOUT THIS REPORT Seven West Media’s Sustainability Report, initiated in  2022, offers a comprehensive review of our sustainability  efforts for FY24. Our report is structured around the four  key pillars of our sustainability strategy: •	 Providing opportunities for future generations •	 Uniting people and communities  •	 Representing Australia •	 Bringing awareness to environmental issues These pillars guide us in delivering the most meaningful  positive outcomes for our people, communities, and the  environment. Alongside this, we provide further detail on key areas of  activity – such as our emissions reduction efforts, our key  partnerships, and the important causes we support with  the power of our platform by providing Community Service  Announcement (CSA) airtime. We developed our sustainability strategy through an in- depth process of consultation with internal and external  stakeholders, and by assessing Seven West Media’s long- term existing sustainability initiatives. As part of this process, Seven West Media adopted the  United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  as a framework to provide us with a clear path forward  on our sustainability journey. Seven West Media supports  the SDGs, which are recognised as a key benchmark for  progress on sustainability matters. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF COUNTRY  Seven West Media respectfully acknowledges the lands,  waterways and sky country – the traditional homelands of  our First Peoples. From the Gadigal of Sydney, the Turrbal  and Jagera of Brisbane, the Kulin nations of Melbourne,  the Noongar of Perth, the Kaurna Peoples of Adelaide and  everywhere in between.  We pay our heartfelt respects to the Traditional  Custodians of the land throughout Australia,  community Elders and the teachers who are sharing the  intergenerational knowledge and education as we work  side-by-side in a new era of interconnectedness.

In June, I had the privilege of appearing before the Joint  Select Committee on Social Media and Australian Society.  As a father of two teenagers, I shared my personal concerns  about the pervasive influence of unregulated misinformation  and the emotional toll of online scams, exclusion and  bullying. These issues are not just abstract concerns;  they are real, affecting families and communities across  Australia. It is in this context that Seven West Media’s role  becomes crucial. Seven West Media invests over $250 million a year in  generating news content. We employ more than 1,500  journalists, producers, editors, camera operators, and  support staff dedicated to creating and distributing news  content across the nation. Our reach is extensive, covering  55 towns and cities nationwide. In Western Australia  alone, we connect with 84% of the population through our  metropolitan, regional and community media platforms. Our commitment to delivering balanced, accurate and  regulated news content sets us apart. Unlike unregulated  social media platforms, our content is subject to rigorous  compliance and editorial codes.  In February 2024, we launched The Nightly, a new national  digital news platform covering politics, policy, business,  and culture. Featuring content from esteemed sources  including The New York Times, The Economist, CNBC  and others, The Nightly furthers our goal of delivering  trusted news by providing premium quality journalism to  Australians, free of charge. Beyond our media responsibilities, Seven West Media  is deeply committed to supporting our communities.  In 2023, the Perth Telethon raised a record $78 million to  support sick children, thanks to the incredible generosity  of West Australians. This funding is being channelled into  136 children’s charities, beneficiaries and community  organisations, advancing medical research and providing  essential services, equipment, and programs for sick and  vulnerable children and their families across Western  Australia. Since its inception in 1968, Telethon has raised  over $600 million. Similarly, the 2024 Good Friday Appeal, broadcast on  Channel 7 Melbourne and nationally on 7plus, raised a  record $23.4 million for The Royal Children’s Hospital  in Melbourne. This funding will enable the hospital to  continue providing world-class care and conducting vital  research. The event, highlighted by performances from top  entertainers and appearances by popular Seven Network  personalities, brought the community together in support  of a common cause. Our commitment to equality and representation is evident  in our continued partnerships and initiatives. We have  once again been named an Employer of Choice for Gender  Equality by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency. We  also marked our fourth year as the official broadcast  partner with UN Women Australia for International Women’s  Day, reinforcing our joint commitment to gender equality  and celebrating the accomplishments of women. Environmental sustainability remains a core focus for Seven  West Media. We have continued our partnership with  Planet Ark to drive positive behavioural change around  critical environmental issues. As the Official Media Partner  of National Recycling Week and National Tree Day, we  are proud to support Planet Ark, one of Australia’s leading  environmental behaviour change organisations. We are pleased to see an 18 per cent reduction in our scope  1 and 2 emissions since FY22 resulting from a combination  of grid decarbonisation and our own initiatives, specifically  consolidation of premises in Sydney and ongoing energy  efficiency measures, including introducing LED lighting  across a number of our offices. Our FY24 Sustainability Report is not just a summary of our  achievements; it is a reflection of our enduring commitment  to the communities we serve, the environment we cherish  and the values we uphold. We are proud of the progress  we have made, and we remain steadfast in our mission to  create a positive and lasting impact. Yours sincerely, Jeff Howard Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Seven West Media I am pleased to present to you the FY24 Sustainability Report, a testament to our ongoing commitment to making  a positive impact in the communities where we operate.  3  ===== PAGE 4 ===== Our Sustainability Framework  As we progress our long-term sustainability goals, we understand the importance of tackling the issues that impact the people and groups  who support our business: our employees, advertisers, partners, shareholders, audiences, local communities and Australia more broadly.

The issues identified as most material help to direct our  sustainability strategy and pillars across environmental,  social, and governance factors. We consistently see social  issues as front-of-mind, and this is reflected strongly  in our pillars, including our role in uniting people and  communities across Australia, representing and reflecting  our nation’s diversity through our platforms, and providing  better opportunities for future generations to thrive. Environmental issues are also important to us, and our  approach to these reflects our ability to use our platforms  and reach to raise awareness for vital causes, like our  partnership with Planet Ark, as well as making meaningful  improvements in how we operate sustainably in our  business, like reducing our energy use. Governance is also a critical focus, with responsible  broadcasting and advertising and adherence to  data security and privacy policies clearly reflected  in our strategy.  Our most material sustainability issues are identified in  our materiality assessment. 4  ===== PAGE 5 ===== Our Sustainability Framework  “Us”is all of us Us as individuals     Us as communities Us as teams              Us as a nation Our sustainability efforts are directed by our sustainability framework and our sustainability purpose:  using the power of our platforms to inspire a better us.  UNITED NATIONS’ SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS  The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),  endorsed by the United Nations in 2015, provide a clear path for  achieving sustainable development globally. Seven West Media supports these goals wholeheartedly, and we  continue to reflect their importance in how we progress towards  our sustainability targets and performance.  Our support is focused on the following priority goals: Goal 3.  Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being  for all at all ages Goal 5. Achieve gender equality and empower all  women and girls  Goal 10. Reduce inequality within and among countries Goal 12.  Ensure sustainable consumption and  production patterns Goal 16. Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for  sustainable development, provide access to  justice for all and build effective, accountable,  and inclusive institutions at all levels 5  ===== PAGE 6 ===== Opportunities  for Future  Generations •	 The annual West Australian  Telethon raised a record $78 million  to support sick children •	 The Good Friday Appeal raised a  record $23.4 million for The Royal  Children’s Hospital in Melbourne •	 The Channel 7 Children’s Research  Foundation awarded $1.5 million in  research grants  •	 Named the third recipient of the David  Leckie Seven Scholarship Program •	 The annual Sydney Sick Kids Appeal  raised $14.6 million to support  treatment, research, and patient  experience Uniting  People and  Communities  •	 Provided more than $70 million in  Community Service Announcement  (CSA) support to more than 170  organisations •	 Supported Big Freeze 10, which  raised $20.1 million for the fight  against Motor Neurone disease  •	 Supported local community  awards to recognise everyday heroes  supporting others in their community  •	 Launched The Nightly, providing free  local, national and global news and  current affairs for all Australians Representing  Australia  •	 Named an Employer of Choice for  Gender Equality by the Workplace  Gender Equality Agency  •	 Fourth year as the official broadcast  partner with UN Women Australia  for International Women’s Day •	 Working with production partners to  continuously improve processes for  diverse casting of contestants  •	 Championed women’s sports  with free live coverage of Hockey  Australia’s Hockeyroos, the  Women’s Big Bash League,  AFLW and the FIFA Women’s  World Cup 2023™  •	 Completed the commitments in our  Reflect Reconciliation Action Plan  •	 Rolled out new training on  workplace behaviours and  inclusion •	 Introduced five days of paid fertility  leave for our employees Bringing  Awareness to  Environmental  Issues  •	 Official Media Partner for Planet  Ark’s National Recycling Week  and National Tree Day •	 Continued efforts to reduce  waste from printing and reduce  energy usage •	 Our production partner ITV is  prioritising sustainable production  methods – all ITV Studios Australia  productions, including The Voice,  My Kitchen Rules and The Chase  Australia, are certified by a third- party screen industry organisation for  environmental sustainability, albert •	 Preparing to publish detailed  climate-related financial  disclosures from FY26  •	 Achieved an 18 per cent decline  in scope 1 and 2 emissions between  FY22 and FY24 through a combination  of grid decarbonisation and  our own initiatives FY24 Highlights 6  ===== PAGE 7 ===== Community Service Announcements  Using the power of our platforms to inspire a better us is at the core of Seven West Media’s sustainability strategy. The ongoing support we provide to charitable causes and other organisations across  Australia via Community Service Announcement (CSA) airtime helps to draw attention to  critical issues, promote important community initiatives, and raise funds for these groups.  CSAs are broadcast and streamed free of charge and allow charitable and community  organisations to promote their causes to the public. We also provide advertising and  support through The West Australian and our other publications. In FY2024 Seven West Media provided more than $70 million in Community Service  Announcement (CSA) support to more than 170 organisations. Our platforms reach 19 million people across the nation every month and we know our  audiences care deeply about the issues in their communities.  Provided more than  $70 million  in CSA support to more than 170 organisations Our platforms reach   19 million  people across the nation every month GOOD360 AUSTRALIA CAMPAIGN - CASE STUDY  In FY24 Seven provided nearly $2 Million in Community Service Airtime to Good360. Good360 Australia works to reduce need and waste by connecting businesses  with brand-new unsold or surplus goods to people in need. Every year in  Australia, $2.5 billion of unsold household goods are wasted and one in eight  Australians are living below the poverty line. Good360 has been a vital lifeline amid  the cost-of-living crisis, distributing almost four million items, valued at more than  $70 million, supporting over 4,200 charities and disadvantaged schools across  Australia in FY2024.  Its efforts also addressed hygiene poverty by providing essential hygiene items to  over 207,000 individuals, significantly improving their quality of life. Hygiene poverty  affects over four million Australians, forcing them to choose between heating, eating, or  keeping clean.  Good360 Australia’s “EveryOne Day” campaign sought to raise funds to enable  the organisation to deliver $1 billion of brand-new goods to meet the growing needs  of communities across Australia, while also reducing waste in our environment.  Every $1 donated helps Good360 deliver $20 of unsold, new goods  to Australians in need. 7  ===== PAGE 8 ===== The past year has seen a welcome surge in the visibility and popularity of women’s sport, including Australian women  performing at the highest levels on the world stage.  As the broadcast partner for the Women’s Big Bash  League and the Hockeyroos in the Oceania Cup over the  past year, as well as AFLW, Seven West Media has been  incredibly proud to showcase some of Australia’s female  sports stars.  In July and August of 2023 the FIFA Women’s World  Cup 2023™ elevated women’s sport in Australia even  further, particularly the incredible semi-final against  England, which reached an extraordinary 11.15 million  Australians nationally. This made the Matildas’ semi-final  the most-watched TV program in Australia in more than  two decades, as well as the most streamed event ever in  Australia, with almost one million viewers on 7plus. Case study: Championing Women’s Sport Award winning coverage, L to R: Elise Kellona-Knight, Mel Mclaughlin,  Emma Freedman, Mackenzie Arnold Overall, Seven’s TV WEEK Logie Award-winning coverage  of the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023™ reached 18.6  million viewers, with nearly 15 million on broadcast and  3.82 million streaming on 7plus, reflecting the outstanding  pride across Australia for the Matilda’s achievements. We know how vital representation is for advancing  equality in our proud sporting traditions.  Seeing the way the Matildas, as well as our Hockeyroos,  women cricketers and AFLW players, have impacted a  new generation of fans and future stars already, has been  nothing short of inspiring. As a trusted Australian broadcaster, we’re thrilled to see  growing momentum behind women’s sport, and proud  to play a role in shining a light on the talents of these  wonderful athletes to the world. 8  ===== PAGE 9 ===== Opportunities for Future Generations Contributing to better opportunities for future generations is core to Seven West Media’s values and how we engage with the communities  in which we operate. Our partnerships with community groups and charities, in particular the focus on children’s health and medical  research, is a longstanding priority for Seven West Media and an area where we are committed to making a meaningful impact. In 2023, the annual West Australian Telethon raised a  record $78 million to support sick children. Thanks to the  generosity of West Australians, this funding will be used by  Telethon to financially support an incredible 136 children’s  charities, beneficiaries and community organisations to  advance medical research and provide essential services,  equipment and programs for sick and vulnerable children  and their families all over WA. Telethon has raised more  than $600 million since it was established in 1968.  The 2024 Good Friday Appeal, broadcast on Channel 7  Melbourne and nationally on 7plus, raised a record  $23.4 million for The Royal Children’s Hospital in  Melbourne, enabling world-class care and research.  The event featured performances by top entertainers and  appearances by popular Seven Network personalities. The Channel 7 Children’s Research Foundation (CRF)  in South Australia awarded annual research grants of more  than $1.5 million in 2023, as well as providing $300,000 to  a Fellowship Program to support research into children’s  health, education and welfare.  7NEWS Sydney again partnered with the Sydney  Children’s Hospital Foundation for the annual Sydney  Sick Kids Appeal, one of the major fundraising appeals  for the Sydney Children’s Hospitals Foundation (SCHF).  More than $14.6 million was raised to support treatment,  research, and patient experience.  Seven West Media continued its long-time support for  McHappy Day to support Ronald McDonald House  Charities Australia.  We delivered $14,466 of promotional airtime in the  four weeks leading up to McHappy Day, as well as  39 Seven staff and family members volunteering across  15 Queensland stores on the day.  We are committed to  developing the next  generation of media  talent, including  sponsoring two  scholarships for young  people with an interest  in media to attend TAFE  while working at Seven  as Broadcast Engineers. Seven West Media also  welcomed Alessandro Rosini as the third recipient of  the David Leckie Seven Scholarship Program, which  supports graduates passionate about sales, programming,  or news with a 12-month role at Seven West Media.  Seven West Media also hosts educational tours  for primary school groups across Sydney and  Melbourne – with Adelaide being added – so local  kids can learn about the media industry, how TV  is made, and meet a high-profile presenter. Alessandro Rosini 9  ===== PAGE 10 ===== Uniting People and Communities Seven West Media has a longstanding legacy of strong community engagement across the nation, and we are committed to having a  positive impact on the places where we operate across the nation.

SEVEN WEST MEDIA AND PLANET ARK Planet Ark is one of Australia’s leading environmental behaviour change organisations, focused on making a difference in how  people view and tackle important environmental issues. Since 2022, Seven West Media has been the Official Media Partner of  Planet Ark on flagship nationwide events, including National Recycling Week and National Tree Day. This year, National Recycling Week was a massive campaign, registering 433 schools and almost 65,000 students across the  country to take part. Using the power of our platforms, we helped secure two weeks of national coverage to promote  the event, with a promotional value worth over $4 million. National Tree Day is another event we were very proud to support as Official Media Partner. The initiative has  resulted in over 27 million trees, shrubs, and grasses being planted by more than five million volunteers since 1996.  Education is a vital component, with Schools Tree Day helping bring the impact of nature care activities  and environmental awareness into classrooms across the country. 13  ===== PAGE 14 ===== Sustainability Governance At Seven West Media, we know that robust corporate governance forms an essential  part of our role as an employer and an operator in this market. Our materiality assessment revealed a number of issues  of high importance to our stakeholders and high impact  for our business, these being, responsible advertising;  accuracy and independence of content; data security  and privacy; employee safety and security; harassment  and discrimination; and community engagement and  contribution. We have a number of policies, processes,  and procedures in place to oversee these areas, which  are important to our stakeholders. RESPONSIBLE ADVERTISING We recognise the impact of advertising on the community  and adhere to policies to ensure compliance with industry  best practice and legal requirements. Our broadcast  scheduling teams ensure a balanced approach between  advertising and audience-loved content, adhering to  time limits in the Commercial Television Industry  Code of Practice.  All advertisements are required to comply with the  Australian Association of National Advertisers (AANA)’s  Code of Ethics, Food and Beverages Advertising Code  and Children’s Advertising Code, as well as the ABAC  Responsible Alcohol Marketing Code.  ACCURACY AND INDEPENDENCE OF CONTENT Seven West Media is governed by a group editorial policy  which outlines the principles and processes that governs  the news content on all our platforms. West Australian Newspapers follows an editorial policy  and a code of conduct, assessed by the Independent  Media Council in the case of complaints, while Australia’s  free-to-air broadcasters are regulated under the  Commercial Television Code of Practice.  Furthermore, Seven West Media shares the community  concerns for mis-information and dis-information on  digital platforms. We had the opportunity to appear  before the Joint Select Committee on Social Media  and Australian Society in 2024 as part of its inquiry  into the influence and impacts of social media on  Australian society.  Seven West Media outlined its concerns about the  pervasive influence of unregulated mis-information and  the emotional toll of online scams, exclusion and bullying  on Australians. We also continue to advocate for the  designation of Meta under the News Media Bargaining  Code to ensure digital platforms are carrying trusted and  verified news content to combat the spread of mis- and  dis-information. DATA SECURITY AND PRIVACY We integrate sound governing principles into all  corporate processes, particularly when handling personal  information and collected data. We deploy secure and  encrypted cloud-based technologies for housing and  movement of identifiable and de-identified datasets.  We have a senior Privacy Officer and a comprehensive  Privacy Policy that ensures our organisation is compliant  with the Australian Privacy Principles. Our aim is to handle  personal information responsibly, transparently and not  hold data without value exchange for our customers.  Our maturity level for cyber security continues to evolve.

Our content  spine, supplemented by our sport and  entertainment offerings, continues  to resonate with audiences. Seven has  continued this performance in the first  half of the calendar year 2024, leading  the year as the #1 national network  in total people.  Our content offering continues  to improve, with the digital rights  for AFL and Cricket to commence  for the first time in FY25.  Strategic Outlook  Our FY25 strategy is built upon the foundations set during FY24 and is guided by our ambition to Build a better,  digital media business. This strategy continues to see digital first and foremost in the Group’s strategy as we look  to capitalise on the opportunity this presents. Whilst digital creates new opportunities, focus will not divert away  from optimising the Group’s traditional assets and create new business opportunities across traditional and new  business assets. These strategic drivers of performance will be supported by an efficient cost base. The previous  strategic priority of ‘Enhance and Elevate the Brand’ continues, however, it is now embedded into each of the FY25  drivers of performance. The changes in the Group’s operating structure that occurred during June is about setting up the operating model  to align to these drivers of performance from the commencement of FY25. This new operating model supports and  drives transparency and accountability across the business and is focused on the Group’s ensuring that we are  Driving our own future. Deliver a  digital future  that underpins  growth in SWM  earnings Optimise traditional  assets to create a  sustainable future  for television and  publishing assets Find new revenue  streams / business  opportunities Manage costs  responsibly  to generate  strong cashflow 5 Review of Segments Governance Directors’ Report Remuneration Report Financial Statements Risk Management, People and Sustainability Executive Letters Our Strategy  ===== PAGE 9 ===== Seven West Media has embraced FY24 as a year of transformation,  positioning ourselves for future growth through innovation and  increasing operating discipline.  ”We recognise the important role local media  companies play in Australia, employing thousands  of professionals who provide entertainment and  news, and strengthen the connection between  metropolitan and regional communities.“ The business has responded to mixed  market conditions with a focus on  internal capability and costs, and has  established a new structure for the  Group that will improve resilience and  help reposition the company for growth. A softer economic and advertising  environment and an evolving media  landscape have challenged traditional  media business models. These changes  have inspired us to innovate and adapt.  We’ve restructured our operations  and management, and conducted an  independent review of our company  organisation to ensure a safe and  inclusive environment for all our staff. In April 2024, we appointed Jeff  Howard as the company’s new  Managing Director and Chief Executive  Officer. Jeff has brought a refreshed  leadership and disciplined approach  to the business. Previously CFO,  Jeff has demonstrated the leadership  capabilities that have given the Board  confidence in his ability to guide  the company through this stage of  transformation. The new operating structure was  introduced at the end of June 2024  and early July, and comprises three  divisions: Television, Digital and Western  Australia. This new structure aligns our  resources with our strategic priorities  and strengthens our commitment  to delivering quality content across  all platforms. We recognise the important role local  media companies play in Australia,  employing thousands of professionals  who provide entertainment and news,  and strengthen the connection between  metropolitan and regional communities.  In FY24 Seven West Media continued  our involvement in a range of charities,  including Telethon in Western Australia,  which raised $78 million for vital  medical and charity services. In addition, we supported the Good  Friday Appeal, which raised $23.4  million for Melbourne’s Royal Children’s  Hospital, and hosted the live broadcast  of The Big Freeze, helping to raise $20.1  million for Fight Motor Neurone Disease. We are committed to supporting  local content and ensuring Australian  audiences have free access to a diverse  range of media. We call on the Federal  Government to support the domestic  media industry in maintaining a fair and  equitable playing field, by compelling  foreign-owned operators to fully  comply with the Australian regulatory  environment. It is crucial that the Federal Government  protects Australians’ access to sports  and other programming, live and free  across all platforms, while the anti- siphoning rules are subject to review. Despite these challenges, Seven  West Media remains a leader across  the Australian media landscape  through our broadcast, print and  digital businesses. We are adapting  to structural changes in the industry,  and our focus on our digital offerings  is yielding significant results. Digital is  now contributing a significant part of  our annual earnings, and we expect to  continue building these assets further,  in tandem with our traditional television  and print businesses. We are excited to have secured  exclusive rights to major sports events,  and for the first time in Australian  history, we will be streaming AFL  and cricket live and free across our  digital platform 7plus later this year. Seven’s current affairs and news  programs, general interest and  drama continue to perform strongly,  while our award-winning sports  programs dominate audience  numbers year-round. Letter from  the Chairman 6 Executive Letters  Seven West Media Limited Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 10 ===== In Western Australia, our operations  are at the forefront of print and digital  audiences in the state and we have  launched a national digital newspaper,  The Nightly, and sport platform  Streamer. The new OzTAM Virtual Australia ratings  system, known as VOZ, is providing our  advertisers with accurate data about  our audience numbers in both digital  and broadcast. Through data analytics  and artificial intelligence, we can also  now target key demographics with  tailored content, enabling significantly  more efficient advertising for our  customers. Your board and new management  team is committed to creating a safe,  sustainable, performance-focused  culture at Seven West Media. In pursuit  of that goal, we have implemented  a major cost-cutting program. With  this exercise underway, we have had  to farewell many staff and senior  executives, and we thank them for their  dedicated service over many years. On behalf of the Board, I thank you,  our shareholders, and our staff for your  ongoing support. We are confident that  Seven West Media is well positioned  to thrive in this dynamic and evolving  industry. Kerry Stokes AC Chairman 7 Review of Segments Governance Directors’ Report Remuneration Report Financial Statements Risk Management, People and Sustainability Our Strategy Executive Letters  ===== PAGE 11 ===== Dear Shareholders, I am honoured to be writing to you for  the first time as Seven West Media’s  Managing Director and Chief Executive  Officer, having taken on the role in  April this year. Stepping into this role  at such a pivotal time for our company  is a real privilege and has been both  challenging and rewarding. With the  media landscape undergoing rapid  transformation, I am committed to  leading our company through this  period of change. Our objective is to build a better  media business, one that will prosper  despite our industry’s current structural  changes and the broader economic  challenges. I am excited about the  opportunities ahead of us, and it is very  important that we ensure we are well  positioned to take advantage of these  opportunities as they come up.  We need to think differently about how  we work and how we are structured.  In June 2024 we introduced a new  operating model of three divisions  – Television, Digital and Western  Australia – supported by every  department across Seven West Media  to help us achieve that ambition. The  priority now is to focus on optimising  our television business, delivering on  our digital future, finding new revenue  streams and business opportunities,  and managing costs responsibly.    Financial Performance The FY24 results reflect the challenging  macroeconomic environment. Group  revenue including share of associates  of $1.415 billion was down 5% on FY23.  Statutory net profit after tax of $45  million was down 69% on FY23, while  underlying net profit after tax after  excluding significant items was $78  million, down 46%. Group earnings  before interest, tax, depreciation and  amortisation (EBITDA) before significant  items of $187 million was down 33%  on FY23.    Operating cost growth was held to  2% during the period, with a 4% year- on-year decline achieved in second- half costs, in line with guidance. Net debt of $301 million increased  from $257 million as of 30 June 2023,  driven by the $67 million invested in the  purchase of ARN Media Limited shares.  Underlying cash generation, excluding  this investment, is $16 million. Reported  net leverage (net debt/EBITDA) is  1.6 times; however, when adjusting for  the ARN investment, the underlying  leverage is 1.3 times.  Our Strategy Our strategy is driven by the immediate  financial and economic challenges  we face, plus the ongoing structural  changes in the media industry. As  I said, it centres on optimising our  television business, putting digital  first, finding new revenue streams and  business opportunities, and managing  costs responsibly. By focusing on these  areas, we can build a resilient and  future-ready organisation that can  thrive in the evolving media landscape. Content excellence is at the heart  of our strategy. We are committed  to producing and delivering high- quality content that resonates with  our audiences and can be monetised  effectively across all our platforms.  This includes investing in original  content, securing exclusive rights to  major sports events, and continuously  enhancing our news coverage. Our  goal is to be the go-to source for news,  entertainment and sports in Australia. Delivering on our digital future means  turbocharging 7plus and our other  digital platforms to ensure they are  giving people what they want, when  they want it, via the technology they  want to use. We are leveraging cutting- edge technologies to enhance the user  experience, optimise our operations,  and capture revenue like never before.  Letter from the  Managing Director and  Chief Executive Officer 8 Executive Letters  Seven West Media Limited Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 12 ===== Our focus on personalisation, data  analytics, and AI-driven solutions  positions us at the forefront of the  digital media revolution. Managing our costs responsibly is  critical to our future. That means making  some hard decisions. As part of the  introduction of our new operating model  in June 2024, we farewelled some of  our colleagues. Those decisions were  not taken lightly or easily. On behalf  of Seven West Media, I would like to  extend my sincere thanks to everyone  who has left us and wish you all the  very best for the future.  Optimising Traditional  Assets Our television and digital platforms  continue to dominate the Australian  market, reaching more than 17 million  people nationally every month. With  a truly national broadcast network  and a robust digital presence, including  7plus, The Nightly and 7NEWS.com.au,  we reach audiences across all corners  of the country. Our content, whether  viewed on a television, mobile phone,  laptop or tablet, remains unparalleled.  We pride ourselves on delivering high- quality news, sports, and entertainment  that engages with all Australians. Seven West Media Western Australia  is a remarkable business, reaching  and engaging with people in its home  state like no other media organisation.  The West has continued to transform  its business, driving a greater share of  its revenue from digital subscriptions  and circulation through high quality  local editorial. The result of this focus is  demonstrated in the leading readership  and circulation results across the  country, as well as the strong growth  in digital subscriptions.  It has also successfully expanded  nationally with new ventures such  as the digital newspaper The Nightly  and Streamer, an innovative digital  community sport platform. In just  its first five months, The Nightly  established an audience of  2.3 million unique users in June  2024. You can expect to see  more market-leading  innovations from  the West.  9 Review of Segments Governance Directors’ Report Remuneration Report Financial Statements Risk Management, People and Sustainability Our Strategy Executive Letters  ===== PAGE 13 ===== Delivering the Digital Future Digital transformation is a key part  our strategy. Our digital platforms,  particularly 7plus, continue to see  excellent user growth and engagement. Our digital strategy extends beyond  content acquisition. We are investing  in technology and working with  market-leading partners such as AWS  and Databricks to enhance the 7plus  user experience. The integration of AI  into the 7plus personalisation engine  has allowed us to provide tailored  content recommendations, significantly  boosting audience engagement and  retention. Our data-driven approach  ensures that we can deliver the  right content to the right audience  at the right time, maximising both  viewer satisfaction and advertising  effectiveness. Navigating Challenges and  Embracing Opportunities The media landscape is evolving,  creating both challenges and  opportunities. The current economic  conditions and regulatory environment  require us to think differently, adapt  swiftly, and work hard and smart. Our  ability to innovate and adapt is critical  to maintaining our competitive edge. The regulatory environment also  presents challenges, particularly when  it comes to the digital and social media  giants. We are actively advocating  for fair regulations that ensure a level  playing field for all media companies.  Our position is simple: the digital and  social media giants must be regulated  and held to account for their actions.  There are a number of steps the Federal  Government can take, such as bringing  Meta back into the News Media  Bargaining Code and making sure the  digital platforms take responsibility for  the content they distribute, particularly  when it comes to what children see.  We are also closely monitoring the  development of AI in relation to our  content.  As a country, we should not bow  to the demands of the digital platforms.  They should be made to play by our  rules. Other multinational industries  have to comply with all manner of  laws and regulations when they want  to trade here; it is time for the digital  and social media giants to be required  to do the same.  While the recent Communications  Legislation Amendment (Prominence  and Anti-siphoning) Bill 2023  introduces some positive measures  for the industry, Seven West Media  is disappointed that the Government  did not take the opportunity to keep  pace with technology developments  by ensuring the prominence framework  applied to all existing connected  TVs. Stapling digital simulcast to the  broadcast sports rights would have  addressed the issue.  The case for including the digital  simulcast will only get stronger as more  Australians migrate to free streaming  apps to get their free TV services. In the  lead up to the two-year anti-siphoning  review, Seven West Media will continue  to advocate for all Australians to  be able to watch free sport, no matter  what technology they use. Despite these challenges, the  opportunities are immense. The growth  of digital advertising, the increasing  demand for premium content, and  the potential for new revenue streams  through emerging technologies offer  clear growth prospects. We are  working hard to capitalise on these  opportunities and drive sustained  growth in the years to come. Our People The success of Seven West Media  is built on the dedication and talent  of our people. Our team has shown  remarkable resilience and commitment.  We are committed to fostering a  culture of inclusivity, collaboration  and continuous learning. This year,  we have launched several initiatives  aimed at professional development  and employee wellbeing. Our training  programs, leadership development  courses, and wellness initiatives are  designed to support our employees’  growth and ensure they have the  tools they need to succeed. We also recognise the importance  of diversity and inclusion in driving  innovation and creativity. Our diversity  programs focus on promoting gender  equality, supporting underrepresented  groups, and creating an inclusive work  environment where everyone can thrive.  We believe that a diverse and inclusive  workforce is essential to our success  and reflects the communities we serve. Seven West Media takes very  seriously any allegations in relation  to sexual harassment, bullying and  other behaviours deemed to be  inappropriate within the workplace.  We take complaints seriously, manage  them confidentially and deal with  any breaches decisively. We have  very clear policies in place and any  behaviour that is found to be in breach  of these policies will not be tolerated. ”Our data-driven approach ensures that we can  deliver the right content to the right audience at the  right time, maximising both viewer satisfaction and  advertising effectiveness.“ 10 Executive Letters  Seven West Media Limited Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 14 ===== Community and Social  Impact We believe in the power of media to  make a positive impact on society.  Through our community initiatives,  we aim to support local communities,  promote social causes and contribute  to a better world.  Seven West Media’s commitment  to community remains steadfast.  Our unparalleled news coverage,  extensive sports broadcasting, and  significant fundraising initiatives, such  as Telethon, reflect our dedication  to making a positive impact. In 2023  alone, Telethon raised $78 million,  supporting 136 beneficiaries and  delivering critical services to children  and families in need. Sustainability is another area where  we are making progress. We have  implemented several green initiatives  across our operations, from reducing  energy consumption in our offices and  studios to promoting recycling and  waste reduction.  Looking Forward I’m excited about the opportunities that  lie before us. Our focus is on delivering  exceptional content, engaging our  audiences, making the most of our  digital future, and driving sustainable  growth. Together, we will navigate the  challenges and seize the opportunities  to build a better media business. I’d like to thank my predecessor,  James Warburton, for his leadership  of Seven West Media over five years.

Better Homes and Gardens 2024 Review of Segments  Seven West Media Limited Annual Report 2024 14  ===== PAGE 18 ===== The Group delivered revenue including  share of equity accounted investees  profits of $1,415.2 million, down  4.9% versus the previous year. The  advertising market continued to decline  at higher than forecast rates, driven  by the macroeconomic inflationary  environment, resulting in the total TV  advertising market down 8.2% in FY24.  The Group was able to outperform the  market performance as our advertising  share for FY24 was 40.2%, an increase  of 1.7% from the prior year, which  included growth in every quarter of the  year. Our revenue performance was  driven by our audience performance,  which has grown as compared to the  prior year.  Total Group costs, excluding  depreciation and amortisation,  increased $20.1 million, an increase  of 1.7% from the previous year,  as the Group made investments in  programming that has contributed  to the sales performance noted  above and was impacted by the high  inflationary environment impacting  supplier and salary costs. To partially  offset these increases, as announced  at the Group’s 2023 AGM in November  2023, the Group has identified  $60 million in initiatives for execution  over FY24 – FY25, with $25m being  actioned in FY24. This cost focus  continues into FY25, with the FY25  program upsized.  EBITDA relating to profit before  significant items, net finance costs,  tax, depreciation and amortisation  of $187.0 million was down 33.2%  on the previous year. Significant items before tax of $44.3  million were recorded in the period,  relating to implementation costs  in relation to Project Phoenix, the  Group’s new integrated revenue  system, net costs in relation to the  Group’s investments, programming  adjustments and redundancy and  restructure costs being partially offset  by gains recognised on a reduction in  the expected term of one of the Group’s  leases and a settlement of a dispute.  The net costs in relation to the Group’s  investments is primarily in relation to  the Group’s investment in ARN Media  entered into during the period. The gain  recognised on the remeasurement of the  lease has impacted the Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss and Other  Comprehensive Income due to previous  impairments recognised on the ROU  asset of this lease. Redundancy and  restructure costs are incurred in relation  to the cost initiatives announced at the  2023 AGM in November and in June  in connection with the announcement  of the restructuring of the Group’s  operating model. Significant items in the prior period  also related to implementation costs  in relation to Project Phoenix being  partially offset by fair value gains  recognised on the Group’s ventures  portfolio and gain on the sale of  Pyrmont and Mackay property sales.  Seven West Media Limited reported a statutory profit before tax of $67.1 million  for the year ended 30 June 2024. This compares to a corresponding year statutory  profit before tax of $196.0 million. Excluding significant items, the current year  profit after tax of $78.4 million is down 46.4% on the previous year equivalent  profit of $146.3 million.  2023 AFL Finals Series 15 Governance Directors’ Report Remuneration Report Financial Statements Risk Management, People and Sustainability Our Strategy Executive Letters Review of Segments  ===== PAGE 19 ===== As announced at the Group’s FY22 year  end results announcement, the Group  commenced a 12 month on-market  share buy-back for up to 10% of shares  on issues. As part of the Group’s FY23  year end results announcement, it was  announced that this program was being  continued for a further 12-month period.  As at 30 June 2024, 50,977,737 shares  ($18,864,000) have been bought back  at an average price of $0.37 under this  program, of which, 14,430,739 shares  ($3,866,000) were purchased in the  period to 30 June 2024. This program  will not continue in FY25. Cashflow Operating cash inflows of $60.3  million, were down $17.1 million on  the prior year and impacted by the  decrease in operating results, partially  offset by a net tax refund received.  In connection with finalising its FY23  tax return, a refund of $23 million was  received, which offset the FY24 monthly  tax instalments made of $12 million.  Working capital movements largely  relate to the timing of programming  payments.  The Group’s CAPEX spend during the  year has decreased as the prior half  included additional spend on Project  Arx, which was the consolidation of all  Sydney staff into our South Eveleigh  head office. This project was completed  at the start of this year and the Group  is in the process of finalising its exit  from the Martin Place site. During the period, the Group also  expanded its venture portfolio with  investments made in ARN Media Limited  and Mad Paws Holdings Limited,  refer details in the Ventures section.  Excluding these investments of $68.5  million, the Group saw a cash inflow  of $15.7 million. Net Debt As at 30 June 2024, the Group held net  debt of $301.4 million, compared to  $249.4 million in the prior period, and  leverage of 1.6x, compared to 0.9x  in the prior year. Excluding the ARN  investment, leverage would have been  1.3x, with the increase on the prior  year reflective of decline in the Group’s  operating results during the period.  During the year, the Group refinanced  its debt facility. The refinanced  facility has been downsized from  $600 million to $525 million, and the  tenor increased from three years to a  four-year term. Despite recent market  movement, funding costs have been  held at approximately 2.4% above  BBSY, reflecting the same terms as  the existing deal, adjusted for the  extra tenor. There has been no change  to the Group’s covenants as part of  this refinancing and the group has  maintained compliance with these  covenants during the period up to,  and as at, 30 June 2024. Balance Sheet As at 30 June 2024, the Group’s assets  exceeded its liabilities by $403.5  million (30 June 2023: $378.8 million).  The Group has positive net current  assets as at 30 June 2024 of $134.8  million (30 June 2023: $116.2 million).  Ventures Portfolio Seven West Ventures has been  expanded and refreshed during the  financial year with investments made  into ARN Media Limited and Mad Paws  Holdings Limited, as well as the exit from  the Portfolio of CarBar Holdings Pty  Limited, MoneyMe Limited and Starts  at Sixty Pty Limited. These ventures are opportunities where  we leverage the power of our assets  to unlock maximum growth potential  and drive long-term value creation.  The portfolio is focused on disruptive,  scalable businesses with a strong  consumer or media proposition.  Investment into ARN Media Limited During November, the Group announced  that it had acquired a 14.9% shareholding  in ARN Media Limited (ARN) as well  as entering into a cash-settled equity  swap with Barrenjoey Markets Pty  Limited relating to a further 5.0% of ARN.  SWM has existing and long-standing  commercial partnerships with ARN and  has an interest in ensuring their continued  and long-term success via a direct  investment in ARN. The Group acquired these investments  at $1.10 per ARN share, resulting in  a gross payment of approximately $67  million. These investments were required  to be fair valued to the listed market price  on acquisition, which has resulted in a  day 1 P&L loss being recognised, as a  significant item, and at each reporting  date. Post day 1, fair value changes in  the cash swap have been recognised in  the P&L (significant items) and changes  in the direct equity have been recognised  in equity (other comprehensive income).

This programming slate resulted in the  group continuing to deliver audience  consistency and strength and ensured  Seven retained its position as the  number 1 network for National audience  share for the fourth year running in FY24.  This performance has continued into the  CY24 survey year, which has seen Seven  be the only network to grow share.  Seven’s linear audience performance  has seen audience growth as well  as audience share improvements.  1	 Source: Seven’s average audiences; total people, metro + regional; 18:00 to 22:30; per OzTam. Seven has grown linear audience  by 0.5%1 on a total people basis  throughout the year, and has seen  linear audience growth on multiple  tentpoles and sports.   7plus has seen minutes growth of  39% year-on-year, which includes  significant growth across both live  and video on demand minutes. This audience performance has not  translated into revenue performance  during the year, which continues to  be challenged by the macroeconomic  inflationary environment. ThinkTV  reported that the total TV advertising  market decreased by 8.2% to $3.2  billion in the financial year.

All up, the FIFA  Women’s World Cup 2023TM accounted  for five of the top six programs of the  2023 survey year. This event provided  the strong platform to launch the  remaining content in FY24.  Six of Seven’s tent pole shows –  Dancing With The Stars, SAS Australia,  Farmer Wants A Wife (the 2024  calendar year version saw a further  increase on the 2023 calendar year  version), Australian Idol and My Kitchen  Rules – increased their audiences  year-on-year. Audience growth also  occurred on our sport coverages,  with the AFL Grand Final up 22%,  metro test cricket coverage up 4%  and BBL audiences up 3% nationally  and 7% up in capital cities.  Every month, Seven reaches more than  17 million people nationally across  broadcast and digital. The depth of the Seven broadcast  schedule remains unparalleled.  This consistency is led by our market  leading news and public affairs  programming, long running Seven  productions (Home and Away and  Better Homes and Gardens) and Sport.  Seven’s programming schedule begins  each day with Sunrise, which remains  Australia’s most-watched breakfast  show for a 21st consecutive financial  year. The Morning Show celebrated  its 16th birthday as the most-watched  morning show. Home and Away  continues to be the #1 Australian drama  on free to air. Rounding out Seven’s  dominance throughout the day is The  Chase that provides the lead-in to  Seven’s market leading nightly news  service. Seven’s nightly news service  remains the most trusted source of  broadcast news in the country with  more Australians turning to Seven for  news and public affairs. Seven is also  the home of Australia’s number one  winter sport in the AFL and the number  one summer sport with the Cricket.  This ratings performance has translated  into our market leading 40.2% share of  the total television advertising market,  tracking in line with our FY24 target of  40% plus. During Q1 FY24, the group  record a share of 42.2% share which  was the strongest ever non-Olympics  quarter for the Group. Seven’s revenue decreased by 5.8%  to $1,239.6 million, despite a market  decline for the period of 8.2%. Costs  increased by 1.6% to $1,067.5 million.

This minutes growth  has outpaced the market, with the  Group’s minutes share during the  year increasing by 2.4%. The Group continues to invest in the  7plus platform across all mediums,  with a focus on user experience  and seeking to continue to add  innovative features, functionality  and optimisations. More features  are regularly added to continue  to improve the user experience.  The introduction of the Group’s  AFL and Cricket digital rights  commencing September 2024 will  be a game changer for the 7plus  platform and is expected to drive  significant growth for the platform.  Our investments are aimed at making  the use of our platforms now and into  the future a best-in-class experience. The industry’s audience  measurement platform VOZ  launched in May 2023 continues  to demonstrate the incremental  demand for BVOD and is enabling  the delivery of premium experiences  for customers. VOZ is set to be the  currency used in sales discussions  into FY25 and is expected to deliver  greater opportunities and benefits for  customers in their future campaigns.

The West’s digital platforms also  include Streamer.com.au, Australia’s  premier community sport streaming  platform, and The Game sports tipping  platform (thegame.com.au).  The latest IPSOS data for June 2024  shows The West’s digital platforms  now have a collective audience of  4.54 million and generated 59.5 million  monthly page views, an increase of  5.2 million page views or 9.6% year- on-year*. The Nightly, which was  launched at the end of February 2024,  strongly contributed to this growth with  a record 5 million page views in just its  fourth month post launch. The Nightly  is Australia’s fastest growing news  brand with a total unique audience  of 2.3 million in June, an increase  of 23.7% month on month. In print, The West Australian Monday to  Friday and Saturday editions continue  to have the highest market reach of any  major metropolitan masthead in the  nation, with 14.6% of West Australians  on average reading an issue of the  weekday edition and 19.3% of West  Australians on average reading an  issue of the Saturday edition**. On the back of award-winning  journalism and newspaper presentation,  the latest data from Roy Morgan  to March 2024 indicates The West  Australian averages 349,000 print  readers every weekday and 460,000  on the weekend. The Sunday Times  averages 374,000 readers every  weekend. The West continues to transform its  business with a strong focus on driving  a greater share of its revenue from  digital subscriptions and circulation,  through high quality editorial. The  result of this focus is demonstrated in  the leading readership and audience  results, as well as the continued growth  in digital subscriptions revenue. West Australian Newspapers, alongside  Seven, continues to benefit from the  landmark commercial agreement  to provide Google news content,  supporting The West’s investment in  high quality journalism and content.  Evidence of this investment includes  the ongoing ‘Subscribe with Google’  marketing initiative and innovative  new digital products such as Digital  edition newspapers. While economic conditions were  strong in WA, advertising conditions  were mixed in a challenging market  impacted by interest rate rises and high  inflation. The travel sector continues  its recovery towards pre COVID-19  advertising spend levels and retail  spend was flat year-on-year. Overall total revenue increased  $1.2 million or 0.7% to $172.0 million.  Rendering of services increased  $6.1 million or 54.4% due to an  increase in commercial printing.  The West’s advertising revenue was  flat year-on-year and circulation  revenue declined 3.0%. Operating costs continue to be  an ongoing focus. The West’s costs  excluding depreciation & amortisation  increased $5.1 million or 3.7% to  $144.6 million in FY24. This was due  to greater labour, materials and  printing costs associated with new  commercial printing work secured,  new digital products and CPI increases.

The Group’s content strategy is focused on growing  audience in absolute terms and audience share in the  market. This audience growth should result in growth  for the Total TV advertising market in line with the growth  experienced in the wider advertising market. The VOZ measurement systems continues to demonstrate  the reach of the total TV market and provide a comparable  viewer measurement metric to the digital offerings in the  market receiving a higher share of the advertising market. Optimise the  business Partner for  growth Sustainable cost base The Group’s cost base reflects  investments and restructures made  each year, as well as programming  commitments made in prior years. The Group continues to focus on the  development of a cost base that is  sustainable and drives future profits  and cashflows. During FY24, management has implemented a cost out  program that delivered $25m of benefits for FY24 and  was to deliver $35m of benefit in FY25. In line with the  operating model changes announced in June, this program  has been upsized. Management intends to continue to  explore opportunities for further benefits during FY25.  This cost out program offsets increases in the cost base,  with costs expected to be down year on year. These initiatives will occur in the ordinary course of business,  as management looks for new ways of working under the  revised operating model, as well as in response to further  market challenges. Accelerate our  digital future Enhance  and elevate  the brand Competition for key sports  and entertainment rights  The Group recognises the value  of premium content to its audiences  and advertisers and the importance  of the Group securing rights or creating  attractive content at a sustainable cost.  The Group ensures a disciplined approach is maintained  in acquiring content rights and production resourcing.  For these rights acquired, the focus is on maximising  the revenue opportunities that these rights present,  including by targeting key demographics for advertisers  and demonstrating the return on advertising investment  through reliable measurement systems.  Accelerate our  digital future Enhance  and elevate  the brand Optimise the  business Structural change and new competitors  for audiences  The rapid transformation of the media  industry due to technological change  represents a material economic  sustainability risk for the Group.  The Group is responding to and participating in this change  under its current strategic framework, including via continued  investment in the rapid digital transformation of the Group  whilst maintaining a sustainable cost base.  The Group continues to target leadership in the most  valuable linear broadcast demographics which, together  with our 7plus Broadcast Video on Demand (“BVOD”)  service, allows for growth in audiences and greater  returns on the investments in content.  Whilst the Group is focused on maximising the BVOD  opportunity, the traditional business remains critically  important to our future and management continues  to look for ways to optimise our revenue generation  in a cost effective and sustainable way. Risk Management Seven West Media maintains sound risk management  systems in order to protect and enhance shareholder value.  The Board acknowledges that the management of business  risk is an integral part of the Group’s operations and that  a sound risk management framework, aligned to its strategy,  not only helps to protect established value, but can also  assist in identifying and capitalising on opportunities to  create value.  The table below sets out the key risks (in no particular order)  which could impact achievement of the Group’s strategic  objectives. These risks are actively monitored under our  risk management framework and there are processes in  place to identify, measure, evaluate, monitor and report  on each of them and then control or mitigate them, to the  extent possible. For more information on the Group’s risk  management framework, refer to pages 37 to 43 of this  Annual Report for the Corporate Governance Statement.

There is also the risk that  key technology may fail resulting in loss  of revenue and audiences.  The Group has increased its technology capabilities through  enhanced staffing expertise, project delivery governance  and reporting processes to better manage this risk.  The Group continues to manage risks which could give  rise to a failure in core operational systems and processes  through Business Continuity Planning including system  and site redundancy.  Accelerate our  digital future Optimise the  business Regulatory change  The television industry is subject to a high  degree of regulation including broadcast  licence conditions. Changes to these  conditions can have a material impact on  the costs of operation and the ability of the  Group to compete with global competitors.  Management maintains a specialised expertise in regulatory  matters and participates in regulatory reviews through direct  engagement and via representation on a variety of industry  bodies. The Group continues to engage with the Federal  Government following the release of the Media Reform  Green Paper to participate in the creation of a new regulatory  framework for the future of the Australian free-to-air industry.  Accelerate our  digital future Enhance and  elevate the  brand Optimise the  business Cyber security risk  Noting the increasing frequency and  severity of cyber security attacks globally,  there is a risk that the Group’s systems may  be subject to such an attack. The Group  recognises that such incidents, should they  occur, may negatively impact financial and  operational performance. This can include  the loss of Group and customer data.  All Group staff receive ongoing training to ensure that  they are aware of the risks that cyber attacks pose  and their role in preventing incidents from occurring.  The Group also continues to grow its investment in the  technical staff and systems required to appropriately  manage the potential adverse effects on the Group.  Optimise the  business Partner for  growth  Capital Funding Availability  There is a risk to the availability of  the capital funding required to meet  the Group’s operating and strategic  requirements. This risk arises due  to some or all of the following factors:  	 > the structural changes in the  media industry; and  	 > the success of the Group’s  content and audience strategies.  The Group has access to liquidity at reporting date across  its debt facilities and existing cash reserves. The availability  of funding is a key focus of the Group as its executes its  strategic objectives, and is monitored daily.  The Group refinanced its debt facilities in October for  a further 4 years, with fundings costs maintained from  previous facility, after adjusting for the extra tenor. Partner for  growth Execution of M&A strategy  There is a risk that the M&A activity  that is entered into does not realise  the expected benefits and strategic  alignment to the Group’s strategy  when it was entered into.  The Group ensures that M&A transactions that are  entered into meet stringent hurdles to achieve the  best possible outcome for our shareholders. Detailed  integration plans accompany any M&A transaction  so that any transaction is successfully integrated.  The Group continued to expand our ventures portfolio  during the year with the addition of our ARN Media  Limited investment (19.9%). The Group has an existing  and long-standing commercial partnership with ARN  Media Limited and has an interest in ensuring their  continued and long-term success via a direct investment.  27 Review of Segments Governance Directors’ Report Remuneration Report Financial Statements Our Strategy Executive Letters Risk Management, People and Sustainability  ===== PAGE 31 ===== People At Seven West Media, we understand that our people ensure our success and, in return, we are committed to  creating a workplace where employees can fulfil their individual career aspirations and potential and that they are  inspired by a high-performance culture and rewarded for achievement and results.

The Company’s full 2024 Corporate Governance Statement,  which set outs the Company’s compliance with the 4th  edition of the ASX Corporate Governance Council Corporate  Governance Principles and Recommendations (“ASX  Recommendations”), unless otherwise stated, is available  in the “Corporate Governance” section of the Company’s  website at www.sevenwestmedia.com.au/about-us/  corporate-governance. Board and Committee Charters  and a number of the corporate governance policies referred  to in the 2024 Corporate Governance Statement are also  available at the above link. The documents marked with an * below have been posted  in the ‘Corporate Governance’ section on the Company’s  website at www.sevenwestmedia.com.au/about-us/  corporate-governance. Role and Responsibilities of the Board The Board is empowered to manage the business of  the Company subject to the Corporations Act and the  Company’s Constitution*. The Board is responsible for  the overall corporate governance of the Company and  has adopted a Board Charter* setting out the role and  responsibilities of the Board as well as those functions  delegated to Management. Delegation to Management Subject to oversight by the Board and the exercise by the  Board of functions which it is required to carry out under  the Company’s Constitution, Board Charter and the law,  it is the role of management to carry out functions that are  expressly delegated to management by the Board, as well  as those functions not specifically reserved to the Board,  as it considers appropriate, including those functions and  affairs which pertain to the day-to-day management  of the operations and administration of the Company. Management must supply the Board with information in  a form, timeframe and quality that will enable the Board  to discharge its duties effectively, including information  concerning the Company’s compliance with material  legal and regulatory requirements and any conduct  that is materially inconsistent with the values or Code  of Conduct of the Company. Board Composition The Company’s Constitution provides for a minimum of three  Directors and a maximum of twelve Directors on the Board.  As at the date of this statement, the Board comprises seven  Directors, including six Non-Executive Directors and the  Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer. The Non-Independent Directors in office are: 	 > Mr Kerry Stokes AC, Chairman 	 > Mr Ryan Stokes AO, Director 	 > Mr Jeff Howard, Managing Director & Chief Executive  Officer The Independent Directors in office are: 	 > Ms Colette Garnsey OAM, Director 	 > Ms Teresa Dyson, Director 	 > Mr Michael Malone, Director 	 > Mr Michael Ziegelaar, Director The qualifications, experience, expertise and period  in office of each Director of the Company at the date  of this Annual Report are disclosed in the Board of  Directors section on pages 34 to 36. Mr David Evans was a Director throughout the financial  year until his retirement on 9 November 2023. Mr Jeff Howard was appointed Managing Director &  Chief Executive Officer of the Company on 19 April 2014,  following Mr James Warburton’s resignation from that role  and the Board on 18 April 2024. Chairman The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  are separate. Mr Kerry Stokes AC is the Chairman of the  Company. The Chairman is responsible for leading the Board,  facilitating the effective contribution of all Directors and  promoting constructive and respectful relations between  Directors and between the Board and Management. The Board acknowledges the ASX Recommendation that  the Chairman should be an Independent Director, however  the Board has formed the view that Mr Stokes is the most  appropriate person to lead the Board as its Chairman given  his experience and skills, particularly with regard to his long-  term association with various media businesses of the Group. In addition, the Company has a clear conflict of interest  protocol to manage the relationships between the Company  and Seven Group Holdings Limited. 37 Review of Segments Directors’ Report Remuneration Report Financial Statements Risk Management, People and Sustainability Our Strategy Executive Letters Governance  ===== PAGE 41 ===== Board Independence The Board comprises a majority of Independent Directors,  with three Non-Independent Directors and four Independent  Directors. During the period of the financial year prior  to Mr Evans’ retirement, the Board comprised three  Non-Independent Directors and five Independent Directors.  In determining whether a Director is independent, the Board  conducts regular assessments and has regard to whether  a Director is considered to be one who: 	 > is a substantial shareholder of the Company or an officer  of, or otherwise associated directly with, or represents  or has been within the last three years an officer or  employee of a substantial shareholder of the Company; 	 > receives performance-based remuneration (including  options or performance rights) from, or participates  in an employee incentive scheme of, the entity; 	 > is, or has previously been, employed in an executive  capacity by the Company or another Group member, and  there has not been a period of at least three years between  ceasing such employment and serving on the Board; 	 > has within the last three years been a principal of a  material professional advisor of, or a material consultant  to, the Company or another Group member, or an  employee materially associated with the service provider; 	 > is a material supplier or customer of the Company or other  group member, or an officer of or otherwise associated  directly or indirectly with a material supplier or customer; 	 > has a material contractual relationship with the Company  or another group member other than as a Director; or 	 > has been a Director of the entity for such a period that  their independence from management and substantial  holders may have been compromised. The Board determines the materiality of a relationship on  the basis of fees paid or monies received or paid to either  a Director or an entity which falls within the independence  criteria above. If an amount received or paid may impact the  Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation  (EBITDA) of the Group in the previous financial year by more  than 5%, then a relationship will be considered material. In the Board’s view, the Independent Directors referred to  above are free from any interest, position or other relationship  that might, or reasonably be perceived to, influence, in  material respect the capability to bring an independent  judgement to bear on issues before the Board and to act in  the best interests of the Company as a whole rather than in  the interests of an individual security holder or other party. Mr Michael Ziegelaar is a partner at Herbert Smith Freehills,  a law firm which provides certain legal services to the  Company. The legal services provided by Herbert Smith  Freehills are not considered material having regard to the  principles above and Mr Ziegelaar is not involved in providing  the services. The Board is satisfied that Mr Ziegelaar’s  role with Herbert Smith Freehills does not interfere with the  independent exercise of his judgment as a Non-Executive  Director of the Company. Mr Kerry Stokes AC and Mr Ryan Stokes AO are not regarded  as independent within the framework of the independence  guidelines set out above because of their current and/ or recent positions within Seven Group Holdings Limited,  which is a major shareholder of Seven West Media Limited. Due to his position as Managing Director & Chief Executive  Officer, Mr Jeff Howard is not considered to be independent. Appointment of Directors The policy and procedure for the selection and appointment  of new Directors is set out in an Annexure to the Board  Charter. The factors that will be considered when reviewing  a potential candidate for Board appointment include: 	 > the skills, experience, expertise and personal qualities that  will best complement Board effectiveness having regard  to the Board skills matrix, including a deep understanding  of the media industry, corporate management and  operational, safety and financial matters; 	 > the existing composition of the Board, having regard  to the factors outlined in the Company’s Diversity Policy  and the objective of achieving a Board comprising  Directors from a diverse range of backgrounds; 	 > the capability of the candidate to devote the  necessary time and commitment to the role (this involves  a consideration of matters such as other board or  executive appointments); and 	 > potential conflicts of interest and independence. Directors appointed to fill casual vacancies hold office until  the next Annual General Meeting and are then eligible for  election by shareholders.

The aggregated questionnaire results also provide the  basis of individual discussions between Directors and  the Chairman. The Chairman and each Board member  consider the performance of that Board member in relation  to the expectations for that Board member and consider  any opportunities for enhancing future performance. During the reporting period, performance evaluations of  the Board, its Committees and individual Directors were  carried out in accordance with this process. Assessment of Management Performance The performance of the Managing Director & Chief Executive  Officer is formally reviewed by the Board against the  achievement of strategic and budgetary objectives in respect  of the Group’s operations and investments whilst also having  regard for his personal performance in the leadership of the  Group. The Board’s review is carried out annually in regard  to certain goals against which he is assessed, and throughout  the year in regard to others, and forms the basis of the  determination of the Managing Director & Chief Executive  Officer’s performance-linked remuneration. The performance of senior executives of the Company is  reviewed on an annual basis in a formal and documented  interview process with either the Managing Director  & Chief Executive Officer or the particular executive’s  immediate superior. Performance is evaluated against  agreed performance goals and assessment criteria in  relation to the senior executive’s duties and material areas  of responsibility, including management of relevant business  units within budget, motivation and development of staff, and  achievement of and contribution to the Company’s objectives. A performance evaluation of the Managing Director & Chief  Executive Officer and other senior executives took place  during the year in accordance with this process. Core Values In accordance with its Charter, the Board has reviewed  and approved the following core values of the Company: 	 > Be Brave 	 > Better Together 	 > Make it Happen During FY25, the Company’s values will be reviewed  by the Board, to ensure they align with the Board’s and  Management’s expectations for behaviour and the culture  they are seeking to embed, and so that they will serve as  guiding principles to support the changes to the Company’s  purpose, operating model and strategic objectives being  implemented by the Company. Diversity and Inclusion The Board recognises the benefits of a workplace culture  that is inclusive and respectful of diversity. The Board  values diversity, including in relation to age, gender, cultural  background and ethnicity and recognises the benefits it can  bring to the organisation. The Board has adopted a Diversity  Equity and Inclusion Policy* that sets out the Board’s  commitment to working towards achieving an inclusive and  respectful environment. Please refer to pages 30 to 31 of  this Annual Report for reporting on the Diversity Policy and  the measurable objectives and initiatives relating thereto. Code of Conduct and other  Company policies The Board has adopted a Code of Conduct for Directors*  which establishes guidelines for their conduct in matters such  as ethical standards and the disclosure and management  of conflicts of interests. The Company has adopted  Employee Conduct Guidelines* which provides a framework  of ethical principles for conducting business and dealing  with customers, employees and other stakeholders. Material breaches of the Codes of Conduct for Directors  and Employees are reported to the Board.

Security holders are given the option to receive  communications from, and to send communications to,  the Company electronically to the extent possible.

The Company’s website www.sevenwestmedia.com.au  provides various information about the Company. 41 Review of Segments Directors’ Report Remuneration Report Financial Statements Risk Management, People and Sustainability Our Strategy Executive Letters Governance  ===== PAGE 45 ===== Risk Oversight and Management The Board requires Management to design and implement  a risk management and internal control system to manage  the Group’s material business risks and report to it on the  management of those risks. The Board also believes a sound  risk management framework should be aimed at identifying  and delivering improved business processes and procedures  across the Group which are consistent with the Group’s  commercial objectives. Risk Management Policy The Board has adopted a Risk Management Policy*.  The group-wide risk profile covers the revenue, costs,  content, product/technology, regulatory and people risks of  the Company and is prepared by the Risk Assurance function  in consultation with key executives across the business. Throughout the year, the Audit & Risk Committee reviews  with management the group-wide risk profile and the  success of the risk mitigation strategies in order to satisfy  itself that management is operating within the risk appetite  set by the Board. External advice is obtained as appropriate.  The key risks identified by Management and mitigation  actions in place are regularly updated and reported to the  Audit & Risk Committee and periodically to the Board. During the reporting period, Management reported to the  Board as to the effectiveness of the Company’s management  of its material business risks. The Board satisfied itself the  Company’s risk management framework continues to be  sound and effectively identifies potential risks. Internal Control Framework –  Risk Assurance and Internal Audit The Company has established Risk Assurance and Internal  Audit functions to evaluate and improve the effectiveness  of the Company’s governance, risk management and internal  control processes. The Audit & Risk Committee reviews and  approves Internal Audit plans and resourcing as well as  monitors its independence, performance and management’s  responsiveness to its findings and recommendations. A specialist external Internal Audit firm has been appointed  to conduct the Company’s Internal Audit reviews under in-  house oversight. The Board considers that this appointment  provides an enhanced level of capability and technical  depth, which serves to embed a stronger risk and compliance  culture across the organisation whilst drawing on best  practice and knowledge across operational and emerging  issues. Additionally, efficiencies are gained by the externally  resourced Internal Audit function working closely with the  Group’s external auditor KPMG, to ensure audit efforts are  not duplicated and Internal Audit work can be relied upon. Material Risks Under the risk framework described above, the Company  has identified Total TV advertising market, sustainable cost  base, sector transformation, content, regulatory, technology,  cyber security, capital funding and execution of M&A  strategy risks which it manages and mitigates. Each of the  foregoing material business risks is monitored and managed  by appropriate Senior Management within the Company. Where appropriate, external advisers are engaged to assist  in managing the risk. More detail concerning these risks, the  Company’s economic sustainability risks and how it manages  those risks is set out under the headings “Risk Management”  and “Risk Management Policy” on pages 26, 27 and 42 of  this Annual Report. The Company does not believe it has any  material exposure to environmental risks. Commentary on the  Company’s environmental, sustainability and human capital  related initiatives as well as its community engagement,  which underpin the Company’s social risk management,  which is considered a key risk area for the Company is  provided on pages 28 to 33 of this Annual Report. Details  on the Company’s sustainability reporting and approach to  sustainability are available on the Company’s website at:  www.sevenwestmedia.com.au/about-us/sustainability. Strategy The Company has continued its strategic focus on  responding rapidly to the challenges and opportunities in  its marketplace. For more information on the Company’s  strategic framework which underpins the Company’s  economic sustainability, please refer to pages 4 and 5 of this  Annual Report. Environment Environmental risks are considered as part of the Company’s  risk assessment processes. Environmental risks relating to  the use and storage of any hazardous materials are identified  and managed through regular inspections of business  premises, reviews of compliance and emergency procedures,  and advice from external consultants on environmental  matters. The Company is mindful of climate change and managing  the environmental impact of its operations. For more  information on the Company’s environmental practices  and the Company’s efforts to minimise the environmental  footprint of its businesses, please refer to pages 32 and 33 of  this Annual Report. The Company releases a separate annual  Sustainability Report which is available on the Company’s  website at: www.sevenwestmedia.com.au/about-us/ sustainability.  42 Governance  Seven West Media Limited Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 46 ===== External Audit Function The Audit & Risk Committee meets periodically with the  External Auditors without Management being present.  Each reporting period, the External Auditor provides  an independence declaration in relation to the audit.  Additionally, the Audit & Risk Committee provides advice  to the Board in respect of whether the provision of non-audit  services by the External Auditor are compatible with the  general standard of independence of auditors imposed  by the Corporations Act. The Company’s External Auditor attends all Annual General  Meetings and is available to answer shareholders’ questions  about the conduct of the audit and the preparation and  content of the Auditor’s report. Declarations by the Managing  Director & Chief Executive Officer  and Chief Financial Officer Before the Board approves the financial statements for  each half year and full year, it receives from the Managing  Director & Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial  Officer a written declaration that, in their opinion, the  financial records of the Company have been properly  maintained and the financial statements are prepared in  accordance with the relevant accounting standards and  present a true and fair view of the financial position and  performance of the consolidated group. These declarations  also confirm that these opinions have been formed on the  basis of a sound system of risk management and internal  compliance and control which is operating effectively. The required declarations from the Managing Director  & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have  been given for the half year ended 31 December 2023 and  the financial year ended 30 June 2024.

Such reports, as are included in the non-audited sections  of this Annual Report, are submitted to a Committee or the  Board for consideration. Remuneration The Board considers that the attraction, retention and  motivation of its Directors and senior executives is of critical  importance in securing the future growth of the Company  and its shareholder returns. The objective of the remuneration policy for Executive  employees is to ensure that remuneration packages properly  reflect the duties and responsibilities of the employees,  and that remuneration is at an appropriate but competitive  market rate which enables the Company to attract, retain  and motivate people of the highest quality and with the best  skills from the industries in which the Company operates. The aggregate remuneration for Non-Executive Directors  is approved by shareholders. Fees for Directors are set out  in the Remuneration Report on pages 48 to 67. Hedging Policy It is the Company’s policy that employees (including Key  Management Personnel (“KMP”)) are prohibited from dealing  in Seven West Media securities if the dealing is prohibited  under the Corporations Act. Therefore, in accordance  with this policy, all KMP are prohibited from entering into  arrangements which operate to limit the executives’ economic  risk in connection with Seven West Media securities which  are unvested or remain subject to a holding lock.

Indemnity and insurance of Directors  and officers The Constitution of the Company provides an indemnity  to any current and former Director, Alternate Director and  Secretary of the Company against any liabilities incurred  by that person arising out of the discharge of duties as an  officer of the Company or the conduct of the business of  the Company, including associated legal costs defending  any proceedings relating to that person’s position with the  Company, except where the liability arises out of conduct  involving a lack of good faith. As permitted by the Constitution of the Company, the  Company has entered into Deeds of Access, Insurance  and Indemnity with each Director as at the end of the  financial year.  No amounts were paid and no actions were taken pursuant  to these indemnities during the year. During the financial year, the Company paid a premium  in respect of a contract insuring all Directors and officers  (including employees) of the Company and of related bodies  corporate against certain liabilities specified in the contract.  The contract prohibits disclosure of the nature of the liabilities  insured and the amount of the premium. Non-audit services The Company may decide to employ the auditor on  assignments additional to their statutory audit duties where  the auditor’s expertise and experience with the Company  and/or the Group are important. Amounts paid or payable by the Group to the auditor,  KPMG, for non-audit services provided during the year were  $190,553. The Board of Directors has considered the position  and, in accordance with the advice received from the Audit  and Risk Committee, is satisfied that the provision of the  non-audit services is compatible with the general standard  of independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations  Act 2001. The Directors are satisfied that the provision of  non-audit services by the auditor did not compromise the  auditor independence requirements of the Corporations  Act 2001 for the following reasons: 	 > all non-audit services were subject to the corporate  governance procedures adopted by the Group and  have been reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee  to ensure they do not impact the integrity and objectivity  of the auditor; 	 > the non-audit services provided do not undermine the  general principles relating to auditor’s independence  as set out in APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional  Accountants, as they did not involve reviewing or auditing  the auditor’s own work, acting in a management decision  making capacity for the Group, acting as an advocate  of the Group or jointly sharing the risks and rewards. The Lead auditor’s independence declaration is set out  on page 68 and forms part of the Directors’ Report for the  financial year ended 30 June 2024. Rounding of amounts The Group is of a kind referred to in ASIC Instrument  2016/191 and in accordance with that Instrument, amounts  in the consolidated financial statements and Directors’  Report have been rounded off to the nearest one thousand  dollars unless otherwise stated. This report is made in accordance with a resolution of the  Directors.

Overview of FY24 Executive Remuneration  and Performance Outcomes 	 > Fixed Remuneration – There were no remuneration  increases to Executive Key Management Personnel (KMP)  and Non-Executive Directors during the year, excluding  J Howard appointment to MD & CEO effective 19 April  2024 and superannuation increases for Executive KMP  based on the statutory increase.  	 > Short-Term Incentive (STI) Plan – The Group’s  underlying EBIT result did not exceed the 90% threshold  set by the Board for the gateway to open. Accordingly,  no amounts are payable under the FY24 STI Plan. 	 Further details of the FY24 STI Plan are provided in  Section 7 of the Report. 	 > Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Plan – The FY22 grant  reached the end of its three-year performance period on  30 June 2024. The Award was tested against the Absolute  Total Shareholder Compound Annual Growth Rate (ATSR  CAGR) measure, and on testing the plan did not vest and  all performance rights lapsed. Following the AGM in November 2023, performance rights  under the FY24 LTI Plan were granted to the former MD &  CEO and other Executive KMP. Any vesting of these awards  is to be assessed equally against Relative Total Shareholder  Return (RTSR) against a peer group and Earnings Per Share  (EPS) Growth, over a three-year performance period. Further details of the FY24 LTI Plan are provided in Section 7  of the Report. There were no other material changes to the remuneration  framework during FY24. Remuneration Report Message from the Remuneration & Nomination Committee Chairman 48 Remuneration Report  Seven West Media Limited Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 52 ===== Changes to Key Management Personnel and Non-Executive Directors 	 > J Warburton, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, left the Group effective 18 April 2024; 	 > J Howard was appointed Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, of the Group effective 19 April 2024; 	 > BI McWilliam, Commercial Director, left the Group effective 7 April 2024; 	 > D Evans, Non-Executive Director, retired on 9 November 2023. With the appointment of J Howard as Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer effective 19 April 2024, Craig Haskins  was appointed as Acting Chief Financial Officer. Due to the interim nature of this appointment Mr. Haskins is not reported  as an Executive KMP.  Outlook and Changes for FY25 Our Group’s Strategy will be focused on optimising our  television business and delivering on our digital future.  This will be enabled by a new operating model where the  Group will have three Divisions: Television, Digital and  Western Australia.  Fixed Remuneration Continuing our prudent approach to cost management, there  will be no increases in Fixed Remuneration for Executive  KMP or Base Fees for Non-Executive Directors in FY25. Changes to the FY25 Short Term Incentive (STI) plan From FY25, the STI will continue to be delivered as 50% cash  and 50% deferred shares that are restricted for 12 months  from date of vesting. However, to align to market practice  the deferred component will be no longer issued at the  commencement of the performance period. Instead, at the  end of the performance period should there be an outcome  under the STI, 50% will be delivered as cash and 50% will be  issued as deferred shares that are restricted for 12 months  from date of vesting. The number of deferred shares will be  determined by dividing 50% of the outcome by the volume  weighted average price (VWAP) over the 5 trading days  up to and including the start of the performance period  (30/06/2024). The VWAP date is set at the beginning  of the STI performance period to create shareholder  alignment over the incentive plans full operation.  Changes to the FY25 Long Term Incentive (LTI) plan From FY25, a third measure will be added into the LTI plan,  which will account for 30% of the LTI and will be assessed  against strategic measures. The intent of incorporating  this new measure into the LTI is to incentivise and reward  progress against the Group’s Transformation Strategy  which will enhance shareholder value over the long term.  The performance period for this measure will be three  years from 1 July 2024 to 30 June 2027 and in determining  any vesting, the Board will assess performance on an  aggregated level, across a group of quantitative measures,  which will be disclosed retrospectively given they are  commercially sensitive. The two existing measures – RTSR and EPS Growth –  will remain as the primary measures of the plan, both with  adjusted weightings of 35% each to accommodate the new  measure. In addition, to align to market practice and to  ensure the Group can continue to attract and retain talent,  the additional 12-month restriction on vesting following  the applicable performance period will be removed.  Further details will be set out in the FY25 Remuneration  Report.  Thank you for your ongoing support of Seven West Media.  I look forward to receiving your views and support at the  2024 Annual General Meeting.

Base remuneration  and superannuation are aimed at the  median of the market. STI rewards the achievement of  pre-determined, individual and Group  KPIs over the 12-month performance  period which are aligned to, and  supportive of the Group’s annual  strategic objectives. LTI rewards the achievement of  pre-determined Group objectives  over the 3-year performance period  which are aligned to and supportive  of the Group’s longer term strategic  objectives. Description Fixed remuneration is made up of  cash salary, non-monetary benefits  and employer contributions to  superannuation funds as well as  any ongoing employee benefits  on a salary-sacrificed basis. STI awards are delivered in cash  (50%) and deferred shares (50%).  Any restricted shares awarded at  the end of the performance period  are subject to a minimum 12-month  restriction period. LTI awards are delivered in  performance  rights, subject to  performance and service conditions.  The performance is tested once at the  end of the performance period.  Outcomes  reached  in FY24 With his appointment to MD and  CEO on 19 April 2024 J Howard’s  Fixed Remuneration was increased to  $1,250,000, with no changes made to  fixed remuneration for other executives  during FY24, except for superannuation  based on the statutory increase. The Group’s underlying Earnings  Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) result  for FY24 did not exceed the 90% EBIT  gateway, resulting in no outcome  under the FY24 STI plan. The FY22 LTI Plan did not meet  the minimum vesting threshold of its  Absolute Total Shareholder Return  Compound Annual Growth Rate  (ATSR CAGR) measure as tested at  the end of the performance period  (30 June 2024), resulting in all  performance rights being lapsed.

FY24 Remuneration Framework – Overview Seven’s Remuneration Framework and outcomes are strongly linked to the delivery of shareholder value over the short  and long-term. Executive remuneration is determined by the Remuneration and Nomination Committee and, for the  MD and CEO, is recommended to the Board for its approval. Executive remuneration comprises both a fixed component  and variable (or ‘at risk’) components which include STI and LTI elements. In structuring remuneration, the Board aims to find a balance between fixed remuneration and ‘at risk’ variable remuneration;  cash and deferred equity; and short and long-term rewards in line with the Group’s performance cycle.

Link between Remuneration Policy and Group Performance MD and CEO Performance Objectives  The Committee reviews and makes recommendations to the Board on performance objectives for the MD and CEO.  These objectives are intended to provide a clear link between remuneration outcomes and the key drivers of long-term  shareholder value. Group performance is linked to the STI Plan through the EBIT hurdle. The STI objectives are set in the form of a balanced  scorecard with targets and measures aligned to the Group’s strategic priorities cascaded from the MD and CEO scorecard  to the relevant Executive KMP scorecard. The key financial and non-financial objectives for the MD and CEO in the 2024  financial year, with commentary on key highlights, are provided in Section 8.1 of the Report. Group performance is linked to the LTI Plan through the ATSR CAGR target for the FY22 LTI and FY23 LTI plans and through  Relative Total Shareholder Return (RTSR) and Earnings per Share (EPS) Growth for the FY24 LTI Plan. Group Financial Performance – Five Year Perspective In FY24, the Remuneration Policy was linked to profit before significant items, net finance costs and tax (EBIT), and TSR  performance of the Group.

Remuneration Governance 6.1 Role of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee The Remuneration and Nomination Committee is the governing body for establishing, monitoring and reviewing the  Remuneration Framework for the Group. The primary objective of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee (the  Committee) is to assist the Board to fulfil its corporate governance and oversight responsibilities. The Committee seeks to  ensure that remuneration policies and structures are fair, competitive and are aligned with the long-term interests of the Group.  The Committee has a strong focus on the relationship between business performance, risk management and remuneration.

External consultants and advisors are engaged as needed to provide independent advice. The requirements for external  consultants’ services are assessed as needed in the context of remuneration matters that the Committee requires to address.  Recommendations provided by external consultants are used as a guide. During FY24, the Committee engaged Orient Capital to provide an independent valuation for the 2024 LTI award and to  independently calculate the FY22 LTI outcome noted in Section 8.2. In the course of providing this information, the Board is  satisfied Orient Capital did not make any remuneration recommendations relating to KMP as defined by the Corporations Act. The Committee and Board make their decisions independently, using the information provided and with careful regard to the  Group’s strategic objectives, risk appetite and the Seven West Media Remuneration Policy and principles. 7. Incentive Plans Overview 7.1 Short-Term Incentive (STI) Plan The STI Plan is an award used to provide clear motivation to focus on strategically aligned metrics and goals that are measured  annually. The award sets annual financial and non-financial measures that are aligned to the Group’s strategic objectives. Seven West Media FY24 STI Plan STI Opportunity For the MD and CEO, the ‘at target’ STI opportunity is 100% of fixed remuneration, with a maximum  amount of 150% for significant outperformance, determined subject to the Board’s discretion. To drive and incentivise significant outperformance, the CFO and other Executives have a maximum  STI opportunity of 125% of target, determined subject to the Board’s discretion. For the CFO and other executives, the ‘at target’ STI opportunity is 75% and 50% of fixed remuneration,  with maximum opportunity of 93.75% and 62.5% respectively. ‘At-target’ refers to the STI award opportunity for an Executive who achieves successful performance  against all KPIs and where 100% of the Group’s underlying EBIT target is achieved. EBIT is defined  as the Group’s profit before significant items, net finance costs and tax. Eligibility The STI Plan covers employees in executive and senior management positions, subject to remaining  employed on, or not having provided notice of termination before the award date. Delivery of Awards The STI plan delivers awards in the form of: 	 > 50% paid in cash at the end of the annual Performance and Remuneration Review (usually in the  August pay cycle after results have been released).  	 > 50% awarded as Performance Rights, designed to support an ownership culture and drive retention  outcomes.  The number of Performance Rights allocated to each participant was determined by dividing the  dollar amount of the STI award deferred component by the 5-trading day volume weighted average  price (VWAP) of the Group’s Share price leading into and including 30 June 2023 (the “Market Price”),  rounded down to the nearest whole number. At the end of each performance year, an assessment will be performed of the Group and individual’s  performance compared to Target metrics, to determine the amount of performance rights to vest into  restricted shares. Restricted shares are subject to a minimum 12-month restriction period. Executives have entitlements to dividends and voting rights in relation to their Restricted Shares during  the restriction period. No entitlements exist in relation to performance rights. Target Measures STI targets are set by the Committee and approved by the Board at the start of each performance year,  based on a range of factors including market performance and the responsibilities of each executive. 57 Review of Segments Governance Directors’ Report Financial Statements Risk Management, People and Sustainability Our Strategy Executive Letters Remuneration Report  ===== PAGE 61 ===== Seven West Media FY24 STI Plan Determination of the  STI Gateway The size of the STI pool is based on performance, based on the achievement of the Group’s underlying  EBIT target set by the Board at the beginning of the financial year. Dependent on the performance  against this target, the STI pool available will be as follows: Percentage of Group Underlying EBIT Achieved  (%) STI Award Pool Available  (% of On-Target) <90% 0% 90–94% 25% 95–99% 50% 100% 100% The Board retains discretion to not make an STI award available to participants where such payment  is regarded to be inconsistent with shareholders’ interests over the financial year, even if the gateway  requirement is achieved. Performance  Conditions Performance is measured against financial and non-financial measures which support the Group’s  strategy. Performance measures are set across Group, divisional and individual targets. Refer Section  8.1 for the FY24 MD and CEO’s balanced scorecard. Restricted shares recognise past performance and are not subject to further performance hurdles. Assessment of  Performance Outcomes STI outcomes are subject to both a quantitative and qualitative assessment. The Board has the capacity to adjust STI outcomes (and reduce STI outcomes to zero if appropriate)  in the assessment process. STI Treatment on  Cessation of Employment If the participant ceases employment before the end of the performance period by reasons other than  outlined below, unvested awards will automatically lapse. If the participant ceases employment before the end of the performance period by reason of death,  disablement, retirement, redundancy or for any other reason approved by the Board, unvested awards  remain on-foot, subject to original performance hurdles, although the Board may determine that some  or all of the awards should be forfeited. Determination of STI at an Individual Level At an individual level, STI is designed to focus Executives on key performance measures supporting the Group’s business  strategy and encourage the delivery of value for shareholders. Beginning of  Performance  Period Performance Objectives Set 	 > Individual objectives are agreed for Executive KMP, using a balanced scorecard approach under  the four categories of (i) Strategic; (ii) Financial; (iii) Audience and Content; and (iv) People,  Operations and Compliance. 	 > The weighting of each measure varies to reflect the responsibilities of an individual’s role. 	 > The measures relate to the contribution towards short to medium term performance outcomes  aligned to the Group’s strategic objectives. 	 > This methodology is replicated across the Group for all employees reflecting the individual’s  responsibilities. End of  Performance  Period Performance Assessed Against Objectives  	 > The performance of each Executive KMP is assessed against their objectives and compliance  standards. This assessment considers the performance of the Group, division and each  individual against these objectives. 	 > The Remuneration & Nomination Committee seeks input from the MD and CEO and CFO  (on financial performance, internal audit and compliance matters) to be factored into this  performance assessment. Determination of Remuneration Outcomes  	 > Where Executive KMP deliver on-target performance, then incentive award recommendations  are likely to be around target opportunity. Recommendations will be adjusted up or down in line  with performance. 	 > The Committee’s recommendations for the MD and CEO are then reviewed and ultimately  approved by the Board. 	 > The Committee approves the remuneration outcomes for other executives. Financial Year 58 Remuneration Report  Seven West Media Limited Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 62 ===== 7.2 Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Plan LTI rewards performance over the longer term and is designed to encourage sustained performance, drive long-term shareholder  value creation and ensure alignment of executive remuneration outcomes to shareholder interests. LTI awards are delivered in the  form of Performance Rights subject to Group performance hurdles and individual service conditions being met. Seven West Media FY24 LTI Plan LTI Plan  Vehicle  The grant is made in the form of Performance Rights. The Performance Rights are granted at no cost and each right  entitles the participant to one ordinary share in the Group, subject to the achievement of the performance hurdles and  service conditions outlined below. As Performance Rights are automatically exercised at vesting, no expiry date applies. Number of  Performance  Rights Granted For the MD and CEO, the value of the LTI allocated is 100% of fixed remuneration. For the CFO and other executives,  LTI is allocated at 75% and 25% of fixed remuneration respectively. The number of Performance Rights granted to each Executive is equivalent to the face value of the LTI grant divided  by an amount calculated based on the share price in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Plan. Performance  Hurdle  Performance Rights are subject to continued employment with SWM and two equally weighted performance  hurdles; Relative Total Shareholder Return and EPS Growth, measured over a three-year period (1 July 2023  to 30 June 2026).

A Threshold EPS target will be set each financial year over the LTI performance period. The Threshold EPS target is the aggregate total of the threshold EPS target for each financial year within the  three-year performance period. The maximum EPS target is the aggregate total of the threshold EPS target plus 5% for each financial year  within the three-year performance period. The annual threshold and maximum EPS targets will be disclosed in the annual report following the end of the  applicable year along with aggregate performance to date. FY24 LTI EPS Performance Year EPS Threshold EPS Maximum Performance  FY24 – Year 1 7.0 cents 7.3 cents 5.1 cents Testing of  Performance  Hurdle Awards are subject to a three-year performance period. Shortly after the completion of the performance period,  the performance hurdles are tested to determine whether, and to what extent, awards vest. In assessing performance against the performance hurdles, the Remuneration & Nomination Committee, in its  absolute discretion, may make any adjustments having regard to any matters that it considers relevant, including  adjusting for abnormal or unusual factors that are outside of management’s control. The LTI Plan does not permit re-testing. Any Performance Rights that do not vest following testing of performance  hurdles (i.e., at the end of the three-year performance period) will lapse. Any vested performance rights convert to restricted shares. Restricted shares are subject to a further minimum  12-month deferral period. Disposal  Restrictions on  Vested Shares There is a restriction imposed of the sale of shares acquired after vesting (to the extent the performance hurdles  are achieved) until the earliest of the following: 	 > The date the Executive ceases employment with Seven West Media (subject to approval by the Board); 	 > The one-year anniversary of the vesting date (or subsequent anniversaries (if elected by the Executive); or 	 > The Board determines that the restriction should be released.  Dividends and  Voting Rights Performance Rights do not carry any dividend or voting rights prior to vesting. Change  of Control Where there is a change of control, the Board may determine that some or all of the unvested performance rights  vest or lapse. Where an actual change of control occurs before the Board has exercised its discretion, all unvested  performance rights will vest on a pro rata basis having regard to the portion of the performance period that has elapsed. Cessation of  Employment If the participant ceases employment before the end of the performance period by reasons other than outlined  below, unvested awards will automatically lapse. If the participant ceases employment before the end of the performance period by reason of death, disablement,  retirement, redundancy or for any other reason approved by the Board, unvested awards remain on-foot, subject to  original performance hurdles, although the Board may determine that some or all of the awards should be forfeited. Hedging Under the Seven West Media Equity Incentive Plan Rules, Executives who are granted share-based payments,  such as Performance Rights under the LTI Plan, are prohibited from entering into other arrangements that limit  their exposure to losses that would result from share price decreases. 60 Remuneration Report  Seven West Media Limited Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 64 ===== 7.3 Performance Rights granted under FY24 STI and LTI Plans  In line with the STI and LTI plans outlined above, the dollar value and number of performance rights with respect to the FY24  plans, are detailed below.

FY24 Incentive Plans Outcomes 8.1 FY24 STI Outcomes Under the design of the STI Plan, a pool may be available for distribution where the Group’s EBIT threshold target is met as set  out in Section 7.1 of the Report. For FY24, the Group’s EBIT result of $150.7 million meant that the STI financial gateway did  not open. The STI framework provides a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) which are used to assess the quality of the outcomes  delivered against the Group’s financial and non-financial strategic goals. 61 Review of Segments Governance Directors’ Report Financial Statements Risk Management, People and Sustainability Our Strategy Executive Letters Remuneration Report  ===== PAGE 65 ===== The FY24 MD and CEO scorecard is as follows:  Strategic Pillar & Measure Weight Performance Against Scorecard Targets Outcome Strategic 	 > Deliver on content and cost agenda. 	 > Deliver essential projects to monetise  data and audience to rebuild and scale. 	 > Future proof content pipeline through  scale, diversification, and synergy. 20% 	 > National Ratings Leadership continued  in FY24, the fourth consecutive year  of ratings leadership. 	 > #1 ratings for Total People in CY2023. 	 > Purchased 19.9% stake in ARN. 	 > Share Buyback program completed.

The table below sets out the components of Non-Executive Director remuneration: 	 > Base Fee – This fee is paid as cash and is for service as a Non-Executive Director of the Seven West Media Board.  The base fee for the Chairman of the Board covers all responsibilities, including all Board Committees. 	 > Committee Fees – These additional fees are also paid as cash to other Non-Executive Directors for chairing  or participating in Board Committees. 	 > Employer Superannuation Contributions – This component reflects statutory superannuation contributions which are  capped at the superannuation maximum contributions base as prescribed under the Superannuation Guarantee legislation. To maintain independence and impartiality, NEDs fees are not linked to the Group’s performance or short-term results.  Likewise, NEDs are not eligible to participate in any of the Group’s performance-based remuneration arrangements. From 1 July 2022, NEDs can elect to salary sacrifice a portion of their fees to acquire shares in the Group. Any salary  sacrificed amounts will be used to purchase restricted shares twice a year, shortly following the announcement of the Group’s  half year and full year results in February and August respectively. On vesting, the Share Rights will convert into fully paid  ordinary shares subject to a disposal restriction (a Restricted Share). 11.1 NEDs Director Fees The fees for the year to 30 June 2024 are provided in the table below: Annual Remuneration Board Audit and Risk Committee Remuneration  and Nomination Committee Chairman $335,000 $40,182 $20,091 Member $135,614 $14,064 $10,045 11.1.1 Fee Pool The aggregate of all payments each year to NEDs must be no more than the amount approved by shareholders at the Annual  General Meeting (AGM). The current aggregate fee pool of $1.9 million, inclusive of employer superannuation contributions,  was approved at the 2013 AGM held on 13 November 2013. For the year ended 30 June 2024, $1.182 million (62%) of this fee  pool was used. 11.1.2 Changes to Board and Committee Composition At the 2023 AGM on 9 November 2023, D Evans retired from the Board and as a member of the Audit and Risk Committee and  member of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee.  66 Remuneration Report  Seven West Media Limited Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 70 ===== 11.2 NED Remuneration 11.2.1 Executive Remuneration in Detail (Statutory Disclosures) Details of the remuneration of the Group’s NEDs are as follows: Short-Term  Benefits Post-Employment  Benefits Name   Financial  Year Board  Fees1  $ Non-Monetary  Benefits $ Superannuation $ Total $ NEDs KM Stokes AC, Chairman 2024 307,601 – 27,399 335,000 2023 309,708 – 25,292 335,000 T Dyson 2024 158,374 – 17,421 175,795 2023 159,091 – 16,704 175,795 C Garnsey OAM 2024 140,274 – 15,430 155,704 2023 137,085 – 14,394 151,479 M Malone 2024 143,894 – 15,828 159,722 2023 140,711 – 14,775 155,486 RK Stokes AO 2024 145,659 – – 145,659 2023 145,000 – – 145,000 M Ziegelaar 2024 134,844 – 14,833 149,677 2023 135,455 – 14,222 149,677 Former NEDs D Evans 2024 54,791 – 6,027 60,818   2023 144,545 – 15,178 159,723 Total Non–Executive Director Fees 2024 1,085,437 – 96,938 1,182,375   2023 1,171,595 – 100,565 1,272,160 1	 Includes fees paid to the Chairman and members of Board Committees as well as salary sacrifice arrangements in respect of the NED plan.  11.2.2 Equity Holdings and Transaction of NEDs The number of ordinary shares in the Group held during the financial year by each NED held directly, indirectly, beneficially  and including their personally related entities, and restricted shares acquired through the NED share plan, are as follows:  Name Type of  Equity-Based  Instrument Number Held  at Start of  the Year Purchases /  NED Plan Shares Sales Closing Balance NEDs KM Stokes AC Ordinary Shares 621,453,734 –  –  621,453,734 Restricted Shares – 329,851 –  329,851 T Dyson Ordinary Shares 117,720 – – 117,720 Restricted Shares 42,303 116,414 – 158,717 C Garnsey OAM Ordinary Shares 425,000 – –  425,000 Restricted Shares 35,051 40,171 – 75,222 M Malone Ordinary Shares 273,000 – –  273,000 Restricted Shares 90,045 257,500 – 347,545 RK Stokes AO Ordinary Shares 240,466 – –  240,466 M Ziegelaar Ordinary Shares 10,000 – – 10,000 Restricted Shares 36,018 99,118 – 135,136 Former NEDs D Evans1 Ordinary Shares 1,397,803 – – 1,397,803 1	 The closing balance for D Evans is as at 9 November 2023, the date of his retirement. 67 Review of Segments Governance Directors’ Report Financial Statements Risk Management, People and Sustainability Our Strategy Executive Letters Remuneration Report  ===== PAGE 71 ===== I declare that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, in relation to the audit of Seven West Media Limited  for the financial year ended 30 June 2024 there have been: i. no contraventions of the auditor independence requirements as set out in the Corporations Act 2001  in relation to the audit; and ii. no contraventions of any applicable code of professional conduct in relation to the audit.

Revenue recognition is based on the delivery of performance  obligations and an assessment of when control is transferred to the customer. Revenue is recognised either when the performance  obligation in the contract has been performed (‘point in time’ recognition) or ‘over time’ as control of the performance obligation  is transferred to the customer. Customer contracts can have a wide variety of performance obligations, from production contracts to format licences and distribution  activities. For these contracts, each performance obligation is identified and evaluated. The Group needs to evaluate if a distribution right  is a right to access the content (revenue recognised over time) or represents a right to use the content (revenue recognised at a point in time).  The Group has determined that most distribution revenues are satisfied at a point in time due to their being limited ongoing involvement  by the Group in the use of the rights following its transfer to the customer. The transaction price, being the amount to which the Group expects to be entitled and has rights to under the contract is allocated to the  identified performance obligations. The transaction price will also include an estimate of any variable consideration where the Group’s  actual performance may impact the revenue to be recognised based on the achievement of agreed targets with the customer such as  audience targets. Variable consideration is not recognised until the performance obligations are met. Revenue is stated exclusive of GST and equivalent sales taxes. Revenue recognition criteria for the Group’s key classes of revenue are as follows: Class of revenue Recognition criteria Timing of recognition [A] Advertising 	 > Television Advertising is generated from selling spot airtime and  is recognised at the point of transmission 	 > Newspapers Advertising is generated from selling space in the  newspaper and is recognised at the point of publication. At the point in time when  the advertisement is  broadcast or published. [B] Circulation 	 > Circulation revenue is generated through the distribution and sale  of newspapers to third party consumers. Recognised on delivery  of the newspaper to the customer and the right to be compensated  has been obtained. At the time the  newspapers are  distributed. [C] Licencing of content and programming includes:  	 (i) Programme  production 	 > Revenue generated from the programmes produced for broadcasters  in Australia and internationally and is recognised at the point of  delivery of an episode and acceptance by the customer. At the point in time  when obligations have  been accepted by the  customers. 	 (ii) Distribution rights 	 > A licence is granted for the transmission of a programme in a stated  territory, media and period and revenue is recognised at the point  when the contract is signed, the content is available for download  and the licence period has started. Recognised on delivery  of rights to the customer. [D] Affiliate fees 	 > Affiliate fees earned through the transmission of network channels  in a stated territory. Recognised in the period of the broadcast feed  to the affiliates in line with the contract terms and conditions. Recognised over time  as conditions are met  over the contract life. [E] Rendering of services 	 > The revenue is recognised when the service has been performed.  These services mainly relate to printing and are generally delivered  over a period of time. At the point in time the  services are delivered. [F] Other revenue includes: 	 (i) Rental income 	 > Rental income is derived through the leasing of assets and the  benefits are to be transferred over time. Revenue is recognised  over the life of the lease. 	 (ii) Dividends 	 > Dividend revenue is recognised when the right to receive payment  is established.  At the point in time the  dividend is declared. 77 Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2024 Review of Segments Governance Directors’ Report Remuneration Report Risk Management, People and Sustainability Our Strategy Executive Letters Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 81 ===== 2.2 Revenue and Other Income (continued) REF 2024 $’000 2023 $’000 Sales revenue Advertising revenue [A]  1,215,783   1,299,304  Circulation revenue [B]  52,004   53,603  Licencing of content and programming [C]  82,658   77,367  Affiliate fees [D]  14,510   15,644  Rendering of services [E]  17,259   11,176  Other revenue [F]  31,487   30,162  Total sales revenue  1,413,701   1,487,256  Other income Dividends received  2,189  – Sundry income  34   101  Net gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment and investments  46   67  Total other income  2,269   168  Timing of Revenue Recognition The following table includes revenue from contracts per above that have been disaggregated by the timing of recognition: 2024 $’000 2023 $’000 Products or services transferred at a point in time  1,399,191   1,471,612  Products or services transferred over time   14,510   15,644  Total external revenue   1,413,701   1,487,256  78 Financial Statements  Seven West Media Limited Annual Report 2024 Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2024  ===== PAGE 82 ===== 2.3 Expenses Profit before tax includes the following specific expenses: REF 2024 $’000 2023 $’000 Depreciation and amortisation (excluding program rights amortisation)  [A]   (36,331)  (41,479) Advertising and marketing expenses  (23,477)  (29,102) Printing, selling and distribution (including newsprint and paper)  (30,883)  (31,364) Media content (including program rights amortisation)  [A] [B]   (636,827) (622,607) Employee benefits expense (excluding significant items)  [B]   (330,525)  (329,872) Raw materials and consumables used (excluding newsprint and paper)  (6,807)  (5,455) Repairs and maintenance  (23,849) (23,311) Licence fees  (31,923)  (30,819) Rental expense relating to operating leases  (2,828)  (3,021) Other expenses from ordinary activities (141,122)  (132,568) Total expenses (1,264,572)  (1,249,598) Included in the expenses above are the specific items [A] to [B] from continuing operations: [A]	 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment  (22,038)  (19,939) Depreciation of right of use assets  (7,794)  (8,958) Amortisation of intangible assets   (6,499)  (12,582) Total depreciation and amortisation  (36,331)  (41,479) Television program rights amortisation  (95,819)  (98,033) Total depreciation and amortisation (including program rights amortisation)  (132,150)  (139,512) The below disclosure includes amounts recognised as employee benefits expense and employee  benefits expenses incurred in the production of content which are recognised within media content: [B]	 Employee benefits expense (380,574) (382,869) Defined contribution superannuation expense (32,253)  (30,741) Total employee benefits expense (412,827)   (413,610) 79 Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2024 Review of Segments Governance Directors’ Report Remuneration Report Risk Management, People and Sustainability Our Strategy Executive Letters Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 83 ===== 2.4 Significant Items Profit before tax expense includes the following specific (expenses) benefits for which disclosure is relevant in explaining the financial  performance of the Group: REF 2024 $’000 2023 $’000 Net (costs) income related to investments  [A]  (17,340)  12,456  Major IT project implementation costs [B]  (19,307)  (21,511) Programming valuation adjustments [C] (14,947) – Restructuring costs [D] (10,183) – Net gain on change in lease terms [E]  14,466  – Settlement of dispute [F]  3,000  – Net gain on assets disposed [G] –  2,040  Total significant items before tax (44,311)  (7,015) Tax benefit 11,193  6,453  Net significant items after tax (33,118)  (562) [A]	 Net costs on investments relates to fair value losses recognised on the Group’s other financial assets during the period, primarily ARN.

Diluted earnings per share Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the figures  used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take  into account the after tax effect of interest and other financing  costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and  the weighted average number of additional ordinary shares  that would have been outstanding assuming the conversion  of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. Retrospective adjustments If the number of ordinary or potential ordinary shares outstanding  increases as a result of a capitalisation, bonus issue or share split,  or decreases as a result of a reverse share split, the calculation  of basic and diluted earnings per share for all periods presented  shall be adjusted retrospectively.

Trade receivables are generally settled  within 30-90 days and are non-interest bearing. The Group  provides goods and services to substantially all of its customers  on credit terms. The collectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing  basis. The Group has applied the expected credit loss model to  determine the allowance for expected credit loss. A provision for  impairment of trade receivables is used when there is objective  evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts  due according to the original terms of receivables. Debtors which  are known to be uncollectable are written off by reducing the  carrying amounts directly.  The amount of the impairment loss of receivables is recognised  in profit or loss in other expenses. Subsequent recoveries  of amounts previously written off are credited against other  expenses in profit or loss. Loans and other receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with  fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active  market. They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services  directly to a third party. They are included in current assets,  except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after  the reporting period which are classified as non-current assets.  Loans and receivables are carried at estimated future cash flow  and are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. 2024 $’000 2023 $’000 Current Trade receivables  237,828   243,943  Allowance for expected credit loss  (4,614)  (3,947) Provision for sales credits and returns  (12,983)  (21,668)  220,231   218,328  Other receivables  9,410   11,819  Total trade and other receivables  229,641   230,147  Movements in the allowance for expected credit loss are as follows: Balance at the beginning of the financial year  3,947   6,285  Net movement in allowance recognised during the year 835  (2,131) Amount utilised (168)  (207) Balance at the end of the financial year  4,614   3,947  Refer to Note 6.5 regarding information on the Group’s exposure to credit and market risks, and impairment losses for trade and other receivables.

The level of provision is assessed  by taking into account the recent sales experience, the ageing of receivables, historical collection rates and specific knowledge of the  individual debtor’s financial position. Estimates are used in determining the level of receivables that will not be collected. These estimates include factors such as historical  experience, the current state of the Australian economy and industry factors. 3.3 Program Rights and Inventories Accounting policy Program rights Program rights includes both purchased rights and produced  programs.	 Program rights are recognised at the earlier of when cash  payments are made or from the commencement of the rights  period of the contract. Television program rights are carried at the lower of cost less  amortisation and net recoverable amount. Cost comprises  acquisition of program rights and, for programs produced using  the Group’s facilities, direct labour and materials and directly  attributable fixed and variable overheads.	 The Group’s amortisation policy requires the amortisation of  purchased programs on a straight line basis over the expected  useful life. The useful life of purchased programs is assessed at least  annually. Produced programs are expensed when broadcast. Inventories Inventories, which includes newsprint, paper, finished goods,  raw material and work in progress, are measured at the lower  of acquisition cost, cost of manufacturing or net realisable value.  The net realisable value is the estimated achievable selling price  in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs through  to completion and the estimated necessary selling costs. 2024 $’000 2023 $’000 Current Television program rights – cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment  150,802   164,575  Newsprint and paper – at cost  10,960   12,340   161,762   176,915  Program rights and inventory expense Program rights and inventories recognised as an expense during the year ended 30 June 2024 amounted to $95,818,551 (June 2023:  $98,033,083) and $22,145,605 (June 2023: $20,961,725) respectively. Key judgements, estimates and assumptions The Group recognises program rights which are available for use. These are capitalised and amortised over the useful life of the content.  The assessment of the appropriate carrying value of these rights requires estimation by management of the forecast future cash flows  which will be derived from that content. This estimate is based on a combination of market conditions and the value generated from the  broadcast of comparable programs. 84 Financial Statements  Seven West Media Limited Annual Report 2024 Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2024  ===== PAGE 88 ===== 3.4 Trade and Other Payables Accounting policy Trade payables and accruals Trade and other payables represent liabilities for goods and  services provided to the Group prior to the end of financial year  which are unpaid.  The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30-60  days from the end of the month in which they are incurred and  may be interest bearing. Television program liabilities Television program liabilities are recognised from the  commencement of the rights period of the contract.

Cost is measured as the consideration and transaction  cost of the business combination minus the net fair value of  the acquired and identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent  liabilities. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at  cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Refer to Note 4.1.1  for further details on assessment of carrying value. Intangible Assets Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial  recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a  business combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition. Costs incurred for internally developed software and websites  are capitalised and amortised over the estimated useful life of the  software or website. Costs that relate to the design and ongoing  maintenance of the internally developed software and websites  are expensed as incurred.  Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) arrangements are service  contracts providing the Group with the right to access the  cloud provider’s application software over the contract period.  As such the Group does not receive a software intangible asset  at the contract commencement date. For SaaS arrangements,  the Group assesses if the contract will provide a resource that  it can ‘control’ to determine whether an intangible asset is  present. If the Group cannot determine control of the software,  the arrangement is deemed a service contract and any  implementation costs including costs to configure or customise  the cloud provider’s application software are recognised  as operating expenses when incurred. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost  less amortisation and any impairment losses. The useful lives  of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.  Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised on a straight line  basis over their useful life and tested for impairment whenever  there is an indication that they may be impaired. Intangible  assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually.  The amortisation period and method is reviewed at least annually.  A summary of the policies applied to the Group’s intangible assets is as follows: Useful life Amortisation method used Internally generated or acquired Goodwill Indefinite No amortisation Acquired Television licences Indefinite No amortisation Acquired The West mastheads Indefinite No amortisation Acquired Reacquired Rights Finite (1 – 2 years) Amortised on a straight line basis over its useful life Acquired Customer  Relationships Finite (2 – 9 years) Amortised on a straight line basis over its useful life Acquired Computer software Finite (3 – 7 years) Amortised on a straight line basis over its useful life Internally developed and acquired Section 4:  Other Key Balance Sheet Items  87 Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2024 Review of Segments Governance Directors’ Report Remuneration Report Risk Management, People and Sustainability Our Strategy Executive Letters Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 91 ===== 4.1 Intangible Assets (continued)  Licences   $’000    Mastheads   $’000   Computer  software   $’000   Goodwill   $’000  Re-acquired  Rights and  Customer  relationships   $’000  Total   $’000 Year ended 30 June 2024 Opening net book amount  670,277  –  7,747   30,254   6,523   714,801  Additions – –  9,796  – –  9,796  Amortisation charge  – –  (4,337) –  (2,162)  (6,499) Closing net book amount  670,277  –  13,206   30,254   4,361   718,098  Comprised of: Cost  2,300,000   119,555   82,412   1,266,337   19,725   3,788,029  Accumulated amortisation  and impairment  (1,629,723)  (119,555)  (69,206)  (1,236,083)  (15,364)  (3,069,931) Year ended 30 June 2023 Opening net book amount  670,277  –  8,163   27,398   14,439   720,277  Finalisation of business combinations – –  (39)  2,856   411   3,228  Additions – –  3,878  – –  3,878  Amortisation charge  – –  (4,255) –  (8,327)  (12,582) Closing net book amount  670,277  –  7,747   30,254   6,523   714,801  Comprised of: Cost  2,300,000   119,555   72,604   1,266,337   19,725   3,778,221  Accumulated amortisation  and impairment  (1,629,723)  (119,555)  (64,857)  (1,236,083)  (13,202)  (3,063,420) 88 Financial Statements  Seven West Media Limited Annual Report 2024 Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2024  ===== PAGE 92 ===== 4.1 Intangible Assets (continued) 4.1.1 Impairment of non-financial assets Accounting policy Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful  life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually  for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in  circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. Assets  are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately  identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the  cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (cash generating  units or CGUs). Other assets are reviewed for impairment whenever  events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying  amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised  for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its  recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an  asset’s fair value less cost to sell and its value in use.	 In calculating the recoverable value, the cash flows include  projections of cash inflows and outflows from continuing use  of the CGU’s assets. For value-in-use models, the cash flows are  estimated for the assets of the CGU in their current condition and  discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that  reflects the current market assessments of the risks specific to the  CGU. For fair value less cost to sell models, the recoverable amount  is defined as the price that would be received from selling the asset  less any costs required and needed to make the sale. Non-financial assets other than goodwill that have been impaired  previously are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment  at each reporting date. Impairment reversals are recognised to  the extent of any previous revaluation with any excess recognised  in the profit and loss. Key judgements, estimates and assumptions Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested annually to determine if they have been impaired in accordance with  the Group accounting policy. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use approach.  These calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions. Refer to 4.1.1B for details on assumptions used. 4.1.1A Allocation of goodwill and indefinite life assets Intangible assets with indefinite lives, including goodwill, are allocated to the Group’s CGUs, as follows Allocation of CGU Groups  Goodwill   $’000   Licences,  mastheads  $’000   Total   $’000  Year ended 30 June 2024 Television  30,254   670,277   700,531  The West1 – – – Other Business and New Ventures – – – Total goodwill and indefinite life assets  30,254   670,277   700,531  Year ended 30 June 2023 Television  30,254   670,277   700,531  The West – – – Other Business and New Ventures – – – Total goodwill and indefinite life assets  30,254   670,277   700,531  1 	 During the year, management have reassessed these CGUs and combined the West into one CGU for impairment testing purposes.

Key components of the recoverable value calculations and the  basis for each CGU are detailed below: (ii) Cash flows Year 1 cash flows are based upon budgets for the next 12 months.  Future cash flows are based on the following assumptions: Television 	 – The forecast advertising market growth rates are assumed  to be consistent with industry market participant expectations  and long-term industry growth rates. The National TV market  is expected to decline at low single digits and the BVOD market  is forecast to grow at double digit growth over the medium term. 	 – The Group’s share of the advertising market across all  platforms takes into account historical share performance, and  consideration of the impact of programming across the schedule. 	 – Expenses include the benefit of cost out programs enacted  during FY24. Future amounts are assumed to increase by CPI  and known fixed increases for specific program rights. The West 	 – Publishing revenue forecasts are management’s best estimates  using: current market data, industry forecasts and historical  actual rates, resulting in a mid single digit decline rate over the  medium term.  	 – Digital revenue assumptions are in line with industry forecasts  and management’s expectations of market development  resulting in a mid single digit growth rate over the medium term.  	 – Expenses are expected to increase by CPI, unless impacted by  committed cost reduction initiatives and volume assumptions.  (iii) Terminal growth factor A terminal growth factor that estimates the long term growth  for that CGU is applied to the year 5 cash flows into perpetuity.  These terminal growth rates do not exceed long term expected  industry growth rates. The terminal growth factor for each CGU  is detailed below. (iv) Discount rate The discount rate is an estimate of the pre-tax and post-tax  rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value  of money and the risks specific to the CGU. The terminal growth rate, pre-tax and post-tax discount rates applied to the CGU’s cash flow projections are detailed below: Terminal growth factor Discount rate (pre-tax) Discount rate (post-tax) Jun-24 Jun-23 Jun-24 Jun-23 Jun-24 Jun-23 Television 0.0% 0.0% 14.8% 14.6% 10.4% 10.0% The West  -0.5% -0.5% 15.0% 15.7% 10.5% 11.5% 4.1.1.C Impact of changes in key assumptions for the Television CGU The values assigned to the key assumptions represent management’s estimate of future performance based on historical experience and  internal and external sources. As at 30 June 2024, the recoverable amount of the Television CGU is consistent with its carrying amount.  As a result, the estimated recoverable amount is highly sensitive and any challenges in executing the Group’s strategic plan or adverse  changes in key revenue assumptions detailed above, which are not mitigated by actions taken by management, may result in a future  impairment loss. These actions include revenue initiatives, cost base reductions or a combination of these. 90 Financial Statements  Seven West Media Limited Annual Report 2024 Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2024  ===== PAGE 94 ===== 4.2 Property, Plant and Equipment Accounting policy Measurement of cost All property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and provision of impairment.  Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is  probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured  reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognised when replaced. All other repairs  and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred. Depreciation Asset class Useful life Depreciation method used Land Indefinite Not depreciated Buildings 40 years Straight line basis Leasehold improvements Finite Shorter of the life of the lease of each property or the life  of the asset Plant and equipment Printing presses and publishing equipment 15 years Straight line basis to allocate their cost, net of their residual  values, over their estimated useful lives Other plant and equipment 3-10 years Straight line basis to allocate their cost, net of their residual  values, over their estimated useful lives Impairment of assets The asset’s residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. An asset’s  carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated  recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount and these are  included in profit or loss. 91 Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2024 Review of Segments Governance Directors’ Report Remuneration Report Risk Management, People and Sustainability Our Strategy Executive Letters Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 95 ===== 4.2 Property, Plant and Equipment (continued) Freehold land  and buildings $’000 Leasehold  improvements $’000 Plant and equipment $’000 Total $’000 Year ended 30 June 2024 Opening net book value  21,571   39,426   62,218   123,215  Additions  76   2,961   12,235   15,272  Disposals –  –   (22)  (22) Depreciation charge  (1,214)  (8,911)  (11,913)  (22,038) Closing net book amount  20,433   33,476   62,518   116,427  Comprised of: Cost  30,305   58,461   423,920   512,686  Accumulated depreciation and impairment  (9,872)  (24,985)  (361,402)  (396,259) Year ended 30 June 2023 Opening net book value  28,868   32,302   52,659   113,829  Additions  (693)  17   (306)  (982) Net additions through business combinations   42   12,216   23,368   35,626  Disposals  (5,268)  (23)  (34)  (5,325) Depreciation charge  (1,378)  (5,086)  (13,475)  (19,939) Change due to movement in FX rates – –  6   6  Closing net book amount  21,571   39,426   62,218   123,215  Comprised of: Cost  30,229   55,500   411,930   497,659  Accumulated depreciation and impairment  (8,658)  (16,074)  (349,712)  (374,444) Key judgements, estimates and assumptions The estimation of useful life, residual value and depreciation methods require some judgement and are reviewed at least annually.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with carrying amount.  These are included in the income statement. 92 Financial Statements  Seven West Media Limited Annual Report 2024 Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2024  ===== PAGE 96 ===== 4.3 Leases Accounting policy The Group recognises a right of use asset and a lease liability  at the lease commencement date. Right of use assets are initially  measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease  liability adjusted for any incentives included and an estimate of  costs to dismantle. These assets are subsequently depreciated  under a straight line method from the commencement date to the  end of the lease term. The right of use assets are presented at cost  less accumulated depreciation and any impairments recognised.  At the inception, the lease liability is calculated as the present  value of the future lease payments, discounted using the Group’s  incremental borrowing. The lease liability balance will unwind as  lease payments are made. Lease liabilities due for payment in greater  than 12 months from reporting date are classified as non-current. When management’s assessment of the lease changes subsequent  to the commencement of a lease (change in duration or value), the  value of the right of use asset and lease liability will be remeasured  accordingly. Any adjustments to the right of use asset value at  cost will be presented as a remeasurement.  Short-term and low value leases The Group applies the short-term and low value lease exemptions in  accordance with AASB 16 and therefore does not recognise right of  use assets or lease liabilities on such leases. The payments for these  leases are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income  on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 4.3A Right of use assets The Group leases many assets including offices, equipment, transmission towers and satellites.

The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market  assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the passage  of time is recognised as interest expense. Provision Description and measurement of provision [A] Employee benefits Provision for employee benefits includes annual leave, long service leave and short term incentives. Short-term  employee benefits Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits and annual leave expected  to be settled within 12 months after the end of the reporting period in which the employee renders  the service. It is measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. Long-term  employee benefits Liability for long service leave which is not expected to be settled within 12 months after the end  of the period. It is measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services  provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures  and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the end of the  reporting period on corporate bond rates with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely  as possible, the estimated future cash flows. Short term incentives and  bonus plans A liability is recognised when there is an obligation to settle the liability and at least one of the  following conditions is met: 	 > there are formal terms in the plan for determining the amount of the benefit; or 	 > past practice gives clear evidence of the amount of the obligation. [B] Redundancy  and restructuring Redundancy and restructuring provision is recognised when it is demonstrably committed to either  terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without  possibility of withdrawal or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage  voluntary redundancy. It is payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement  date, or when an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. [C] Onerous Contracts Provision for onerous contracts represents contracts where, due to changes in market conditions,  the expected benefit is lower than the cost for which the Group is currently committed under the  terms of the contract. The minimum net obligation under the contract is provided for. The provision  is calculated as the net of the estimated economic benefit and the estimate of the committed cost  discounted to present values. [D] Make Good Provision Make good provision to restore the leased premises of its offices, studios and other premises to their  original condition at the end of the respective lease terms. A provision has been recognised for the  present value of the estimated expenditure required to remove any leasehold improvements.

The classification depends on the Group’s business model for  managing the financial asset as well as its contractual cash flow characteristics. Dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. 2024 $’000 2023 $’000 Movements in carrying amounts of other financial assets Carrying amount at the beginning of the period 79,441  39,571  Acquisitions 72,452  34,362  Net change in fair value of financial assets at fair value (36,024) 5,416  Disposals (6,973) – Foreign Currency revaluation  3  92  Carrying amount at the end of the year 108,899 79,441  Other financial assets represent equity investments in listed and unlisted entities comprising of ARN Media Limited, View Media Group  Limited, RAIZ Invest Limited, Open Money Group Pty Limited and a portfolio of other SWM Ventures. During the year, the Group acquired an investment in ARN Media Limited. The investment was acquired through a combination of direct  shares (14.9%) and a cash settled equity swap with Barrenjoey Markets Pty Limited relating to a further 5.0% interest. SWM has existing  and long-standing commercial partnerships with ARN Media Limited and has an interest in ensuring their continued and long-term success  via a direct investment. During the year, the Group has made the decision to dispose of the investments in CarBar Holdings Pty Ltd, MoneyMe Limited and Starts  at 60 Pty Limited. Acquisitions during the period were made using a mix of cash and contra advertising agreements. Refer to Note 3.1. Key judgements, estimates and assumptions The fair value of other financial assets that are measured through a Level 3 (significant unobservable inputs) approach under the  accounting standard AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement. The valuation technique used was based on the equity price established in the  most recent round of equity financing and consideration of any other key changes in the investment which requires a level of judgement. 95 Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2024 Review of Segments Governance Directors’ Report Remuneration Report Risk Management, People and Sustainability Our Strategy Executive Letters Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 99 ===== 5.1 Taxes Accounting policy Current taxes Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount  expected to be recovered from or paid to taxation authorities  at the tax rates and tax laws enacted or substantively enacted  by the balance sheet date. Deferred taxes Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised for  all deductible temporary differences, carried forward unused  tax losses, to the extent it is probable that taxable profit will  be available to utilise them or an outflow will be required  to settle the balance. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed  at balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no  longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available  to utilise them. The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences  that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects,  at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount  of its assets and liabilities. In making this assessment, the Group  considers the tax consequences of recovering assets and liabilities  through sale, use and subsequent sale or through use and then  abandonment or scrapping of the asset. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the  tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is  realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws  that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance  sheet date. Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences at  balance sheet date between accounting carrying amounts and  the tax bases of assets and liabilities, other than for the following: 	 > Where they arise from the initial recognition of an asset or  liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and  at the time of the transaction affects neither the accounting  profit nor taxable profit or loss. 	 > Where taxable temporary differences relate to investments  in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures: (i) 	 Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if the timing  of the reversal of the temporary differences can be  controlled and it is probable that the temporary  differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. (ii)	 Deferred tax assets are not recognised if it is not  probable that the temporary differences will reverse  in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will not  be available to utilise the temporary differences. Deferred tax liabilities are also not recognised on recognition  of goodwill. Income taxes relating to items recognised directly in equity  are recognised in equity and not in the income statement. Offsetting deferred tax balances Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset only if a  legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against  current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities  relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. Tax consolidation The Company and its wholly owned Australian resident entities  are part of a tax consolidated group. As a consequence, all  members of the tax consolidated group are taxed as a single  entity. The head entity within the tax consolidated group  is Seven West Media Limited. Current tax expense/income, deferred tax liabilities and deferred  tax assets arising from temporary differences of the members  of the tax-consolidated group are recognised in the separate  financial statements of the members of the tax-consolidated  group using the group allocation approach by reference to the  carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the separate financial  statements of each entity and the tax values applying under tax  consolidation. Any current tax liabilities (or assets) and deferred tax assets  arising from unused tax losses of the Company or its subsidiaries  are ultimately assumed by the head entity in the tax consolidated  group and are recognised as amounts payable/(receivable) to/ (from) other entities in the tax consolidated group in conjunction  with any tax funding arrangement amounts (refer below). Prime Media Group joined the tax consolidated Group of Seven  West Media Limited effective 31 December 2021. Nature of tax funding arrangements The head entity, in conjunction with other members of the tax- consolidated group, has entered into a tax funding arrangement  which sets out the funding obligations of members of the tax- consolidated group in respect of tax amounts. The tax funding  arrangements require payments to the head entity equal to the  current tax liability assumed by the head entity resulting in a  related party payable to the head entity equal in amount to the  current tax liability assumed. This related party balance is at call. Contributions to fund the current tax liabilities are payable  as per the tax funding arrangement and reflect the timing of  the head entity’s obligation to make payments for tax liabilities  to the relevant tax authorities. Any difference between the amounts assumed and amounts  receivable or payable under the tax funding agreement  are recognised as a contribution to (or distribution from)  wholly-owned tax consolidated entities.

Such changes to tax liabilities will impact tax expense in the period that such a determination is made.  97 Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2024 Review of Segments Governance Directors’ Report Remuneration Report Risk Management, People and Sustainability Our Strategy Executive Letters Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 101 ===== 5.2 Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities Deferred tax assets (liabilities) Year ended 30 June 2024 30 June 2023 $’000 Recognised in profit or loss $’000 Recognised  in other  comprehensive  income $’000 30 June 2024 $’000 The balance comprises temporary differences attributable to: Trade and other receivables 4,130  (1,963) – 2,167 Program rights and inventories (108,862) 13,414 – (95,448) Investments – 2,177 – 2,177  Intangible assets (195,922) 5,885 – (190,037) Property, plant and equipment 4,682  (1,451) – 3,231 Leases 38,517  (6,343) – 32,174 Trade and other payables (1,989) 149 – (1,840) Creditors 15,777  (3,517) – 12,260 Provisions 45,926  (10,520) (38) 35,368 Deferred income  816  (434) – 382 Transaction costs 442 (313) – 129 Other 695  (586) – 109 Net deferred tax (liabilities) assets (195,788) (3,502) (38) (199,328) Year ended 30 June 2023 25 June 2022 $’000 Deferred tax  balances  transferred  from Business  Combinations  $’000 Recognised in profit or  loss $’000 Recognised  in other  comprehensive  income $’000 30 June 2023 $’000 The balance comprises temporary differences attributable to: Trade and other receivables 5,147  – (1,017) – 4,130  Program rights and inventories (74,950) – (33,912) – (108,862) Investments 7,993  – (6,106) (1,887) – Intangible assets (198,046) (123) 2,247  – (195,922) Property, plant and equipment 11,918  (2,123) (5,113) – 4,682  Leases 38,079  – 438  – 38,517  Trade and other payables – – (1,989) – (1,989) Creditors 17,928  – (2,151) – 15,777  Provisions 56,648  – (10,800) 78  45,926  Deferred income  (5,635) – 6,451  – 816  Transaction costs 49  – 393  – 442  Other (4,391) – 5,086  – 695  Net deferred tax (liabilities) assets (145,260) (2,246) (46,473) (1,809) (195,788) 98 Financial Statements  Seven West Media Limited Annual Report 2024 Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2024  ===== PAGE 102 ===== 6.1 Borrowings Accounting policy Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised  cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognised in profit or loss over the  period of the borrowings. Any related accrued interest is included in trade payables and accruals. 2024 $’000 2023 $’000 Non-current Borrowings – secured   360,000   310,000  Unamortised refinancing costs   (4,107)  (3,166) Borrowings net of unamortised refinancing costs   355,893   306,834  6.1A Financial arrangements As at 30 June 2024, the Group had access to secured revolving syndicated facilities to a maximum of $525,000,000 (June 2023:  $600,000,000). The amount of these facilities undrawn at reporting date was $165,000,000 (June 2023: $290,000,000). In November 2023, the Group refinanced its syndicated debt facility for a further 4 years. The new facility has been downsized from  $600 million to $525 million, with funding costs being held at approximately 2.4% above BBSY, in line with the existing deal plus the  extra tenor. The covenants are consistent with the prior facility. In addition, the Group has access to a $11,399,000 (June 2023: $13,400,000) multi-option facility with Australia and New Zealand Banking  Group Limited. As at reporting date, $10,143,805 of this facility (June 2023: $11,244,606) was utilised for the provision of bank guarantees.  The Group also has access to a $20,000,000 (June 2023: $18,000,000) uncommitted trade facility for short-term working capital purposes.  As at reporting date, no amounts were utilised under this facility.   The facilities are subject to a weighted average interest rate of 6.85% at 30 June 2024 (June 2023: 6.53%). Fair value The carrying amount and fair value of Group borrowings at the end of the financial year was $360,000,000 (June 2023: $310,000,000). Risk exposures Information about the Group’s exposure to interest rate changes is provided in Note 6.5. 6.2 Share Capital Accounting policy Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the  proceeds. Ordinary shares are fully-paid and have no par value. They carry one vote per share and the right to dividends. They bear no special  terms or conditions affecting income or capital entitlements of the shareholders. 2024   $’000  2023   $’000  1,539,140,502 (June 2023: 1,553,571,241) Ordinary shares authorised and fully paid   3,414,102  3,417,968  Ordinary shares entitle the holder to participate in dividends and the proceeds on winding up the company in proportion to the number of and  amounts paid on the shares held. On a show of hands every holder of ordinary shares present at a meeting in person or by proxy, is entitled  to one vote, and upon a poll each share is entitled to one vote. In conjunction with the Group’s FY22 year end results announcement on 16 August 2022, an on-market share buy back of up to 10% of shares  on issue was announced. The Board has made the decision to cancel this program and determined it will not continue in FY25.

Of this amount, 14,430,739  ($3,866,000) have been bought back in the year to 30 June 2024 (30 June 2023: 36,546,998 shares ($14,998,000)). The shares bought back  were subsequently cancelled. As at 30 June 2024, a trust controlled by the Group (disclosed as ‘Reserve for own shares’ in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in  Equity) held 19,966,755 (June 2023: 34,926,146) ordinary shares in the Group. During the year, 14,959,391 shares were issued (June 2023:  50,351,431) out of the trust to employees and no shares were purchased by the trust (June 2023: 5,000,000 shares). Shares are held for the  purpose of allowing the Group to satisfy performance rights obligations of the Seven West Media’s employees and Executives Short Term  and Long Term Incentive Plans. 6.3 Dividends Accounting policy Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the entity,  on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of the reporting period. 6.3A Dividends  There were no dividends paid during the financial year (June 2023: nil). 6.3B Dividends not recognised at year end No final dividend has been declared in the current or prior year. 6.3C Franked dividends Franked dividends declared will be franked out of existing franking credits or out of franking credits arising from the receipt of franked  dividends and the payment of tax in the year ending 30 June 2024. 2024 2023 Franking credits available for subsequent financial years based on a tax rate of 30% (2023: 30%) 114,400 99,626 The above amounts represent the balance of the franking account as at the end of the financial year, adjusted for: (a) franking credits that will arise from the payment of the current tax liability or receivable; (b) franking debits that will arise from the payment of dividends recognised as a liability at the reporting date; and (c) franking credits that will arise from the receipt of dividends recognised as receivables at the reporting date. 6.4 Share-Based Payments Accounting policy Employees of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share based payments, whereby employees render services as consideration  for equity instruments. Share-based compensation benefits are provided to executives and employees in accordance with the Company’s share plan and  employment agreements. Equity-settled transactions The fair value of the rights granted is recognised as an employee benefit expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The total  amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the rights granted, which includes any market performance  conditions but excludes the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions and the impact of any non-vesting  conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of rights that are expected to vest. The total expense is  recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of  each period, the entity revises its estimate of the number of rights that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. 100 Financial Statements  Seven West Media Limited Annual Report 2024 Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2024  ===== PAGE 104 ===== 6.4 Share-Based Payments (continued) 6.4A Performance and share rights granted as compensation The total expense recognised for the LTI share-based payments for all plans during the financial year for the Group was $2.2 million (June 2023:  $3.0 million). The total expense for the STI share-based payments for all the plans during the financial year for the Group was nil (June 2023: nil). The accounting value of share-based payments may be negative where an executive’s share-based expense includes cumulative adjustments  for changes in non-market vesting conditions. Long Term Incentive Plans At 30 June 2024, performance rights that remain outstanding are from 2022, 2023 and 2024 Long Term Incentive Plans. The Group issued two tranches in 2024 for the long term incentive plan that entitles key management personnel to performance rights.  Holders of vested rights are entitled to fully paid ordinary shares in the Company. A total of 5,440,174 (2023: 5,498,382) performance rights were granted on 3 April 2024 (2023: 14 December 2022) and a further 450,885  (2023: 180,043) on 18 April 2024 (2023: April 2023) as an additional allocation on CEO transition. These performance rights will convert  to restricted shares if certain performance conditions are met. The performance period commenced on 1 July 2023 and ends on 30 June 2026  (2023: 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2025). The performance rights are allocated 50% each to two vesting conditions being: 	 > Relative TSR hurdle; and 	 > An EPS growth hurdle As well as an individual performance conditions. Performance rights do not carry any dividend or voting rights prior to vesting and are all equity settled. During the year, 22,135,415 rights for  LTI and STI plans vested and 21,592,297 rights lapsed, including the 2022 LTI plan and 2024 STI plan (2023: 11,334,213 rights for LTI and STI  plans vested and 15,218,767 rights lapsed, including the 2023 STI plan). 6.4B Valuation models and key assumptions used 2024 Long Term Incentive Plan – Initial Grant 2024 Long Term Incentive Plan – Top up Grant Grant date 3 April 2024 18 April 2024 Award type Performance Rights Performance Rights Vesting Conditions Relative TSR  EPS Relative TSR EPS Performance period 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2026 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2026 Vesting Date 29 August 2026 29 August 2026 Share price at grant date  $0.185   $0.185  $0.210   $0.210 Number of rights granted  2,720,087   2,720,087  225,443  225,443 Fair value at grant date  $0.039   $0.185  $0.058  $0.210 Volatility – Seven West Media 50% 50% 50% 50% Risk free interest rate 3.75% 3.75% 3.90% 3.90% Dividend yield 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% Valuation methodology Monte-Carlo  simulation Risk Neutral  Assumption Monte-Carlo  simulation Risk Neutral  Assumption Short Term Incentive Plans In FY24, the Company’s underlying EBIT result of $150.7 million did not open the financial gateway. Refer to the Remuneration Report  on pages 48 to 67 for further details. Key judgements, estimates and assumptions The Group measures the cost of equity transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of equity instruments at the date at  which they are granted. The fair value is determined by an external valuer using a valuation model. The most appropriate valuation model  used is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant. The estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs into  the valuation model including the expected life of the share options, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them. 101 Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2024 Review of Segments Governance Directors’ Report Remuneration Report Risk Management, People and Sustainability Our Strategy Executive Letters Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 105 ===== 6.5 Capital and Financial Risk Management 6.5A Accounting classifications and fair values The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities.

The carrying amount for financial assets and liabilities not included in this section are a reasonable approximate to their fair value. AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement  hierarchy: a.	 quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1). b.	 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly  (derived from prices) (level 2), and c.	 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (level 3). The following table shows the valuation techniques and measurement level inputs used to assess the fair value of financial assets and financial  liabilities at 30 June 2024 and 30 June 2023: Type Valuation Technique Measurement  Level 2024  $’000  2023  $’000  Other Financial Assets  – Listed Entities The fair value is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active  markets for identical assets or liabilities that can be accessed  at the measurement date.

This methodology included using: 	 > The issue prices in the most recent round of equity raising conducted by each company assuming this was in the last 12 months; 	 > Comparison of issue price movements to listed peers over the same period; and 	 > Consideration of the investment method and the Group’s current and forecasted valuation date. 102 Financial Statements  Seven West Media Limited Annual Report 2024 Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2024  ===== PAGE 106 ===== 6.5C Risk management framework The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks:  market risk (including interest rate risk), credit risk, capital risk  and liquidity risk.  The Group’s overall risk management program focuses on the  unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential  adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group.  The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge  certain foreign exchange risk exposures. Derivatives are exclusively  used for hedging purposes, i.e. not as trading or other speculative  instruments. The Group uses different methods to measure different  types of risk to which it is exposed. These methods include sensitivity  analysis in the case of interest rate and foreign exchange and aging  analysis for credit risk. 6.5C(i) Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or  counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual  obligations, and arises principally from credit exposures to  customers, cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial  instruments. The carrying amounts of financial assets represent the maximum  credit exposure. Trade receivables The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the  individual characteristics of each customer. However, management  also considers the factors that may influence the credit risk of  its customer base, including the default risk associated with the  industry in which customers operate. Each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness  before the Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and  conditions are offered. The Group’s review includes external ratings,  if they are available, financial statements, credit agency information  and industry information. Sale limits are established for each  customer and reviewed on a regular basis. In monitoring customer credit risk, customers are grouped  according to their credit characteristics, including whether they  are an individual or a legal entity, their industry, trading history  with the Group and existence of previous financial difficulties. An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date  using a provision range matrix to measure expected credit losses.  The percentage used will depend on the risk profile of the debtors  at the time and may vary year on year. The provision rates are based  on days past due for groupings of various customer segments.  The calculation reflects the probability-weighted outcome and  reasonable and supportable information that is available at the  reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts  of future economic conditions. Set out below is the information about the credit risk exposure on the Group’s trade receivables and contracts assets using a provision  range matrix.  Past due but not impaired Not past due < 30 days 31-90 days > 90 days Total $'000 Year ended 30 June 2024 Expected credit loss rate 1.1% 5.6% 32.9% 87.6% Estimated total gross carrying amount 226,075 7,790 3,357 606 237,828 Expected credit loss (2,540) (437) (1,106) (531) (4,614) Year ended 30 June 2023 Expected credit loss rate 0.9% 5.1% 30.2% 86.4% Estimated total gross carrying amount  234,500   5,618   3,273   552   243,943  Expected credit loss (2,196)  (286)  (988)  (477)  (3,947)  6.5C(ii) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Group is unable to meet its financial commitments as and when they fall due. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities  when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of  committed credit facilities. The Group manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flow and monitoring the  Group’s liquidity reserve on the basis of these cash flow forecasts. In addition, the Group had access to total debt funding under its revolving  syndicated debt facility equal to $525,000,000, refer to Note 6.1 for additional details on the Group’s borrowing activities for the year. Maturities of financial liabilities The table analyses the Group’s financial liabilities including interest to maturity into relevant groupings based on their contractual maturities. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted principal and interest cash flows and therefore may not agree with the  carrying amounts in the statement of financial position. For interest rate swaps the cash flows have been estimated using forward interest  rates applicable at the end of the reporting period. 103 Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2024 Review of Segments Governance Directors’ Report Remuneration Report Risk Management, People and Sustainability Our Strategy Executive Letters Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 107 ===== Less than  one year $’000 Between 1 and 5 years $’000 Total contractual  cash flows $’000 Carrying amount  – liabilities $’000 At 30 June 2024 Non-derivative financial liabilities Trade and other payables 170,052 5,208 175,260 184,219 Unsecured loans 24,665 418,182 442,847 355,893 Total financial liabilities 194,717 423,390 618,107 540,112 At 30 June 2023 Non-derivative financial liabilities Trade and other payables  203,846   4,019   207,865   210,245  Unsecured loans  20,310   316,604   336,914   306,834  Total financial liabilities  224,156   320,623   544,779   517,079  6.5C(iii) Market risk Market risk is defined as possible changes in market prices, such  as foreign exchange rates and interest rates that will affect the  fair value or future cash flows of the Group’s financial instruments.  The key components of market risks are: (a) Price risk Price risk refers to the risk of a decline in the value of a security  or a portfolio. The Group is not exposed to significant price risk. (b) Interest rate risk Interest rate risk refers to the risks that the value of a financial  instrument or its associated cash flows will fluctuate in response  to changes in market interest rates.  The Group’s main interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. As at the end of the reporting period the Group had the following  instruments: Variable rate instruments 2024 $’000 2023   $’000  Cash at bank, on hand and at call  54,534   57,402  Weighted average interest rate 4.70% 4.45% External borrowing facilities  360,000   310,000  Weighted average interest rate 6.85% 6.53% Net exposure to cash flow interest rate risk  305,466   252,598  The Group’s current receivables generally do not bear interest. Group sensitivity Based on the Group’s outstanding floating rate borrowings at 30 June 2024, a change in interest rates of +/-1% per annum with all other  variables remaining constant would impact equity and after tax profit by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant. Net Profit/(Loss) Net Equity 2024 $’000 2023 $’000 2024 $’000 2023 $’000 If interest rates were 1% higher with all other variables held constant: (Decrease)/increase (2,520)  (2,170) (2,520)  (2,170) If interest rates were 1% lower with all other variables held constant: Increase/(decrease) 2,520  2,170  2,520  2,170  (c) Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial  instrument or its associated cash flows will fluctuate due to changes  in foreign currency rates. The Group has transactional currency risk; such exposure arises from  sales or purchases by an operating unit in currencies other than the  unit’s measurement currency. It is the Group’s policy not to enter into  forward contracts until a firm commitment is in place. The terms of the  forward currency contracts have been negotiated to match the terms  of the commitments. Foreign currency contracts are used to reduce the  exposure to the foreign exchange risk. As at 30 June 2024, the Group  does not have any material cross-currency hedges.  As at the end of the reporting period, the Group had the following  exposure to foreign exchange risk: Based on the Group’s financial instruments held at 30 June 2024,  had the Australian dollar weakened/strengthened by 10% against  the US dollar, Euro, UK pound and New Zealand dollar, with all other  variables held constant, the Group’s equity and after tax profit for  the year would not have changed significantly. The analysis was  performed on the same basis as 2023 and ignores any impact of  forecasted sales and purchases. 104 Financial Statements  Seven West Media Limited Annual Report 2024 Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2024  ===== PAGE 108 ===== 7.1 Equity Accounted Investees 2024 $’000 2023 $’000  Non-current Investments in associates and jointly controlled entities  16,053   16,694  Accounting policy An associate is an entity, other than a subsidiary, over which  the Group has significant influence but not control. Significant  influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating  decisions of the entity with shareholding generally up to 50% of the  voting rights. A jointly controlled entity is an entity in which the Group holds  an interest under a contractual arrangement where the Group  and one or more other parties undertake an economic activity  that is subject to joint control. Measurement Interests in associates and jointly controlled entities are  accounted for using the equity method. They are initially  recognised at cost plus the investor’s share of retained post- acquisition profits, impairment and other changes in net assets,  until significant influence or joint control ceases. Dividends received or receivable from equity accounted  investees are recognised in the consolidated financial statements  as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses equals or exceeds its interest  in an equity accounted investee, including any other unsecured  long-term receivables, the Group does not recognise further  losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments  on behalf of the investee. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted  investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent  of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are  eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the  extent that there is no evidence of impairment. Impairment Equity accounted investees are tested for impairment annually  or when indicators of impairments exist.

Seven West Media Limited and its subsidiaries  together are referred to in this financial report as the “Group.” The consolidated entity controls an entity when it is exposed  to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with  the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its  power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from  the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are  deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains  on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.  Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction  provides evidence of the impairment of the asset transferred.  Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where  necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted  by the Group. Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries  are shown separately in the consolidated income statement,  statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes  in equity and statement of financial position respectively. The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities and results of the following subsidiaries in accordance with the  accounting policy described above.

Non-monetary items that are measured based on  historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange  rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency differences  are generally recognised in profit or loss and presented within  finance costs. Foreign currency differences are recognised in OCI and  accumulated in the translation reserve. Finance income and costs Interest income or expense is recognised using the effective  interest method. The ‘effective interest rate’ is the rate that exactly  discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the  expected life of the financial instrument to: 	 > the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or 	 > the amortised cost of the financial liability. In calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest  rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset or to the  amortised cost of the liability. Reserves (i) Equity compensation reserve The share based payments reserve is used to recognise the  expense, based on the grant date fair value of incentive shares  issued to eligible employees with performance related conditions. (ii) Reserve for own shares  Treasury shares are shares in Seven West Media Limited that are  held by the SWM Equity Incentive Plan Trust for the purpose of  purchasing shares that are then to be transferred to employees  under the Group’s Employee Share Scheme.  (iii) Foreign currency translation reserve Exchange differences arising on translation of the foreign  controlled entity are recognised in other comprehensive income  in a separate reserve within equity.  The cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss when the  net investment is disposed of.  (iv) Fair value reserve  Fair value reserve is used to recognise the valuation of the Groups  accounting for other investments as fair value through other  comprehensive income.  8.5 BEPS 2.0 Disclosure The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) introduced Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) Rules at the end  of 2021 and released technical guidance in March 2022 for a new global minimum tax framework (Pillar two). This framework aims to  ensure that multinational enterprises with a consolidated worldwide annual turnover exceeding €750 million will be subject to a minimum  15% effective tax rate, and also address the geographical allocation of profits for taxation. To provide transitional relief for Pillar Two tax compliance and administrative burden, the OECD has also introduced a framework for  Transitional Safe Harbours applicable to the Transitional Period covering financial years 2024 to 2026. Legislation on Pillar Two has been enacted in a country in Australia, as well as, Exposure Draft Pillar Two and Explanatory Materials which  have been released for consultation. The Group is continuing to evaluate how Pillar 2 rules will apply, however, based on an initial assessment, the SWM group does not expect  any material top-up tax adjustments during the transitional periods 2024 to 2026. Whilst it is unlikely that Pillar Two will give rise to additional temporary differences, in May 2023, the IASB issued an amendment to the IAS  12 Income Taxes standard. This amendment considers whether deferred tax assets and liabilities need to be remeasured and which tax rate  should be applied when calculating deferred tax. The amendment provides a temporary mandatory exemption from deferred tax accounting  related to Pillar Two. The SWM Group has applied the exemption in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended 2024 and until  further notice. 116 Financial Statements  Seven West Media Limited Annual Report 2024 Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2024  ===== PAGE 120 ===== Basis of Preparation The Consolidated Entity Disclosure Statement (CEDS) has been  prepared in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 and includes  required information for each entity that was part of the consolidated  entity as at the end of the financial year in accordance with AASB 10  Consolidated Financial Statements. The percentage of share capital held for bodies corporate included  in the statement represents the economic interest consolidated in  these consolidated financial statements either directly or indirectly. Determination of Tax Residency Section 295(3A) of the Corporations Act 2001 requires that the tax  residency of each entity which is included in the CEDS be disclosed.  In the context of each entity which was an Australian resident,  “Australian resident” has the meaning provided in the Income Tax  Assessment Act 1997. The determination of tax residency involved  judgement as the determination of tax residency is highly fact  dependent and there are currently several different interpretations  that could be adopted, and which could give rise to a different  conclusion on residency.  In determining tax residency, the consolidated entity has applied  the following interpretations:  	 > Australian tax residency 	 The consolidated entity has applied current legislation and  judicial precedent, including having regard to the Commissioner  of Taxation’s public guidance in Tax Ruling TR 2018/5. 	 > Foreign tax residency 	 The consolidated entity has applied current legislation and  where available judicial precedent in the determination of foreign  tax residency. Where necessary, the consolidated entity has  used independent tax advisers in foreign jurisdictions to assist  in its determination of tax residency to ensure applicable foreign  tax legislation has been complied with.  Branches (permanent establishments) Foreign branches of Australian subsidiaries are not separate level  entities and therefore do not have separate residency for Australian  tax purposes. Generally, the Australian subsidiary that the branch  is a part of will be the relevant tax resident, rather than the branch  operations.  Additional disclosures on the tax status of Australian subsidiaries  having a foreign branch with a taxable presence in that jurisdiction  have been provided where relevant.  FY24 Assessment The list of entities that make up the consolidated accounting group  is disclosed below and is consistent with Note 7.2 of Consolidated  Financial Statements. For tax purposes, all of these entities are body corporates, their tax  residency aligns to their place of incorporation and ownership interest  is at 100% except for Pacific Magazines Trust which is structured  as a Trust instead of a Body Corporate (noted as [A] below). Additionally, Seven Satellite Pty Limited (noted [B] below), an  Australian tax resident, has set up two permanent establishments  (branches) in the United Kingdom and United States of America.

In our opinion, the accompanying Financial Report  of the Company gives a true and fair view, including  of the Group’s financial position as at 30 June 2024  and of its financial performance for the year then  ended, in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001,  in compliance with Australian Accounting Standards  and the Corporations Regulations 2001. The Financial Report comprises: 	 > Consolidated statement of financial position  as at 30 June 2024 	 > Consolidated statement of profit or loss and other  comprehensive income, Consolidated statement  of changes in equity, and Consolidated statement  of cash flows for the year then ended 	 > Consolidated entity disclosure statement and  accompanying basis of preparation as at 30 June 2024 	 > Notes, including material accounting policies 	 > Directors’ Declaration. The Group consists of the Company and the entities  it controlled at the year end or from time to time during  the financial year. Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian  Auditing Standards. We believe that the audit evidence  we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide  a basis for our opinion. Our responsibilities under those standards are further  described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the  audit of the Financial Report section of our report.  We are independent of the Group in accordance with  the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements  of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards  Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional  Accountants (including Independence Standards)  (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the Financial  Report in Australia. We have fulfilled our other ethical  responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.  Key Audit Matters Key Audit Matters are those matters that, in our  professional judgement, were of most significance in  our audit of the Financial Report of the current period. This matter was addressed in the context of our audit  of the Financial Report as a whole, and in forming our  opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate  opinion on this matter.

The level of judgement required by us in evaluating the  Group’s forecast Television CGU cash flows was impacted  by the following conditions existing at 30 June 2024: 	 > The continued impact of macroeconomic factors,  changes in consumer viewing habits and use of  alternative viewing platforms on advertising markets  and resultant cash flows;  	 > Assumptions regarding future cost base, including  content investment and cost out programs enacted  during the financial year. The above factors create uncertainty in the key assumptions  used in the Television CGU value in use model increasing  the risk of inaccurate forecasts or a wider range of possible  outcomes for us to consider, specifically: 	 > Television advertising growth rates in free to air and  digital markets, in the short and medium term as well as  terminal growth rate assumptions; 	 > The Group’s share of the Television advertising in free  to air and digital markets;  	 > The content investment and cost management strategies;  and 	 > The discount rate. Our procedures included: 	 > Considering the appropriateness of the value in use  method applied by the Group to test the Television  Licenses for impairment against the requirements  of the accounting standards. 	 > Considering the underlying assumptions applied in  deriving future cash flows in the model by comparing  these to the Board approved budget, contracted future  content agreements and committed cost out programs. 	 > Challenging the short, medium and long-term forecasts  for television advertising market growth rates, including  consideration of the terminal growth rate, and the  Group’s share of the advertising market. We compared  the market share and growth rate assumptions against  historical actuals and third party perspectives on  industry outlook. 	 > Challenging the discount rate against publicly available  data of a group of comparable entities. This procedure  was performed with assistance from our valuation  specialist. 	 > Testing the mathematical accuracy of the model and  considering sensitivity analysis performed by the Group,  focusing on the areas in the model where a reasonably  possible change in assumptions could result in the  carrying amount of the CGU exceeding its recoverable  amount. 	 > Assessing the adequacy of disclosures in relation to  the valuation of the Television Licenses by comparing  these disclosures to our understanding obtained from  our testing and accounting standard requirements. 122 Financial Statements  Seven West Media Limited Annual Report 2024 Independent Auditor’s Report  ===== PAGE 126 ===== Other Information Other Information is financial and non-financial information in  Seven West Media Limited’s annual report which is provided  in addition to the Financial Report and the Auditor’s Report.

In connection with our audit of the Financial Report,  our responsibility is to read the Other Information.  In doing so, we consider whether the Other Information  is materially inconsistent with the Financial Report or our  knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears  to be materially misstated.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is  not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with  Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material  misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error. They are  considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they  could reasonably be expected to influence the economic  decisions of users taken on the basis of the Financial Report.

ABOUT THIS REPORT  Seven West Media’s Sustainability Report, first launched  in 2022, provides a comprehensive overview of our  sustainability activities in FY23.  We have structured our reporting around the four key  pillars of our sustainability strategy:  •	 Representing Australia  •	 Providing opportunities for future generations  •	 Uniting people and communities  •	 Bringing awareness to environmental issues  We have identified these focus areas as offering the best  and most meaningful positive outcomes for our people,  communities and the environment.  Alongside this, we provide further detail on key areas of  activity – such as our emissions reduction efforts, our key  partnerships, and the important causes we support with  the power of our platform by providing community service  announcement (CSA) airtime. Our sustainability strategy was developed based on an  in-depth process of consultation with key internal and  external stakeholders, and by assessing Seven West  Media’s long-term existing ESG initiatives.  As part of this process, Seven West Media adopted the  United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  as a framework to provide us with a clear path forward on  our sustainability journey.  Seven West Media supports the SDGs, which are  recognised as a key benchmark for progress on  sustainability matters.  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF COUNTRY  Seven West Media respectfully acknowledges the lands,  waterways and sky country – the traditional homelands of  our First Peoples.  From the Gadigal of Sydney, the Turrbal and Jagera of  Brisbane, the Kulin nations of Melbourne, the Noongar of Perth,  the Kaurna Peoples of Adelaide and everywhere in between.  We pay our heartfelt respects to the Traditional  Custodians of the land throughout Australia,  community Elders and the teachers who are sharing the  intergenerational knowledge and education as we work  side-by-side in a new era of interconnectedness.

This report is integral to how we approach our  business and defines how we use the power of our platforms to  inspire a better “us”.  At Seven West Media, we are committed  to making an impact across Australia by doing right by our  audiences, our clients, and our people. Seven West Media’s sustainability framework is built on the four  pillars of Representing Australia, providing Opportunities for  Future Generations, Uniting People and Communities, and  Bringing Awareness to Environmental Issues. By focusing on these areas, we believe we can have the most  impact – and we have made great progress over the past  12 months. Our sustainability framework and focus on the  four pillars has been warmly received by our stakeholders.  We are proud of our efforts to date, but we know this is a  marathon, not a sprint. As a leading and growing Australian media company, we  reach 19 million people every single month. Every day, every  week and every year, we drive positive change through our  community service announcement airtime that we donate  to important charitable causes; through our own direct  fundraising efforts and telethons; by informing millions of  Australians through our current affairs and news programs,  websites and newspapers; and through our own efforts to  reduce our impact on the environment. Over the past year we donated over $62 million in  community service announcement airtime, totalling over  750,000 impressions across Australia. The organisations we  support align with our ambitions to have an impact in our  sustainability focus areas. This includes raising awareness  for important environmental causes including Earth  Hour, The Great Reef Census and Clean Up Australia, or  providing opportunities for future generations by supporting  campaigns like the Children’s Cancer Institute and the  Gidget Foundation. We aim to unite people and communities  by supporting causes including the Biggest Morning Tea  and promote our efforts in Representing Australia through  supporting organisations including Be the Change and UN  Women Australia. Supporting local communities is an ongoing  priority for us. We bring trusted news and stories across  the furthest reaches of Australia and engage communities  through initiatives like the Perth 7NEWS Local Champions  Awards and the Community Achievement Awards. We also  look after our employees through initiatives like Mental  Health Month, SWM Wellness and resilience programs  across our organisation.  What we do every day becomes even more important in an  era of mis and dis-information. 7NEWS, The West Australian  and our other news products are trusted sources of information  which help underpin our democracy and unite the people and  communities in which we operate. Seven West Media was very proud to publish our inaugural  “Reflect” Reconciliation Action Plan in February 2023, an  important step in strengthening our relationship with First  Nations communities. As a media company, we understand  the impact we have on how Australia sees itself as a nation.  Representing Australia and our diversity and inclusion journey is  an important pillar for our people and our audiences. When it comes to young Australians, Seven West Media has  a long and proud tradition of supporting future generations.  This can be seen in our commitment to initiatives including the  Channel 7 Telethon Trust. It was exciting to see our Western  Australian Telethon reached new heights in 2022, with a record  fundraising total of just over $71 million during its 26-hour live  broadcast event – taking the total fundraising amount since  its inception in 1968 to over half a billion dollars. In Victoria,  our long-term partnership with the Royal Children’s Hospital in  Melbourne continues to thrive: this year’s Good Friday Appeal  raised $23 million to support the hospital in providing world- class care for the children who need it most. We are committed to progressing our sustainability journey.  Over the past 12 months we measured our emissions to gain an  understanding of our emissions level and profile.  Based on our modelling, our ambition is to reduce our scope  1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by over 50 per cent by  2030 through a combination of grid decarbonisation, building  consolidation and other reduction initiatives.  Our exciting new partnership with Planet Ark grew from our  sustainability strategy and the desire to use our platform for  the health of the environment. Through the partnership we are  raising awareness of the importance of effective recycling and  waste management. It was great to have Planet Ark co-CEO  Paul Klymenko provide information on National Recycling Week  and the benefits of recycling to our employees. In 2023 we will  also support Planet Ark’s National Tree Day initiative, Australia’s  largest community tree planting and nature care event. Reflecting on these pillars and our achievements over the past  year, I’m immensely proud of the progress Seven West  Media has made. We look forward to building on this  work and providing you with updates as  we continue this journey.  Regards, James Warburton Chief Executive Officer and  Managing Director 3  ===== PAGE 4 ===== “Us”is all of us Us as individuals     Us as communities Us as teams              Us as a nation Sustainability Framework  Seven West Media’s critical role in Australian society is  underpinned by our commitment to use the power of our  platforms to inspire a better “us”.  This guides our sustainability strategy and our efforts across each of the four pillars.  We do this by informing and uniting Australians each and every day, through our  unwavering commitment to the communities in which we operate, our support for  diversity and awareness, and by operating ethically and responsibly.  Us is all of us. It includes individuals, groups, communities, businesses, organisations,  the nation as a whole and our team at Seven West Media. We recognise as a media  company with a reach into almost every home in Australia that we have powerful  platforms that help shape who we are as Australians.  We aim to achieve a positive impact through our four sustainability pillars focused  on uniting people and communities; providing opportunities for future generations;  representing Australia by supporting diversity, equity and inclusion internally and  externally; and by being environmentally responsible and promoting important  environmental causes. As a trusted provider of news, information and entertainment, we bring people together  as we tell the nation’s stories. We connect Australia with quality content, fostering a  shared identity and belonging.  In short, we’re bringing all of us closer to the moments that move us.  4  ===== PAGE 5 ===== Material Issues  As we continue on our sustainability journey, we recognise the importance of focusing on the key issues that matter most to the groups that  drive our business: our employees; advertisers; partners; investors; audiences; and local communities.

The issues identified as most material to our business have guided the pillars  of our strategy as we continue to sharpen our long-term sustainability focus.  Social issues continue to be of utmost importance to our stakeholders, as  well as using our platform to support progress in key areas, like raising  awareness of environmental issues. Our most material sustainability issues span across social, environmental  and governance factors.  SOCIAL Stakeholders have high expectations of Seven  West Media in our sustainability journey,  particularly in relation to people and communities.  Community engagement, the importance of  diversity, equity and inclusion within our business,  and content representation are key priorities for  our stakeholders. ENVIRONMENTAL While social issues are of the highest priority,  stakeholders also highlight two critical  environmental aspects where we can make  an impact – in reducing our energy use and  greenhouse gas emissions, and in how we  leverage our platform to drive environmental  progress. GOVERNANCE The governance of our content, and data  security and privacy are essential aspects of our  responsibility as a leading media organisation.  Responsible broadcasting, characterised  by accurate and independent content and  responsible advertising, is also crucial. UNITED NATIONS’ SUSTAINABLE  DEVELOPMENT GOALS  The United Nations’ Sustainable Development  Goals (SDGs), endorsed by the United Nations  in 2015, provide a clear path for achieving  sustainable development globally. Seven West Media supports these goals  wholeheartedly, and we continue to reflect their  importance in how we progress towards our  sustainability targets and performance.  Our support is focused on the following  priority goals: Goal 3.  Ensure healthy lives and promote  well-being for all at all ages Goal 5. Achieve gender equality and empower  all women and girls  Goal 10. Reduce inequality within and among  countries Goal 12.  Ensure sustainable consumption and  production patterns Goal 16. Promote peaceful and inclusive societies  for sustainable development, provide  access to justice for all and build  effective, accountable, and inclusive  institutions at all levels 5  ===== PAGE 6 ===== Representing  Australia  •	 Published our inaugural ‘Reflect’  Reconciliation Action Plan  •	 Screen Diversity Inclusion Network  released its first report with the  preliminary data on diversity in the  Australian screen industry  •	 Named an Employer of Choice for  Gender Equality by the Workplace  Gender Equality Agency  •	 Joined the Diversity Council  Australia  •	 Launched a new recruitment policy to  improve diversity, equity and inclusion •	 Rolled out new  Respect@Work training  Future  Generations  •	 Awarded the second recipient of the  David Leckie Seven Scholarship  Program  •	 Launched a new Broadcast  Technician and Operations  Trainee Program •	 Progressed our partnership with  The Careers Department  •	 The Channel 7 Western Australian  Telethon raised more than  $71 million to support sick,  disadvantaged and vulnerable  children •	 The Good Friday Appeal raised  more than $23 million for the Royal  Children’s Hospital in Melbourne •	 The Channel 7 Children’s Research  Foundation (CRF) in South Australia  awarded 1.5 million in research grants Uniting People  and Communities  •	 Supported Big Freeze 9, which raised  $2.3 million for the fight against Motor  Neuron disease   •	 Partnered with Drought Angels to  provide relief to farmers impacted by  natural disasters  •	 Provided more than $62 million in  Community Service Announcement  (CSA) support to more than 140  organisations  •	 Official media partner for  White Ribbon Day 2023 •	 Supported a range of initiatives and  fund-raising events across regional  Australia to encourage community  resilience, building and investment.

One of the highest impact ways to achieve  our sustainability purpose is through the ongoing support we provide to charitable causes and other organisations across Australia  via Community Service Announcement (CSA) airtime.  Our platforms reach 19 million people every month, and  through this reach we can assist charitable organisations,  raise important funds, draw attention to important issues,  and promote vital community initiatives. Seven West Media donates tens of millions of dollars  of airtime to CSAs annually for charities and community  groups through the Seven Network. We also provide  advertising and other support through The West Australian  and our other publications.  In the last financial year, we provided CSA support  with a value of more than $62 million to more than  140 organisations across the nation.  Our CSA support during FY23 spanned a wide range of  important issues – helping charitable causes and other  organisations to raise funds, promoting the availability of  important services and providing education on important  environmental and social issues.  These campaigns included:  LIFE BE IN IT   Life Be In It is one of Australia’s most well-known health  campaigns which encourages us to get out and get  active for a healthier, happier life. Issues with obesity  and the need for more exercise among Australians have  never occupied more of the news than they have recently  - whether the issue being discussed is heart health,  diabetes, cardiovascular disease or mental health, the  most common advice is to get out and walk more! Created  in the 1970s, many Australians remember the original  public health campaign fondly, and now it’s back after  COVID lockdowns to help remind us to get up, get out and  get active! R U OK? R U OK? is a national charity inspiring and empowering  everyone to meaningfully connect and lend support to  the people in their world who may be struggling with life.  R U OK? Day is their national day of action in September  each year.  In 2022, the top conversation barrier for Australians to  ask their loved ones R U OK? was that they thought it was  a conversation for an expert.  R U OK? set out to remind  all Australians that they have what it takes to ask the  question and have the conversation, with their R U OK?  Day campaign: “Ask R U OK? No qualifications needed.”  Seven West Media provided CSA airtime to R U OK? as  part of this important campaign.  Following R U OK? Day, a nationally representative  survey (Kantar, October 2022) found that 92 per cent of  respondents agreed that they feel more confident they  have the knowledge and skills to know when and how to  ask, ‘are you OK?’ and how to keep the conversation going  when someone says they’re not OK. 7  ===== PAGE 8 ===== Community Service Announcements  BACKPACK BED FOR HOMELESS  Backpack Bed for Homeless is a national charity that  saves lives by providing Backpack Beds and Fire  Retardant Sleeping Bags to homeless people without  shelter. Over 120,000 Aussies will be homeless today  and over 45,800 people will sleep on our streets without  shelter this year. The Backpack Bed looks like a backpack  and rolls out to a waterproof and fire retardant bed with a  mattress - improving dignity, self-esteem, health, sleep,  comfort and safety for people on the street. It is fire  retardant and meets 47 standards for quality and safety. Backpack Beds are 100% funded by public donations.  To drive public awareness and support their fundraising,  marketing and production companies in Melbourne helped  Backpack Bed for Homeless to produce a television spot,  which was then aired by Seven West Media to generate  more support for this vital community-funded cause. BREAST CANCER TRIALS 2023  AUSTRALIAN WOMEN’S HEALTH DIARY For 25 years, Breast Cancer Trials has produced the  Australian Women’s Health Diary, a fundraising initiative  to raise funds for clinical trials research for the treatment,  prevention and cure of breast cancer. This research is  critical to ensure every person gets the personalised  treatment they need to cure them of their breast  cancer, forever. This year Seven West Media ran a campaign calling on  viewers to purchase the Australian Women’s Health Diary,  which was available at newsagents and participating Post  Offices and Woolworths stores. The 2023 edition raised  almost $900,000 to support breast cancer research. More than  $62 million  of community service airtime totalling over  766,341 impressions  was donated to over  140 causes in FY23 * In FY22-23, across all Seven Network markets and channels 8  ===== PAGE 9 ===== Reconciliation Action Plan In 2023, Seven West Media published its inaugural ‘Reflect’ Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP).  Endorsed by Reconciliation Australia, Seven West Media’s  first Reflect RAP has been developed to strengthen Seven  West Media’s relationship with First Nations communities,  embed reconciliation throughout the business and provide  Seven West Media with meaningful accountability. It sets  out a long-term framework that will contribute positively  to the pursuit of reconciliation, as well as empower and  educate those within Seven West Media about issues that  continue to face First Nations Peoples. As one of Australia’s most prominent media companies  and home to Australia’s most-watched television network,  Seven West Media plays a vital role in entertaining and  informing millions of Australians with diverse content,  providing us with numerous and unique opportunities to  contribute to reconciliation between First Nations Peoples  and non-Indigenous Australians. In our journey towards reconciliation, we will increase  our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander procurement,  create Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employment  strategies, develop internal policies that enable our  people to volunteer time to participate in First Nations  Peoples’ charities and community work, and provide  tools, resources and activities to help our people better  understand, celebrate and empower First Nations Peoples.  Seven West Media is committed to increasing employment  opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  Peoples in our company. While the current number of  First Nations Peoples employed at Seven West Media is  unknown, we will undertake measures to better capture  this information in the future. As part of this RAP, Seven West Media has established its  first Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander external advisory  board to provide guidance, support, cultural knowledge  and advice throughout our reconciliation journey. Additionally, as part of our efforts to mark National  Reconciliation Week in 2023, The West Australian  published its second and now annual dual Noongar- English front cover of Marawar Boodjara (The West  Australian). This edition was also co-edited by Indigenous  leaders Colleen Hayward and Clinton Wolf.  Alongside this, Seven West Media held an internal  staff event during National Reconciliation Week  focusing on cultural awareness, unconscious bias and  Acknowledgement of Country. Access plan here. Our bilingual edition of Marawar Boodjara / The West Australian for  National Reconciliation Week 2023 9  ===== PAGE 10 ===== The artwork which appears on the front of the inaugural RAP, and  now hangs proudly at the Seven West Media office in Sydney, is titled  “Niina Marni” and  was inspired by Seven West Media’s connection to  the communities we operate  in – from the small regional towns in  heartland Australia to the largest metropolitan cities.  The illustration by Brian James Devonshire depicts the different Australian states by  their floral emblems, which themselves represent the beauty and diversity of all our  native flowers and their value to sustaining Australia’s unique ecosystems.  The artwork portrays the violet-blue Royal Bluebell wildflower alongside the iconic  waratah flower, the common heath flower, Sturt’s desert pea flower, Sturt’s desert  rose, the Tasmanian blue gum and the red and green kangaroo paw. At the centre  of the artwork, connecting the lands is the Rainbow Serpent, which in Aboriginal  society represents one of the great and powerful forces of nature and spirit.  Describing the artwork, Brian said: “The Rainbow Serpent of life meanders through  the regional communities of the states and territories of our Australia. The artwork  is also inspired by Seven West Media’s inclusiveness of LGBTQIA+ across the  organisation, so I took the opportunity to incorporate non-traditional shades in  the piece and use more contemporary colours. Artist Brian James Devonshire with RAP art piece “Niina Marni” Reconciliation Action Plan 10  ===== PAGE 11 ===== Case Study: Planet Ark PLANET ARK AND NATIONAL RECYCLING WEEK The heart of our sustainability efforts is to use the power of  our platform to inspire a better us and this was brought to  life in our new and exciting partnership with environmental  leaders Planet Ark. Utilising the reach of our platforms to  raise awareness for environmental issues across Australia  is a priority for us at Seven West Media. In 2022, we  sought out an organisation making a meaningful difference  in this space in order to elevate their message: this process  led to our media partnership with Planet Ark. Planet Ark is a leading behaviour change organisation  focused on helping people, business and government  reduce their impact on the environment. In November  2022, we were proud to serve as Planet Ark’s official  media partner for National Recycling Week, which focuses  on actionable changes Australians can make in their own  lives to improve outcomes for the planet. The focus for National Recycling Week in 2022 was  exploring the idea that ‘Waste isn’t Waste until it’s  Wasted’ and encouraging Australians to get involved by  performing at least one recycling activity that they might  not have previously to show how simple measures can  improve one’s environmental impact.   We were hugely proud of the impact we were able to have  by elevating this important national campaign – the media  reach of the campaign improved by 58 per cent, with  social reach improving by 20 per cent.  United by shared values around supporting environmental  initiatives (on both sides of the screen), our partnership  allowed us to amplify Planet Ark’s vital campaigns, and  we look forward to making National Recycling Week even  bigger and better in 2023. HELPING TO HAVE GREATER IMPACT: National Recycling Week 2022 included: •	 325,074 students involved at schools across  the country •	 3.7 million people reached on social media •	 2 weeks of national television coverage •	 162 registered events •	 19,281 people involved through their workplaces –  and counting!

This combination leads to improved outcomes for both our stakeholders and our business. INTERNAL DIVERSITY AND RECONCILIATION SUPPORT  As an organisation that aims to speak to all Australians,  diversity and inclusion is at the heart of Seven West Media.  Reconciliation is an essential aspect of how we better  ensure we are representing Australia. In 2023, we  published our inaugural ‘Reflect’ Reconciliation Action  Plan. Endorsed by Reconciliation Australia, Seven  West Media’s first Reflect RAP has been developed to  strengthen Seven West Media’s relationship with First  Nations communities, embed reconciliation throughout the  business and provide Seven West Media with meaningful  accountability. It sets out a long-term framework that will  contribute positively to the pursuit of reconciliation, as well  as empower and educate those within Seven West Media  about issues that continue to face First Nations Peoples. As part of this effort, Seven West Media partners with  the National Indigenous Times (NIT), a 100% Indigenous- owned news media organisation for Indigenous affairs, to  better raise awareness for the issues that affect Aboriginal  and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. Millions of Australians  read their monthly publication across the country. The  West Australian provides pro-bono production services to  NIT, including the use of facilities as well as layout, design  and printing services. On gender equality, Seven West Media is proud to have  been named an Employer of Choice for Gender Equality by  the Workplace Gender Equality Agency for 2022-2024.  At Seven West Media 47 per cent of management roles  are held by women. We are excited to announce we have  reached our gender diversity targets, and Seven West  Media is now in the process of gathering broader data  with a view to setting ourselves additional Diversity, Equity  and Inclusion targets. The company celebrated International Women’s Day in  2023 as an official media partner of UN Women, our third  year of this important partnership, hosting five key UN  Women events for internal staff across our locations  in Australia.  Seven West Media also celebrated LGBTQIA+ Pride,  continuing our support for diversity in both our workplace  and the wider community. Channel 7 and PerthNow  returned as official media partners of the 2022 Pride  Parade and Festival, and held Pride celebrations across  our locations.  Pride month celebrations at Seven West Media We continue to run internal training programs  focused on important issues related to diversity, equity  and inclusion. In FY23, Seven West Media conducted  compulsory modules on cultural awareness, diversity and  inclusion, and workplace discrimination and harassment –  including a module on Respect@Work. We also reflect these values in our policies. We have  reviewed and updated our recruitment policy to address  flexible working options, to make hiring panels more  diverse to support inclusive recruitment processes, and  to focus on First Nations Peoples in line with our RAP.  We are also now using a ‘job decoder’ tool to avoid  gendered coding of job listings.   12  ===== PAGE 13 ===== Representing Australia  PARTNERING WITH INDUSTRY TO DRIVE CHANGE Seven West Media’s membership to meaningful  organisations is another important element of representing  Australia, and we are proud to be part of the Screen  Diversity Inclusion Network (SDIN), the UN  Unstereotype Alliance and Media Diversity Australia.  As part of the SDIN, Seven West Media is participating  in the ‘The Everyone Project’ to benchmark and track the  diversity of the Australian screen industry. In October 2022  SDIN released the inaugural ‘The Everyone Project’ survey,  which measures diversity on and off screen in Australia’s  TV and film industry. This report covers data from a number  of Seven West Media’s productions, including through our  production partners and our own productions.  We are also excited to have joined the Diversity Council  Australia in 2023, an independent not-for-profit peak  body leading diversity and inclusion in the workplace. REPRESENTING DIVERSITY ON-SCREEN Seven West Media reflects Australia’s diversity through  our news, entertainment and sport content, supporting  how Australians perceive themselves and their country.  Our content is constantly evolving to be more diverse and  inclusive, aligning with our Australian audiences from all  backgrounds.  Producing quality Australian content is critical and has  far-reaching impacts beyond the number of people who  watch and engage with it each day. Seven West Media is  proud to have more than 70 per cent Australian content on  our primary channels.   Quality Australian content enriches the social fabric  of Australia. It informs voters. It holds the powerful to  account. It tells stories. It provides employment. It promotes  Australian tourism. It promotes important environmental and  social causes. It unites Australian communities.  In our role as the nation’s leading broadcaster, Seven  West Media is committed to helping guide positive social  change by representing Australia’s diversity on-screen.  Some examples of how we are reflecting our diverse nation  on screen include:  2023 Australian Idol winner Royston Sagigi-Baira Australian Idol, one of Australia’s best-loved singing  competitions returned to our screens in 2023 and  it continues to represent a diverse cross-section of  Australian society. The 2023 Australian Idol winner  Royston Sagigi-Baira, a 24-year-old queer Thanakwith  and Wagadagam man, has spoken about the importance  of representation and said he hadn’t really seen someone  who looked or lived like him on television before1.  •	 Sydney Weekender, Seven West Media’s Sydney  and NSW-focused travel show, includes the  Acknowledgment of Country and First Nations names  for places visited in every episode, as well as featuring  a special NAIDOC episode ahead of NAIDOC week.  One of our presenters, Luke Carrol, is a proud First  Nations man from the Wiradjuri nation.   •	 Seven West Media is proud to be the broadcast partner  for the AFL and AFLW, and our long-term partnership  with the AFL includes important events such as the AFL  Indigenous Round, the AFL ANZAC Round and the AFL  Sir Doug Nicholls Round. •	 Seven Network was also proud to be the official  Australian media partner for the XXII Commonwealth  Games in Birmingham, the most inclusive and diverse  event in world sport. This Commonwealth Games had a  fully-integrated competition schedule; and the Games  saw more women competing for medals than men.

We allocate substantial resources to projects across Australia, focusing on children’s health, medical research, and career and mentoring  opportunities. Our aim is to create a better future for younger Australians, making a meaningful impact on their wellbeing. CHILDREN’S HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESEARCH  Seven West Media, in partnership with the Channel  7 Telethon Trust, runs the annual Western Australian  Telethon. In 2022, the Telethon raised an incredible  $71,356,721 during its 26-hour live broadcast event –  taking the total fundraising amount since its inception in  1968 to over half a billion dollars!  Funds raised for the Channel 7 Telethon Trust have  supported medical research into children’s diseases, and  provided equipment, critical services and life-changing  opportunities for sick, disadvantaged and vulnerable  children. The Telethon ‘Leeuwin Lunch’ in May 2023 raised  a further $5 million.  In Victoria we support the Good Friday Appeal, a  long-term partnership with the Royal Children’s Hospital  in Melbourne and The Herald Sun. The 2023 annual  Good Friday Appeal helped raise a record-breaking  $23,061,320 for The Royal Children’s Hospital.  These funds will support it in continuing to provide world- class care to children and pursuing ground-breaking  research as one of the world’s leading children’s hospitals. In South Australia, the Channel 7 Children’s Research  Foundation (CRF) awards annual grants of around  $1.5 million to organisations carrying out children’s  medical research.  The Channel 7 CRF, an independent not-for-profit  organisation dedicated to enriching the lives of children,  was established in 1976 with proceeds from Christmas  Telethon Appeals.  Throughout the Foundation’s 46 years, organisations  including Flinders University, SA Pathology, University of  South Australia, The University of Adelaide, SAHMRI, The  Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Novita, and the Women’s and  Children’s Health Network have accessed over $45 million  (in today’s dollars) of CRF funding for more than 1,000  children’s research projects. Seven West Media also supports Sydney’s Annual Sick  Kids Appeal, using our platform to help in raising vital funds  for Sydney’s network of world-leading Children’s hospitals  and services, so sick kids across the state receive the best  possible care, when and where they need it. In 2022 we also continued to support Ronald McDonald  House Charities through their biggest fundraiser -  McHappy Day. This annual event is staged to help to  raise much-needed funds for the families of sick children  - many of whom live a distance from their nearest hospital.  Seven West Media supported McHappy Day, providing  Community Service Announcement airtime to promote  this important cause. Our team also volunteered at stores  across Queensland on the day. MENTORING AND SUPPORTING FUTURE CAREERS  Seven West Media also runs mentoring and scholarship  programs to support careers in the media industry. This year, Seven West Media was thrilled to announce  Nuwan Ranasinghe as the second recipient of the David  Leckie Seven Scholarship Program, following the success  of inaugural recipient, Madeline McKeown, who has  secured a full-time producer position at Weekend Sunrise.  Established in 2021, the annual program honours the legacy  of the late David Leckie, former Seven West Media Chief  Executive Officer, by offering a 12-month scholarship role at  Seven West Media for a graduate with a passion for sales,  programming or news. It was set up in partnership with Skye  Leckie and David and Skye’s sons, Harry and Ben. 2021 David Leckie scholar Madeline McKeown and  2022 David Leckie scholar Nuwan Ranasinghe 14  ===== PAGE 15 ===== Future Generations  In 2022, Seven West Media also launched a new  Broadcast Technician and Operations Trainee  program to recruit and train new and diverse talent in the  broadcast operations team by providing six successful  candidates with two-year paid contracts that combine  TAFE study with mentoring and hands-on training. The  program will provide the next generation of highly-skilled  technicians and operators with the opportunity for real  experience in a world-class environment.

The partnership saw Seven West Media support The  Careers Department’s 2022/2023 National Schools’ Tour  and face-to-face workshops in over 100 metropolitan,  regional and remote schools, as well as virtual work  experience competition.  7NEWS and Sunrise reporters, including Sam Mac, have  also created bespoke video content that will give students  a behind-the-scenes look at life working in the television  industry, and examples of pathways to these roles. Seven team creating content to inspire students with a behind the scenes look at the media industry 15  ===== PAGE 16 ===== Case Study: Telethons THE CHANNEL 7 TELETHON AND GOOD  FRIDAY APPEAL The Channel 7 Telethon in Western Australia and the  Good Friday Appeal in Victoria are two of Seven West  Media’s most successful fundraising initiatives, attracting  vital support for future generations of Australians. TELETHON – WESTERN AUSTRALIA Seven West Media, in collaboration with the Channel  7 Telethon Trust, actively contributes to the success  of Telethon in Western Australia. In 2022, Telethon  achieved a remarkable $71,356,721. This achievement  was celebrated during a 26-hour live broadcast event,  further solidifying Telethon’s legacy as a philanthropic  powerhouse since its inception in 1968, with a cumulative  fundraising total exceeding half a billion dollars! Funds raised for the Channel 7 Telethon Trust have supported  medical research into children’s diseases, and provided  equipment, critical services and life-changing opportunities  for sick, disadvantaged and vulnerable children. The Telethon  ‘Leeuwin Lunch’ in May 2023 raised a further $5 million. OUR IMPACT In 2022, Telethon-funded grants directly impacted: 112,158 children 94,416 parents 1,178 schools 68,499 families Source: Grant reporting received from Telethon beneficiaries between  01/12/2022 – 28/02/2023 This year, we also celebrated some incredible milestones  with our Telethon beneficiaries, including 10 years  supporting Constable Care, 20 years supporting Camp  Quality and Therapy Focus, and 40 years with Telethon  Speech & Hearing.  This event is made possible by the immense efforts of our  volunteers, consisting of both our staff and other helpers  from the community. In 2022, we were supported by more  than 1,300 volunteers! GOOD FRIDAY APPEAL – VICTORIA  In Victoria, we support the Good Friday Appeal, a  decades-long partnership with the Royal Children’s  Hospital in Melbourne and the Herald Sun.  The Royal Children’s Hospital delivers world class care to  thousands of patients and their families every year. The  vital funds raised from the Good Friday Appeal support  people most in need, including through ground-breaking  research that aims to provide a better future for kids in  Australia and around the world.  In 2023, the Good Friday Appeal helped raise a record- breaking $23,061,320 for The Royal Children’s Hospital,  and Seven West Media looks forward to continuing this  exceptional partnership in the years ahead.

We are proud to be a part of the fabric that brings our communities together and cultivates the spirit of Australia. SUPPORTING LOCAL COMMUNITY GROUPS  We are locals in the communities in which we operate, and  we are committed to supporting these communities and  giving back. This includes initiatives to engage communities, such as  Perth Local Champions award. 7NEWS, together with  RAC Insurance, call on the community to tell us about the  volunteers, the carers and the selfless unsung heroes that  quietly dedicate their time to helping the lives of others so  we can give them the recognition they deserve. Over 10  weeks, 7NEWS then tells the stories of Local Champions  who were nominated by fellow community members. More  than 2,000 volunteers were nominated for awards this year  – more than three times as were nominated in previous  years. A total of $15,500 in prize money is awarded across  eight categories, with a major prize of $5,000 to the  overall winner. The 7NEWS commitment to telling stories that connect  with community is at the heart of the partnership with  Awards Australia, which runs both the Young Achiever  and Community Achievement Awards nationally.  As the naming rights partner of both awards, the aim is  to encourage, acknowledge and reward the valuable  contributions individuals, communities and businesses  are making throughout metropolitan and regional  communities. The partnership allows our 7NEWS presenters time  within the community, presenting and officiating awards  ceremonies, and offers staff the opportunity to be part of  expert judging panels and awards events. By telling the  stories of our inspiring Australians, the awards showcase  and celebrate the courage and endeavour of everyday  people, to make a difference and a contribution.  Seven West Media is also using the power of our platforms  to support community initiatives helping those impacted by  natural disasters. In 2022, Seven Network’s Farmer Wants  A Wife partnered with Drought Angels, a Queensland- based rural support charity, to help provide financial  assistance and relief to primary producers across Australia  impacted by drought and natural disasters. Drought Angels  was featured prominently in an episode of the show centred  around Farmer Paige, a first-generation sheep and cattle  farmer from New South Wales, taking part in a community  fundraising event for Drought Angels. As part of Farmer  Wants A Wife’s commitment to Australian farmers and  communities, Seven West Media also delivered additional  support to Drought Angels through the creation of a free  television commercial that ran on Channel 7 and 7plus.   Farmer Paige from our partner episode with Drought Angels supporting  rural communities THE BIG FREEZE  The annual Big Freeze event raises funds for Fight Motor  Neurone Disease through the Big Freeze – including via  the walk, the celebrity slide and the sale of its iconic blue  beanies. FightMND is driving real change, and has been  able to invest over $69.3M over the past nine years in  research that is beginning to show real promise.  The Big Freeze 9 in 2023 raised a total of $2.3 million  on the day, surpassing the goal of $2 million. Seven  West Media is proud to be a long-term supporter for  this important cause as a media partner, hosting a live  broadcast of the event across our platforms. 17  ===== PAGE 18 ===== Uniting People and Communities SUPPORTING VULNERABLE MEMBERS  OF THE COMMUNITY  Seven West Media is also committed to helping those  most vulnerable in our community, and we are proud to  be the media partner for White Ribbon Day 2023. White  Ribbon Day, also known as the International Day for the  Eradication of Violence against Women (held on  25 November), is an annual day to raise awareness of  family violence.  Seven West Media was also a sponsor for the annual  dinner for the Women’s Resilience Centre, which works  to bridge the gap in services between short-term crisis  care and longer-term recovery for women who have  experienced or witnessed domestic abuse and trauma.  Seven West Media also volunteered for and participated  in the Walk for the Women’s and Girls’ Emergency  Centre to raise funds to support women and families  in crisis.  Internally, Seven West Media provides support and paid  leave for any employees experiencing domestic or family  violence issues, and has improved the benefits available  to employees dealing with domestic or family violence  issues by upgrading our employee assistance program to  a provider that offers additional services.  MENTAL HEALTH AND COMMUNITY WELFARE Internally, we have programs in place for mental  health, risk management, and wellness initiatives. Our  comprehensive framework includes training, events,  and initiatives to support mental health, such as SWM  Wellness, RU OK Day?, Mental Health Month, and  campaigns on gender-based violence and financial stress.  Resilience programs are delivered across the organisation,  particularly for news and broadcast teams. For our team,  we also have a ‘Wellness Wednesdays’ program in which  there is a wellness topic or activity each week; and we  have launched a partnership with the Calm smartphone  application to provide our employees with mental health,  mindfulness and sleep support.  IN THE COMMUNITY  We are proud to support Australia’s artistic and cultural  institutions – Seven West Media is a strategic partner to the  National Gallery of Australia and provides support to Art  Exhibitions Australia and Perth Fringe as a media partner.  Seven West Media is also bringing us all closer to local  community sports from across the nation, with West  Australian Newspaper’s launch of community sports  platform Streamer.  Streamer aims to be a ‘home of community sport’, not  just a streaming website, but where grass roots sporting  clubs and players can get the exposure and funding  they need to be successful, sustainable and to have an  impact in their community. Streamer brings awareness to  these sporting clubs and facilitates public and corporate  donations to support local community sports. Seven West Media is also proud to sponsor local sports  in the communities in which we operate, such as the  local AFL in Albury. We are proud of our work bringing cheer to Australians  during the holiday season. Seven West Media’s Channel  7 Perth has owned and managed the much-loved Perth  Christmas Pageant for more than 50 years, and we are the  official broadcast partner of the Woolworths Carols in the  Domain. We also broadcast local holiday events, such as  the City of Gold Coast’s Mayor’s Christmas Carols and  the Mildura Carols by Candlelight.  18 Streamer, home of  community sport in  Western Australia  ===== PAGE 19 ===== Uniting People and Communities PROVIDING TRUSTED NEWS AND INFORMATION  FOR COMMUNITIES Seven West Media, through 7NEWS, Sunrise, and The  West Australian, delivers the latest trusted news and  information to metropolitan and regional communities.  We keep them informed about national, state, territory  and local happenings, contributing to a well-functioning  democracy. We are continuing to invest in providing high  quality news with our new state of the art facility at  Media City in Sydney. We provide news across the nation, with 55 news bulletins  across 20 regional markets, creating almost 24 hours of  news material every weekday. DUBBO CHANNEL 7 NEWS  Hamish Southwell and Russell ‘Rusty’ Kinsey are the reporter and camera operator team for Dubbo news Channel 7 –  bringing the stories of Dubbo and the surrounding regions to the rest of Australia and beyond!  Local reporter Hamish says for the team, it’s about flying the flag in communities large and small. “Getting out to the  smaller communities that don’t always get a say is so important. We’re like a community noticeboard – the central service  where people get their information from. In these tight-knit communities, the smaller issues can mean so much more.”  Rusty, behind the camera, has been a staple of Dubbo news for over 40 years, and says it all comes down to fostering  trust. “People are our business. We never want to be just a camera in anyone’s face – it’s about connecting as  people, to tell the stories that need to be told.”  Sometimes, a story connects with the local community to help them come together for a great cause – like  improvements to the local school bus service for a mum raising four kids in difficult circumstances further out of town.  Other times, it’s a story that travels a long way – like breaking stories about opal mining developments in  Lightning Ridge that are followed closely by people and businesses across Europe.  “With Seven West Media as the only  full-time TV network out in this part  of the country, and with so many  stories to be told, we’re so grateful  to be able to tell them. Some of the  stories we’ve covered, you could  write several books on!”  For Hamish and Rusty, uniting  people and communities is at  the core of what they do, and  the Channel 7 Dubbo news team  is proud to use their platform to  inspire a better “us.” Russell ‘Rusty’ Kinsey Hamish Southwell 19  ===== PAGE 20 ===== Bringing Awareness to  Environmental Issues At Seven West Media, we recognise the power of our platforms to raise environmental awareness and shed light on crucial environmental  issues. We consider it our responsibility to collaborate with organisations that prioritise sustainability and conservation. Seven West Media is  also committed to reducing the environmental impact of our business activities on the communities and the environment in which we operate. RAISING AWARENESS  As Australia’s most watched network, we recognise that  one of the most effective ways for us to drive positive  environmental outcomes is to use the power of our platforms.  One of our key sustainability partners is Planet Ark, a  leading environmental behaviour change organisation  focused on making a difference here in Australia.  We were proud to serve as Planet Ark’s official media  partner for its National Recycling Week program in 2022,  and we are continuing our work alongside this important  organisation in 2023.  Planet Ark’s work focuses on making positive environmental  actions accessible to all. National Recycling Week, one  of the organisation’s flagship national campaigns, aims  to build trust in recycling practices and promote good  recycling habits among Australians. United by shared values around supporting  environmental initiatives (on both sides of the screen), our  partnership allowed us to amplify Planet Ark’s important  work with the National Recycling Week campaign. REDUCING OUR IMPACT  Over the past 12 months we measured our emissions to gain  an understanding of our emissions level and profile. We now  have a comprehensive view of our scope 1 and 2 emissions.  Our scope 1 emissions are largely comprised of diesel and  petrol for transport including for our news teams, as well  as natural gas and refrigerant.  Our scope 2 emissions, which make up 92% of our  emissions, are from electricity consumption. We were pleased to find that since 2016 we have reduced  our scope 1 and 2 emissions by almost 27per cent.1  Our FY22 emissions footprint falls under the NGER  reporting threshold.  Figure 1 FY22 Having established the FY22 baseline for our scope 1 and  2 emissions, we engaged climate risk and energy transition  consultants Energetics to evaluate and quantify our future  reduction plans.  Based on their calculations and modelling our ambition is  to reduce our scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by  over 50 per cent by FY2030 through a combination of grid  decarbonisation, building consolidation and other reduction  initiatives including the introduction of LED lighting. Figure 2 FY22  emissions  25,073 tCO2e,  Electricity use (scope  2 emissions) makes up  92% of SWM’s emissions  profile. 1 Based on last NGER reporting audit.  Includes sustainability efforts and business reshaping 20  ===== PAGE 21 ===== Bringing Awareness to  Environmental Issues Additionally, we are actively committed to minimising  the environmental impact of our business operations on  both communities and the natural surroundings where we  operate. This includes:  IMPROVING THE SUSTAINABILITY OF OUR PRINTING Printed editions of our newspaper are important for  accessibility to news in many of the communities in which  we operate, particularly those in regional or remote areas.  We are mindful of the impact that newspaper production  has on our environment and aim to reduce the impact  of the physical copies of our newspapers. West  Australian Newspapers undertakes the following  sustainability initiatives:  •	 The paper used to print The West Australian, The  Sunday Times, regional and community titles is sourced  from a mix of recycled consumer product and certified  plantation forests. West Australian Newspapers also  ensures all paper used is sustainably sourced and not  from illegally logged timber. •	 The West Australian and The Sunday Times printed  waste measure has been further reduced from  4.9 per cent to 4.3 per cent. •	 Waste ink produced in Perth is collected and  reprocessed and plant wastewater is processed  and used for reticulation on site. ENERGY EFFICIENCIES MEASURES Electricity is the overwhelming majority of Seven West  Media’s energy use and emissions, including across our  offices and in our production studios. The consolidation  of our Sydney studio to Media City in Eveleigh and plans  for relocations to higher rated energy efficient buildings  will cumulatively save over 10,000 tCO2e from SWM’s  emissions portfolio from FY22 to FY30*. Reducing the energy consumption of our lighting is also  an important step in reducing our overall footprint. LEDs  have lower power consumption, and also have dimming  and sensor capabilities which enable further reductions  in energy use (this dimmer and sensor system can reduce  emissions from a light system by up to 80 per cent). To  date in Western Australia we have replaced more than a  third of our fluorescent light fittings with LEDs. Our recent  relocation of 7NEWS and Sunrise in Sydney saw their new  studio fitted with LED lighting therefore reducing our use of  both incandescent and fluorescent globes in lighting sets. IMPROVING PROCESSES FOR WASTE MANAGEMENT In an effort to raise awareness of the Planet Ark  partnership and promote better recycling practices,  we held a Sustainability SWM school hosted by  Larry Emdur where we had Planet Ark’s co-CEO Paul  Klymenko talk about recycling. Following this our CEO and  MD James Warburton joined Paul and Dr Trent Dickeson  our Director of Operations and Clare Gill our Chief  Regulatory and Sustainability Officer, for some recycling  Trivia to engage the organisation in this important  partnership and environment practice. Additionally, as part of our continued journey for  improvement on waste management, we continue a  national roll out of centralised, colour coded bins, allowing  staff to sort their own waste and removing the need for  plastic-lined bins at every workstation.

Our Board oversees our corporate policies, accessible on our company’s website.  Our Board has ultimate oversight of Seven West Media’s  sustainability strategy and efforts, which are reported  to the CEO and the Board from our Chief Sustainability  Officer and a cross-functional internal ESG committee  that meets monthly and manages the implementation of  this sustainability strategy.  Our core values – Be Brave, Better Together, and Make  it Happen – guide and shape this strategy. This strategy  is also guided by our materiality assessment, which  identified the key ESG issues impacting our customers,  communities, viewers, employees and other stakeholders.  Seven West Media is committed to refreshing this  assessment regularly.  Sustainability is deeply embedded in our business – we  work every day to represent Australia, unite people and  communities, create opportunities for future generations,  and drive environmental awareness.  Our Board continues to recognise the management of  financial and non-financial risk as an integral pillar to  Seven West Media’s operations. We constantly review  established policies and procedures to oversee and  manage material business risks, including cyber security,  customer and staff privacy and compliance. Outlined on the right is our approach to key sustainability  governance areas highlighted as material by our  stakeholders. DATA PRIVACY We integrate sound governing principles into all  corporate processes, particularly when handling personal  information and collected data.  We deploy secure and  encrypted cloud based technologies for housing and  movement of identifiable and de-identified datasets.   We have a senior Privacy Officer and a comprehensive  Privacy Policy that ensures our organisation is compliant  with the Australian Privacy Principles. Our aim is to handle  personal information responsibly, transparently and not  hold data without value exchange for our customers. As part of this commitment to protecting data privacy, we  have shared our views with the Federal Government as  part of the consultation on the new Privacy Act, including  the technical function of SaaS based Data Clean Room  solutions to ensure this meets the unique data protection  needs of our audiences.  CYBER SECURITY We continue to evolve our Cyber security program in  alignment with the current threat landscape. We recently  implemented enhanced password security checking  and changed our multifactor authentication to require  verification code checking. We have also invested in an AI based email filtering  technology, which has resulted in a significant reduction  of phishing email.  We are currently uplifting our security incident and event  monitoring system which gives us more visibility and insight  into our Cloud security posture. Awareness training remains key to maintaining security  vigilance, we continuously test phish proneness and  deliver video based training modules. Our program has strong support from the Executive  Committee and we report to the Board on a bi-monthly basis.  RESPONSIBLE ADVERTISING We recognise advertising’s impact on the community and  adhere to policies to ensure compliance with industry best  practice and legal requirements. Our scheduling teams ensure a balanced approach  between advertising and audience-loved content,  adhering to time limits in the Commercial Television  Industry Code of Practice. We provide comprehensive training to ensure suitable  advertising for young audiences, aired at appropriate times. All advertisements comply with the Australian Association  of National Advertisers (AANA)’s Code of Ethics, Food and  Beverages Advertising Code and Children’s Advertising  Code, as well as the ABAC Responsible Alcohol  Marketing Code. We recognise advertising’s impact on vulnerable  community members and through our partnership with  the Unstereotype Alliance we work to eliminate  harmful biases by aligning our marketing activities  with their policies and objectives. 22  ===== PAGE 23 ===== Sustainability Governance EDITORIAL AND CONTENT GUIDELINES Australia’s free-to-air broadcasters are regulated under  the Commercial Television Code of Practice. The Code is  a result of extensive consultation with advisory bodies,  community interest groups, and the general public. It  aims to balance the widely varied and often conflicting  interests of these groups in the regulation of free-to-air  broadcasting. Our commercial television programs  comply with licence conditions, Australian Communications  and Media Authority standards, and industry codes  of practice.  Seven West Media has proudly partnered with Free TV in  the development and rolling out of an interactive online  Code of Practice training module. This training was rolled  out to all Seven West Media’s news, sales, commercial  inventory, and classification teams in early May 2023. This  module has formed an essential component of ensuring  Seven West Media’s news, sales, commercial inventory,  and classification teams are equipped to maintain our  corporate culture of compliance and the highest standards  of commercial television broadcasting throughout our  organisation. West Australian Newspapers follows an editorial policy  and a code of conduct, assessed by the Independent  Media Council in the case of complaints. CODE OF CONDUCT AND COMPANY POLICIES The Board has adopted a Code of Conduct for directors,  guiding their ethical conduct, conflict of interest  disclosure, and management.  Employees also follow a Code of Conduct, setting  ethical principles for business conduct with customers,  employees, and stakeholders.  Material breaches are reported to the Board. We have  implemented additional policies and procedures to  maintain integrity, including Continuous Disclosure, Share  Trading, Procurement, Diversity Equity and Inclusion,  Whistleblower, Fraud, Anti-Bribery and Corruption, and  Modern Slavery policies. EMPLOYEE WELLNESS AND ENGAGEMENT Our team’s safety, wellbeing, and engagement are vital  to our business. We prioritise a positive health and safety  culture, injury prevention, and risk mitigation through high  workplace standards.  We have programs in place for mental health, risk  management, and wellness initiatives. Our comprehensive  framework includes training, events, and initiatives to  support mental health, such as SWM Wellness, RU OK  Day?, Mental Health Month, and campaigns on gender- based violence and financial stress.  Resilience programs are delivered across the organisation,  particularly for news and broadcast teams.  We have also improved the benefits available to  employees dealing with domestic or family violence issues,  by upgrading our employee assistance program to a  provider that also offers a counselling arm and speciality  services, including legal support.  We have reward and performance frameworks, talent  development opportunities, and gender-balanced  recruitment processes. We are proud to now offer up to  five days paid fertility treatment, both for the individual  receiving treatment and for individuals supporting a  partner undergoing fertility treatment.  More details can be found in the Seven West Media  annual report. 23  ===== PAGE 24 ===== SDG WHY IT’S IMPORTANT TO SEVEN WEST MEDIA HOW WE SUPPORT THIS GOAL Representing  Australia This is about how we reflect the nation’s diversity  both internally, in our workplace, and externally,  through our platforms and content – as well as  our important work partnering with others in the  industry to improve representation.
