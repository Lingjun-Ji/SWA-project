Annual Report 2024  |  9  ===== PAGE 10 ===== Chair’s  Report  2024 EGL excels in sustainable practices,  emphasising renewable energy,  decarbonisation, and resource  recovery, made possible by our skilled  and dedicated teams. 10  |  The Environmental Group Limited  ===== PAGE 11 ===== Dear Shareholders, On behalf of The Board of   The Environmental Group Limited  (EGL) I am pleased to present the  2024 financial year Chair’s report.  Financial Year 2024 (FY24) has  been an outstanding year for The  Environmental Group with remarkable  financial results underpinned by  strengthened operating margins   which have contributed to   continued growth in EBITDA.    The Environmental Group is dedicated to engineering  a sustainable future through comprehensive waste  recycling, air pollution control, odour management,  and energy efficiency products and services. As  industries and legislation evolve and we strive to  provide solutions across the circular economy,  The Environmental Group, in collaboration with our  technology partners, is well-positioned to place us   at the forefront of environmental protection.  We remain committed to spearheading the transition to  renewable  energy sources, significantly contributing  to decarbonisation and resource recovery. In line  with our ambitions, we have expanded our service  offerings into the solar energy sector, demonstrating  our dedication to supporting renewable energy  initiatives. Our projects, such as filtration systems to  improve safety and efficiency of advanced solar farms  and the development of innovative waste-to-energy  solutions, are pivotal in reducing carbon emissions  and promoting sustainable energy practices. These  initiatives not only align with global climate targets but  also showcase our proactive approach in embracing   the renewable energy transition. The Group’s strategic focus on decarbonisation and  resource recovery has led to several high-impact  projects. Our recent advancements include the  implementation of state-of-the-art technologies for  the extraction of harmful substances like PFAS from  water, and the installation of sophisticated waste  processing facilities designed to achieve up to 99%  landfill diversion. By incorporating regenerative  activated carbon filters and other cutting-edge pollution  control measures, we are enhancing air quality and  reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These efforts are  reflective of our broader commitment to environmental  stewardship and underscore our role in facilitating a  sustainable future. Through continuous innovation  and adherence to best practices, The Environmental  Group is not only meeting regulatory requirements  but also setting new benchmarks in environmental  responsibility and operational excellence. Delivering on our three-year strategy, the strength of  our market position and reputation as a group that  focuses on ethical and healthy organisational cultural  values has enabled us to attract world class partners  and collaborators. Global leaders in aligned industries  have sought out EGL to work with, allowing us to  curate a portfolio of integrated brands that enables us  to offer our clients comprehensive solutions for their  most challenging problems. Through this year we have  extended our portfolio bringing Fulton Boilers and the  Kadant PAAL Ltd. bailer offering to the market through  the EGL network and adding to our already strong  relationship with Turmec recycling plants, Wieshapt  burner technology, Anguil Environmental Systems for  thermal destruction and GBM chemical process plants  - all world leading brands now available and supported  Australia wide by The Environmental Group Limited. In addition to bringing these world class products to the  market the Group has continued to focus on internal  innovation to address environmental challenges and  our mission to enable our clients to contribute to a  sustainable environment. We have continued to refine  and develop additional applications for our patented   PFAS treatment technology, market leading silencer  designs and effective carbon capture solutions.   Annual Report 2024  |  11  ===== PAGE 12 ===== During the year the sales team attended industry- based conferences including the leading IFAT trade  show in Europe. These activities have contributed  to building brand awareness with both customers  and potential partners. This also ensures that we  remain current with innovative developments and new  technologies world-wide to ensure that we remain  on the leading edge offering environmental solutions   for our clients.  As a result of our Sales initiatives the Group has built  a strong pipeline of future work and opportunities in  line with our growing product range and new markets  which will build on the already secured work for FY25.  This is in addition to delivery over $98 million in revenue  for the financial year. To support our sales and marketing initiatives we  have initiated a rejuvenated branding strategy across  the group as an outward facing representation of the  synergies that are already occurring. This includes a  new website and invigorated communication channels  which have already generated a significant increase  in engagement and conversion to new business. As  we continue to consolidate and leverage synergies  within our business operations we have consolidated  communication to our four pillars: EGL Clean Air, EGL  Turbine Enhancements, EGL Energy and EGL Waste.  These four pillars are all in alignment with our dedication  to our core purpose of “Engineering a Sustainable Future”  which is underpinned by our corporate Sustainability  Strategy. As we continue to refine our strategy and  data collection around key ESG initiatives the Group  is exploring both the risks and opportunities in this  area. Key highlights in the development of our teams,  improvement in environmental impacts for our clients  and sustainability initiatives are outlined in the Our  Approach to Sustainability section of this report.   Best practice corporate governance has maintained   its position as a priority of the group with the appointment  of Mr Micheal Constable in August 2023 as Independent  Non-Executive Director and Chair of the Audit and   Risk committee. As we align these new technologies and integrate them  into our business model, we have continued to mature  our operational processes to provide streamlined  solutions across the group allowing for an adaptive  process to maximise efficiency and leverage skill  sets across the organisation. Cross training our sales,  engineering, project and service teams across our range  of business units not only provides flexibility but also  builds team engagement.  We have improved synergies throughout the Group to  increase efficiency and provide greater agility across  business units, and integrated Airtight into the EGL  systems and processes. In line with our core values, I am  pleased to report that we have had no lost time injuries  for the period.  Our priority remains ensuring that our  teams and the communities they work with do so safely. Financial results demonstrate the strength in the Group’s  strategy with year-on-year growth in EBITDA of 51.7% to  $10.1 million before significant items. Recurring revenue  from spares, parts and services now represents over  50% of our revenue delivering increased flexibility and  more predicable cashflows.  Gross margins have increased by  30.5% to 29.8% year-on-year, in part  due to the standarisation of product  ranges across the Group, which  has reduced costs and increased  competitiveness. The balance sheet  has been strengthened by increased  cash reserves and debt reduction  providing a strong base for further  growth in future periods. In FY25   we will continue to invest in this aspect  of the organisation increasing   our ability to integrate new  opportunities, leverage efficiencies  and monitor performance.  12  |  The Environmental Group Limited  ===== PAGE 13 ===== Mr Graeme Nayler has signalled his intent to retire  from the board later in 2024 and this has triggered the  structured search for a new NED, further progressing  the board renewal process. I would like to take this  opportunity to thank Mr Graeme Nayler, and other Board  members for their contribution to the Group this year.   In line with governance best practice RSM lead audit  partner Mr Mathavan Parameswaran will rotate out  following the completion of the FY24 audit cycle. The  Board would like to thank Mathavan for his diligence  over the last five years.  As we look to FY25 and beyond the Group is well placed  to continue to execute on its strategic goals designed  through the collaboration between the Board, Executive  and Management teams. The Group is forecasting  continued growth in EBITDA of approximately 25% year  on year (excluding significant items).  The remarkable results we continue to achieve as a  group are the result of the combined effort of our teams  lead by our general managers, executives and CEO  Jason Dixon. The board and I thank each and every  one of our team members for their ongoing efforts  and dedication to the One EGL mindset. Central to  our growth strategy is the support of our customers,  partners and shareholders, we thank you each for your  continued support of The Environmental Group Limited  and look forward to continued success.   Lynn Richardson Non-Executive Chair Annual Report 2024  |  13   ===== PAGE 14 ===== CEO’s  Report  2024 We had zero lost time injuries for the  year with over 359,000 hours worked,  this has been achieved while we   have grown the business to over   200 team members with a great  culture, maintaining a sustainable   work life balance. 14  |  The Environmental Group Limited  ===== PAGE 15 ===== Dear Shareholders, It is with great pleasure that   I report to you on the progress of   The Environmental Group Limited (EGL)  over the last financial year, producing  further outstanding financial results, at the  same time continuing to drive our strategic  goals of margin expansion, process  improvement, risk controls and building   the growth platform for the future. The  team has worked tirelessly to amplify   the performance of the existing business   units while focussing on operating   as One EGL to drive growth. The opportunity is to continue to build the platform  of a very strong product offering, leveraging our  intellectual property and strategic relationships to  provide a compelling offering to the industries in which  we operate. Whether it be developing world leading  silencer technologies for peaking load gas turbines,  broadening our products and services. In EGL Energy  through the Fulton distribution agreement or Kadant  PAAL bailers into EGL Waste, whole of site emissions  solutions through EGL Clean Air and extending our  services into the broader waste industry. The culture we are continuing to build is founded on  trust and integrity. Our clients and stakeholders know  that while there will always be barriers to perfect  solutions, we will be accountable for our actions and  strive for optimal outcomes by using our collective  technical knowledge, practical and transparent  approach and relationships to the best advantage.  Fostering a continuous learning and development  environment cultivates agile and high-performing  teams. Our management team is evaluated based  on group outcomes, not just individual achievements,  ensuring value creation across the entire group. I am pleased to report we had zero lost time injuries  for the year. With 359,000 hours worked, this can  only be achieved through our staff recognising the  value of a safe working environment and taking  responsibility for all those around them. From a  market perspective, each of the EGL divisions play  their role in providing the one stop shop solution for a  sustainable future.  EGL Waste for resource recovery,  sorting and bailing technologies, EGL Clean Air  (TAPC & Airtight) for dust, fume, emission and odour  controls and EGL Energy (Tomlinson Energy Services  & Ignite Services) for heat exchange, biomass boilers  and autoclaves. As waste treatment technologies  develop further in Australia into the waste to energy  industry, Baltec has the expertise in intake and off  take systems for turbines and thermal dynamics   to support the shift. As we transition between traditional energy sources  and renewable energy, demand for our services  is high. We continue to be a market leader in  understanding the thermal dynamics of using  gas turbines at peaking load capacity, and our  clients are increasingly requesting a greater focus  on reducing noise pollution from the turbines,   in support of surrounding communities.  The commercialisation of our PFAS separation  technology strengthens our ability to further service  the waste sector utilising our growing IP. We  are now becoming a group of premium brands  and premium intellectual property in the sectors   we operate in.  From a financial perspective the business continued  to perform very well having now achieved a three year  compound average growth rate in normalised EBITDA  of 47%, an outstanding achievement, generating  significant cash flows.  For the FY24, revenue was $98,251,869 up 18.8%  (FY23 $82,672,245) EBITDA rose significantly up  to $10,101,890 (FY23 $6,660,670), an increase of  51.7%, and EBIT up to $7,559,303 an increase of  52.8%, before significant items $450,386 (integration  costs $88,090, restructuring costs $40,589, FX losses  $163,367 and performance rights $158,340). The very strong financial result was again driven   by our three-year growth strategy, offering all the  services of The Environmental Group to our client  base, while at the same time broadening our offering  Annual Report 2024  |  15  ===== PAGE 16 ===== through increased services and spares, the Fulton  boiler distribution agreement and the Kadant PAAL  Ltd. bailer offering. The acquisition last financial  year of Airtight Solutions allowed EGL Clean Air to  provide whole of site air emission control systems.  The waste sector is a multibillion-dollar industry in  Australia and is going through significant change as  part of the circular economy to lift its recycling levels  of waste, derive valued products and minimise the  environmental impact. We are well positioned to be  part of this landmark change in the industry following  the introduction of the Recycling and Waste Reduction  Act 2020, targeting a significant improvement in  recycling rates and including the banning of all waste   being exported from Australia. To grow the business at 47% compound annual growth  for the last three years requires a strong balance sheet  and good cash flow. We now have cash at bank of $10.1  million, positive operating cash flow of $4.2 million and  an undrawn working capital facility of $5 million, giving  us the financial strength to continue to deliver further  sustainable growth.  Our EBITDA margins have risen from FY23 8.1% to  10.3% in FY24, with our margins lifting almost 50%  since the strategy was approved by the board. The  growth of the recurring revenues in service, spares  and repeat business has climbed to over 50% of   our earnings, enabling us to build a strong balance  sheet and cash flows. The stability of the senior management team  to focus on the journey to achieve the results  for our shareholders has been a testament to  their commitment to the company. While at the  same time over that three-year journey revenues  have grown from approximately $46.6 million to   $98.3 million up 110%. This has been achieved  while we have grown the business to over 200  team members with a great culture, maintaining a  sustainable work life balance. To the board, team members, and all our stakeholders:  I thank you for your ongoing support and look forward  to another strong year in FY25. At this time, we   expect normalised EBITDA to grow again by  approximately 25%.     Jason Dixon CEO, The Environmental Group Limited. 16  |  The Environmental Group Limited  ===== PAGE 17 =====   Our EBITDA margins have risen  from FY23 8.1% to 10.3% in  FY24, with our margins lifting  almost 50% since the strategy  was approved by the board. The  growth of the recurring revenues  in service, spares and repeat  business has climbed to over  50% of our earnings, enabling us  to build a strong balance sheet  and cash flows. “ Annual Report 2024  |  17   ===== PAGE 18 ===== Review of  Operational  Report The Environmental Group Limited  (EGL) is focused on engineering a  sustainable future, providing products  and engineering services through our  operating divisions to a diverse range  of clients across many industries. We now have consistent processes  throughout all business units,  enhancing the quality of our offerings,  lowering procurement costs, and  generating information that allows us  to better serve our clients while driving  margin growth. 18  |  The Environmental Group Limited  ===== PAGE 19 ===== EGL Clean Air EGL Clean Air had consolidated revenue  of $32,940,055 and EBITDA of $3,214,869  before significant items, a tougher year  than expected for the business unit with  the downturn in a couple of key sectors,  the business unit also incurred costs of  integration of Airtight Solutions. TAPC reported solid financial performance with revenue  increasing by 3% on the pcp to $17,401,940 and EBITDA  down to $2,322,545 before significant items, a good  result in the environment where the lithium carbonate  price declined approximately 70% during the period  resulting in several projects going on hold or being  postponed. We have all but finished a major lithium  and rare earth project during the period on time and  on budget. The capital spend on new lithium and rare  earth projects globally has softened with the fall in  the lithium price, but the long-term need for refined  product remains strong as a key component into the  renewable energy sector. Growth in critical metals (or  rare earths refining) continues with some significant  tenders currently in the pipeline.  Servicing of plants and spares organically grew revenue  by 5.5% for the full year to $4,900,95. The market for  service, spares and small projects softened around the  middle of the year as our clients pulled back on their  spend but that appears to have improved in the final  quarter of the year. TAPC has expanded its offering  working together with Airtight Solutions to include  whole of site emissions and dust control systems. In the first full reporting period, Airtight recorded  revenue of $15,538,115 for the full year, slightly behind  expectations, largely due to a significant decline in  the joinery sector, with several major manufacturers  closing during the period. The strategy to expand  further into the waste sector has been successful  with tenders of over $6 million awaiting award and  an important strategic partnership entered for dust  suppression as part of our expansion into whole of  site emissions solutions. EBITDA of $892,325 before significant items, was  a result of improved margins in the business, but  negatively impacted by volumes. The result was also  impacted by costs associated with transferring Airtight  onto our systems and platforms which is now fully  completed. We have finished off several incomplete  jobs prior to our ownership at lower margin, in some  cases in losses to achieve a good outcome with our  clients. Airtight is now fully functioning on our systems  and has been integrated into all our processes and we  expect to see improved results in FY25. Airtight has  market-leading products in dust extraction systems,  with synergies through sales into the waste sector  expected to exceed our expectations. From this reporting period TAPC and Airtight will  report as the consolidated EGL Clean Air business unit.  Annual Report 2024  |  19  ===== PAGE 20 ===== EGL Energy EGL Energy had an outstanding year  executing our key strategies on margin  expansion and product offering   expansion with revenue up 2.7% on pcp   to $37,864,288 with EBITDA up 41.0%   to $5,347,913 before significant item.  Combined with the increased level of  service work EBITDA margin expanded  from 10.3% pcp to 14.1% for the full year.  As reported in the first half results new boiler sales  have been very strong for Tomlinson’s and position  the business well for the coming period. Ignite  Services performed well and continued to contribute  above expectations with both revenue and earnings  growth. In the period we also made the significant  announcement of securing the national distribution  for Fulton, a worldwide leader in the development   of premier heat transfer equipment. Fulton is an American multi-national collection of  companies headquartered in Pulaski, New York, USA,  who research, engineer, manufacture and support  premier heat transfer equipment for a wide range  of commercial and industrial applications. Fulton  employs more than 650 people in facilities across   five countries, serving as an industry leader of emerging  heat technologies for more than 70 years. The Fulton distribution agreement combined with  Australia’s largest sales and service group of steam  boilers and related thermal energy systems, providing  Australia’s only national 24-hour service capability, gives  us the opportunity to take the EGL Energy businesses  to a new level. The Fulton companies not only provide  us with an extended offering but also cutting - edge  technology advances such as more energy-efficient  hybrid boilers. This is a significant commercial opportunity with  the Fulton companies offering a large range of  heat exchange products, substantially extending   EGL Energy’s product line, particularly in the smaller boiler,  electric boiler and condensing hot water heaters. These  products will enable EGL Energy to broaden its sales   and service pipeline. We believe that this is a   substantial growth opportunity in both the industrial  and commercial markets. With the rising cost of natural gas our clients are  looking for the optimisation of their combustion  efficiency and alternate fuel sources such as biomass  boilers using waste products to generate heat  and hydrogen as an alternate fuel source. With  our knowledge of combustion systems and heat  exchange we believe we are at the forefront of the  circular economy to provide solutions to the industry.  20  |  The Environmental Group Limited  ===== PAGE 21 ===== Baltec is also nearing the completion on our first solar  farm inverter inlet system to prevent dust build up  and explosion risk on solar inverters. It is a unique  product offering derived from our Intellectual property  on removing particulate matter from air flow while not  sustaining a pressure drop, the same principles used  for gas turbine inlets. Once successfully commissioned  we will be promoting this technology to other solar  farm utilities. The system will remove particulate  matter while maintaining required inlet flow rates to  allow cooling of inverters. The technology can have  a significant impact in lowering the risk of inverter  failure, while increasing power output for the solar  farm and lowering OHS risk. The solar farm industry  has seen significant growth in Australia with 151  registered solar farms producing greater than 5 MW  as at the end of 2022. Innovation such as these open  new markets leveraging off our intellectual property.  EGL Turbine Enhancements Baltec IES performed exceptionally   well for the year with revenue up 34.7%   on pcp to $ 27,128,799 with EBITDA up   205% to $4,811,059 before significant  items. The management focus on margin  and process improvement led to the  strong improvement with EBITDA margins  increasing from 7.8% pcp to 17.7%.  Baltec has established a unique position in the market  designing silencers suitable for gas turbines running  in peaking load capacity supporting the move to  renewable energy while being able to achieve the  noise attenuation required by our customers. The IP  generated by an engineering team is world leading  and has positioned the business for further growth  in the future. The growing need for gas turbines to have the flexibility  to run either in peaking load or base load is being driven  by the growth of the renewables sector. As renewables  grow capacity, gas turbines benefit from the technology  of being able to run in peaking load to support peak  demand periods, this requires technical solutions that  can survive in an operating environment dealing with  far greater thermal dynamics. Annual Report 2024  |  21  ===== PAGE 22 ===== EGL Waste  EGL Waste is the centrepiece for offering  all of EGL’s products and services to the  waste industry, recycling plants through  the Turmec agency agreement, dust and  particulate matter extraction through EGL  Clean Air and sterilisation and combustion  technologies via EGL Energy, providing  the one stop shop solution to the waste  treatment industry. We believe the macro- outlook remains very strong following the  introduction of the Recycling and Waste  Reduction Act 2020. EGL Waste generated revenue of $810,829 and delivered  EBITDA of $118,423 (excluding EGL Water) before  significant items for the full year. Most pleasingly  though we did not sell a new plant during this period,  the revenue and earnings derived came from the  sale of services and spare parts further building our  recurring revenue streams. It is important to consider  that while EGL Waste manages the clients in that  sector the revenue is allocated to the business unit  that undertakes the work. EGL Clean Air and EGL  Energy have been beneficiaries of the work generated  through our waste clients. Our offering to the industry is  continuing to grow through not only the sales of Turmec  recycling plants, but also with our provision of servicing,  maintenance and spares which was launched this year.  As detailed in the ASX release dated 19th February  2024, we now also represent Kadant PAAL exclusively  in Australia as a leading manufacturer of baling  presses, specialising in the design and manufacture  of high-performance balers and ancillary equipment, a  meaningful addition to our Turmec agency agreement.   Our pipeline for recycling plant tenders remains very  strong at $146 million. EGL Water has continued to progress forward with  our first commercial PFAS separation plant, all  documentation required is now fully submitted to the EPA  to obtain licence amendments to operate at the liquid  waste facility in Melbourne. While this process has taken  longer than expected all questions have been responded  to and we are not aware of any further information that  needs to be provided to the EPA from our client. The plant  has continued to perform well under pilot licence and  has now processed over 300,000 litres of liquid waste for   PFAS removal prior to discharge. Over the last 12 months, we have also been developing  the business plans for soil and biosolids as it is a  significant segment of PFAS contaminated wastes. Our  ongoing trials for PFAS contaminated soils and biosolids,  have been successful seeing consistent enhancements  with each iteration. Our ongoing refinement of the  process has yielded highly encouraging results utilising  the same technology platform. Our technology is  effective, but importantly can be provided at a low  operating and capital cost, with no additional waste  streams generated through our process. The growing market for the treatment of biosolids has  become an area of focus for us. As PFAS is accumulating  in the environment and in the biosolid sludges of our  sewer networks, the end of our sewerage treatment  process, it becomes s a greater area of concern.  Historically biosolids post treatment have been applied  to land as a soil conditioner with a high nitrogen value.   22  |  The Environmental Group Limited  ===== PAGE 23 ===== Financial Position The financial position of the Group has  strengthened over the period with net assets  increasing by $4,548,471 to $40,944,027. Cash  on hand at the balance date was $10,147,059  and an undrawn $5,000,000 debt facility  provides significant working capital to fund  further growth. The outlook for FY25 remains  strong with EGL again forecasting increased  earnings, at this stage expecting EBITDA to   increase by approximately 25% year on year.  As those biosolids are now becoming increasingly  contaminated rather than being in a beneficial  reuse process they are now becoming a significant  contaminated waste stream that will require treatment. Since we commenced marketing our PFAS technology  in March of this year inbound interest has been high  in water, soil and biosolids treatment which we have  provided several proposals to our clients for review.  Annual Report 2024  |  23   ===== PAGE 24 ===== Risk Nature of Risk Controls Established Fraud Misappropriation of funds EGL has a clear Fraud Policy in place that is   communicated to all new staff as part of their   induction to the business. Financial Controls   & Audit Risk A failure to manage audit processes  and compliance controls can lead to  fraud, financial misstatements and  loss of assets or data. Ongoing oversight of systems and financial   reports by the Directors and the audit and risk   committee, including review and approval of   monthly results, as well as half-yearly and annual  reports released to the ASX.  Timeliness of   Funding/Cash Flow A lack of liquidity management   can result in insufficient cash flow  resulting in insolvency. EGL operates within a financial delegations matrix to  ensure effective control over type and timing of   expenditure is maintained. Commercial Bid Reviews  with Executive oversight are conducted on all major  Projects to ensure cash flow controls are adequate,  and the sales pipeline is maintained. EGL has a  diverse customer portfolio with a high proportion of  recurring revenue streams. Employee Recruitment   & Retention Loss of key people may lead to   loss of critical skills, knowledge and  experience which may disrupt   workflow, impact key relationships  with stakeholders and can impact  EGL's competitive advantage. A group-wide succession plan is actively managed to  develop talented staff in preparation for progression  within the business. There is regular role review and  performance management in place across the group  and remuneration is set at or above market averages  for a similar size and scope of business. Loss of Customer   Confidence   or Relationship EGL maintains a diverse portfolio   of Tier 1 and 2 customers. A loss of   a key customer may negatively   impact the financial success of   the business. EGL has a diverse range of customers across differ- ent markets around the globe. Despite the relatively  low risk of significant financial impact from the loss  of one customer, EGL is committed to meeting and  exceeding customer expectations on project and  service delivery.  Opportunities and Business Risks  The Environmental Group is committed   to delivering shareholder value whilst  managing the risk profile of the Group.  The Environmental sector continues to evolve and with   this change comes both opportunity and complexity.  The Waste industry is experiencing increasing pressure  to meet ambitious legislative targets by 2030 whilst the  Energy and Air Quality are continuing to shift in response  to both political and social expectations.          To ensure we stay on track to deliver on our Strategic  Objectives, The Environmental Group operates within   an Enterprise Risk Management Framework that actively  identifies, plans, controls and mitigates a wide range of  risks across functions and continually seeks opportunities  to gain competitive advantage across sectors.  The material business risks that have the potential   to impact the Group’s future performance and   financial prospects are outlined below.   24  |  The Environmental Group Limited  ===== PAGE 25 ===== Risk Nature of Risk Controls Established Information Security EGL may be exposed to an event   or events which may result in our   own IP, financial information or  our client's information being  compromised with adverse  consequences for the business.   Our information security risks   remain heightened due to the  growing sophistication and   increased frequency of cyber attacks  within all industries. EGL invests in a wide range of information security  protection and preventative measures in response  to the increasing threats presented by cyberattacks.  Critical to the success of EGLs’ information security  program is the central management of this function  with a robust common strategy and policy across  EGL that follows the framework of protect, monitor,  detect and respond. EGL also partners with trusted  external partners to provide security testing and  training, including phishing exercise and social  engineering testing. Induction security training and  ongoing regular communication to staff is conducted  to recognise and prevent cyber threats, strengthening   our overall security posture. Competitor Risk The risk of competitors taking  majority of or all market share in  EGL's market segments. EGL continues to invest in market led product  development to ensure we have best-in-class  offerings for our clients. We have an operational  drive towards developing customers across multiple  sectors to ensure market diversification as well as  solidifying our position in the Waste sector. EGL has  positioned its process, systems and people to be  able to quickly scale to meet demand and continue to  develop strategic partnerships that are beneficial to  achieving our strategy. Business Interruption There is a risk of business  interruption leading to commercial  loss that may result from natural  disasters such as pandemics, floods  and bushfires.  EGL has comprehensive emergency management  plans in place and conducts regular drills across all  sites to ensure staff and business preparedness to  respond quickly is maintained. EGL also manages  these risks through the framework and governance  structures outlined in this report. Serious   Workplace Health   & Safety Incident A WH&S incident results in a   serious injury or death and the  company is severely impacted by   the consequences. EGL has a full suite of Safe Operating Procedures  that staff are trained in for all risky activities and  equipment and have a 'take 5' culture embedded into  all physical work. Leading indicators for maintaining  a healthy and safe workplace for our staff are closely  monitored and continuously improved.

These elements are  integrated into all areas of our business – strategy setting, risk  management processes and decision making.    Sustainability Performance Significant statistics: 0x LTIs Safety During FY24 work was further developed on the Group’s Sustainability Strategy, to  incorporate relevant sustainability-related risks and opportunities that reflect the  direction of our company. This Sustainability Strategy is being built to support our  Corporate Strategy, with an increasing focus on those sustainability topics most  relevant to the communities we are active in and to our current business activities. Based on our previous materiality assessment, and guided by our core values,  baseline data has been captured against these key materiality topics. This will form  the basis of our Sustainability Plan which will detail the tactical implementation  of the Strategy, allowing objectives and targets to be clearly communicated  throughout the business and to external stakeholders. Performance against  these targets will continue to be captured, closely monitored and optimised  where possible. 26  |  The Environmental Group Limited  ===== PAGE 27 ===== 01   Limit harmful pollutants and chemicals entering the Environment 151  Air pollution reduction systems  delivered and installed 8x  Silencers for Exhaust   systems delivered 1x  Installed and operating the  largest recycling facility in the  Southern Hemisphere. 1x  PFAS system removing   harmful organic compounds   from the environment 1x  National distributor agreement  signed to sell a more energy  efficient boiler range  151  All EGL sites with spill kits and  trained staff to use them 02   Renewable   energy use 03   Waste   reduction 04   Environmental regulation compliance 4x  Vehicle transition from   diesel to petrol commenced 77  Lifts of recycled bins   from all sites 0  EPA regulation breaches Environment Annual Report 2024  |  27  ===== PAGE 28 ===== 25  Prequalification checks for   evidence of Modern Slavery   from potential suppliers >5%  Median base salary increase above  the ABS reported inflation rate Achieved recertification of   ISO 45001:2018  0 LTIs and 0 incidents 08   Ethical conduct with customers 09   Product safety >60  Client Pre-Qualifications   completed and accepted Proactive client meetings  every 2 weeks   (minimum) for all Projects CE Certification  achieved   (A regulatory standard that verifies  certain products are safe for sale  and use in the European Economic  Area (EEA) Social/People 05   Ethical   supply chain 06   Pays fair   wages/salaries 07   Employee Health & Safety 6422 hours  of staff training   across the Group 100%  of all non-technician staff receiving   Annual Performance Reviews 10   Training and education 11  Performance reviews career development 9 staff  promoted from within   the organisation 28  |  The Environmental Group Limited  ===== PAGE 29 ===== Governance 12   Impartial Board of Directors Board rotation   plan in place 1/4  Female Board members Independent   Board maintained 13   Accurate and transparent  accounting methods 14   Transparent Corporate  Governance Statement Passed  External audits passed Corporate Governance   Statement updated Annual Report 2024  |  29  ===== PAGE 30 ===== We work to have a positive impact on the environment by integrating environmental  considerations and management into our activities, including design, choice of  suppliers, and day-to-day operations of our facilities. Highlights We are facilitating the transition from coal-based to  renewable energy solutions through enhanced energy  efficiency designs for gas turbines. We have developed a unique air filtration system to  significantly reduce particulate matter entering solar  farm inverters, which leads to: •	 A significant reduction in maintenance and power  production down time. •	 A reduced risk of fire and explosion in inverters   due to a build-up of particulate matter. We have invested in IEC class 1 acoustic test equipment  to help clients address the increasing regulation of  environmental noise.  We contributed to noise reduction targets globally by  supplying 8 x Exhaust System Silencers to the gas  turbine industry, helping meet country targets and  improve quality of living for surrounding communities. In FY24, we prioritised embedding existing sustainable  procurement principles across the Group, launching  updated tools, templates  and guidance documents,  and supporting our end clients in their supply chain   decarbonisation journeys.  We are optimising cutting patterns to suit the machinery  of our manufacturers to reduce material wastage.  We are promoting the use of VSD’s over other technologies  to minimise power consumption across our product  range. Environment 30  |  The Environmental Group Limited  ===== PAGE 31 ===== Opportunities for FY25 Further standardising our design of our Systems  to reduce total steel and consumable inputs, weld  time (power consumption), waste offcuts and  pressure drop (to maximise turbine efficiency:   less fuel consumed for the same output equals less  GHGs emitted). Identifying more durable materials for weight  optimisation, prolonged design life of products   and simplified maintenance activities. Collecting field noise data from existing equipment  installations with our industry recognised IEC Class  1 noise test equipment. This will support the already  highly specialised analytical engineering techniques  we use to design products for an industry of ever  demanding environmental noise performance  requirements. Developing an ammonia stripping system with   the capability to recover the ammonia from a  contaminated stream, reducing the carbon footprint  of refinery processes. Standardising our engineered solution to provide  integrated dust management for mining operations,  minimising the generation of noxious particulate matter  including silica dust. Developing and delivering sustainable procurement  training for teams to identify early indicators of broad  sustainability risks. Working collaboratively with our suppliers to establish  an energy efficiency program to further reduce GHG  emissions from our operations. EGL, in partnership with Victoria University, have  conducted several PFAS Soil and Biosolid trials   that have yielded a number of potential clients   with several contaminated sites. The new  technology has significant environmental  advantages over thermal soil treatment, as in   2000-fold reduction in Energy and processing   of the soil can happen on site and returned safely to  its original location unlike thermal treatment. Potential Risks Increased regulatory landscape and stakeholder  expectations leading to extended timeframes for  assessment and complexity of environmental  approvals. Annual Report 2024  |  31   ===== PAGE 32 ===== Our people are integral to our success. To maintain a high performing organisation  in a rapidly changing industry and society we will continue to evolve our people  strategy to attract and retain highly capable people whose values align to those   of our business and create a work environment for them to be at their best. Highlights We recognise those who have contributed to our  success by celebrating our major employment  milestones with events held in offices across  the country. In FY24 we celebrated 9 x long term  employment staff who have been with us in excess  of 20 years, including 3 x members who have been  with us since 1994, marking a 30-year commitment  to our Company. An Employee Assistance Program (EAP) has been  introduced across all sites to support our staff  in all aspects of their professional and personal  life. Our EAP offers 24/7 support via professional  counselling services for employees, contractors   and their families. We have trained all management staff on our  ‘Just Culture’ decision framework, and it has been  applied across challenging decision scenarios to  ensure consistency and fairness in how situations   are managed. We have invested in our people through a significant  commitment of over 6,000 hours of staff training  across the business. We have professionally progressed nine staff on  internal promotions across the Group. We introduced additional due diligence processes  for high-risk sourcing activities to identify evidence of  modern slavery in our supply chains. Renewed branding for the Group has been rolled out  to more accurately reflect the environmental nature  of the work we do and is embedded into new, more  climate suitable clothing attire for staff.

These financial  statements also comply with International Financial Reporting  Standards as issued by the International Accounting  Standards Board (‘IASB’). Historical cost convention The financial statements have been prepared under the  historical cost convention, except for, where applicable, the  revaluation of financial assets and liabilities at fair value  through profit or loss, and derivative financial instruments. Critical accounting estimates The preparation of the financial statements requires the  use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires  management to exercise its judgement in the process of  applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving  a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where  assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial  statements, are disclosed in Note 3. Annual Report 2024  |  57  ===== PAGE 58 ===== Note 2. Material accounting policy information (continued) Parent entity information In accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, these  financial statements present the results of the Group only.  Supplementary information about the parent entity is  disclosed in Note 42. Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets  and liabilities of all subsidiaries of The Environmental Group  Limited (‘Company’ or ‘parent entity’) as at 30 June 2024 and  the results of all subsidiaries for the year then ended. The  Environmental Group Limited and its subsidiaries together  are referred to in these financial statements as the ‘Group’. Subsidiaries are all those entities over which the Group  has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group  is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its  involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those  returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity.  Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which  control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated  from the date that control ceases.  Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains  on transactions between entities in the Group are eliminated.  Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction  provides evidence of the impairment of the asset transferred.  Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where  necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted  by the Group. The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the  acquisition method of accounting. A change in ownership  interest, without the loss of control, is accounted for as  an equity transaction, where the difference between the  consideration transferred and the book value of the share of  the non-controlling interest acquired is recognised directly  in equity attributable to the parent. Where the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it  derecognises the assets including goodwill, liabilities and  non-controlling interest in the subsidiary together with any  cumulative translation differences recognised in equity. The  Group recognises the fair value of the consideration received  and the fair value of any investment retained together with  any gain or loss in profit or loss. Operating segments Operating segments are presented using the ‘management  approach’, where the information presented is on the  same basis as the internal reports provided to the Chief  Operating Decision Makers (‘CODM’). The CODM is  responsible for the allocation of resources to operating  segments and assessing their performance.  Foreign currency   transactions and balances Functional and presentation currency The functional currency of each of the Group’s entities is  measured using the currency of the primary economic  environment in which that entity operates. The consolidated  financial statements are presented in Australian dollars which  is the parent entity’s functional and presentation currency. Foreign currency transactions are translated into functional  currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the  transaction. Foreign currency monetary items are translated  at the year-end exchange rate. Exchange differences are  recognised in profit or loss. Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are  translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rates  at the reporting date. The revenues and expenses of foreign  operations are translated into Australian dollars using the  average exchange rates, which approximate the rates at the  dates of the transactions, for the period. All resulting foreign  exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive  income through the foreign currency reserve in equity. The foreign currency reserve is recognised in profit or loss  when the foreign operation or net investment is disposed of. Revenue recognition The Group recognises revenue as follows: Revenue from contracts with customers Revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the  consideration to which the Group is expected to be entitled  in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.  For each contract with a customer, the Group: identifies  the contract with a customer; identifies the performance  obligations in the contract; determines the transaction price  which takes into account estimates of variable consideration  and the time value of money; allocates the transaction price  to the separate performance obligations on the basis of  the relative stand-alone selling price of each distinct good  or service to be delivered; and recognises revenue when or  as each performance obligation is satisfied in a manner  that depicts the transfer to the customer of the goods or  services promised. Variable consideration within the transaction price, if any,  reflects concessions provided to the customer such as  discounts, rebates and refunds, any potential bonuses  receivable from the customer and any other contingent  events. Such estimates are determined using either the  ‘expected value’ or ‘most likely amount’ method. The  measurement of variable consideration is subject to  58  |  The Environmental Group Limited  ===== PAGE 59 ===== Note 2. Material accounting policy information (continued) a constraining principle whereby revenue will only be  recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a  significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue  recognised will not occur. The measurement constraint  continues until the uncertainty associated with the variable  consideration is subsequently resolved. Amounts received  that are subject to the constraining principle are recognised  as a refund liability. Products Revenue on capital work contracts are recognised when  performance obligations are satisfied. Where performance  obligations are deemed to be satisfied over a period of time,  the input method is used for recognising revenue based  on costs incurred. Revenue recognised on ongoing capital  work contracts in excess of amounts billed to customers is  reflected as an asset (“contract assets”). Amounts billed to  customers in excess of revenue recognised on uncompleted  capital work contracts are reflected as a liability (“contract  liabilities”).  Revenue from sales other than capital work contracts is  recognised when goods have been dispatched to a customer  pursuant to a sales order and the associated risks of  ownership have passed to the customer. Services Revenue from the rendering of a service is recognised upon  the delivery of the service to the customer. Interest Interest revenue is recognised as interest accrues using the  effective interest method. This is a method of calculating the  amortised cost of a financial asset and allocating the interest  income over the relevant period using the effective interest  rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future  cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset  to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. Other revenue Other revenue is recognised when it is received or when the  right to receive payment is established. Government grants Government grants relating to costs are deferred and  recognised in profit or loss over the period necessary to match  them with the costs that they are intended to compensate.          Income tax The income tax expense or benefit for the period is the  tax payable on that period’s taxable income based on the  applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction, adjusted by  the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable  to temporary differences, unused tax losses and the  adjustment recognised for prior periods, where applicable. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for  temporary differences at the tax rates expected to be applied  when the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled, based  on those tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted,  except for: •	 When the deferred income tax asset or liability arises  from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset  or liability in a transaction that is not a business  combination and that, at the time of the transaction,  affects neither the accounting nor taxable profits; or •	 When the taxable temporary difference is associated  with interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint  ventures, and the timing of the reversal can be  controlled and it is probable that the temporary  difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary  differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that  future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those  temporary differences and losses. The carrying amount of recognised and unrecognised  deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date.  Deferred tax assets recognised are reduced to the extent  that it is no longer probable that future taxable profits will be  available for the carrying amount to be recovered. Previously  unrecognised deferred tax assets are recognised to the  extent that it is probable that there are future taxable profits  available to recover the asset. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only where there  is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets  against current tax liabilities and deferred tax assets against  deferred tax liabilities; and they relate to the same taxable  authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable  entities which intend to settle simultaneously. The Environmental Group Limited and its wholly owned  Australian subsidiaries have formed an income tax  consolidated group under the tax consolidation regime.  The head entity and each subsidiary in the tax consolidated  group continue to account for their own current and deferred  tax amounts. The tax consolidated group has applied the  ‘separate taxpayer within group’ approach in determining  the appropriate amount of taxes to allocate to members of  the tax consolidated group.       Annual Report 2024  |  59  ===== PAGE 60 ===== In addition to its own current and deferred tax amounts,  the head entity also recognises the current tax liabilities (or  assets) and the deferred tax assets arising from unused tax  losses and unused tax credits assumed from each subsidiary  in the tax consolidated group.  Current and non-current  classification Assets and liabilities are presented in the statement   of financial position based on current and   non-current classification. An asset is classified as current when: it is either expected to  be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the Group’s  normal operating cycle; it is held primarily for the purpose of  trading; it is expected to be realised within 12 months after  the reporting period; or the asset is cash or cash equivalent  unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle  a liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period.   All other assets are classified as non-current. A liability is classified as current when: it is either  expected to be settled in the Group’s normal operating  cycle; it is held primarily for the purpose of trading; it is  due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting  period; or there is no unconditional right to defer the  settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after  the reporting period. All other liabilities are classified   as non-current. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always classified as  non-current. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial  position comprise cash at bank, cash in hand and other short- term deposits with an original maturity of three months or  less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash  and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes  in value. For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and  cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as  defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts. Bank  overdrafts are included within other financial liabilities in  current liabilities on the statement of financial position. Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and  subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective  interest method, less any allowance for expected credit losses.  Trade receivables are generally due based on 30-90 day terms.      The Group has applied the simplified approach to measuring  expected credit losses, which uses a lifetime expected loss  allowance. To measure the expected credit losses, trade  receivables have been grouped based on days overdue.  Expected credit losses are also assessed on individual  debtors with overdue balances for any specific allowance  required. Specific expected credit losses are recognised when  there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able  to collect the receivable. Financial difficulties of the debtor  or, default payments are considered objective evidence of  possible impairment.  Other receivables are recognised at amortised cost, less any  allowance for expected credit losses. Contract assets Customer contract assets are recognised when the Group  has transferred goods or services to the customer, or  performance obligations are met but where the Group is  yet to establish an unconditional right to consideration (that  is, billing milestones are not achieved yet). Contract assets  are treated as financial assets for impairment purposes.  Inventories Raw materials and consumables Raw materials and consumables are measured at the lower of  cost and net realisable value. Costs are assigned on a first in,  first out basis. Costs of purchased inventory are determined  after deducting rebates and discounts received or receivable. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the  ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of  completion and the estimated costs necessary to make  the sale. Plant and equipment Plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less  accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment  losses. Such cost includes the cost of replacing parts that are  eligible for capitalisation when the cost of replacing the parts  is incurred. All other repairs and maintenance are recognised  in the statement of comprehensive income as incurred.  Depreciation is calculated on either a straight-line or  diminishing value basis over the estimated useful life of the  specific asset. The expected useful lives as follows: Leasehold improvements	 	 3-10 years Plant and equipment	 	 3-10 years The residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are  reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the unexpired  period of the lease or the estimated useful life of the assets,  whichever is shorter. Note 2. Material accounting policy information (continued) 60  |  The Environmental Group Limited  ===== PAGE 61 ===== An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised  upon disposal or when there is no future economic benefit  to the Group. Gains and losses between the carrying amount  and the disposal proceeds are taken to profit or loss. Right-of-use assets A right-of-use asset is recognised at the commencement date  of a lease. The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which  comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted  for, as applicable, any lease payments made at or before the  commencement date net of any lease incentives received,  any initial direct costs incurred, and, except where included  in the cost of inventories, an estimate of costs expected to  be incurred for dismantling and removing the underlying  asset, and restoring the site or asset. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis  over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful  life of the asset, whichever is the shorter. Where the Group  expects to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of  the lease term, the depreciation is over its estimated useful  life. Right-of use assets are subject to impairment or adjusted  for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The Group has elected not to recognise a right-of-use asset  and corresponding lease liability for short-term leases with  terms of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets.  Lease payments on these assets are expensed to profit or  loss as incurred. Goodwill and intangibles Goodwill Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business and is initially  measured at cost being the excess of the cost of the business  combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of  the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent  liabilities. Goodwill is not amortised. Instead, goodwill is  tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or  changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired  and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.  Impairment losses on goodwill are taken to profit or loss and  are not subsequently reversed.  Intangibles other than goodwill Intangible assets acquired separately or in a business  combination are initially measured at cost. The cost of an  intangible asset acquired in a business combination is its fair  value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition,  intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated  amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.          The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be  either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives  are amortised over the useful life and tested for impairment  whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may  be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation  method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life is  reviewed at least at each financial year end. The amortisation  expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised  in profit or loss in the expense category consistent with the  function of the intangible asset. Customer relationship Customer relationship asset acquired in a business  combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition  date, and subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis  over the period of their expected benefit.  Intellectual property Intellectual property acquired in a business combination is  recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. They have  an indefinite useful life and are subsequently tested for  impairment.   Research and development costs Research costs are expensed in the period in which they  are incurred. Development costs are capitalised when it is  probable that the project will be a success considering its  commercial and technical feasibility; the Group is able to  use or sell the asset; the Group has sufficient resources and  intent to complete the development; and its costs can be  measured reliably. When a capitalised development project  is complete, the costs are amortised on a straight-line basis  over the period of their expected benefit, being their finite  life of 5 to 10 years. Software An intangible asset arising from software purchased or  development expenditure, the cost model is applied requiring  the asset to be carried at cost less any accumulated  amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Any  expenditure so capitalised is amortised over the period of  expected benefit from the related project. Impairment of non-financial assets Goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite  useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested  annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or  changes in circumstances indicate that they might be  impaired. Other non-financial assets are reviewed for  impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.   An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which  the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. Annual Report 2024  |  61  ===== PAGE 62 ===== Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value  less costs of disposal and value-in-use. The value-in-use is  the present value of the estimated future cash flows relating  to the asset using a post-tax discount rate specific to the  asset or cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.  Assets that do not have independent cash flows are grouped  together to form a cash-generating unit. Further details on the  methodology and assumptions used are outlined in Note 19. Impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not  subsequently reversed. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested  for impairment annually either individually or at the cash- generating unit level consistent with the methodology outlined  for goodwill above. Such intangibles are not amortised.  The useful life of an intangible asset with an indefinite life  is reviewed each reporting period to determine whether  indefinite life assessment continues to be supportable. Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are carried at cost and due to their  short-term nature, they are not discounted. They represent  liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior  to the end of the financial year that are unpaid and arise  when the Group becomes obliged to make future payments  in respect of the purchase of these goods and services. The  amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days  of recognition. Contract liabilities Contract liabilities represent the Group’s obligation to transfer  goods or services to a customer and are recognised when a  customer pays consideration, or when the Group recognises  a receivable to reflect its unconditional right to consideration  (whichever is earlier) before the consolidated entity has  transferred the goods or services to the customer. Borrowings Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair  value of the consideration received, net of transaction costs.  They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using  the effective interest method.               Lease liabilities A lease liability is recognised at the commencement date of  a lease. The lease liability is initially recognised at the present  value of the lease payments to be made over the term of  the lease, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the  lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s  incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments comprise of  fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable, variable  lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, amounts  expected to be paid under residual value guarantees, exercise  price of a purchase option when the exercise of the option is  reasonably certain to occur, and any anticipated termination  penalties. The variable lease payments that do not depend  on an index or a rate are expensed in the period in which  they are incurred. Lease liabilities are measured at amortised cost using  the effective interest method. The carrying amounts are  remeasured if there is a change in the following: future  lease payments arising from a change in an index or a rate  used; residual guarantee; lease term; certainty of a purchase  option and termination penalties. When a lease liability is  remeasured, an adjustment is made to the corresponding  right-of use asset, or to profit or loss if the carrying amount  of the right-of-use asset is fully written down. Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred  unless they are attributable to a qualifying asset. Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present  (legal or constructive) obligation as a result of a past event, it  is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic  benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable  estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured at the present value of  management’s best estimate of the expenditure required  to settle the present obligation at the reporting date using a  discounted cash flow methodology. If the effect of the time  value of money is material, provisions are discounted using  a current pre-tax rate that reflects the time value of money  and the risks specific to the liability. Employee benefits Short-term employee benefits Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary  benefits, annual leave and long service leave expected to  be settled wholly within 12 months of the reporting date  are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the  liabilities are settled. Note 2. Material accounting policy information (continued) 62  |  The Environmental Group Limited  ===== PAGE 63 ===== Other long-term employee benefits The liability for long service leave not expected to be settled  within 12 months of the reporting date are measured at the  present value of expected future payments to be made in  respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting  date using the projected unit credit method. Consideration is  given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience  of employee departures and periods of service. Expected  future payments are discounted using market yields at the  reporting date on corporate bonds with terms to maturity and  currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated  future cash outflows. Defined contribution superannuation expense Contributions to defined contribution superannuation plans  are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Retirement benefit obligations Termination benefits are payable when employment is  terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or  when an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange  for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits  at the earlier of the following dates: (a) when the Group can no  longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and (b) when the  entity recognises costs for a restructuring that is within the  scope of AASB 137 and involves the payment of terminations  benefits. In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary  redundancy, the termination benefits are measured based  on the number of employees expected to accept the offer.  Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of  the reporting period are discounted to present value. Contributed equity Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs  directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are  shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. Earnings per share Basic earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated as net profit attributable  to members of the parent, adjusted to exclude any costs  of servicing equity (other than dividends), divided by the  weighted average number of ordinary shares, adjusted for  bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the financial  year. Diluted earnings per share Diluted earnings per share is calculated as net profit or  loss attributable to members of the parent, divided by the  weighted average number of ordinary shares and dilutive  potential ordinary shares, adjusted for any bonus element.  Potential ordinary shares are treated as dilutive when,  and only when, their conversion to ordinary shares would  decrease earnings per share or increase loss per share from  continuing operations. Business combinations The acquisition method of accounting is used to account  for business combinations regardless of whether the equity  instruments or other assets are acquired. The consideration transferred is the sum of the acquisition- date fair values of the assets transferred, equity instruments  issued or liabilities incurred by the acquirer to former owners  of the acquiree and the amount of any non-controlling interest  in the acquiree. For each business combination, the non- controlling interest in the acquiree is measured at either  fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s  identifiable net assets. On the acquisition of a business, the consolidated entity  assesses the financial assets acquired and liabilities  assumed for appropriate classification and designation in  accordance with the contractual terms, economic conditions,  the consolidated entity’s operating or accounting policies and  other pertinent conditions in existence at the acquisition-date. Where the business combination is achieved in stages, the  consolidated entity remeasures its previously held equity  interest in the acquiree at the acquisition-date fair value  and the difference between the fair value and the previous  carrying amount is recognised in profit or loss. Contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer  is recognised at the acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent  changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration  classified as an asset or liability is recognised in profit or  loss. Contingent consideration classified as equity is not  remeasured and its subsequent settlement is accounted  for within equity. The difference between the acquisition-date fair value of  assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling  interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the consideration  transferred and the fair value of any pre-existing investment  in the acquiree is recognised as goodwill. If the consideration  transferred and the pre-existing fair value is less than the fair  value of the identifiable net assets acquired, being a bargain  purchase to the acquirer, the difference is recognised as a  gain directly in profit or loss by the acquirer on the acquisition- date, but only after a reassessment of the identification and  measurement of the net assets acquired, the non-controlling  interest in the acquiree, if any, the consideration transferred  and the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquirer.          Annual Report 2024  |  63  ===== PAGE 64 ===== Business combinations are initially accounted for on  a provisional basis. The acquirer retrospectively adjusts  the provisional amounts recognised and also recognises  additional assets or liabilities during the measurement period,  based on new information obtained about the facts and  circumstances that existed at the acquisition-date. The  measurement period ends on either the earlier of (i) 12  months from the date of the acquisition or (ii) when the  acquirer receives all the information possible to determine  fair value. Goods and Services Tax (‘GST’)  and other similar taxes Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the  amount of associated GST, unless the GST incurred is not  recoverable from the tax authority. In this case it is recognised  as part of the cost of the acquisition of the asset or as part  of the expense. Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount  of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of GST  recoverable from, or payable to, the tax authority is included  in other receivables or other payables in the statement of  financial position. Cash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST  components of cash flows arising from investing or financing  activities which are recoverable from, or payable to the tax  authority, are presented as operating cash flows. Commitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the  amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the tax  authority. Comparatives Where necessary, comparatives have been reclassified and  repositioned for consistency with current year disclosures. New Accounting Standards and  Interpretations not yet mandatory  or early adopted Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that  have recently been issued or amended but are not yet  mandatory, have not been early adopted by the Group for  the annual reporting period ended 30 June 2024.  Note 2. Material accounting policy information (continued) 64  |  The Environmental Group Limited  ===== PAGE 65 ===== Note 3. Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the financial statements requires  management to make judgements, estimates and  assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the  financial statements. Management continually evaluates  its judgements and estimates in relation to assets, liabilities,  contingent liabilities, revenue and expenses. Management  bases its judgements, estimates and assumptions on  historical experience and on other various factors, including  expectations of future events, management believes to  be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting  accounting judgements and estimates will seldom equal  the related actual results. The judgements, estimates and  assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material  adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  (refer to the respective notes) within the next financial year  are discussed below. Allowance for expected   credit losses The allowance for expected credit losses assessment  requires a degree of estimation and judgement. It is based  on the lifetime expected credit loss, grouped based on days  overdue, and assumptions laid to allocate an overall expected  credit loss rate for each group. The allowance for expected  credit losses, is calculated based on the information available  at the time of preparation. The actual credit losses in future  years may be higher or lower. Provision for impairment   of inventories The provision for impairment of inventories assessment  requires a degree of estimation and judgement. The level of  the provision is assessed by taking into account the recent  sales experience, the ageing of inventories and other factors  that affect inventory obsolescence. Estimation of useful lives of assets The Group determines the estimated useful lives and  related depreciation and amortisation charges for its  property, plant and equipment and finite life intangible  assets. The useful lives could change significantly as a  result of technical innovations or some other event. The  depreciation and amortisation charge will increase where  the useful lives are less than previously estimated lives,  or technically obsolete or non-strategic assets that have  been abandoned or sold will be written off or written down.  Impairment of goodwill The Group tests annually, or more frequently if events or  changes in circumstances indicate impairment, whether  goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets have  suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting  policy stated in Note 2. The recoverable amounts of cash- generating units have been determined based on value- in-use calculations. These calculations require the use of  assumptions, including estimated discount rates based on  the current cost of capital and growth rates of the estimated  future cash flows as discussed in Note 19. Impairment of non-financial   assets other than goodwill The Group assesses impairment of non-financial assets  other than goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets  at each reporting date by evaluating conditions specific  to the Group and to the particular asset that may lead to  impairment. If an impairment trigger exists, the recoverable  amount of the asset is determined. This involves fair value  less costs of disposal or value-in-use calculations, which  incorporate a number of key estimates and assumptions. Income tax The Group is subject to income taxes in the jurisdictions  in which it operates. Significant judgement is required in  determining the provision for income tax. There are many  transactions and calculations undertaken during the ordinary  course of business for which the ultimate tax determination  is uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated  tax audit issues based on the Group’s current understanding  of the tax law. Where the final tax outcome of these matters  is different from the carrying amounts, such differences will  impact the current and deferred tax provisions in the period  in which such determination is made. Recovery of deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary  differences only if the Group considers it is probable that  future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those  temporary differences and losses. Annual Report 2024  |  65  ===== PAGE 66 ===== Note 3. Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions (continued) Lease term The lease term is a significant component in the measurement  of both the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Judgement  is exercised in determining whether there is reasonable  certainty that an option to extend the lease or purchase the  underlying asset will be exercised, or an option to terminate  the lease will not be exercised, when ascertaining the  periods to be included in the lease term. In determining  the lease term, all facts and circumstances that create an  economical incentive to exercise an extension option, or  not to exercise a termination option, are considered at the  lease commencement date. Factors considered may include  the importance of the asset to the consolidated entity’s  operations; comparison of terms and conditions to prevailing  market rates; incurrence of significant penalties; existence  of significant leasehold improvements; and the costs and  disruption to replace the asset. The consolidated entity  reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise an  extension option, or not exercise a termination option, if there  is a significant event or significant change in circumstances. Incremental borrowing rate Where the interest rate implicit in a lease cannot be readily  determined, an incremental borrowing rate is estimated to  discount future lease payments to measure the present value  of the lease liability at the lease commencement date. Such  a rate is based on what the consolidated entity estimates it  would have to pay a third party to borrow the funds necessary  to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset,  with similar terms, security and economic environment.                             Employee benefits provision As discussed in Note 2, the liability for employee benefits  expected to be settled more than 12 months from the  reporting date are recognised and measured at the present  value of the estimated future cash flows to be made in  respect of all employees at the reporting date. In determining  the present value of the liability, estimates of attrition rates  and pay increases through promotion and inflation have  been taken into account. Business combinations As discussed in Note 2, business combinations are initially  accounted for on a provisional basis. The fair value of assets  acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are  initially estimated by the Group taking into consideration  all available information at the reporting date. Fair value  adjustments on the finalisation of the business combination  accounting is retrospective, where applicable, to the period  the combination occurred and may have an impact on the  assets and liabilities, depreciation and amortisation reported. Revenue from contracts with  customers, contract assets, and  contract liabilities  When recognising revenue in relation to capital projects  (service revenue), the key performance obligation of the  Group is considered to be the percentage of the completion  for respective projects. Judgement is exercised in determining  the percentage of completion of the contract and in reliably  estimating the total contract revenue and contract costs to  completion.  Contract assets are measured at revenue recognised for each  project, net of any provision for anticipated future losses,  and in excesses of the amounts billed to the customers  based on the underlying contracts. Judgement is exercised  in determining the provision for expected future losses, as  well as the amount of revenue recognised as explained above,  which in turn impacts the contract assets, as well.  Contract liabilities are measured at the amounts billed to the  customers based on the underlying contracts, in excess of  the revenues recognised for respective projects. Judgement  is exercised in determining the amount of revenue recognised  as explained above, which in-turn impacts the contract  liabilities, as well. 66  |  The Environmental Group Limited  ===== PAGE 67 ===== Note 4. Operating segments Identification of reportable  operating segments The Group has identified its operating segments based on  the internal reports that are reviewed and used by the Board  of Directors (chief operating decision makers) in assessing  performance and determining the allocation of resources.  Unless stated otherwise all amounts reported to the Board  of Directors, being the chief operating decision makers with  respect to operating segments, are determined in accordance  with accounting policies that are consistent to those adopted  in the annual financial statements of the Group. The Group is managed primarily on the basis of product  category and service offerings as the diversification of the  Group’s operations inherently have notably different risk  profiles and performance assessment criteria. Operating  segments are therefore determined on the same basis.  Reportable segments disclosed are based on aggregating  operating segments where the segments are considered to  have similar economic characteristics and are also similar  with respect to the following: •	 The products sold and/or services provided by   the segment. •	 The fabrication process. •	 The type or class of customer for the products   or services. •	 The distribution method. •	 Any external regulatory requirements. Types of products and services   by segment Products segment EGL Clean Air (Pollution Control)  incorporates the operations related to the supply, design,  construction and installation services to industry, this  segment includes activities related to air pollution control,  water purification systems. Products segment EGL Turbine Enhancement incorporates  the operations related to the supply, design, construction  and installation services to industry, this segment includes  activities related to design, engineering and manufacture of  gas turbine equipment and solutions. EGL Energy (previously Services) are a combination of  Tomlinson and Ignite. The segment reflects the services  and after sales support to industry, this segment includes  services to construction, health sector, food processing,  manufacturing and many other industrial markets. EGL Waste (previously Waste). This segment reflects the  agency agreement with Turmec and includes services related  to the Waste Industry. Inter-segment transactions All inter segments transactions occur through a funds transfer  or via a loan account and are eliminated on consolidation in  the Groups financial statements. Segment assets Where an asset is used across multiple segments, the asset  is allocated to that segment that receives majority economic  value from that asset. In the majority of instances, segment  assets are clearly identifiable on the basis of their nature and  physical location. Segment liabilities Liabilities are allocated to segments where there is a  direct nexus between the incurrence of the liability and the  operations of the segment. Borrowings and tax liabilities are  generally considered to relate to the Group as a whole and  are not allocated. Segment liabilities include trade and other  payables and certain direct borrowings. Segment performance The following table present revenue and profit information  and certain asset and liability information regarding  business segments for the years ended 30 June 2024   and 30 June 2023.

Non-current assets - Intangible assets (continued) Research and development Research costs are expensed in the period in which they  are incurred. Development costs are capitalised when it is  probable that the project will be a success considering its  commercial and technical feasibility; the Group is able to  use or sell the asset; the Group has sufficient resources and  intent to complete the development; and its costs can be  measured reliably. When a capitalised development project  is complete, the costs are amortised on a straight-line basis  over the period of their expected benefit, being their finite  life of 5 to 10 years. Customer relationships Customer relationships acquired in a business combination  are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of their  expected benefit.     Software Significant costs associated with software are deferred and  amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of their  expected benefit, being their finite life of 5 years. Intellectual property Intellectual property acquired in a business combination is  recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. They have  an indefinite useful life and are subsequently tested for  impairment.  Impairment testing Goodwill acquired through business combinations and  licences have been allocated to the relevant cash generating  units as summarised in the table below: EGL  Clean Air  TAPC EGL  Clean Air  Airtight EGL  Energy  Tomlinson EGL   Energy   Ignite EGL  Turbine  Enhancement EGL  Waste EGL  Total Goodwill 5,328,297 2,998,703 3,956,878 1,584,425 4,007,647 192,969 18,068,920 EGL Clean Air Cash Generating  Unit (TAPC) The recoverable amount of the EGL Clean Air (TAPC) Cash  Generating Unit has been determined using a value in use  calculation which is based on the following key assumptions:  •	 11.7% post-tax discount rate; (2023: 16%) •	 5% (2023: 5%) per annum projected revenue and cost  of sales growth rate;  •	 3.5% (2023: 5%) per annum increase in overhead; and •	 2% (2023: 2%) projected indefinite nominal growth in  the terminal value.  Based on the above, there was no impairment of goodwill. Sensitivity Revenue would need to decrease by more than 7.8% before the  goodwill would need to be impaired, with all other assumptions  remaining constant. The discount rate would be required to increase by 12.2%  before goodwill would need to impaired with all other  assumptions remaining constant. EGL Clean Air Cash Generating  Unit (Airtight) The recoverable amount of the EGL Clean Air (Airtight) Cash  Generating Unit has been determined using a value in use  calculation which is based on the following key assumptions:  •	 11.7% post-tax discount rate; (2023: 16%) •	 10% (2023: 10%) per annum projected revenue and  cost of sales growth rate;  •	 3.5% (2023: 5%) per annum increase in overhead; and •	 2% (2023: 2%) projected indefinite nominal growth in  the terminal value.  Based on the above, there was no impairment of goodwill.

Non-current assets - Intangible assets (continued) 80  |  The Environmental Group Limited  ===== PAGE 81 ===== Key assumptions used in value in  use calculations The calculation of value in use for each of the Cash Generating  units is most sensitive to assumptions made concerning  projected revenues, cost of sales, and overheads, projected  gross margins for the first year, discount rates, and growth  rates used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period.   Gross margins are based on the values achieved in recent  years preceding the start of the budget period. Discount rates  reflect management’s estimate of the time value of money and  the risks specific to each unit that are not already reflected  in the cash flows. In determining the appropriate discount  rates, regard has been given to the weighted average cost  of capital of the entity as a whole and adjusted for business  risk specific to each unit. Growth rate estimates reflect recent  past experience. Note 20. Non-current assets - Other non-current assets Consolidated 2024  $ 2023  $ Security deposits 154,941  230,930 Note 21.

Capital risk management The Group’s objectives when managing capital is to safeguard  its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can provide  returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders  and to maintain an optimum capital structure to reduce the  cost of capital. Capital is regarded as total equity, as recognised in the  statement of financial position, plus net debt. Net debt is  calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group  may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders,  return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets  to reduce debt.     The Group would look to raise capital when an opportunity to  invest in a business or company was seen as value adding  relative to the current company’s share price at the time of  the investment.  The Group is subject to certain financing arrangement  covenants and meeting these is given priority in all capital  risk management decisions. There have been no events of  default on the financing arrangements during the financial year. The capital risk management policy remains unchanged from  the 2023 Annual Report. Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new  shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of  tax, from the proceeds. Note 33.

Financial risk management Financial risk   management objectives The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise  receivables, payables, cash and short term deposits, bank  loans, and leases. The Group manages its exposure to key financial risks,  including interest rate and currency risk with the objective of  supporting the delivery of the Group’s financial targets whilst  protecting future financial security. The main financial risks that arise in the normal course of  business for the Group’s financial instruments are interest  rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.  The Group uses different methods to measure and manage  different types of risks to which it is exposed. Liquidity risk is  monitored through the development of future rolling cash flow  forecasts. Ageing analyses and monitoring of specific credit  allowances are undertaken to manage credit risk.     The Board has continued the policy that no speculative  trading in financial instruments be undertaken. Details of the significant accounting policies and methods  adopted, including criteria for recognition, the basis of  measurement and the basis on which income and expenses  are recognised, in respect of financial instruments are  disclosed in Note 2 to the financial statements.

Interest rate risk Interest rate risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial  instrument or cash flows associated with the instrument will  fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. Interest rate  risk arises from interest bearing financial assets and liabilities  that are used. Interest bearing assets are predominantly  short term liquid assets, such as bank deposits and interest  bearing current accounts. The Group’s bank loans outstanding, totalling $150,000  (2023: $750,000), with an average interest rate of 5.37%  (2023: 5.135%), are principal and interest payment  loans. Monthly cash outlays of approximately $2,346.52   (2023: $3,209) per month are required to service the   interest payments. Foreign currency risk The Group has transactional currency exposure arising from those sales and purchases which are denominated in United States  dollars and euros. From time to time the Group hold cash denominated in United States dollars and euros. Currently the Group  has no foreign exchange hedge programmes in place. Transaction exposures, where possible, are netted off across the Group to  reduce volatility and provide a natural hedge.

Financial risk management (continued) Credit risk Credit risk arises from the financial assets of the Group  which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other  receivables, term deposit and bank bills. The Group’s exposure  to credit risk arises from potential default of the counter party,  with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of  these instruments. Exposure at reporting date is addressed  in each applicable note. The Group trade only with creditworthy third parties. The credit  risk for cash and cash equivalents is considered negligible,  since the counter parties are reputable banks with high  quality external credit ratings. It is the Group’s policy that all  customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to  credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances  are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the  Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet  its financial obligations as they fall due. The liquidity position  of the Group is managed to ensure sufficient liquid funds are  available to meet all financial commitments in a timely and  cost-effective manner. The Group constantly reviews the  liquid position including cash flow forecasts to determine the  forecast liquidity position and maintain appropriate liquidity  levels. The remaining contractual maturities of the Group’s financial  liabilities are: Annual Report 2024  |  91  ===== PAGE 92 ===== Note 37.

The tables have  been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial  liabilities based on the earliest date on which the financial  liabilities are required to be paid. The tables include both interest  and principal cash flows disclosed as remaining contractual   maturities and therefore these totals may differ from their  carrying amount in the statement of financial position.

FY23 Acquisition On the 5th May 2023 EGL acquired 100% of the ordinary  shares of Airtight Pty Ltd for the total consideration transferred  of $4,855,162. Airtight is a leading supplier of air pollution  control systems and filtration solutions across a variety of  industries. Airtight provides small to large scale air pollution  control projects in most industries including construction  inputs, minerals, foundry, dairy, mining, and timber processing.  Approximately 85% of Airtight sales are in light industrials  sector. AT is headquartered in NSW with its major operations  in three locations: Wetherill Park in NSW, Bayswater in VIC,  and Tingalpa in QLD. The goodwill of $3,897,008 represents strong recurring revenue  and expected future growth from the areas mentioned in the  previous paragraph. The acquisition will be a major expansion of EGL’s presence  in the air pollution control market, providing a significant  growth to the current TAPC business unit. Airtights focus is  on the lighter industrials market compared to TAPC in the  heavy industrials / refining sector. The business aligns with  EGL’s strategy, while providing a broader client base focusing  on smaller scale projects (typically $100k-$250k). Larger  customer segments include joinery, food & beverage, schools,  TAFEs, and universities.  Integrating the acquired business will provide opportunities  to recognise synergies through EGL Waste with the dust  extraction and collection systems suitable for waste processing  facilities. Currently TAPC does not bid on this work, as it is not  their key strength, and much of it is outsourced. Airtight can  be bolted on to EGL’s existing infrastructure and platform. The acquired business contributed revenues of $3,391,888 and  an EBITDA of $154,787 to the consolidated entity for the period  from 5 May 2023 to 30 June 2023. If the acquisition occurred  on 1 July 2022 estimated full year contributions would have  been revenues of $18,200,000 and EBITDA of $1,820,000. It  is impracticable to disclose the revenue and profit or loss of  the combined entity as if the acquisition had occurred at the  beginning of the annual reporting period, as the acquired entity  did not comply with Australian Accounting Standards prior to  its acquisition by Environmental Group Limited. As at 30 June 2023, provisionally determined values were  reported. Subsequent to 30 June 2023, final fair values for the  business combination were determined. Comparative amounts  for 30 June 2023 have been restated in this financial report to  the final determined fair values.

The decrease in the fair value of Inventory and increase in the fair value of plant and equipment comprises of $426,489 which has  been re-classified as Showroom display assets. 2. Contract liabilities were increased due to a projects estimated cost being underestimated. 3.The decrease in provision for income tax of $303,208 is a result of a revised tax return for FY22. 4.The hold back payment has been adjusted due to changes in the estimated working capital and tax payable.  5.The earnout was subjected to achieving an EBITDA target of $1,530,155 for the FY24. Upon receipt of further information regarding  past performance of Airtight Solutions, including the adjustment number 2 above, management revised its budget for Airtight  Solutions according to which the probability of meeting EBITDA target to achieve the amount was low. Therefore, the balance is  revised accordingly. Note 43. Business combinations (continued) Annual Report 2024  |  97  ===== PAGE 98 ===== Note 44.

In our opinion the accompanying financial report of the Group is in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001,  including:  (i)  giving a true and fair view of the Group's financial position as at 30 June 2024 and of its financial  performance for the year then ended; and   (ii) complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001.     Basis for Opinion    We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards.  Our responsibilities under those  standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report section of  our report.  We are independent of the Group in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the  Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board's  APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the financial  report in Australia.  We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.     We confirm that the independence declaration required by the Corporations Act 2001, which has been given to  the directors of the Company, would be in the same terms if given to the directors as at the time of this auditor's  report.    We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our  opinion.    Key Audit Matters    Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of  the financial report of the current period.  These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial  report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.        ===== PAGE 104 ===== Key Audit Matters (Continued.)  Key Audit Matter  How our audit addressed this matter  Impairment of Goodwill  Refer to Note 19 in the financial statements  At 30 June 2024, The Group had goodwill with a  carrying value  of  $18,068,920,  which  represents  approximately 24% of the Group's total assets.  As required under AASB 136, management have tested  goodwill for impairment. As goodwill does not generate  cashflows that are largely independent from other assets,  its recoverable amount was determined by calculating the  recoverable amount of the cash generating unit (''CGU'') to  which it belongs. This recoverable amount was then  compared to the CGU's carrying amount. In this instance,  the recoverable amount was determined to be its value in  use.   We determined the impairment review of goodwill to be a  Key Audit Matter because of the materiality of the Goodwill  balance, and because of the significant management  judgments and assumptions used to determine the value  in use of the CGU which contains it. Namely, the  calculation of the recoverable amount of the CGU involves  judgements about the future underlying cashflows of the  CGU, estimated growth rates for the CGU for the next 5  years as well as in perpetuity, and judgments of an  appropriate discount rate to apply to the estimated  cashflows.  With the assistance of our Corporate Finance team, our audit  procedures included:   • Assessing the reasonableness of management's determination that the goodwill should be allocated to six CGUs based on the nature of the Group's business; • Assessing the valuation methodology used to determine  the recoverable amount; • Challenging the reasonableness of key assumptions, including the following: o Cash flow projections; o Future growth rates; o Discount rates; o Terminal value; • Performing  sensitivity  analysis  over  the  key assumptions used in the models; • Checking the mathematical accuracy of the cashflow model and reconciling input data to supporting evidence, such as approved budgets, and considering the reasonableness of the evidence (such as budgets); and • Assessing the appropriateness and accuracy of the disclosures included in the financial report. Revenue recognition  Refer to Note 5 in the financial statements  Revenue for the year ended 30 June 2024 was  $98,251,869. The primary revenue streams are:  • Engineering and Fabrication Solutions • Provision of services • Sales of parts Revenue is considered to be a Key Audit Matter because  of:  • the identification of performance obligations, • the method of recognition of revenue (over time or at a point in time); and • revenue is generated from varying income sources, with different recognition patterns requiring significant management estimates. Our audit procedures included:  • Assessing whether the Group’s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers; • Evaluating  the  operating  effectiveness  of management’s controls related to revenue recognition; • For a sample of revenue transactions, substantiating transactions by agreeing to supporting documentation, including customer contracts and ensuring they are accounted for in line with the revenue recognition policy; • Assessing revenue transactions before and after year- end to ensure that revenue is recognised in the correct period; and • Performing substantive analytical review procedures on the different revenue streams.  ===== PAGE 105 =====   Key Audit Matters (Continued.)

The group performed the provisional accounting in the  financial year 2023 and opted to use the measurement period  arrangement allowed under the accounting standards to  finalise the acquisition accounting within 12 months from the  acquisition  date.  During  the  financial  year  2024,  management has reviewed the additional information  available regarding the status and performance of Airtight as  at the acquisition date, and has made necessary adjustments  to finalise the acquisition accounting.  This is considered a Key Audit Matter as accounting for such  a transaction is complex and involves significant judgement  in applying the accounting standards. This includes valuation  of consideration paid and payable, including contingent  consideration, as well as the measurement and recognition  of intangible assets. Apart from the accounting treatment of  the consideration and assets recognised, there is also a risk  that sufficient and accurate disclosures are not made in  accordance with the accounting standards.     Our audit procedures included:  •  Assessing the further adjustments made by the  management during the measurement period,  including substantiating the significant items  against supporting documents and calculations;   •  Performing additional test of details over certain  balances after finalization of the acquisition  accounting by the management; and   •  Reviewing the disclosures made in the financial  statements is in accordance with the accounting  standards.       Other Information     The directors are responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises the information included  in the Group's annual report for the year ended 30 June 2024, but does not include the financial report and the  auditor's report thereon.     Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and accordingly we do not express any  form of assurance conclusion thereon.    In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing  so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report or our knowledge  obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.     If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other  information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.     Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Report    The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of:  a. the financial report (other than the consolidated entity disclosure statement) that gives a true and fair  view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001; and   b. the consolidated entity disclosure statement that is true and correct in accordance with the Corporations  Act 2001, and      ===== PAGE 106 =====   for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of:  i.  the financial report (other than the consolidated entity disclosure statement) that gives a true and fair  view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and   ii.  the consolidated entity disclosure statement that is true and correct and is free of misstatement, whether  due to fraud or error.  In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group to continue as  a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of  accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic  alternative but to do so.     Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report    Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from  material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance  with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements  can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably  be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.
