We pay our respects to Elders of the  past, present and future, as they hold the memories, knowledge and spirit of the  lands on which we live and work.  GHD recognises the history of accomplishments of Indigenous Peoples, and we  are deeply committed to learning from them in the work that we carry out across  the world.  We respect and value the knowledge, abilities and culture that Indigenous  Peoples contribute to creating strong communities. We recognise their strength,  diversity, resilience and deep connections to the lands we live and work upon.

Our services  are constantly evolving in response to  the changing needs of clients and the  communities we serve. There is increasing  tension between interconnected global  challenges such as escalating climate  change and the cost and complexity of  infrastructure responses. These pressures  demand the holistic solutions we are  committed to delivering. We firmly believe that the greatest  sustainability impact we can make as  a company is through the projects we  deliver together with our clients. We are  tackling complex social, environmental  and infrastructure challenges through the  combination of our deep technical skills,  business advisory and digital capabilities,  embedding sustainability and resilience at  every step. We are equally committed to managing  our own operations and supply chain  responsibly, promoting respect for human  rights and supporting the natural world.  As GHD’s new CEO I intend to champion  these commitments and empower our  people to make sustainability an integral  part of our daily business practices.  Examples of this commitment include  again in FY2024 achieving carbon  neutrality for scope 1 and 2 emissions  through emissions reductions and  purchase of verified nature-based carbon  offsets; and our recent adoption of a  statement on respect for the rights of  Indigenous Peoples. Throughout my 30-year career at GHD,  I’ve had the privilege of working across  a variety of markets and locations,  including the United States, Southeast  Asia, Australia and, most recently, Canada.  Immersing myself in local communities  and connecting with clients on a personal  level has provided an unparalleled  learning experience. I’ve seen a shared  global desire to tackle the challenges  we all face, though every client and  community has its own unique needs. GHD is wholly owned by its employees,  and I believe this ownership model  imbues us with a collective sense of  responsibility for the world we are  partnering with our clients to help  shape — one where water, energy and  communities are made sustainable for  generations to come.  As engineers, architects, scientists,  project managers and other technical  professionals, our people endeavour to  be at the forefront of innovation for a  more sustainable future. As CEO, I am  personally committed to supporting this  transition by enabling our teams to deliver  locally relevant solutions while drawing on  our global experience, bringing together  the best of GHD’s skills and capabilities to  leave a lasting positive legacy.

We are continually refining how and  what we work on to address the impacts  of climate change, respect human rights,  conserve natural resources, support the  circular economy and help build resilient  communities.  Our Sustainability Way has materially  evolved how we work with our clients to  create positive impacts on water, energy  and communities. At the same time, client  projects may also present risks. Our Project  Selection Standard, which establishes the  principles we follow for client projects,  guides us in pursuing projects that align  with our commitment to sustainable  development and human rights.  A key component of the Project Selection  Standard is the fossil fuels project selection  guidelines, which expressly set out the  types of fossil fuel-related projects we will  consider and those we will seek to forego.  These guidelines help focus our business  on projects that support our clients and  communities in transitioning to a low- carbon future through reduced reliance  on fossil fuels. The Standards are reviewed  and approved annually by the Board.  Against the backdrop of global volatility  and uncertainty, creating sustainable  solutions requires wide-ranging  collaboration and constant innovation.  Through client engagement, we work to  understand client needs and develop high- value proposals that aim to deliver superior  outcomes that are aligned with their  greater goals. By proactively considering  sustainability and resilience outcomes,  developing sustainable project delivery  frameworks and building new sustainability  capabilities in our technical teams, we  are introducing our Sustainability Way  principles into our project delivery. We are working across our organisation to  better leverage global capabilities to create  innovative, sustainable solutions for clients.  This focus on resilience and ESG is key  to integrating sustainability across our  business.

Our 48 Technical  Service Line communities are the  backbone for the technical work we do  with our clients, connecting our teams as  a global network. They are a hub for our  engineering, architectural, environmental  and consulting professionals to  collaborate on technical issues, including  embedding environmental and social  sustainability best practices and  learnings across GHD. This has created  opportunities for:  	 →Service Line Leaders to shift culture  by bringing sustainability to the front of  our projects and encouraging holistic  consideration of clients’ sustainability  challenges and priorities.  	 →Service Lines to share tools and  methods that deliver high-impact  sustainability outcomes for clients  and build our integrated sustainability  service offering.  	 →Service Lines to share new or best  practices relating to sustainability and  embed them as standard practices  broadly across our global network.   	 →Technical Services events to cross- connect Service Lines and connect  internal teams through sustainability- themed Accredited Technical  Masterclasses, Virtual Technical  Summits, and Technical Conferences.  	 →Continuous improvement mechanisms  that challenge Service Line Leaders  and members to identify new ways of  working with a sustainability focus. In FY2024, all 48 Service Lines  committed to sustainability actions in  their business plans, alongside a list of  SMART (specific, measurable, achievable,  relevant, time-bound) goals to guide their  sustainability efforts. More than two- thirds of our Service Lines have reported  some or significant progress towards  implementing action plans that include  both risk and opportunity management  and embedding sustainability into their  standard technical toolkits.  Progress towards embedding  sustainability across our Service Lines  can be understood as a gradient. At one  end are relative beginners, receiving  practical guidance and training to  implement their action plans.

At the leading edge, our most advanced Service Lines, equipped with technical tools and knowledge-sharing networks,  are accelerating sustainability integration in client projects. Specifically: 56%  have reported some progress,  including designating a sustainability  champion, implementing an action plan,  and having a deeper understanding of the  relevance of sustainability to their Service  Line and client projects.  31% have  developed action plans  but have yet to report real progress  towards implementation. They are  receiving practical guidance and training  to support the integration of sustainability  into their business planning and the  technical work they do. 13%  of our Service Lines have reported significant  progress, indicating successful  embedment of sustainability into  business as usual. They prioritise it in  client projects while leveraging their  knowledge, ideas and success by  sharing their stories across Service  Lines to support knowledge-sharing and  accelerate overall efforts.  Sustainability is a regular topic at monthly Service Line Leader meetings, and our Technical Services General Managers are tracking  progress with Service Line Leaders. These recurring progress check-ins promote accountability and support the ongoing efforts. We  also have hosted two virtual sustainability-themed workshops (February 2023 and July 2024) with our Service Line Leaders to develop  ways to accelerate building capability and new technology across our technical services.  All 48 Service Lines will have sustainability actions in their FY2025 business plans.

Some selected examples of where our  Service Lines have driven meaningful  outcomes towards sustainability in our  key markets include:  Properties and buildings We developed and implemented  Sustain 2.0, a design guide created by  GHD for sustainable and regenerative  built environments. Our architects and  engineers use this guide to assess the  sustainability impacts of a project and  provide insights on reducing these  impacts. Through our global Service Line  network, GHD introduced Sustain 2.0  into the APAC and Americas Economic  Regions. Environment We collaborated to establish industry  practices for the beneficial use of  excavated soil and sediment. Water We developed an approach to  incorporate sustainability into  infrastructure planning and design  projects. This includes guidance on  engaging with clients to understand  their challenges and priorities and a  checklist of sustainable design criteria to  be considered throughout the planning,  concept design, detailed design,  tender/construction, operation and  decommissioning phases of an asset. Transport We created a sustainability case study  register outlining the sustainability scope  and achievements for 58 transport  project examples across Australia and  New Zealand. Additionally, we compiled  a simple checklist of questions to help  project teams align with the sustainability  goals of major clients and transport  authorities in various jurisdictions. Energy and resources We are developing a tailings reprocessing  valorisation database to identify potential  economic resources within tailings  dams, aligned with circular economy  principles in the mining sector. We have  also developed Sustainability Checklists  specific to the mining sector to guide our  clients and demonstrate more sustainable  project design decisions to advance our  decarbonisation objective through the  design process.  1.

This internal  investment funding highlights GHD’s  commitment to investing in innovation.  It provides Service Line members  with funding to support their technical  research and the development of new  applications, methodologies or ways of  working in alignment with our strategy.  Investments can provide supplemental  funding to a client project, discipline- specific research, broader Service Line  development, or collaborations with third- party partners.  Seed funding has enabled several  innovation initiatives relating to  sustainability, resilience and ESG,  including: 	 →Working in partnership with clients,  industry stakeholders, and the US  Environmental Protection Agency  to develop a white paper on best  practices for water reuse in the  beverage industry. The project’s  insights have been shared internally  and externally through white paper  presentations at several high-profile  conferences.  	 →Collaborating with clients to develop  emission factors for GHG emissions  from wastewater treatment plants,  contributing to solutions for  decarbonising these facilities. 	 →Creating a low-carbon concrete  specification, offering a sustainable  alternative to conventional concrete  without compromising performance. GHD has invested in early-stage  companies that are building solutions  to tackle challenges in the areas of  water, energy and communities through  emerging technologies. We believe  collaboration is key to creating lasting  change, so we strive to work closely with  the companies we invest in to enable  collaboration through access to our  global network of industry and technical  capability. Through our investments, we  aim to harness innovation to drive a more  sustainable future.

Our three Strategic Growth Initiatives —  Future Energy, Future of Water and Future  Communities — are inspired by our vision  and designed to help our clients stay  ahead in a changing world. They connect  capability and experience across our  business to explore and develop new  services and solutions that enable our  clients and communities to adapt and  thrive now while supporting their goals  and aspirations for the future.  Understanding the interlinkages between  water, energy and communities helps  build resiliency and unlock opportunities.  By harnessing the power of three, we  are better equipped to create a positive  legacy. Our commitment to a more  resilient future is focused  on the nexus of water,  energy and communities  to sustainably deliver  efficiency and opportunity for  generations to come.”  — Rob Knott, Board Chair Future of Water Future of Water is our commitment to realise efficiencies  and innovation across the value cycle through a holistic  water stewardship lens. Our goal is to enable positive water  outcomes that respect nature and nurture communities while  enabling transformation. Future Energy Future Energy is our commitment to helping clients and  communities navigate the complex and rapidly evolving  energy transition. Our purpose is to lead and accelerate the  shift towards a future of affordable, reliable, secure and low- carbon energy. Future Communities We believe communities are at their best when they  are connected, resilient, inspired and productive. Future  Communities is our commitment to helping clients achieve  the right balance of these four enablers to deliver thriving  places and spaces that put people first.

The SDGs guide  us in identifying, communicating, and  continually improving our contributions to  sustainable development. GHD has been a participant of the UN  Global Compact since 2010. While  GHD supports the broader 2030  Agenda and its 17 SDGs, we focus on  10 “impact SDGs” that we believe we  can substantially influence through our  operations, supply chain, client projects  and philanthropic work. GHD 2024 Sustainability Report  |  19 Executive summary CEO commitment Integrating sustainability Governance Environmental  Social Appendix About GHD Together with our clients	 | Technical Services leadership	 | The power of three  | Sustainability Way   | Our Impact Sustainable Development Goals	  ===== PAGE 20 ===== This SDG aligns with our Sustainability Way principles of Social  Inclusion and Community Vitality, including our commitments  to Inclusion & Diversity and Wellbeing. Our work to support  communities’ access to clean water and to remediate contaminated  sites are examples of projects that advance this goal.    We intentionally commit to community impact through our  Reconciliation Action Plans, respecting human rights in all aspects  of our business, encouraging work with minority-owned vendors,  and acknowledging and partnering with Indigenous Peoples and  other marginalised communities. Our Future Communities Strategic Growth Initiative focuses on  efforts to provide thriving places and spaces that put people first  and support inclusive and sustainable urbanisation. Through our work with clients, we strive to support life below water  to maintain its biodiversity and strengthen the resiliency of marine  and coastal ecosystems.   We also focus on creating positive outcomes for life on land,  seeking to promote resilient communities while addressing species  decline and reducing the risk of ecosystem collapse.  As a company, we actively contribute to this goal, including  providing holistic client solutions for Future Energy, strategic  integrated solutions for Future of Water and our commitment  to developing resilient Future Communities. Our corporate  commitment to set a science-based, net-zero target demonstrates  our priority to decarbonise our own operations. Our Project  Selection Standard is designed to focus our business on projects  that support our clients and communities in transitioning to a low- carbon future through reduced reliance on fossil fuels.   The development of GHD policies and ways of working that  prioritise inclusion and diversity, respect human rights in all  business operations and promote procurement from women- owned vendors support this goal. Our Pay Equity policy and  Gender Diversity targets are two examples illustrating our  commitment to this SDG.  Our Future of Water Strategic Growth Initiative focuses on water  security and supporting access to safe and affordable drinking  water. The holistic wastewater management we promote advances  recycling and the safe reuse of wastewater.  Our work across our global markets of water, energy and resources,  environment, property and buildings, and transportation supports  new sustainable and resilient infrastructure, as well as the upgrading  of existing infrastructure and retrofitting facilities to make them  more sustainable.  Through our efforts to embed sustainability into our own operations, supply chain and client work, we are demonstrating our commitment to advancing sustainable  development and embodying our Sustainability Way. In the following sections, we indicate the Sustainability Way principles and related SDGs we support through our  business activities.  From hydrogen to offshore wind and to renewable natural gas,  our Future of Energy Strategic Growth Initiative aims to advance  the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. As an  important complement to those efforts, our focus on transmission,  distribution and energy system integration supports increasing  access to reliable and modern energy services.

As  the hydrogen opportunity expands,  there is a growing need to demonstrate  confidence and certainty around cost  competitiveness, return on investment,  scalability, optionality and transparent  business models that benefit stakeholders  and communities. In Alberta, Canada,  we are working with Evolve Power to  accelerate their plan to repurpose an  idle coal mine into a green hydrogen  production facility within a renewable  energy complex.  Leveraging our broad experience, we  conducted a thorough economic analysis  that evaluated: 	 →Market potential for green hydrogen 	 →Opportunities for utilising an on- site pumped hydro energy storage  system and high-potential wind power  resources 	 →Sensitivity in optimising the economics  of electrolysers and renewable energy  pricing  We also contemplated future carbon  taxes, policy regulations and clean  fuel credits. Our work included preparing federal  funding applications under Canada’s  Clean Fuels Standard programs,  providing a detailed and auditable  carbon intensity estimate, and  analysing market needs and timing  across regional industries and energy  sectors. We detailed key risks and  opportunities and reviewed technical  and capital costs. Finally, we mapped  out the approach for delivering the  green hydrogen project, including  integration with other renewable  components of the complex. The  result is a promising opportunity for  investors and local stakeholders.   Learn more about the project.  Asset transition The Western Australian Climate Policy  sets out the government’s plan to create  a climate-resilient, low-carbon economy,  with clean manufacturing and future  industries as critical priorities.  Western  Australia is well-positioned to leverage  its renewable energy hydrogen potential  and leading iron ore industry. We were  engaged by the Minerals Research  Institute of Western Australia (MRIWA)  to assess the viability of sustainably  processing the state’s iron ore into green  steel across the value chain.  Our innovative value chain model  explores opportunities to decarbonise all  stages of steel production. We evaluated  scenarios based on infrastructure and  investment needs, market dynamics,  resource availability, and potential  partnerships between the iron ore and  steel industries. We also assessed the  future of iron ore mining and global  iron and steel markets to identify  opportunities and risks for each scenario. The study models five pathways  where fossil fuel-based processes  are replaced with renewable energy  options, highlighting the state’s abundant  magnetite and hematite iron ore reserves  as a strategic advantage. It emphasises  the importance of using domestic mineral  resources to produce value-added iron  products for the green steel industry. By exploring realistic scenarios, the  Green Steel Value Chain Assessment  provides a clear roadmap for Western  Australia to become a global leader in  green steel research, development and  commercialisation. The Green Steel Value  Chain Assessment is the first free global  study available to the public.  Learn more about the project.

To reduce the carbon  emissions of our clients’ projects, we  must first assess them. While lifecycle  assessment applications are available  that map material quantities to external  databases and calculate the amount of  potential carbon emissions generated, we  wanted to make the embodied carbon  calculation process more scalable and  accessible to our design teams so they  can effectively review it throughout the  design process. Using custom parameters, our solution  was to embed industry-standard  embodied carbon values into our Revit  (Building Information Modelling software)  materials library. As a result, we can  produce a material take-off schedule  within Revit as we design and calculate  the embodied carbon of the modelled  elements and their associated materials.  This allows designers to test and change  designs as they benchmark options  against both the industry and GHD’s  sustainability goals. The capacity to  identify carbon values for clients at early  design stages enables them to make  informed decisions that will have greater  reduction impacts on operational carbon  for the building during construction and  for the operational life of the asset.

At the same time,  we are committed to lowering our own  operational greenhouse gas (GHG)  emissions to align our internal actions  with our external commitments. In 2023, we committed to the Science  Based Targets initiative’s (SBTi) Corporate  Net-Zero Standard and currently hold Net  Zero “Committed” status. Using FY2023  as our baseline, we have set net-zero  targets for scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.  We will submit our targets to SBTi for  validation in FY2025.  Until net-zero targets are validated,  we continue to track progress on our  emissions targets. In FY2024, we again  achieved our goal of carbon neutrality  for scope 1 and 2 emissions through  emissions reductions and the purchase  of verified nature-based carbon offsets.  We also exceeded our target of sourcing  20 percent of our purchased power  from renewable energy for offices that  have purchasing control and access to  renewable energy, with the next goals  being 80 percent by the end of FY2025  and 100 percent by 2030. Where not  possible, Renewable Energy Certificates  are required. We met our goal of having emissions  action plans for all 23 business regions  by the end of 2023. These documents  respond to the GHG emissions data and  carbon reduction opportunities in the  business region including initiatives such  as fleet reductions, behaviour change  and office energy efficiencies that are  tracked by our regional decarbonisation  champions. Actions from these plans  are continually added, updated and  completed. Our scope 1 emissions come from  fugitive refrigerant gases, stationary  natural gas use at our operationally  controlled locations, and fuel for leased  and owned fleets and equipment.  Scope 2 emissions include purchased  electricity, information technology  servers and charging electric vehicles.  Scope 3 emissions include six out of the  15 Greenhouse Gas Protocol categories  material to our operations: 	 →Category 1: Purchased Goods and  Services (includes Categories 4 and 9) 	 →Category 2: Capital Goods 	 →Category 3: Fuel and Energy related  activities 	 →Category 5: Waste in Operations 	 →Category 6: Business Travel 	 →Category 7: Employee Commuting  (includes employees who work from  home)  Achieving net zero Consistent with the Greenhouse Gas  Protocol operational control approach,  emissions related to client sites, client  equipment, project offices and project  fleet are not included as the operations  and activities are determined by the  client and controlled by client policies. For FY2024, scope 1 and 2 emissions  are verified to reasonable assurance  and scope 3 emissions are verified to  limited assurance. Our GHG emissions  are reported in the verified FY2024 GHD  Global GHG Emissions Report.

The  site, characterised by up to 25 meters  of compressible peaty soil, presents  significant geotechnical challenges and is  prone to flooding, which had previously  hindered development. Wetlands play a  vital role in the stormwater management  system for both the current and future  development of the area. To address the site’s challenges, we  created a ground model to better  understand soil conditions and used it to  determine how to manage groundwater  levels and reduce stormwater runoff. We  designed a deep stormwater channel  to allow gravity flow while protecting  adjacent land from flooding and slurry  cut-off walls to prevent groundwater  drawdown and settlement. Cascading  weirs were also included to control the  permanent water level and support  native species migration.

Flood risk for each pump  station was estimated based on the  potential economic loss for both the  town and its residents, using FEMA’s  Benefit-Cost Analysis software. Costs to  Wareham included replacing damaged  equipment and loss of essential services  (such as hospitals, police stations, or fire  department services), while residents  faced relocation expenses, impact to  natural resources, and clean-up costs. The assessment provided Wareham with  an approach to prioritise projects to  enhance coastal resilience. The town has  started upgrades on three of its most  vulnerable stations, each serving essential  services. Improvements include raising  entry points above the DFE, reinforcing  structures with steel bracing and carbon  fibre, installing floodproof doors and  flood planks, relocating infrastructure and  adding bypass connections at stations.

Exploring recycled water to create  green hydrogen In the United States, the Northern  California Power Agency (NCPA) is  establishing an innovative green hydrogen  energy plant at the Lodi Energy Center.  The project will produce low-carbon  hydrogen and reduce the carbon intensity  of natural gas power generation at Lodi  when completed. Despite California’s  abundant solar power and other  renewable feedstock sources, securing  adequate water supply for hydrogen  production due to drought and navigating  legislative challenges posed difficulties. GHD developed preliminary engineering  design studies for a scalable  60-megawatt (MW) reference plant with  the potential to expand to over 150MW.  Using commercial electrolysis technology  and a grid-connected low-carbon  power supply, the facility is designed to  produce approximately 24 metric tons  of low-carbon hydrogen per day, using  wastewater from the adjacent Lodi Water  Pollution Control Facility as feedstock.  The plant could help NCPA lower  greenhouse gas emissions and contribute  to California’s goal of reducing emissions  by 40 percent below 1990 by 2030. It  also has the potential to transition to 100  percent low-carbon hydrogen power  generation, supporting a clean, resilient  and reliable energy system. Protecting wastewater infrastructure In many coastal communities, wastewater  infrastructure is increasingly at risk of  flooding due to sea level rise from climate  change. One particularly vulnerable  area in the United States is the low-lying  coastal town of Wareham, Massachusetts.  Located on the estuaries of Buzzards  Bay, Wareham faces additional risk from  large waves generated by Atlantic Ocean  storms. To assess the status of vulnerable coastal  wastewater infrastructure, it is important  to first determine the safe elevation for  these facilities, known as the Design  Flood Elevation (DFE), factoring in current  base flood elevation and projected sea  level rise. Most of Wareham’s wastewater  pump stations were situated in areas  vulnerable to base floods, according  to US Federal Emergency Management  Agency (FEMA) flood projections.  Additionally, the infrastructure and pump  stations outside of the flood zones  depend on other vulnerable stations  to convey wastewater, necessitating a  prioritisation methodology.  Pinehaven stream, Wellington, New Zealand (GHD photo) GHD 2024 Sustainability Report  |  42 Executive summary CEO commitment Integrating sustainability Governance Environmental  Social Appendix About GHD Energy  | Biodiversity   Water  |  ===== PAGE 43 ===== GHD Biodiversity The world is facing a combined climate  and biodiversity crisis. These issues are  inextricably linked, and both stem from  unsustainable practices. The main drivers  fueling these crises are overexploitation  of land and sea, pollution, urban  expansion, and land use change. The  resulting impacts include a warming  climate, more frequent extreme weather  events, rising sea levels, habitat loss,  forced migration and an accelerated rate  of species loss and extinction. These  impacts on biodiversity present a range of  societal risks, including to food and water  security, physical and mental health, and  to the economy.

In Scottish and Southern  Electricity Network’s (SSEN) licence  areas in the United Kingdom, 65 primary  substations were identified as being at  risk of flooding, with significant potential  impact for SSEN’s customers. Traditional  engineering solutions, while effective,  often increase carbon emissions and  lack holistic benefits. Recognising  the need for more sustainable and  resilient approaches, GHD and Frontier  Economics, in collaboration with SSEN,  developed the Nature4Networks project  aimed at identifying nature-based  solutions that not only improve flood  resilience and asset performance but also  sequester and store carbon and enhance  biodiversity, among others. Additional  consumer and broader societal benefits,  like noise reduction, improved air quality,  better visual appeal and elevated  placemaking would also be provided  by taking nature-based solutions  approaches; the project also set out  to explore and understand these co- benefits. We assessed the key challenges of  SSEN’s distribution network assets  and analysed fault data to propose  a range of potential nature-based  solutions options that could overcome  the challenges, protect against risks  and enhance service reliability and  delivery. The approaches explored  in the project include woodlands,  bioremediation, sustainable drainage  systems, green infrastructure, natural  flood management, marine habitat  creation and peatland restoration. For  example, establishing linear woodlands  adjacent to overhead lines could  safeguard network reliability and  performance while also providing a  wide range of additional co-benefits  like wildlife habitat and carbon  sequestration and storage.

This “natural capital” underpins all other  forms of capital — human, intellectual,  social, manufactured and financial —  that deliver goods and services vital for  sustainable development. Nature-based  solutions are actions which seek to  protect, conserve, restore, create and/ or sustainably use and manage natural  assets, habitats and ecosystems to  address societal challenges and deliver  multiple environmental, social and  economic benefits.  By implementing nature-based solutions  in place of traditional engineering  options, more sustainable outcomes can  be achieved while addressing multiple  societal challenges and delivering a wide  range of co-benefits. For example, blue- green infrastructure like green walls and  roofs and sustainable drainage systems  can provide multiple co-benefits, such  as urban shading and cooling, flood risk  reduction, habitat provision, carbon  sequestration and storage, enhanced  placemaking, air filtration, reduced noise  pollution, and positive impacts on our  physical and mental wellbeing.

The Murray  River and its floodplains support over  2.6 million people through water supply,  agriculture, employment and recreation.  Increased storage and use of Murray River  water in its floodplains has substantially  reduced the frequency, extent and  duration of natural floods, which can have  substantial negative impacts on the health  of this important ecosystem. Without  action, research indicates that hotter and  drier conditions from climate change will  further exacerbate floodplain decline.  This large, multidisciplinary project  involves designing and constructing  water management structures at nine  sites to control environmental flows into  wetlands and floodplains. This will have a  range of localised impacts to accompany  the broader beneficial effects expected  across the floodplain. These impacts  require assessment and approval under  A vegetative matting solution was  implemented to salvage prime nectar  habitats, stabilise slopes and quickly  revegetate disturbed areas. Existing  habitat was removed in mats during the  fall, stored over winter and re-laid in  the spring.

We aim to apply mātauranga Māori to our  local projects and workstreams while also  liaising with external entities, including  government, iwi and Māori organisations.  We provide internal resources to support  cultural learning on topics such as Māori  language, applying the Te Tiriti o Waitangi  and its principles, and iwi histories and  narratives. We also host monthly learning  sessions for local leadership, focusing  on social interactions with Māori in both  traditional and contemporary settings,  and exploring approaches for engaging,  consulting or co-designing with iwi.   Waitangi Day, Matariki (the Māori New  Year) and Te Wiki o Te Reo Māori (Māori  Language Week) are recognised and  celebrated through online learning  sessions to promote awareness of  mātauranga Māori and kaupapa Māori.

We also engaged with 30 of  our top spend vendors to discuss their  sustainability commitments and progress  in these areas. In Australia, we are committed to  increasing our total annual spend with  Indigenous businesses each year in  addition to growing our supply chain.  Since 2021, we have continued to exceed  our targets. In FY2024, we purchased  goods and services from a total of 126  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  owned businesses to a total procurement  value of AUD 5,600,000, an increase  from AUD 4,300,000 in FY2023. Our sustainable procurement focuses  on creating a more equitable society by  building capacity, increasing economic  opportunities, closing the wealth gap  in our communities and supporting  Indigenous-owned businesses. Supplier  diversity is central to this effort and a key  component of our global Inclusion and  Diversity Strategy. We have integrated our  Sustainability Way principles into both  our Vendor Code of Conduct and vendor  pre-qualification. A diverse supplier is  a business that is at least 51 percent  owned and operated by individuals from  traditionally underrepresented groups. In North America, we are embedding  sustainability into purchasing decisions  as we work to reduce our environmental  impact and promote ethical practices  across our supply chain. In FY2024,  we spent AUD 39,300,000 with diverse  suppliers, including AUD 240,000 with  Indigenous businesses. Additionally, we  set a 2030 target of at least 67 percent  In Aotearoa (New Zealand), we continue  to align with the government’s Broader  Outcomes approach to achieving  broader social, economic, cultural  and environmental outcomes through  procurement. In FY2024, we spent AUD  350,000 with Indigenous businesses  across our New Zealand and Pacific  regions. Our Māori and Pasifika Business  Leader is driving the implementation  of a new supplier diversity roadmap. In  partnership with the supplier diversity  organisation Amotai, this roadmap aims  to achieve a 3 percent minimum spend  with Māori- and/or Pasifika-owned sub- contractors or sub-consultants by the  end of 2026. Through this collaboration,  we strive to bolster the capacity and  capability of the Māori and Pasifika  enterprises we work with, helping to  remove barriers and create opportunities  for their successful tendering of  contracts.

In FY2024, we updated our approach to  high-consequence, low-probability risks,  enhancing consistency in measures to  prevent serious injuries during activities  such as remote work, working at height  and driving.   As driving remains a significant risk for  employees, we updated our Driving and  Vehicle Management Procedure into one  global set of standards to reduce serious  vehicle incidents involving GHD drivers.  Key changes include:  	 →Expanding the prohibition on mobile  device use while the vehicle is in  motion to all global operations.  	 →Requiring driver risk assessments to  identify additional driver training needs.  	 →Incorporating driving assessments into  project planning to manage fatigue and  journey risks.   In FY2024, our Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) was 0.16 per 200,000 hours worked.  While this is an increase from our FY2023 rate, it remains beneath our target maximum of  0.20. Our Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) remained steady at 0.05, reflecting that most of  our recordable incidents were minor injuries. Notwithstanding these low incident rates, we  are focused on reducing our TRIR to previous levels or better.  Our culture of health and safety puts  people — employees, contractors,  partners and the communities where  we live and operate — at the centre  of everything we do. As a core value,  our leaders prioritise health and safety  by setting and modelling behavioural  boundaries and establishing clear policies  and procedures. This commitment  extends throughout the organisation,  empowering everyone to act safely and  stop work if a situation is unsafe. As we complete the fourth year of  our Workplace Health Safety and  Environment (HSE) Strategy (2021– 2025), new opportunities have been  created as we adapted our risk mitigation  processes in response to evolving  risk and optimised HSE and wellbeing  outcomes. This includes strengthening  our HSE approach by fostering closer  connections with other internal  disciplines. Improved collaboration has  resulted in a more holistic HSE strategy  across the organisation. We also further  engaged with employees on matters such  as psychosocial risk.

As of June 2024, this is how we are tracking towards our goal: Gender pay equity We prioritise pay equity to facilitate  equal pay for equal work. Using  regression analysis and various controls  influencing pay, such as job grade,  experience, job function and geographic  location, we closely examine pay across  job families or grade levels to identify  and address unjustified disparities. Our  target is to keep gender pay differences  within a narrow margin of +1 percent to  –1 percent. A pay equity variance, such  as –0.5 percent, indicates that a group  is being paid less than its comparative  group, and addressing these gaps is a  priority.  We made significant progress in this  area across all the countries in which we  operate. In FY2024, our GHD country  median pay equity variance was -1.37  percent.  Promoting transparency and open  dialogue about pay equity has been  key to breaking down barriers and  challenging historical disparities. In  FY2024, we shared pay equity results  with all employees for the first time. This  transparency, along with encouraging  candid conversations and sharing best  practices with leaders and managers, has  empowered our people to drive positive  change and actively champion pay equity  across the organisation.  We strive to implement best practices in  recruitment, hiring and leave policies to  promote fairness and address systemic  inequalities, fostering inclusiveness and  reducing disparities for all. 37.4% 32.8% 24.5% 30.0% 42.2% 45.7% of employees are women of executive leadership  positions held by women  of leadership positions  held by women of senior professional positions  held by women of women at the  professional level of women at entry levels GHD 2024 Sustainability Report  |  65 Executive summary CEO commitment Integrating sustainability Governance Environmental  Social Appendix About GHD Communities  | Human rights  | Indigenous Peoples  | Sustainable procurement  | Philanthropic engagement Empowering people  |  ===== PAGE 66 ===== Average gender pay equity variance percentage *Countries large enough to  be evaluated individually  are included (based on  employee headcount).

Employee Resource Groups Our nine Employee Resource Groups  (ERGs) are voluntary groups where  employees with shared identities or  experiences collaborate, support each  other, celebrate successes and promote  inclusion and diversity in our workplace.  Passionate about I&D, these ERGs also  raise and donate money to support  meaningful charities and community  initiatives. We continue to expand our ERGs to  adapt to regional nuances and shifting  landscapes. In FY2024 we launched a  Neurodiverse (ND) ERG in our UK and  Middle East offices. Aligned with our  ND ERGs in the Americas and across  the Asia Pacific region, the ERG aims to  foster an inclusive and accommodating  work environment and provide support  for our neurodivergent employees,  their managers and employees who are  parents and carers of neurodivergent  children.

This analysis helps us determine the  environmental, social and governance  issues that are most important to our  stakeholders and enables us to identify  sustainability trends and priorities,  respond to internal and external  expectations and shape our strategy and  operational programs in a focused way,  informed by holistic insights and data.  The assessment included GHD  stakeholder workshops, client interviews,  interviews with GHD’s financial services  partners and employee surveys. The  data from this research was used to  create a materiality matrix — a visual  representation of the environmental,  social and governance factors that  are most important to our internal and  external stakeholders. The assessment  shows that the top three priorities for  both external and internal stakeholders  — health and safety, carbon emissions  and business ethics and integrity — span  across the environmental, social and  governance categories. The results are  reflected in our current ESG strategy,  policies and practices. We are committed to updating our  materiality assessment every two to  three years. The next revision will be  undertaken in 2025.

Scale: Somewhat important to extremely  important – axes scaled down to  demonstrate that all factors had some  level of importance to both internal and  external audiences.
