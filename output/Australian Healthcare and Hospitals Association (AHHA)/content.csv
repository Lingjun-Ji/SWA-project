Our purpose is to drive collective action across the healthcare system for reform that improves the health and wellbeing of Australians. Our strategy recognises that health care in Australia should be:  • Outcomes-focused • Evidence-based • Accessible • Equitable • Sustainable • Outcomes-focused • Evidence-based • Accessible • Equitable • Sustainable  ===== PAGE 3 ===== At AHHA we recognise that a shared commitment to universal, high quality healthcare is needed to brings the health system together to drive solutions; and we do that by connecting with our government and service provider partnerships to drive innovative solutions to common challenges.  In 2011,  in  order to bette r inform  national h eal th  policy and a dvocacy  the AHHA established its research arm, t he Deeb le Instit ute  for H ealth Polic y R ese arc h, with the goal to make evidence the cornerst one for  health poli cy develo pmen t in  Australia.

We work diligently to understand how policy both enables and disables such innovation; how we can better provide the flexibility in policy to innovate while still  demonstrating  accountability  to achieve better health outcomes for all Australians. We know that achieving the best possible  health  system  requires connection at the highest level between research,  policy  development  and service delivery. The Hon Jillian Skinner AM Chair AHHA Board This year, the extent to which people can access the health care they need, when they need it, and the capacity of our health system to respond to those needs, has continued to be at the forefront of government and media. This has ranged from a demand for more timely access to emergency medical care as well as elective hospital treatment; to improvements in access to mental health care, aged care and disability services. These pressures threaten economic viability, sustainability, environmental goals and community demands and expectations. With  rapid  technological advancements having the capacity to both  improve  outcomes  and efficiencies, we must be vigilant in how we understand health and wellbeing and invest limited resources. We see each part of the system working  tirelessly  to  drive improvements within their influence. Yet it is critical that each of these parts work together.  4 The Hon Jillian Skinner AM  ===== PAGE 6 ===== Achieving  a  policy  environment  that enables a health system that can deliver the best possible health outcomes for Australians, equitably and sustainably, requires constant and collective effort. This year, on the 40th anniversary of Medicare, we remembered the significant impact its establishment has had and the remarkable efforts of Prof John Deeble and Dr Dick Scotton in driving this reform. Such reform doesn’t happen overnight. And while we have not seen this level of policy reform since, we did see progress in key policy areas for which we have been long-standing advocates.  One of these areas was the commitment to the data and digital infrastructure that will allow us to better understand the care pathway for people and the outcomes they achieve. This includes 5-year plans for  healthcare  identifiers  and interoperability. Another was the establishment of a National Health and Climate Strategy. Having been a founding member of the Climate and Health Alliance and the Global Green and Healthy Hospitals Network in our region, we’ve continued to support the connection  of  research,  policy  and practice to address critical sustainability issues, such as low value care and the role of health technology assessments. Chief Executive's report THE VOICE OF PUBLIC HEALTHCARE 5 As we look to the years ahead, we are hopeful about the shift across the sector to focus on outcomes over activity and the opportunities that will come with embracing the skills of different parts of our workforce through multidisciplinary teams – both also areas for which we advocate and where we are seeing national policy starting to explore.

Cassandra Bennett Memorial Lecture AHHA Chair Hon Jillian Skinner Cassandra Bennett (1980-2023) THE VOICE OF PUBLIC HEALTHCARE 8  ===== PAGE 10 ===== As we mark the 40th anniversary of Medicare and the negotiations for the new National  Health  Reform  Agreements commence, it is time for all governments in Australia to reflect on the principles on which  Medicare  was  founded:  equity, efficiency, simplicity and universality. These founding principles were close to heart for the co-architects of Medicare, Professor John Deeble and Doctor Dick Scotton, who were determined to provide Australians with a dependable and equitable healthcare system. As we  mar k the  40th anni versary  of  Med icare and the negotiations for the new Nat iona l He al th Re form Ag ree ments  com men ce, it is time for all governments in Austr alia to  reflect o n the prin ciples on w h ich Medicare was founded: equity, efficienc y, s implici ty and uni versali ty. These  foun din g prin ciple s were close  to h ea rt for  the  co- archi tects of Me dicare, Pro fessor John Deeble and Doctor Dick Scotton , w ho  were determ ine d to  provi de Au st ralians  with a dep endable a nd eq uitabl e health care  system. AHHA has be en for tun ate enough t o have work ed closely with Professor John Deeble, who was  a life member  of AHHA a nd th e name sake of  our Deeble Institute for Health Policy Research. Professor Deeble was a steadfast defender of universal health care for nearly 50 years, having been troubled seeing people refused health treatment because they could not afford it. With  this in mi nd, it’s un fortuna te tha t we st ill see  ou r most vu lnerable  Australians experiencing poorer health ou tcom es,  of ten as a conse quenc e of n ot b e ing able to access healthcare services in a ti mely manner. This undermines Medicare’s original principles of universality and equity. Increasing  costs of tec hnology,  rising ou t- of-pocket costs, long waiting lists, and b ulk -billi ng ra tes declinin g a lso means  that  the principle of efficiency is being unde rmined. The com plex ity a nd siloed n atur e of the  health system is becoming routinely recognised amongst experts and the public and is no longer stated with alarm but a simple fact, hence the principle of simplicity is being undermined. Universal health c are, through Medicare, is a much-loved feature of our Australian way of life. This anniversary is not just about reflecting on how Medicare can be reformed to achieve better health for Australians, it’s about reflecting on how we can reinforce the kind of health care that Australians want, and honouring the legacy and principles on which Medicare was founded. Now is the time to revisit the o riginal foundational principles of Medicare.

Research outputs  Policy impact : Carer wellbeing Dr Natalie Winter | 2023 Deeble Scholar Research Fellow, Deakin University    Approximately 10% of Australians provide unpaid care to family or friends living with chronic illness or disability, saving $77.9 billion in healthcare expenditure in 2020 alone. Carers experience negative impacts on their physical, mental, social and financial status as a result of their caring role.    However, limited support in the community is resulting in poor health and wellbeing outcomes for carers.    Policy influence following publication of the Issues Brief, Prioritising carer's health and wellbeing in the healthcare system was identified as having political, systems wide and academic impact.  For example, evidence from the Brief was provided to the Inquiry into the recognition of unpaid carers, House of Representatives Standing Committee, Australian Parliament House, with recommendations taken up in the Recognising, valuing and supporting unpaid carers report.

The international movement of value-based  health care (VBHC) presents a structured,  whole of system approach to bring all parts of  the system together to drive transformational  reform that addresses the complex interplay  of the issues undermining sustainability.  Both internationally and here in Australia,  there are numerous definitions, theories, and  approaches to achieving value in health care.  However, all agree that VBHC is about  achieving the best possible outcomes for  people with the lowest use of resources,  through providing a framework for evidence- based, person-centred decision making.   Recognising the great value of sharing and  learning in driving the cultural change  necessary to support VBHC implementation,  the Australian Healthcare and Hospitals  Association’s (AHHA), Australian Centre for  Value Based Health Care, held the VBHC  Congress 2023. This was followed by a two- week roadshow exploring VBHC  implementation in remote, rural and  metropolitan locations across Australia.  International leader and early adopter of a  whole of system VBHC approach, Dr Sally  Lewis, National Clinical Director for Value  Based Healthcare at the Welsh Value in Health  Centre, NHS Wales, was invited to join both  the Congress and roadshow to reflect on the  experience of VBHC implementation across  Wales.   More advanced in its implementation, the  Welsh model of VBHC presents an iterative  data-driven, evidence-based, outcomes  focused approach to VBHC, built on the  principles of equity, sustainability, and  partnerships. This model resonated strongly  with Australian audiences, highlighting an  opportunity to harness leanings from Wales,  to support VBHC operationalisation within the  Australian policy context.  This Perspective Brief reflects on the  conversations held throughout the Congress  and roadshow, comparing the Welsh and  Australian experience of exploring and  implementing VBHC. Through considering the  Welsh experience of VBHC within the policy  context of Australia, a number of learnings  emerged for Australia in the Welsh priority  areas of:  • digital health, • person-centred care, • research impact and evaluation; and • strategic partnerships. 1  ===== PAGE 5 ===== Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30  Background In late October 2023, Dr Sally Lewis, National  Clinical Director for Value Based Healthcare at  the Welsh Value in Health Centre, National  Health Service (NHS) Wales, joined the  Australian Healthcare and Hospitals  Association’s (AHHA) Australian Centre for  Value-Based Health Care (VBHC) for the VBHC  Congress 2023, as special guest and keynote  speaker.   As an international leader and early adopter of  a whole of system VBHC approach, Dr Lewis  was invited to address the over 200 health  system leaders gathered in Brisbane to reflect  on the experience of VBHC implementation in  Wales, a universal health system facing similar  pressures as Australia, and to highlight  learnings applicable to the Australian context.    Following the Congress, Dr Lewis joined AHHA  CEO, Kylie Woolcock and Manager of the  Australian Centre for VBHC, Emma Hoban, on  a two-week roadshow across eastern Australia  exploring VBHC implementation in remote,  rural and metropolitan locations (Figure 1).   Throughout the roadshow, discussions centred  on the sustainability challenges impacting  health systems and the opportunities  presented by VBHC as a framework to address  the complex wicked problems undermining  improvements in outcomes.   Further along in its journey towards VBHC, the  Welsh model of VBHC implementation  resonated with the various stakeholders across  Australia. It presents a data-driven approach  to shifting the culture of health care to focus  on improving the outcomes that matter to  people and communities at the levels of the  individual (micro), the pathway (meso) and the  population (macro) (Lewis, 2022).   The Congress and roadshow highlighted the  growing interest and momentum in Australia  that is propelling the VBHC agenda forward,  though there is still much work to do.  This Perspective Brief reflects on the  conversations held throughout the Congress  and roadshow. It begins by outlining the  problem, considers how we have tried to solve  the problem and the journey to VBHC in both  Australia and Wales, before identifying some  of the critical components of the Welsh model  of VBHC implementation and reflecting on  what we can learn from the Welsh experience  to embed a nationally-connected approach to  VBHC within the context of Australia.  Figure 1: VBHC Roadshow locations  2  ===== PAGE 6 ===== Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30  The problem  The sustainability of healthcare systems  around the world is under threat, with the way  we deliver care facing similar pressures  worldwide. Costs are rising at an unsustainable  rate, we have increasingly depleted,  demoralised and burnt out workforces, and in  the developed world we are operating within  outdated systems that were designed for a  very different set of needs (episodic acute  illness) than the ones our populations are  currently experiencing (complex chronic  conditions and multi-morbidity) (Lewis, 2022;  Department of Health and Aged Care, 2019;  Hurst et al., 2019).  Threats to the sustainability of health systems  • Escalating healthcare costs. • Expensive technologies. • Outdated information and digital systems. • Changing community expectations of what the healthcare system is capable of / responsible for. • Ageing populations and increasing comorbidities. • Climate change. • Workforce shortages, skill-mix imbalances, maldistribution and change management capacity. • Focus on volume rather than value. Globally, a persistent focus on the volume of  healthcare activity, rather than the wellness  outcomes being achieved, challenges  investment decisions at all levels of the  system, driving overdiagnosis, low value care  and fragmentation of service provision  (McCreanor, 2017; Bedlington et al., 2021;  Cutler, 2022).   These challenges are felt most acutely by  people who are already experiencing  marginalisation, disadvantage and negative  social determinants of health (Baker, Adams &  Steel, 2021).  Significant inequities persist, both in terms of  access to care and clinical outcomes (Lewis,  2022; Department of Treasury, 2023), with the  impacts of climate change set to multiply  these inequities and place an increasing  burden on healthcare systems globally (IPCC,  2022).   The carbon footprint of health care is  significant (4% of global CO2 emissions,  equivalent to the fifth largest emitter if it were  a country) (Karliner et al., 2019), contributing  to the growing climate crisis and undermining  the fundamental principle of medicine and  health systems to ‘do no harm’ (Department  of Health and Aged Care, 2023a).  New technologies and artificial intelligence  have the capacity to improve outcomes and  efficiencies, but also risk increasing low value  care and further entrenching existing  inequalities and systemic biases (O'Reilly-Jacob  et al, 2021).     Fundamentally, it is increasingly becoming  apparent that the outcomes that matter to  people, communities and health systems are  not improving at a rate that matches  investment (Lewis, 2022; Bedlington et al.,  2021).  3  ===== PAGE 7 ===== Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30  The solution  Various movements have emerged around the  world to try and tackle the challenges of health  system sustainability (Lewis, 2022; Hurst et al.,  2019). Examples include prudent health care  in Wales (Bevan Commission, 2015; Welsh  Government, 2019a), realistic medicine in  Scotland (Realistic Medicine, 2023; Scottish  Government, 2022), slow medicine in Italy  (Bonaldi & Vernero, 2015), or the international  initiative Choosing Wisely (The  Commonwealth Fund, 2019).   Yet, these movements often solely target  health professionals, or are focused on a  specific element of the problem such as  reducing unwarranted variation or embedding  shared decision making between professionals  and people receiving care (Lewis, 2022).   While these initiatives have raised awareness  of important issues in some circles, they have  not proved sufficient to address the complex  interplay of factors undermining health system  sustainability around the world.   An all-encompassing, whole of system shift is  needed to truly tackle the wicked sustainability  issues (financial, environmental, workforce)  impacting health systems globally which is  bigger than any one profession, clinical  movement, state or nation can manage in  isolation (Lewis, 2022).   The transformational change needed to  deliver a sustainable health system requires  structured consideration of the system as a  whole – challenging the processes by which  we manage, deliver and fund care.   Service providers, system stewards, consumers  and stakeholders need to act collectively to  transparently prioritise the investment of  resources, directing them to where the  greatest impact will be achieved, and shifting  the system to drive better outcomes, not just  more activity occurring in silos (AHHA, 2021).  VBHC presents a structured approach to bring  all the various movements and stakeholders  across the system together to drive  transformational reform. Through reorienting  all players, at all levels of the system, to focus  on the collective goal of improving the  outcomes that matter to people and  communities, VBHC presents a whole of  system approach to addressing the complex  interplay of issues undermining sustainability.  4  ===== PAGE 8 ===== Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30  International movements targeting health system sustainability challenges.   Prudent Healthcare, Wales (Bevan Commission, 2015; Welsh Government, 2019a) – is defined as  ‘healthcare which is conceived, managed and delivered in a cautious and wise way, characterised by  forethought, vigilance and careful budgeting which achieves tangible benefits and quality outcomes for  patients’. The principles of prudent healthcare are:  • Achieve health and wellbeing with the public, patients and professionals as equal partners through co-production. • Care for those with the greatest health need first, making the most effective use of all skills and resources. • Do only what is needed, no more, no less; and do no harm. • Reduce inappropriate variation using evidence-based practices consistently and transparently. Realistic Medicine, Scotland (Realistic Medicine, 2023; Scottish Government, 2022) – provides the  health care that people truly value. It is about putting people at the centre of their care and listening  to what matters to them to ensure the right care is provided at the right time. It allows the delivery of  care and treatment that people value as well as reducing inappropriate care. Realistic medicine is  achieved through practicing the six pillars:  • Shared decision making. • Personalised approach to care. • Reduce harm and waste. • Reduce unwarranted variation. • Managing risk better. • Become improvers and innovators. Slow Medicine, Italy (Bonaldi & Vernero, 2015) – is inspired by the slow food movement and is focused  on promoting processes of care based on appropriateness in the context of listening, dialogue and  decision sharing with patients. It promotes balance and prioritises time with patients to counter the  emphasis on speed and throughput in health care that can reduce quality. Three key principles underpin  the slow medicine movement:  • Measured: to act with moderation, gradually and without waste. • Respectful: a commitment to preserving the dignity and values of each person. • Equitable: ensuring access to appropriate care for all. Choosing Wisley, international (The Commonwealth Fund, 2019; Choosing Wisley Australia, n.d) – an  international movement, originating in the US in 2012 and now in over 20 countries, to advance a  national dialogue about how to avoid unnecessary medical tests, treatments and procedures. Choosing  Wisely in Australia is governed by six core principles:  • Health profession-led. • Clear emphasis on improving quality of care and on harm prevention. • Multidisciplinary. • Consumer-focused communication between health professionals and consumers. • Evidence-based. 5  ===== PAGE 9 ===== Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30  Value-Based Health Care (VBHC) What is VBHC?  VBHC originated in the United States of  America (USA) where its creators Professors  Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg (Porter  & Teisberg, 2006) conceptualised value in  health care as ‘the measured improvement in  a patient’s health outcomes for the cost of  achieving that improvement’ reflected in  terms of the value equation (figure 2)  (Teisberg, Wallace & O’Hara, 2020; Porter &  Teisberg, 2006).   Figure 2: The value equation (Porter and  Teisberg, 2006).   However, as the movement has grown and is  increasingly being adopted in systems founded  on the principles of universal health coverage,  such as public value and equity, the need to  consider community and population health  and social, environmental, and cultural  outcomes in the conceptualisation of VBHC  has arisen (Verhoeven et al., 2020; Hoban,  Woolcock & Haddock, 2021).   In the context of finite resources, it is not  possible for everyone to get exactly what they  want, when they want it. Value judgements  must be made about where to prioritise  resources to ensure equity, protect system  sustainability and improve outcomes  (Bedlington., 2021).  As such, understandings and definitions of  VBHC in some contexts have evolved to reflect  the idea of ‘resource use’ rather than ‘costs’  (Hurst et al., 2019), with implementation  approaches focused on creating an enabling  environment that supports decision making  about the deployment of resources at the  macro (population health), meso (pathways of  care) and micro (person-centred care) levels of  the system (Bedlington et al., 2021; Lewis,  2022).  As various jurisdictions around the world have  pursued value in health, it has also increasingly  become apparent that to successfully  implement VBHC, our understanding and  definitions of VBHC must be attuned to  context and circumstance, reflecting local  nuance and recognising social, cultural and  organisational complexity (Papoutsi,  Greenhalgh & Marjanovic, 2024). The Oxford  Centre for Evidence Based Medicine  recognises value ‘as a relationship between  resources, outcomes and context.’ (Hurst et  al., 2019) To embed value, we must focus on  all aspects of this relationship.  Both internationally and here in Australia,  there are numerous definitions, theories and  approaches to achieving value in health care.  However, all agree that VBHC is about  achieving the best possible outcomes for  people with the lowest use of resources,  through providing a framework for evidence- based, person-centred healthcare decision  making.   As highlighted in the Queensland Health Allied  Health Framework for VBHC (Queensland  Government, 2022), ‘VBHC is a way of  6  ===== PAGE 10 ===== Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30  thinking, not a strict process that must be  followed’. It presents a mindset shift, a lens  through which we can take a whole of system  helicopter view and begin to tackle some of  the entrenched wicked problems undermining  the sustainability of health systems by  pursuing the shared goal of improving the  outcomes that matter to people and  communities.  Conceptualisation of VBHC at different levels of the system  Macro  In the increasingly constrained fiscal environment where each dollar spent in the healthcare system  must be justified and add value, the collection, aggregation and use of meaningful outcomes data  at the population level is critical to informing investment decisions. Aggregation of data at the  population level provides a view of whole of system performance, enabling comparisons across  organisations and services to inform decision making (Bedlington et al., 2021). Outcomes data  enables generation of real-world evidence to drive efficient, effective and equitable allocation of  scarce resources (Lewis, 2022).  Meso  For value to be achieved there needs to be the optimum allocation of resources and optimised  interventions across the whole pathway of care from prevention through to end of life. The meso  level brings together individual data inputs at the level of a health condition, for example diabetes  or heart failure, bringing together clinical, process, outcomes and cost data to inform decision  making (Bedlington et al., 2021). Aggregating data at the meso level enables the identification of,  and disinvestment in areas of low value care, and the reinvestment of saved resources in high value  areas of the pathway to drive improvements (Lewis, 2022).  Micro  VBHC highlights the importance of shifting ingrained health system cultures to one that values and  promotes the relationship between people and health professionals as that of an equal partnership  in the delivery of care. The micro level is about creating the conditions, and collecting the data, that  will enable the therapeutic relationship to thrive at the level of the consultation (Lewis, 2022). Goal  setting is a key component of this, facilitating the development of individualised care plans built  around what is important to the person receiving care (Bedlington et al., 2021). Measurement at  the micro level must be simple and meaningful to both individuals and clinicians, providing the right  information to enable patients and clinical teams to plot a treatment pathway that will deliver on  the outcomes that matter. Clinicians must be supported to consider the goals and preferences of  individuals alongside clinical guidelines, and then practice the gentlest form of medicine to achieve  the desired outcome (Lewis, 2022).  7  ===== PAGE 11 ===== Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30  VBHC in Wales  Wales is a country of 3.2 million people which  has a universal health system overarchingly  coordinated through NHS Wales (devolved  from other NHS systems in the UK) (Institute  for Government, 2020), and made up of 7 local  integrated health boards (Figure 3), 3 NHS  trusts, 14 NHS Wales Organisations and 64  general practice clusters (NHS Wales, n.d.-a).   Figure 3. Welsh Integrated Health Boards (NHS  Wales, n.d-a.).   Local health boards have responsibility for  planning and delivering NHS services in their  area including dental, optical, pharmacy and  mental health. NHS trusts look after public  health, ambulance services, cancer and blood  services (NHS Wales, 2020).  VBHC in Wales originated as an informal  grassroots movement, as an implementation  mechanism for the philosophy and policy of  prudent health care, first launched in 2014  (Welsh Value in Health Centre, n.d.-b).  In 2018 the Welsh Government launched A  Healthier Wales (Welsh Government, 2018), a  plan for the health and social care of the  nation. It outlined the need for health services  to change and become fit to meet the evolving  needs of communities and deliver better  health outcomes for all. ‘One key component  in this plan was to improve value for patients  by giving a greater focus to the outcomes that  matter to individuals and considering their  relation to the costs of achieving those  outcomes.’ (Welsh Value in Health Centre,  n.d.-a; Welsh Government, 2018). The release of this strategy created a hook for the VBHC movement to build momentum and secure executive buy-in within services, ensuring local strategic support and resourcing to enable VBHC projects to flourish (Lewis, 2024). The position of National Clinical Lead for value- based healthcare was established in 2019,  signalling formal government commitment to  the movement (Welsh Government, 2019b). A  small team and program of work developed  from there, creating momentum and  eventually securing support for the  establishment of the Welsh Value in Health  Centre in 2021 (Lewis 2024; Welsh Value in  Health Centre, n.d.-b). This also enabled the  foundation to be laid for the Intensive  Learning Academy for Value-Based Health and  Care, dedicated to formal VBHC education  (Welsh Government, 2024).  The mission of the Welsh Value in Health  Centre is ‘to provide leadership, support,  expertise and strategic direction across NHS  Wales that drives better outcomes for patients  in a way that is sustainable in the long term.’  (Welsh Value in Health Centre, 2023a).  8  ===== PAGE 12 ===== Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30  Key to the Welsh approach to VBHC is to  identify opportunities to embed a value-based  approach at every stage of the healthcare  pathway, from prevention through to end of  life (Welsh Value in Health Centre, 2023a).  Partnerships across professions, conditions,  sectors, departments (e.g. finance, digital,  medical) and globally have been critical to  enabling this.  VBHC in Wales has been conceptualised  through the macro (population health), meso  (pathways of care) and micro (person-centred  care) approach with opportunities for  optimisation identified and supported across  all levels.  Figure 4: A whole pathway approach to delivering value in healthcare (Welsh Value in Health Centre 2023a)   9  ===== PAGE 13 ===== Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30  Optimisation of Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) across the Welsh health system  (adapted from the Welsh Value in Health Centre., 2023b).  What are PROMs?  Patient Reported Outcome Measures, or PROMs, are questionnaires that provide a ‘structured  communication between a person receiving care and their clinical team, through delivering a  standardised response about symptom burden and quality of life’ (Welsh Value in Health Centre  2023b).  How PROMs can be used to drive value?  At the Macro level  • Looking at the data with a national focus. • For population health. o To assess a population’s needs and understand where those needs are met. To identify where resources need to be directed. • For research. o PROMs data can support research in a variety of areas, for example in the uptake of technology, or when looking at treatment options. • For evaluation. o PROMs can help us understand how a service is impacting patients. For example, is the new service working? Is it providing what patients want, and more importantly, is it helping to deliver the outcomes that patients want? • For real world evidence. o To work towards real time data though the collection of a data set with real world evidence. • For policy makers. o At the macro level, PROMs mean policy makers see the whole picture, providing the evidence for them to invest appropriately in communities to support them to live healthy lives, plan future services and help develop current services. PROMS also contribute towards the ability to compare performance across hospitals and health services to drive quality and improvements. At the Meso level  • Service improvement and service planning. o By collecting at scale and in the correct way, we can see the opportunities to improve care and treatment at the service level. For example, identifying unwarranted variation in a treatment. • Resource allocation. o Aggregated PROMs can highlight unmet need in terms of high symptom burden. 10  ===== PAGE 14 ===== Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30  At the Micro level  • In direct care. o Provides a needs assessment. o Enables shared-decision making. o Gives structure to a consultation. o Allows patients to consider what matters to them the most. o Helps facilitate the discussion around difficult or sensitive issues. o Serves as a remote monitoring tool. o Helps manage patient expectations and is a two-way process, with the clinician and patient building a relationship around the patient’s desired outcomes. VBHC in Australia – a national approach  In line with the Welsh experience, VBHC in  Australia also originated as a grassroots  movement with health care leaders and  professionals seeking solutions to address the  growing sustainability issues undermining the  system (Figure 5).   Throughout 2017, Australian health leaders  came together to discuss how to transform  health care into a fit for purpose, 21st century  system that could meet the needs and  expectations of Australians.   The result was the ‘Healthy people, healthy  systems’ blueprint for health reform, which  mapped out a transformation agenda to  reorient the system through focusing on  outcomes and value (AHHA, 2021).   While states and territories were pursuing  value, federal engagement with the concept  became prominent in 2018 with the signing of  the Heads of Agreement between the  Commonwealth and the States and Territories  on public hospitals funding and health reform  (ratified in 2020), which demonstrated a  commitment across all levels of government to  the principles of VBHC and to ‘paying for value  and outcomes’ (COAG, 2018).  In 2019, the Australian Centre for VBHC was  established by the AHHA to bring stakeholders  from across the health system together to  drive collective action on VBHC to improve the  health outcomes of Australians for the  resources available, sustainably and equitably  (Australian Centre for VBHC, 2019). Since its  inception, the Australian Centre for VBHC has  driven the value agenda though supporting  educational and training opportunities, events  and conferences, providing implementation  support and advocating for enabling policies at  the federal, state and territory level (Australian  Centre for VBHC, 2019).  The AHHA recognises that a mix of top-down,  bottom-up, centralised and decentralised  approaches are needed to support the  operationalisation and implementation of  VBHC across Australia. As such, the Australian  Centre for VBHC has adopted a connecting  role, working in partnership with services to  support networked problem solving and  develop collective intelligence that is  connected into, and can inform, the policy  environment.  11  ===== PAGE 15 ===== Perspectives brief No: 30  Transforming for value-based health care Figure 5. The role of AHHA and the Australian Centre for VBHC in supporting the operationalisation of VBHC across Australia. 12  ===== PAGE 16 ===== Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30  In 2021, the National Health Reform Long- term Health Reforms roadmap (Australian  Health Ministers, 2021) extended the  commitment made by all levels of government  to driving value, reflecting the principles of  VBHC in its identified areas of reform,  including:   • nationally cohesive Health Technology Assessment, • paying for value and outcomes, • joint planning and funding at a local level, • empowering people through health literacy, • prevention and wellbeing, • enhanced health data; and • interfaces between health, disability and aged care systems. VBHC reform is also aligned with many other  key national policy priorities in Australia. Australian policy priorities that align with the VBHC agenda  • Measuring What Matters, Australia’s national wellbeing framework putting ‘people at the core of our thinking’ (Department of Treasury, 2023). • National Health Reform Agreement (NHRA) Mid-Term Review, recommendations align with the pursuit of VBHC (Huxtable, 2023). • National Preventive Health Strategy 2021-2030, and its requirement for collective and comprehensive effort across sectors (Department of Health and Aged Care, 2021). • Strengthening Medicare Taskforce Report, containing recommendations for a structured and outcomes-focused approach to increasing access to primary care, multidisciplinary team-based care, and supporting change management and cultural change (Strengthening Medicare Taskforce, 2022). • National Healthcare Interoperability Plan, supporting the effective use of data that will be possible with interoperability (Australian Digital Health Agency, 2023). • National Health and Climate Strategy, encouraging services to tackle unwarranted variation in providing appropriate care (Department of Health and Aged Care, 2023a). • National Consumer Engagement Strategy for Health and Wellbeing, being developed to engage consumers in the design and development of health and wellbeing programs (Department of Health and Aged Care, 2023c). • Health Technology Assessment Policy and Methods Review, with a need for value in real world adoption (Department of Health and Aged Care, 2023d). • Digital Health Blueprint and Action Plan 2023-2033, which seek to advance efficient, flexible, value-based models of health care, providing better patient outcomes (Department of Health and Aged Care, 2023b). • National Digital Health Strategy and Delivery Roadmap, placing people at the centre of a modern, connected and digitally enabled healthcare system (Australian Digital Health Agency, 2024b). • Various workforce reviews and plans, with value only achieved through considering the workforce as a whole, not within professional silos (Department of Health and Aged Care, 2023e; Department of Health and Aged Care, 2023f; Department of Health, 2022). 13  ===== PAGE 17 ===== Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30  Lessons from VBHC in Wales  The following compares the Welsh and  Australian experience of exploring and  implementing VBHC. Our reflections are based  on discussions held at the VBHC Congress, and  throughout the roadshow.  Listening to and learning from other systems  as a source of ideas and evidence is a well- known form of policy development, known as  policy transfer (Mossberger & Wolman, 2003).  However, no two health systems are the same  and there are some critical differences  between the Welsh and Australian health  system, in particular the federated nature of  the Australian system with divided  responsibilities between state, territory and  national government compared to a nationally  governed system in Wales. Yet, there are also  many similarities in the pressure and structural  issues that both systems face; including for  example, fragmentation between primary and  secondary care, an ageing and shrinking  workforce, a shift toward specialist rather than  generalist care, and the rapid influx of AI and  new technologies.   It is recognised that understanding the  structures, context and cultural factors unique  to each country is critical when considering  how learnings from Wales can be applied in  Australia.    We have aligned our discussion to the four  initial focus areas identified by the Welsh  Value in Health Centre (2023a):  • digital health, • person-centred care, • research impact and evaluation, • strategic partnerships. Conversation around these focus areas  occurred frequently as we travelled around  the country reflecting their importance as  initial priorities and enablers when seeking to  explore a coordinated approach to VBHC  implementation.   We recognise that the Welsh model has now  expanded its areas of focus to also include  implementation across Wales; and  communication, engagement and education.  14  ===== PAGE 18 ===== Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30  Digital health  The Welsh approach  VBHC demands a digitally enabled and data- informed approach to decision making at all  levels, whether that is to support shared  decision making in consultations, for quality  improvement in a service, for resource  allocation or for research (Lewis, 2022).  In Wales, digital health has been recognised as  of vital importance to VBHC in the following  ways (Welsh Value in Health Centre, 2023a):  • To drive a coordinated approach to patient-facing technology, in support of new models of care and PROM collection. • To build the data infrastructure and cultural shift towards outcomes focused decision making. Digital health is recognised as a critical enabler  of driving the cultural change necessary to  embed VBHC as business as usual. Through  collecting and acquiring outcomes and  triangulating data as evidence, the Welsh  Value in Health Centre has been able to gather  and generate insights to drive learning and  support value-based decision making at the  macro, meso and micro levels (Welsh Value in  Health Centre, 2023a).  Key areas of work that have been prioritised to  build a consistent and coordinated digital  health infrastructure to support VBHC include:  PROMs Standard Operating Model (PSOM) - It  was recognised early that to effectively  implement VBHC, timely and consistent  PROMs would be critical to support the  seamless aggregation, comparison and  benchmarking of data. Time and resources  have therefore been invested in the  development of a PROMs Standard Operating  Model (PSOM). This has enabled a common  approach to the capture and use of patient  reported outcomes across Wales, from  software to support direct care through to the  development of interoperability and data  standards. This has allowed health boards to  make more informed decisions about where  resources should be directed (Welsh Value in  Health Centre, 2023a).   Data standards – A critical component of this  work has been the development of data  standards for nationally approved PROM  standard sets. In partnership with Health  Boards and Trusts, pathway guides have been  developed which set out minimum standards  for collection points and provide supporting  information across the different care and  condition pathways (Welsh Value in Health  Centre, 2023a).   Digital enablement – In partnership with  industry and CEDAR (NHS Wales Centre for  Health Care Innovation, Device Assessment  and Research), work has been undertaken to  develop and deliver digital care structures for  nationally approved PROMs. These detailed  documents specify what data should be  collected, when this should occur and how it  should be coded, ensuring a consistent  approach to PROMs collection across Wales to  inform analysis and decision making (Welsh  Value in Health Centre, 2023a; NHS Wales  n.d.-b). PROMs Outcome Collection Framework – The  framework supports decision making at the  service level through providing a structured  approach to PROMs service procurement  15  ===== PAGE 19 =====                                              Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30   processes, ensuring Health Boards and Trusts  have accesses to suppliers that meet PSOM  specifications (Welsh Value in Health Centre,  2023a).    Data dashboards – In partnership with  clinicians, the creation and sharing of national  digital dashboards across NHS Wales has  allowed more transparent access to health  data. Work persists on these dashboards to  enrich them with further data (e.g. PROMs) as  it becomes available (Welsh Value in Health  Centre, 2023a).   Significant learning has informed this work  with it recognised that the collection, pulling  and storing of data is just the beginning. Work  is now underway to use the data collected to  drive insights, ensuring the right information is  in the hands of the right person at the right  time to drive value-based decision making  (Welsh Value in Health Centre, 2023a).    Reflections on Australia  Australia lags behind Wales in investing in, and  progressing, a consistent approach to digital  health and data collection, particularly when it  comes to data sharing and interoperability. It  is recognised that digital health and data are  key components of achieving high-quality,  high-value, safe and equitable care (Australian  Digital Health Agency, 2018). However,  bringing together information from different  sources in a way that is easy to understand  and act on has been a challenge (Hardie et al.,  2022).    As in Wales, a substantial volume of data is  collected across the Australian health system.  The work of the Australian Institute of Health  and Welfare (AIHW) (AIHW, 2023a) and the  Australian Commission on Safety and Quality  in Healthcare (ACSQHC) (ACSQHC, 2023a), as  well as state-based agencies, continues to  provide important population level insights  and ongoing improvements in our  understanding of variation.  However, while Australia’s data linkage  capability has grown substantially over the  past 50 years (Smith, & Flack., 2021), for  example through efforts led by NSW Health to  facilitate system wide data linkage (NSW  Government, 2024), in most cases, healthcare  data remains steadfastly siloed.   Additionally, there are still many challenges to  the implementation of a holistic and  consistent data and digital health  infrastructure that facilitates real-time access  to information (Zurynski, et al., 2020; Hardie.,  et al., 2022). This is due to challenges in  stakeholder and community support, complex  legal and ethical environments, difficulties of  cross-jurisdictional collaborations, and a lack  of continuous financial investment (Smith, &  Flack., 2021).   Vested interests, workforce shortages and  entrenched business models are also seen to  limit progress and innovation (Productivity  commission., 2022), with competition for  funding, resources and patients as a source of  income, disincentivising engagement with  collaborative digital enablement and data  sharing processes.   A critical example of this is My Health Record,  which in principle, provided an opportunity to  centralise sharing of information between  clinicians but has so far been ineffective in  building collaborative capacity due to low  submission rates by health providers  contributing to the perception of patchy and  out of date content (Burton, 2022: McMillan,  2020).    16  ===== PAGE 20 =====                                              Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30   There is an increasing recognition within the  health community of the importance of  embedding digital systems that support  outcomes data collection. Yet the lack of a  clear, consistent and resourced approach,  supported by interoperable digital  infrastructure and information, means that  many healthcare providers are going it alone  (Appendix 1: Castle, 2022), limiting the  significant efficiencies and learnings that come  with the sharing, spread and scale of initiatives  (Papoutsi, Greenhalgh & Marjanovic, 2024).   Funding models that are tied to activity rather  than outcomes are also inhibiting the ability of  the system to shift to a digitally enabled,  outcome driven approach (NSW Legislative  Council., 2022). For example, in a roadshow  anecdote, we heard about a state and federal  government, pooled funding diabetes initiative  in which funding was tied to the process of  assessment rather than the outcome. People  within the community were receiving a  diabetes assessment, but the incentives within  the system did not drive access to the  supports they needed – as identified in the  assessment. While the funding was being  spent, it was not driving real change in the  outcomes that mattered to those people, nor  was it generating savings to the system  through supporting prevention and early  intervention.   This example highlights the need within the  Australian context, for a stronger focus on  collecting and understanding outcomes data,  and using this to drive real impact.   Australia could adopt a similar approach to  Wales by investing in and supporting the  collection of PROMs and other outcome  measures, and in the development of  interoperable digital systems to support and  generate insights that inform decision making  at the macro, meso and micro levels (Welsh  Value in Health Centre, 2023a).   While the ACSQHC have undertaken work to  curate a validated lists of PROMs to support  uptake in the Australian context (ACSQHC  2023b), the list is narrow in scope and there is  limited awareness of its existence within the  sector. It does, however, highlight an  important signal that the government and  institutions that govern our health system are  recognising the importance of a more  outcomes driven approach to data collection  in Australia.   We are continuing to see a strengthened  commitment from the Commonwealth to a  more interoperable health system. This has  been shown through the release of the  National Healthcare Interoperability Plan  2023-2023 (Australian Digital Health Agency,  2023), National Digital Health Strategy 2023- 2028 and delivery roadmap (Australian Digital  Health Agency, 2024b) and the Digital Health  Blueprint and Action Plan 2023-2033  (Department of Health and Aged Care, 2023b).   The Digital Health Blueprint articulates a  vision for ‘trusted, timely and accessible use of  digital and data [that] underpins a  personalised and connected health and  wellbeing experience for all Australians’ with a  key outcome to ‘advance efficient, flexible,  value-based models of health care, providing  better patient outcomes’ (Department of  Health and Aged Care, 2023b).      The National Health Reform Agreement  (NHRA) Mid-Term Review also identifies digital  health as a priority (Huxtable, 2023). The Mid- Term Review recommends that a future  Agreement should ‘encourage appropriate  17  ===== PAGE 21 =====                                              Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30   data collection, curation and analysis of health  data assets to make the health system more  efficient and enhance equity and patient  outcomes’ (Huxtable, 2023). While the  Commonwealth has not indicated intent to  adopt all the recommendations of the review,  the prioritisation of digital health highlights an  additional policy level signal for the digital  health reform that is needed.  While announcements such as these show  intention, it is unclear if they will result in  tangible and meaningful action. COVID-19  taught us that rapid digital enablement is  possible and that our communities will adapt  and respond (Dyda et al., 2021).   We can no longer hide behind the excuse of  digital literacy as the people that move  through our health system are increasingly  being trained by other industries to use and  expect digitally enabled, interoperable  systems. For example, digital banking systems  connect and secure our private financial  information, airlines rapidly share our data  across national and international jurisdictions,  and online shopping platforms collect and  store our preferences once, and then generate  tailored recommendations to meet them.   Data from the Digital Health Blueprint  highlights that 69% of consumers and 85% of  health professionals agree or strongly agree  that they are comfortable trying new  technologies (Department of Health and Aged  Care, 2023b). So, while equity and ensuring  access through literacy must always be at the  forefront of our minds when designing and  implementing digital solutions, we are  increasingly seeing a community that is  comfortable and expects digital health  infrastructure and interoperable data systems.   It is time we rise to meet these expectations. Lessons for Australia  •  Consistent and coordinated digital health infrastructure and an enhanced digitally  interoperable system are critical enablers of VBHC implementation and should be a priority  of policy reform to support the shift to a value-based health system.    •  Digital systems must move beyond collecting, pulling and storing data to support the  triangulation of data as evidence to generate real-time insights. Data and insights must  then be presented, to the right person, at the right time and in an appropriate format to  drive learning and support decision making at all levels of the system (macro, meso and  micro).  •  A stronger system wide focus on collecting and understanding outcomes data is required;  and using this data to drive real impact. Workforce capability building will be a critical  component of this.  •  A more coordinated and consistent approach to PROMs collection is needed to support  system and population level benefits such as benchmarking for quality improvement, and  to generate population level insights.     18  ===== PAGE 22 =====   Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30  Person-centred care  The Welsh approach   The Welsh model recognises that:   ‘We are all unique individuals, and each  person is an ‘expert in their own life’ with  different goals, preferences and aspirations  for their care. Active involvement in our own  care improves our outcomes whether that is  through health behaviours or confident  management of our chronic conditions.  To do this we need to be able to access the  information we need and be supported to  make the choices about treatments that will  achieve our health goals, whatever they may  be and at every stage of life. We need to be  able to navigate the healthcare system to  access the help that we need at the right  time’ (Value in Health Centre., n.d.-a).   Supported self-management is a key objective  of person-centred care within Wales, with a  focus on striving to ensure the creation of an  environment that supports this objective. This  is achieved through developing and ‘providing  patients and health professionals with  materials and tools to set goals and  preferences, improve health literacy and  support shared decision making’ (Welsh Value  in Health Centre, 2023a).  Through prioritising and focusing on person- centred care, the Welsh Value in Health Centre  strives to effect cultural change, moving away  from the paternalistic approach to care which  has traditionally underpinned health systems,  to focus on people as partners in their own  care (Welsh Value in Health Centre, 2023a).   Reflections on Australia    Person-centred care is not a new concept in  Australia. The ACSQHC recognises person- centred care as ‘care that respects and  responds to the preferences, needs and values  of patients and consumers’ (ACSQHC 2023c). It  is a foundation to the delivery of safe and  high-quality healthcare that it is embedded  throughout all safety and quality standards  developed by the ACSQHC.   To support its implementation the ACSQHC  has established a person-centred care  network, an online community in which people  can share stories and resources to learn and  improve the delivery of person-centred care in  Australia (ACSQHC 2023d). However, while the  importance of person and community centred  care is overwhelmingly recognised within  Australia, its application is fragmented.   Top-down prescriptive approaches to health  care are stifling innovation and preventing  communities from developing the solutions  that meet their own needs (Productivity  Commission 2021). For example, in extremely  remote communities, the prescriptive nature  of assessment and service delivery tied to the  different funding and accountability structures  such as NDIS, aged care, primary care or  hospital services, means that people are  turned away from services and/or delayed  access to care.   A fly-in-fly-out clinician funded to deliver NDIS  assessments or treatment in a remote  community may be prohibited from also  delivering an aged care assessment or service  that is within their clinical scope on the same  day. In many instances the same clinician must  19  ===== PAGE 23 =====                                              Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30   return to the remote community on a different  day, travelling a great distance at significant  cost to the system, to perform the aged care  service. This inhibits access, undermines the  delivery of person-centred care, and highlights  huge inequities in access for very remote  communities where life expectancy is already  significantly lower than the Australian average  of 83 years (AIHW 2023b), only 53 for First  Nations Australians and 65 for non-indigenous  Australians (Western Queensland PHN 2016).  When faced with these real-world examples, it  is clear the top-down approaches are not  appropriate for all communities.  We need to create the conditions to support  the self determination of communities to drive  their own health and wellbeing (Australian  Human Rights Commission, n.d.), particularly  within our First Nations and rural and remote  communities. Recognising people as experts in  their own lives and local context, listening to  them and elevating them to the position of  leaders and partners in health care will be  critical to improving outcomes. To drive value in our health system we need to  create and embed structures and processes  that allow communities to come together and  use data to collectively understand their needs  and to collaboratively drive the solutions to  the wicked problems that impact their lives.  Accountability can be ensured if we pivot our  reporting and funding structures to focus on  the outcomes that matter, as determined by  people and communities, and reflect how  people experience care, rather than solely  focusing on inputs and outputs (AHHA 2021).  This shift aligns with the growing movement  towards a wellbeing economy and the creation  of the Measuring What Matters framework by  the Australian Treasury designed to ‘track  progress towards a more healthy, secure,  sustainable, cohesive and prosperous  Australia’ (Department of Treasury 2023).   Lessons for Australia  •  Supported self-management should be recognised as an active intervention that is  resourced, not a passive deflection of responsibility for care to an individual.  •  Understanding and responding to local context is important in how we design, fund and  deliver VBHC initiatives.    •  To drive value in our health system, we need to create and embed structures and  processes that support self-determination within communities, allowing people to come  together and use data to collectively understand their needs, and to collaboratively drive  the solutions to the wicked problems that impact their lives.  •  To ensure accountability we need to pivot our reporting and funding structures to focus on  the outcomes that matter as determined by people and communities, rather than solely  focusing on inputs and outputs.    20  ===== PAGE 24 =====   Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30  Research, impact and evaluation  The Welsh approach  In Wales it is recognised that VBHC requires a  large cultural and transformational change for  the health community. All parts of the system  need to evolve, from policy through to clinical  encounters, to embed principles of VBHC  (Welsh Value in Health Centre, n.d.-a).   Evidence and engagement are needed to  effect cultural change, with the Welsh model  focusing on supporting the creation of a  learning health and care system that fosters  innovation through sharing and learning from  evidence and experience. The Welsh Value in  Health Centre strives to achieve this though  conducting research, publishing evidence,  providing support for innovative projects, and  conducting evaluations to support scaling for  value (Welsh Value in Health Centre, n.d.-a;  Welsh Value in Health Centre, 2023a).  Examples of how this has been pursued  include:  Research – The PROVISION (PROMs  VISualisatION) study is a program of research  designed to understand if and how patients  would like to see PROMs data reported to  them. It is about ensuring PROMs data is  presented in a way that is easy to understand  and meaningful to patients. This research will  inform the development and implementation  of a patient-friendly visualisation model of  PROMs data (Welsh Value in Health Centre,  2023a).    Impact – A £20 million fund was allocated to  the Welsh Value in Health Centre by the Welsh  government to drive value. £15 million of this  was provided to the Health Boards to drive  local priorities with £5 million used to fund  value-based innovation though a grant  process. 64 grant applications were received,  with 12 projects selected, several of which  demonstrated a national approach to driving  value in a particular clinical area or pathway.  Despite the relatively small amounts of  funding provided, this initiative has signalled  government commitment to VBHC  implementation fostering courage and  confidence within the sector to think outside  the box and attempt bigger and better things  (Welsh Value in Health Centre, 2023a).    Evaluation – A critical element of ensuring  impact of the funding allocated for value, was  a strong evaluation process embedded from  conception. To be selected, all applications  had to demonstrate a robust evaluation  framework, aligned to the principles of VBHC  (Welsh Value in Health Centre, 2023a).   Learning and sharing – A PROMs collaborative  was established to ‘support and troubleshoot  a coordinated approach to implementation of  software, data standards and other technical  issues, data visualisation and robust analysis’  (Welsh Value in Health Centre, 2023a).   Reflections on Australia    The Australian Productivity Commission’s 5- year Productivity Inquiry Interim report  (Productivity Commission, 2022) identified  that in the health sector, where government  funding and regulation have a heavy influence,  it is not simply scientific breakthroughs that  will drive innovative, high-quality and  sustainable health care. More significantly, it  will be the diffusion of ideas and embedding of  adaptive business models that will allow  innovation to flourish.  21  ===== PAGE 25 =====                                              Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30   In Australia, innovation and cultural change  must occur across a complex mix of health  professionals and service providers; who  deliver services in various ways in numerous  settings, and who are funded, operated,  managed and regulated from all levels of  government and non-government settings  (AIHW, 2022).    Across the system there are many examples of  innovation and excellence (Appendix 1), yet  VBHC leaders continue to report feeling their  ability to effect change is challenged by  stakeholders, models of care or policies with  inconsistent incentives or motivations.   Further, evaluations of the implementation of  different models of care are not undertaken in  a manner that supports adoption, diffusion,  and spread (Huxtable, 2023). It has been  suggested that network models of innovation  and diffusion are needed, that draw from  complexity science and connect evidence from  various specialties, sectors and individuals in a  more organised way to facilitate shared  learning and the rapid dissemination of new  ideas (Braithwaite, Glasziou, & Westbrook,  2020; Hardie et al., 2022).    Learning health systems have been identified  globally as ‘the next stage in quality  improvement’ and ‘what is required to find a  sustainable way out of the current crisis,’ for  health systems (Hardie et al., 2022). They are  defined as ‘a systematic approach to iterative,  data-driven improvement’, where a learning  community is ‘formed around a common  ambition of improving services and outcomes’  (Hardie et al., 2022).   The Welsh model presents an example of a  learning health system. Through its  prioritisation of learning from data and sharing  ideas and experience it has been able to drive  real VBHC service and system level impact  (Welsh Value in Health Centre, 2023a).   In Australia, the National Digital Health  Blueprint 2023-2033 highlights a commitment  to ensuring that ‘data and information are  shared and reused securely to deliver a  sustainable learning health system’ as one of  its four key outcomes to support the future  wellbeing of services to 2033 (Department of  Health and Aged Care, 2023).    The NHRA Mid-Term Review (Huxtable, 2023)  also called for the establishment of a National  Innovation and Funding Agency to administer  an Innovation Fund that would support the  implementation of successful innovation and  reform at scale through an Innovation Funding  Pathway, that maps the transition from seed  funding to operation at scale, subject to  evaluation milestones being met.   The Welsh model has highlighted the value of  such an approach in driving impact when  structured to facilitate grassroots innovation,  not top-down prescriptive approaches.  Through its VBHC grant program, the support  provided to health boards to deliver VBHC and  other initiatives, the Welsh Value in Health  Centre provides the link between policy and  practice, building momentum through creating  and sharing the evidence to support initiatives  to scale and propel whole of system cultural  change (Welsh Value in Health Centre, 2023a).  With Health Ministers across all levels of  government in Australia signalling a  commitment to VBHC reform (Australian  Health Ministers, 2021), there is an  opportunity to align a national health  innovation funding approach with the creation  of a value-based learning health system.  22  ===== PAGE 26 =====                                              Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30   If pursued through a coordinated, networked  model focused on harnessing and connecting  existing expertise and infrastructure to  effectively align data, evidence, policy and  practice, a VBHC learning health system  presents a nimble and cost-effective way to  support the operationalisation, spread and  scale of innovation (Hardie et al., 2022;  (Papoutsi., Greenhalgh, & Marjanovic, 2024).   In addition, it would ensure innovation at all  levels of the system is pursued through a value  lens, with a focus on achieving the outcomes  that matter to people and communities  through the equitable allocation of resources,  affirming the sustainability of our planet and  the overall health system.     Lessons for Australia  •  A coordinated approach to research, evidence and evaluation is needed that involves all  parts of the system, from policy through to clinical encounters, to drive the cultural change  necessary to support VBHC implementation and deliver real world impacts.  •  A VBHC learning health system, pursued through harnessing and connecting existing  expertise and infrastructure, presents the opportunity to align national policy  commitments with data, evidence and the real-world experience of implementation, to  support the operationalisation, spread and scale of innovation.  •  Pursuing innovation through a value lens will support the creation of a sustainable  (financial, environmental, social) health system, focused on improving the outcomes that  matter to people and communities through the equitable allocation of resources.     23  ===== PAGE 27 =====   Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30  Strategic partnerships  The Welsh approach  Value-based system redesign requires a  cultural shift and change in mindset to the  same extent that it involves the technical  implementation of outcomes measurement or  optimisation of investment. However, change  only happens when people are engaged and  connected (Lewis, 2024; Welsh Value in Health  Centre 2023a; Queensland Health, 2022).   In Wales, it is recognised that VBHC is a  bottom-up activity that needs top-down  support. Deep collaboration between  clinicians, financial managers, operational  managers and informaticians is required to  drive success in all the elements of system  redesign. It is also critical to drive forward in  parallel the necessary policy changes at the  regional and national level to ensure that  barriers to progress are removed. In short,  every part of the system needs to be pulling in  the same direction (Lewis, 2024).   In Wales, partnerships and collaboration have  been critical to driving a system wide approach  to VBHC reform and developing the underlying  evidence base to influence cultural change  (Welsh Value in Health Centre, 2023a).   Intrinsic to this approach has been recognition  that health systems are complex, with valuable  expertise distributed across the various  sectors, regions, services, organisations and  professions. No one area of the system has  been able to drive VBHC alone and it is only  through working together in Wales that they  have been able to achieve sustainable change.     One mechanism that has allowed Wales to  achieve this has been the adoption of a  distributed leadership approach within the  Welsh Value in Health Centre (Welsh Value in  Health Centre n.d.-a). A conscious decision  was made to have key members of the team  based in the offices of partner entities, for  example Digital Health and Care Wales. This  has allowed the existing expertise and  established infrastructure of these  organisations to be harnessed and fostered  momentum for transformational value-based  change though regular connection and  engagement. This approach reflects the key  principles of the Welsh definition of VBHC  ensuring the ‘equitable, sustainable and  transparent use of available resources’ (Hurst  et al., 2019), and signals a top-down  commitment to a culture of partnering,  learning, sharing and growth.   Key strategic partners of the Welsh Value in  Health Centre have included:  Digital Health and Care Wales (NHS Wales n.d.- c) – A dedicated VBHC team has been  established within Digital Health and Care  Wales. Under the direction of the Welsh Value  in Health Centre, the team has supported  Health Boards and Trusts with mechanisms to  implement value-based approaches within  their own organisations. Work has focused on  (Welsh Value in Health Centre, 2023a):  •  the creation of data tools to bring clinical  audit data to life and products to support  value-based decision making.  •  development of an ecosystem for patient  facing technology.  CEDAR (NHS Wales n.d.-b) – As the Welsh  Value in Health Centre Research group, CEDAR  has supported the VBHC agenda in Wales  though:  24  ===== PAGE 28 =====                                              Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30   •  providing analytical and evaluation  capacity,   •  advising on PROMs selection, use,  licences and administration; and   •  supporting the production of outputs and  reports for presentations and  publications.  Their role has required close collaboration  with a broad range of stakeholders including  consumers, clinicians, government, services  and health boards to support both local and  national projects (Welsh Value in Health  Centre, 2023a).   Finance Delivery Unit (NHS Wales 2021) – Recognising alignment with their own  principles and objectives, the finance delivery  unit has become involved in value-based  projects across all aspects of the Welsh health  system (Welsh Value in Health Centre, 2023a).    Health Boards and Trusts (NHS Wales, 2020) –  Since 2018 the Welsh Value in Health Centre  has been working collaboratively with Health  Boards and Trusts to promote a whole of  system approach to embedding VBHC and  optimising available resources. All Health  Boards and Trusts now have value-based  teams, and a National Leads of Value Planning  and Delivery Group has been established,  creating a platform for sharing and driving a  whole of system approach to VBHC  implementation (Welsh Value in Health  Centre, 2023a).     Value-Based Health and Care Academy at  Swansea University (Swansea university, n.d.)–  The Welsh Value in Health Centre team works  closely with the Value-Based Health and Care  Academy contributing content and helping to  develop VBHC educational offerings that build  the health sector capacity within Wales to  deliver VBHC (Welsh Value in Health Centre,  2023a).    Reflections on Australia  As with the Welsh experience, a whole of  system shift in mindset is required in Australia  to drive the collective action necessary to  embed VBHC in practice.   While there is a growing commitment to the  pursuit of VBHC in Australia, much of the  activity to support this shift is occurring in  silos. Entrenched cultural beliefs around  professional and jurisdictional boundaries are  hampering people’s ability to adopt the  necessary helicopter view and look beyond  their traditional spheres of influence to  identify opportunities for optimisation and  innovation across the full pathway of care,  from prevention through to end of life (Lewis,  2022).  In the words of Dr Sally Lewis, it ‘is time we  challenged ourselves on the status quo.’ In  Australia this will require lifting our heads to  look beyond the entrenched silos of our health  system to connect, share and collaborate in  pursuit of the shared goal of improved  outcomes.   Examples of this type of collaboration are  emerging with meetings and roundtables held  to bring various elements of the sector  together, such as primary care, hospitals,  universities and specialist services, to discuss  how to drive VBHC within their communities  (AHHA, 2023). However, these partnerships  are in their infancy.   Attention and resourcing are needed to  support the further development of trusted  and meaningful partnerships across the  25  ===== PAGE 29 =====                                              Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30   system. Partnerships must be prioritised with  consumers, across primary care and the acute  sector, across professional boundaries, across  departments within our organisations (finance,  digital, innovation), across jurisdictions  (federal, state, territory, local government)  and across sectors, working with those outside  of health who have a strong influence on  health outcomes, for example justice,  disability, education, social services,  employment and environment (AHHA, 2023).    We are beginning to see a shift in the policy  landscape in support of this approach with a  growing recognition of the need for  connection and strategic partnerships across  traditional boundaries being highlighted in  rhetoric and government policy initiatives.   In 2022, the Independent Health and Aged  Care Pricing Authority (IHACPA) had its remit  expanded beyond hospital funding, to not only  explore aged care funding but to also work  with ‘Commonwealth and state and territory  governments to explore and trial innovative  new approaches to funding that improve  health outcomes’ including looking beyond the  four walls of the hospital (IHACPA, 2022).   This has been further supported by the NHRA  Mid-Term Review, which recommends that  the scope of public hospitals within the NHRA  be reviewed with the view to broadening the  understanding of a public hospital service ‘to  address current disparities between States and  Territories and to incorporate those services  that are provided beyond the hospital door’  (Huxtable, 2023).    The National Health Reform Agreement 2020- 2025 (Australian Health Ministers 2021) also  highlights ‘joint planning and funding at the  local level’ as one of its four strategic priorities  for reform between 2020 and 2025 creating  the space for primary health networks and  local health networks to partner and pursue  joint priorities.   In addition, there is a growing recognition of  the need to engage beyond the health sector  to drive solutions. In a 2023 speech to the  Whitlam Institute, the Federal Minister for  Health and Aged Care highlighted his  commitment to the principles of equity,  proactive health protection, community  involvement, and to investing in ‘care that  looks beyond the medical to the social  determinants of health’ (Butler, 2023).    The wellbeing agenda and the Measuring  What Matters framework driven by the  Department of Treasury also demonstrates a  commitment to better understanding and  measuring the interplay between the various  sections of the Australian economy in the  pursuit of improving overall wellbeing  (Department of Treasury 2023).   It is clear we have significant expertise and  experiences within our system pursuing VBHC.  At the policy level many of our leading  institutions are exploring elements of VBHC.  For example, ACSQHC is pursuing work in  areas of unwarranted variation and person- centred care (ACSQHC 2023d). The AIHW has  extensive population level data and analysis  expertise (AIHW 2023a). The Digital Health  Agency is seeking to create a connected,  accessible, progressive and secure healthcare  system (ADHA 2024a) and IHACPA is pursuing  innovative funding models that drive value and  improvements in outcomes (IHACPA, 2022).   With the growing momentum and appetite for  VBHC, and the top-down shift to create a more  supportive policy landscape, a window of  26  ===== PAGE 30 =====                                              Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30   opportunity currently exists in Australia to  harness the existing expertise and, in the  image of the Welsh Value in Health Centre  model, resource a coordinated and distributed  VBHC leadership approach. Such an approach  must recognise the importance of context, and  support evidence-based sharing and learning  to operationalise innovation. This presents a  nimble and flexible alternative to the creation  of additional top-down bureaucratic  structures, ensuring alignment with the  principles of VBHC by driving transformational  cultural change through the optimal use of  scarce resources.    Lessons for Australia  •  A strong focus on enabling and resourcing meaningful strategic partnerships will be  necessary to support the whole of system cultural change required to drive collective  action to embed VBHC in practice.  •  Significant expertise and experience in VBHC exist within the Australian health system; with  many services, stewards and institutions already contributing to the pursuit of value and  outcomes within their spheres of influence. However, coordination of this activity through  a distributed leadership model will be required to support the operationalisation of VBHC  in Australia.  •  The Welsh Value in Health Centre (NHS Wales) has been identified as providing an  exemplar framework for operationalising VBHC in Australia; and could be mirrored through  the Australian Centre for VBHC.          27  ===== PAGE 31 =====   Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30  Conclusion  Health systems around the world are facing  increasing issues of sustainability, undermining  their ability to improve the health and  wellbeing of the people they serve. Real and  transformational change is needed to drive  improvement in the outcomes that matter to  people and communities.   VBHC presents a whole of system structured  approach to drive transformative change,  enabling us to centre everything we do, in all  corners of our system, around the shared goal  of improving the outcomes that matter to  people and communities through the most  efficient and effective use of resources. It  provides a framework to support evidence- based, person-centred healthcare decision  making at the macro (population health),  meso (pathways of care) and micro (person- centred care) levels of the system (Bedlington  et al., 2021; Lewis, 2022).  The 2023 VBHC Congress and roadshow has  identified a growing appetite for change across  the Australian health system, emphasising that  current ways of doing things are no longer  sustainable.   The Welsh model of VBHC presents an  iterative, data driven, evidence-based,  outcomes focused approach to VBHC, built on  the principles of equity, sustainability, and  partnerships. This model has resonated  strongly with Australian audiences,  highlighting an opportunity to harness their  learnings within the Australian policy context.  Through exploring the focus areas of digital  health, person-centred care, research, impact  and evaluation, and strategic partnerships, we  can see some of the basic foundations for  VBHC reform already in place in Australia. An  increasingly enabling policy environment  further supports the path to VBHC  implementation with the Commonwealth  government and many of the institutions that  govern our system shifting to examine  outcomes and value within their spheres of  influence.   Yet the coordinating mechanism that brings  the various expertise from across the system  to connect with grassroots operationalisation  of VBHC, and the ability to support the sharing,  learning and the scaling of innovation, is  lacking.  To build an equitable and sustainable health  system that improves the outcomes that  matter to Australians, the Government must  capitalise on the growing momentum towards  VBHC implementation by harnessing the  existing expertise and infrastructure within our  system. The Welsh Value in Health Centre  (NHS Wales) has been identified as providing  an exemplar framework for operationalising  VBHC in Australia; and could be mirrored  through the Australian Centre for VBHC.  In the words of Dr Sally Lewis (2023 VBHC  Congress):  ‘If not this, then what?   If not now, then when?  If not us, then who?’  28  ===== PAGE 32 =====   Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30  References  Australian Centre for VBHC 2019, About,  viewed 8 February 2024,  https://valuebasedcareaustralia.com.au/     ACSQHC: Australian Commission on Safety and  Quality in Healthcare 2023a, Home, viewed 8  February 2024,  htps://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/    ACSQHC: Australian Commission on Safety and  Quality in Healthcare 2023b, PROMs, viewed 8  February 2024,  htps://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/our- work/indicators-measurement-and- reporƟng/paƟent-reported-outcomes/proms- lists    ACSQHC: Australian Commission on Safety and  Quality in Health Care 2023c, Person-centred  care, viewed 8 February 2024,  htps://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/our- work/partnering-consumers/person-centred- care     ACSQHC: Australian Commission on Safety and  Quality in Health Care 2023d, Person-centred  Care Network, viewed 8 February 2024,  htps://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/our- work/partnering-consumers/person-centred- care/person-centred-care-network    ADHA: Australian Digital Health Agency 2018,  National Digital Health Strategy, viewed 9  February 2024,  https://www.digitalhealth.gov.au/about- us/strategies-and-plans/national-digital- health-strategy-and-framework-for-action   ADHA: Australian Digital Health Agency 2024a,  Connecting Australians to a healthier future,  viewed 9 February 2024,  htps://www.digitalhealth.gov.au/?gclid=Cj0KC QiAy9msBhD0ARIsANbk0A- TjZCZlvxoo6j_yTAPYZfUDvQA2hKaq_FyvlZEﬂQU 0VNQ1oe3YZoaAk88EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds    ADHA: Australian Digital Health Agency 2024b,  National Digital Health Strategy 2023-2028,  viewed 26 February 2024  htps://www.digitalhealth.gov.au/naƟonal- digital-health-strategy/strategy-delivery- roadmap     Australian Health Ministers 2021, National  Health Reform Agreement Long Term Reforms  Roadmap, viewed 8 February 2024,  https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/ documents/2021/10/national-health-reform- agreement-nhra-long-term-health-reforms- roadmap_0.pdf  AHHA: Australian Healthcare and Hospital  Association 2021, ‘Healthy people, healthy  systems: Blueprint for outcome- focused,  value-based health care’, Blueprint for health  reform, viewed 8 February 2024,  https://ahha.asn.au/Blueprint   AHHA: Australian Healthcare and Hospital  Association 2023, ‘AHHA Response to the Mid- term review of the National Health Reform  Agreement’, Submissions, viewed 8 February  2024,  https://ahha.asn.au/system/files/docs/publicat ions/ahha_submission_to_the_mid- term_review_of_the_nhra.pdf   Australian Human Rights Commission n.d.,  ‘Self-determination’, Aboriginal and Torres  Strait Islander Social Justice, viewed 8 February  2024, https://humanrights.gov.au/our- work/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander- social-justice/self- determination#:~:text=Self%2Ddetermination %20means%20that%3A,recognition%20of%20 our%20group%20identities.   29  ===== PAGE 33 =====                                              Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30   AIHW: Australian Institute of Health and  Welfare AIHW 2022, Australia's health 2022: in  brief, Canberra: AIHW.

While each has been explored though the lens of a  level of the health system, it is recognised that, in reality, there is considerable interaction across the  various levels required in the operationalisation of VBHC.  MACRO: Healthy Outback Communities (Western Queensland PHN 2023)  Problem: Inequitable health outcomes at a population level.   Desired outcome: Healthier communities and effective chronic disease management, improving  quality of life, increasing life expectancy, and reducing acute health care need and use.   Value-based health care solution: The Healthy Outback Communities (HOC) initiative in the very  remote Western Queensland shires of Boulia, Diamantina and Barcoo is a new, collaborative model of  health and social care that shifts health service focus to measuring outcomes, rather than a focus on  the volume of health services.   The model presents a community-led, place-based initiative driven though collaborative, cross-sector  effort that places health and wellbeing in the hands of local residents and communities. Residents and  families are supported to take control of their own health and wellbeing journey by ‘linking up’ to  local support.    MESO: Breast Cancer Bundle of Care (Zissiadis et al., 2023)  Problem: Patients diagnosed with cancer report the need for more “joined up” holistic care and the  financial impact of care, as two obstacles to improved quality of life.   Desired outcome:  To develop a bundle of care and test whether it can improve patient experience,  create financial transparency and certainty, improve patient outcomes and form a model that can be  scaled to other geographies/ cancers.   Value-based health care solution: The breast cancer bundle aims to deliver a “joined up”, holistic 12- month package of care for people newly diagnosed with breast cancer undertaking treatment in the  private health system, providing upfront transparency in fees.  Optimisation of the care pathway is enabled through the engagement of a non-clinical navigator who  provides personalised support to help people coordinate their care, access the services they require  to improve treatment outcomes and support self-management. The partnership approach of the  model enables patients to move through the system more efficiently with various services (pathology,  surgery, oncology, radiology, physiotherapy, dietetics and clinical psychology) collectively working  together and sharing information to help maximise the best possible outcomes for the patient.  36  ===== PAGE 40 =====   Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30  MESO: West Australian Eating Disorder Specialist Services (WAEDSS) Collaborative Model (Miller,  2023)  Problem: Siloing of clinical governance and decision making across state, commonwealth and privately  funded providers within the eating disorder care pathway contributing to duplication, fragmentation,  access blocks and undermining patient outcomes and experience.   Desired outcome: Equitable access to a person-centred, evidence-based, integrated continuum of  care that optimises outcomes and experiences for people experiencing eating disorders.    Value based health care solution: The WAEDSS collaborative model is designed to ensure  sustainability of state-based funding to integrate and optimise efficiency of the contributions of all  components of eating disorder service delivery as a ‘joined up’ experience across the system,  regardless of funding source or setting of care and without overwhelming any one service with unmet  demand.  State funding will enable the establishment of three hubs delivering a range of step-up, step-down  services integrating with existing hospital and community services across the Australian state of  Western Australia.   Dedicated roles to optimise and improve patient experience at vulnerable transition points between  WA Country Health Service and Child and Adolescent Health Services to the area-based components  are included along the pathway, as well as peer workers with a lived experience who are integral to  bringing an understanding of value-based outcomes to care planning. Partnerships with primary care  and Medicare funded psychology and dietetic services providing early identification, and  interventions are supported via funded state-wide clinical liaison and education functions to build  capacity across the health workforce beyond the WAEDSS services themselves and sustain flow across  the system.  Looking ahead: A state-wide purpose-built database, data scientist role, and Clinical Advisory Group  will ultimately enable a learning health systems approach to inform individual patient-care decisions  (mico), area-based service quality improvement (meso) and population-level planning for future  investment (maco) within a recovery-oriented framework consistent with the National Eating  Disorders Strategy. 37  ===== PAGE 41 =====   Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30  MICRO: Psychology Outcomes Clinic (Castle 2022)    Problem: Time consuming measurement approach not delivering value to clinicians or psychology  clients.     Desired outcome: An understanding of, and improvement in, the outcomes that mattered to clients  attending a private psychology practice in regional Australia.   Value-based health care solution: Integration of distress outcome measures into treatment. Clients  attending a psychology session complete a short (one minute) distress PROM at the beginning of each  session. The results, including a graph of their distress over the course of the treatment, are then  used to inform discussions within the immediate session.   A decrease in a client’s distress is celebrated, with discussions focusing on what has been working so  that more of this can be embedded within treatment. If a client’s distress has not changed or has  increased, time is spent discussing what is not working and what needs to happen for distress to  come down. The collaborative process ensures that the clients voice outlines the treatment approach  elevating the relationship between clinician and patient to that of an equal partnership in the delivery  of care.  It also allows clinicians to monitor and improve the effectiveness of the treatment they deliver  through the identification of data trends and comparisons with international benchmarks.    38  ===== PAGE 42 =====   Transforming for value-based health care  Perspectives brief  No: 30                            Contact:  Adj AProf Rebecca Haddock   Executive Director Knowedge Exchange    Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association.

The issues  impacting us are not unique to Australia and  the increasingly complex problems of the future  will need more collaboration, agility and wider  networks than ever before. Climate change,  natural disasters, pandemics, infectious diseases  and issues of health care access and equity will  continue to threaten local health security over the  coming decades. But as we face shared threats, we  have  a shared responsibility to act.  This sentiment was at the forefront during our  recent John Deeble Lecture and Panel Discussions  (Canberra), themed Beyond Boundaries: Leadership  for health, where panellists reflected on what it  means to be a leader during a time when global  challenges have become a threat to local health  security. The importance of relationships and  collaborative networks in the absence of evidence  were highlighted as being critical.

From the Parliamentary Reception, I then went  on to represent AHHA at the Commonwealth  Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) 2024  in Samoa, and while this meeting includes the  Commonwealth, the outcomes will go far beyond  the Commonwealth. Echoing the conversations at  our recent event, other countries are also facing  the impacts of climate change and natural disasters  as well as other global challenges. So too are they  exploring the connections, cooperation and new  opportunities that emerging leaders will need to  tackle global challenges that are already at our  doorstep for the wellbeing of future generations. This issue of The Health Advocate brings  together the activity happening within Australia  across research, policy and practice to drive  sustainability. There is much to be achieved, and  we all have a role. As the issue is published, we  welcome announcements about the establishment  of the Centre for Disease Control, as well as the  release of the independent inquiry into Australia’s  response to the COVID-19 pandemic and review  of Commonwealth Disaster Funding (the Colvin  review) to inform system reform.

In Australia, residential aged care (RAC)  residents are not receiving the recommended  quantities and types of allied health care to  support restorative and wellbeing care. A Policy  Issues Brief released by AHHA’s Deeble Institute for  Health Policy Research, examines the barriers to  providing restorative and wellbeing care for   our ageing population. The Policy Brief, coauthored by Isabelle  Meulenbroeks, recipient of the Deeble Institute’s  2024 Jeff Cheverton Memorial Scholarship, and  PhD Candidate at the Australian Institute of Health  Innovation, Macquarie University, recommends  bringing Australia into line with world leading  health systems in delivery of restorative and  wellbeing care in RAC.

However, older adults with impaired vision are twice  as likely to fall than those without impaired vision.  More Australians visit an optometrist than any other  non-medical health professional, but we’re not  seeing the full benefits this sector can bring when   it comes to preventing falls in older adults. Released by AHHA’s Deeble Institute for Health  Policy Research, the Issues Brief ‘Reinforcing the  role of eye care practitioners in falls prevention  among older adults’, highlights the importance  of including eye care practitioners, such as  optometrists, as part of a multi-disciplinary   team of health professionals working towards   fall prevention.  ha  Issues brief  no: 55  Issues Brief   ===== PAGE 7 ===== The Health Advocate  •  NOVEMBER 2024    7 HAVE YOUR SAY...

Frailty affects about 25% of the population aged  over 70, and those living with frailty have poorer  outcomes in hospitals. Focusing on both identifying  and reducing frailty and minimising admissions to  hospital is crucial for improving health outcomes for  these people. James Inglis, NSLHD Director of Operations  Integration, said the Collaborative Commissioning  program works by supporting GPs to identify  patients at risk of presenting to the emergency  department by providing them with faster access to  specialists and community-based care.

The most devastating direct impact of climate  change is extreme heat. Increasing temperatures  and heatwaves, i.e. periods of very hot days and  nights, can cause major impacts on human health,  the healthcare infrastructure, emergency services,  and the natural and built environment. The risk  of hospitalisation and death due to extreme heat  increases with age, with older people living alone  being at higher risk. Many heat-related fatalities  occur in cities, where urban heat islands (i.e.  built-up areas with little vegetation and higher  temperatures relative to their surrounding area)  exacerbate the problem.   It is likely that 2024 is going to be Earth’s warmest  year on record, with the 10 warmest years all  having occurred during the last decade. In response  to the rapid rise of extreme heat, United Nations  Secretary-General António Guterres recently called  for urgent action to address extreme heat in four  critical areas: caring for the vulnerable, protecting  workers, boosting resilience of economies and  societies using data and science, limiting global  temperature rise to 1.5°C by phasing out fossil fuels  and scaling up investment in renewable energy. Rising temperatures significantly increase the  risk of bushfires and smoke, and contributes to    >   ===== PAGE 10 ===== 10    The Health Advocate  •  NOVEMBER 2024 “A stronger focus on preventive health and policies  outside the remit of the health system aiming to reduce  emissions and improve climate resilience in cities can  bring multiple environmental and health benefits.” other more subtle changes in our environment,  such as earlier and longer pollen seasons and  more ozone pollution, which contribute to poor  respiratory health. Extreme heat and pollution  disproportionately affect the health of people in  vulnerable situations: the very old and the very  young, pregnant women, people with disabilities,  migrant communities, and low-income households,  amplifying existing health inequities in our  communities.  Climate change, the underlying cause of these  extremes, is already affecting every Australian  region in multiple ways. Australia’s average  temperature for the last winter was 1.48°C above  average. This was the second-warmest winter  on record since national observations began.  Australia’s spring weather forecast predicts  unusually warm weather, particularly for the  northern of the country. Many climate extremes  depend on the level of warming, but what people  in Australia experience can be very different to   the national average.  Effective adaptation to extreme heat is urgently  needed, focusing on those who are at higher  risk. Heat-health action plans that coordinate  health system and local government’s response  to heatwaves are in place in Victoria and other  jurisdictions. These plans become activated when  predefined temperature thresholds are exceeded.  Although they mainly focus on the public health  response, healthcare services also need to prepare  for patient surges, as well as for impacts on their  workforce and infrastructure.  Australia’s domestic greenhouse gas emissions per  capita are amongst the highest in the world. The  health sector contributes around 7% of Australia’s  total carbon footprint. Although there have been  positive steps in recent years, there is still large  scope for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions,  particularly by drastically reducing low-value health  care and decarbonising clinical practices.  Building workforce capacity and capability for the  net zero transition in the health sector is essential.  The NSW Health program of appointing senior  Unsplash  ===== PAGE 11 ===== The Health Advocate  •  NOVEMBER 2024    11 clinicians as Net Zero Leads to embed low-carbon  models of care in their service is a promising  initiative which could be replicated in other  jurisdictions. A stronger focus on preventive health  and policies outside the remit of the health system  aiming to reduce emissions and improve climate  resilience in cities can bring multiple environmental  and health benefits.  To achieve this, the HEAL Network is supporting  the implementation of the National Health and  Climate Strategy and the National Climate Risk  Assessment and National Adaptation Plan by  drawing together existing research, policy and  community collaborations and creating new  ones across Australia and internationally. We are  investing in a new generation of future research  leaders by strengthening their scientific and  influencing skills through training, networking,  and research initiatives. Importantly, HEAL brings  together Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  knowledge of adapting to environmental change  with Western science and data to develop  innovative climate and health solutions.  Many of our initiatives will be showcased at the  HEAL 2024 conference, Healing with Country for  a Sustainable Future for Everyone, which is taking  place online and in-person in all Australian capital  cities on 26-28 November 2024 (free registration).  UN Secretary-General’s call to action on extreme  heat couldn’t be more timely. Unless there  are large-scale and rapid reductions in global  greenhouse gas emissions and effective adaptation  measures in all sectors, including the health  system, the current pattern of increasing heat will  continue to cause much harm and disruption.  ha The HEAL (Healthy Environments And Lives)  Network receives funding from the National  Health and Medical Research Council Special  Initiative in Human Health and Environmental  Change (grant no. 2008937).  ===== PAGE 12 ===== 12    The Health Advocate  •  NOVEMBER 2024 Green care for high quality care:  practical actions and pathways for  climate-responsive health systems PROF ADITYA VYAS  Associate  Professor of Public  Health & Deputy  Director, Healthy  Environments and  Lives (HEAL) Centre,  University   of Canberra International and national agreements  to reduce the carbon impact of health  systems are gaining momentum — with  important milestones reached recently   by the health community Health leaders around the world have called for  action on climate change by the health sector  for several decades. There is now much greater  awareness of the fact that health care delivery  contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and  therefore exacerbates climate change. The role  of national health systems and individual health  organisations in addressing climate change has been  elevated in United Nations climate negotiations.  The 26th Conference of Parties (COP26) held in  Glasgow in 2021 resulted in the development of  the Alliance for Transformative Action on Climate  and Health (ATACH). There, some 50 countries  committed to building climate resilient and low  carbon health systems, and several countries  committed to reaching net zero health sector  greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.  Two years later, COP28 in Dubai featured the  first-ever Health Day. It had a number of major  outputs: the UAE Declaration on Climate and  Health, endorsed by 123 countries ahead of the  Climate-Health Ministerial; establishment of the  Guiding Principles for Financing Climate and Health  Solutions, with $1B in funding commitments for  health; and a Prospectus of Climate & Health  DR CAROLYN  HULLICK  Chief Medical  Officer, Australian  Commission on  Safety and Quality   in Health Care  ===== PAGE 13 ===== The Health Advocate  •  NOVEMBER 2024    13 Solutions demonstrating how the health sector can  address climate change.1 Since then, the World  Health Assembly has made a landmark resolution on  climate change and health, and international health  professionals’ associations have made concerted  efforts to build capacity in their membership to  address this defining challenge of our time. The  International Society for Quality in Health Care  (ISQua) Green Paper on Environmentally Sustainable  and Climate Resilient Health Systems, launched  in September 2024, is just one example of such  efforts.2 Closer to home, the Australian government  produced the National Health and Climate  Strategy in 2023 with 49 actions across four  objectives: health system resilience, health system  decarbonisation, international collaboration and  health in all policies. The National Health and  Medical Research Council (NHMRC) increased its  investment in climate and health research through  a $10M Special Initiative in 2021 and a $5M Targeted  Call for Research in 2024. Three national bodies —  the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in  Health Care (ACSQHC), Interim Australian Centre  for Disease Control, and Council of Presidents of  Medical Colleges (in conjunction with all member  colleges) — produced a Joint Statement on working  together to achieve sustainable high-quality health  care in a changing climate in October 2024, as a  first step to further combined action.3  These national and international developments  show how far the health community has come  in understanding and starting to address climate  change and health. It also complements the efforts  of many individuals across the health system —  from clinicians and sustainability officers, to health  service managers and executives, college and  health association members, health advocates,   and beyond. Human society stands at the carbon crossroads  — so sustainable healthcare choices that embrace  both adaptation and mitigation of climate change  are needed Despite our collective progress, the challenge  of addressing climate change through the health  system remains. Major research such as the Medical  Journal of Australia–Lancet Countdown on Health  and Climate Change continues to highlight the  health and economic costs of inaction to Australia.  For example, severe floods across the four eastern  states of Australia in 2022 saw insured losses of  $7.168 billion — the highest ever recorded, and  even more than the devastating 2019-20 summer  bushfires.4 While the health impact of these  events is not fully quantified, we know that the  health of the planet determines human health,  and that human society ignores its impacts on the  environment at our own peril (Figure 1). Improving human health involves action across the  whole of society. The role of health practitioners  and health systems can seem hard to fathom when  faced with such a large and cross-cutting problem.  However, there are a number of pathways for  practical action at the disposal of clinicians and  health system managers. The Joint Statement on  working together to achieve sustainable high-quality  health care in a changing climate3 outlines three  principles of sustainable health care: investing in  prevention, minimising potentially harmful and  wasteful care, and minimising emissions associated  with the delivery of high-value care. The ISQua  Green Paper2 sets out potential pathways, and     >   ===== PAGE 14 ===== 14    The Health Advocate  •  NOVEMBER 2024 Figure 1  ===== PAGE 15 ===== The Health Advocate  •  NOVEMBER 2024    15 12 practical actions, that health organisations can  take across the spectrum of clinical care delivery  through to system-wide actions (Figure 2). The Australian healthcare system must embed  sustainable, high quality and low carbon models of  care — while also reducing low value care Health organisations need to drive change, for  example, by embedding actions from the ACSQHC  Environmental Sustainability and Climate Resilience  Module5 in their clinical governance framework.  Many guides for practical action are available, such  as the ISQua Green paper and the Joint Statement. The ISQua Green Paper shows the multiple  pathways a health organisation can take to deliver  climate-responsive health care. For example, an  organisation can start from the ‘bottom up’ by  forming a Green Team within a hospital (action  2), which can host a Green Ward Competition  (action 3) and then embed this practice through  the Sustainable Quality Improvement tool (action  1). A different organisation may take a ‘top  down’ approach with organisational leadership  establishing a chief sustainability officer (action  5), who can lead measurement, monitoring and  evaluation efforts (action 4), which can then inform  the organisation’s performance (action 6). These  actions occur against the backdrop of four domains  of practice — by improving knowledge, establishing  networks, using the health professionals’ voice for  advocacy, and ultimately taking action. The Joint Statement builds on the extensive  evidence of unwarranted clinical variation in  health care documented in the Australian Atlas  of Healthcare Variation Series.6 The focus areas  of the Joint Statement provide a framework for  achieving sustainable high-quality health care in a  changing climate. Integrating care by connecting  care providers, and ensuring that care is patient  centred and high value reduces fragmentation of  care, minimises waste from low value alternatives  and better focuses innovation on developing low  emission models of care. This will require changes  to the ‘business as usual’ of health care practice,  together with thoughtful review of practice and  data to identify opportunities for optimising patient  care. However, the current tight fiscal environment  and ongoing national health reforms provide  the ideal incentive and context to pursue these  objectives. We now need to scale up these actions  across different disciplines of clinical care, and at   a rapid rate.  Mobilising and supporting the health workforce  to lead the health system response to climate  change can be achieved by embedding the  principles of sustainable health care throughout  clinical education. Medical colleges and healthcare  associations have a vital role to play in this regard.  However, health workforce mobilisation can also  take place at a small scale and individual level  — each and every practitioner can contribute to  reducing medication errors; avoiding unnecessary  patient re-admissions; communicating with patients,  families and carers to ensure that care is aligned  to their goals; communicating with colleagues for  patient safety and effective treatment; and ensuring  effective handover of care across a fragmented     >   ===== PAGE 16 ===== 16    The Health Advocate  •  NOVEMBER 2024 health system. These actions all lead to better   value care, which has an associated reduction in   the carbon footprint of care. Ten years ago, at the 2014 United Nations  Climate Summit, President Barack Obama stated  ‘we are the first generation to feel the impact of  climate change and the last generation that can  do something about it.’ While this statement holds  as true today as it did ten years ago, our window  for action is rapidly narrowing. But the health  community has the means, methods and moral  obligation to act — we can be part of the solution  in delivering a better planet and better health for  future generations.  ha REFERENCES 1.

Globally, healthcare accounts for around  4-5% of global greenhouse gas emissions and in  Australia, around 7% of carbon emissions.1 Clinical  care accounts for the biggest portion of healthcare  carbon emissions.2 While action is occurring  within the healthcare sector to address its carbon  footprint, and 80 countries, including Australia,  now committed to sustainable, low-carbon health  systems through the Alliance for Action on Climate  Change and Health (ATACH) Programme,3 it is   not well known exactly what actions were being  undertaken in this sustainability space in Australia.  Therefore, to improve our understanding of what  sustainability and decarbonisation actions were  occurring within the Australian healthcare system,  we mapped activity across Australia,4 including  identifying the various healthcare stakeholders  and carrying out an extensive search to locate  relevant documents; including position statements,  policy documents, frameworks, strategies, reports,  and action plans. Key content data regarding  sustainability and/or decarbonisation was then  extracted with attention to specific actions in  clinical care or in the broader healthcare system.

National Health and Climate Strategy released (Dec 2023). New South Wales (NSW) Created a Climate Risk and Net Zero (CRNZ) unit in 2022 to focus on reducing carbon  emissions and addressing low-value care. The CRNZ strategy includes initiatives to  decarbonise clinical care. Queensland (QLD) QLD Health is working towards a climate-ready public health system, including the  proposed establishment of an Office of Hospital Sustainability and a working group to  support sustainable initiatives in clinical healthcare including activities to quit Desflurane  anaesthetic gas and promote measures to reduce nitrous oxide leaks. Western Australia (WA) WA developed a blueprint for climate response, established a Sustainable Health Unit,  and was the first state to remove desflurane (a high-carbon anaesthetic gas) from public  hospitals. WA is focused on reducing emissions, building staff skills, and shifting from  reactive to preventive healthcare Victoria (VIC) VIC has developed strategies addressing environmental sustainability, climate change  impacts on health, and social determinants of health. Existing legislation supports the  reduction of the healthcare sector’s carbon footprint. Tasmania (TAS) TAS has set ambitious net-zero targets and released a framework of action focusing on  emission reduction and delivery models that reduce unnecessary medical tests. South Australia (SA) SA aims to reduce healthcare carbon emissions through prevention and improved  wellbeing, with plans for Australia’s first all-electric major hospital. Climate change is also  acknowledged as a determinant of health. Australian Capital Territory (ACT) The ACT has strategies to achieve net-zero emissions by 2045, focusing on resource  management, infrastructure, digital health, workforce, and procurement. Canberra will have  Australia’s first all-electric critical care facility. Northern Territory (NT) NT Health established a Sustainable Healthcare Committee to address waste, emissions,  and climate change adaptation. Primary Health Networks (PHNs) Two PHNs, both in NSW, have included environmental sustainability in their strategic  plans, with some focus on decarbonising clinical care. Public Hospitals Various hospitals have developed sustainability plans, with notable initiatives in NSW,  QLD, WA, and VIC focusing on environmental sustainability and decarbonisation.  For instance, NSW supports Net Zero Clinical Leads and QLD created the SWAPNet  Environmental Accountability Working Group. Private Health Providers Some private hospital groups have sustainability strategies incorporating aspects of  decarbonised clinical care. For example, Ramsay Healthcare, St John of God Health Care,  St Vincent’s Health Australia and HealthScope all have various sustainability reports.  However, publicly available information is limited for many private providers, especially  around clinical care activity emissions. Professional Organisations Most medical colleges and dental associations have adopted policies supporting  sustainability actions. For Example, RACP’s Environmentally Sustainable Healthcare  Position Statement that recognises carbon footprint of clinical care. Non-Government Organisation Numerous non-government and professional organizations are engaging with  policymakers to develop and implement sustainability strategies. For example, Doctors for  the Environment and the Climate and Health Alliance (CAHA) are very active, with CAHA  administering the Global Green and Healthy Hospitals program in Australia.  ===== PAGE 20 ===== 20    The Health Advocate  •  NOVEMBER 2024 The mapping exercise revealed that while  Australian healthcare stakeholders are supporting  sustainability, there is a notable lack of action  towards decarbonising clinical care practices.  This is a rapidly evolving space with constant new  developments including the October 2024 joint  statement on achieving sustainable high-quality  healthcare led by the Australian Commission on  Safety and Quality in Health Care, Australian  Government and Medical Colleges.5 It is clear  that the focus of activity to date on general  sustainability measures needs to shift towards  specific decarbonisation efforts. The establishment  of the National Health Sustainability and Climate  Unit offers a significant opportunity for national  leadership and coordination in achieving low- carbon, environmentally sustainable healthcare.  Future efforts should include more focus on  decarbonisation of health systems, improved  evaluation of sustainability activities,  encouragement of private sector involvement, and  increased transparency and coordination across the  sector to effectively address carbon emissions and  achieve net-zero healthcare.  ha REFERENCES 1.

Healthcare buildings  are significantly different from other building  typologies due to their 24/7 operations and the  high energy demands of medical equipment,  lighting, HVAC systems, and water supply, as  well as a high standard of indoor environmental  requirements. For example, hospitals adhere to  stricter ventilation standards to protect patient  health and well-being. Most of the electrical  energy used in hospitals is for HVAC systems  (around 37%), electrical processes (34%), and  lighting (24%)2.  In Australia, healthcare buildings come in  various types, reflecting the diverse needs of the  population and the complexity of the healthcare  system. These facilities range from small local  clinics for community health organisations,  including those dedicated to Aboriginal and Torres  Strait Islander communities, to large, specialised  hospitals and research centres for public and  private acute and sub-acute health provider  organisations.  In the face of climate change, healthcare  facilities themselves are vulnerable to the  effects of extreme weather, impacting both  their infrastructure and ability to deliver care.  Conversely, many health environments in  community settings are also refuges of last resort  during extreme weather or disaster events. Thus,  decarbonising healthcare buildings is an urgent,  actual, and existential priority as the healthcare  sector grapples with the dual challenge of reducing  its environmental impact, while also addressing  the health consequences of climate change.  Decarbonising is not only a moral imperative  for the healthcare sector to address the climate  crisis, but also a strategic move that can lead to  improved operational efficiency, cost savings, and  better health outcomes. Buildings that embrace  decarbonisation are better equipped to respond  to climate-related health challenges, remain  resilient in the face of disruptions, and operate  more sustainably in the long term. Decarbonising  healthcare buildings requires a systemic approach  that integrates energy efficiency, renewable  energy, sustainable building materials, and  optimised operations.

The Post Carbon Research Centre The Post-Carbon Research Centre at RMIT  University offers an innovative, holistic approach  to this challenge, leveraging its interdisciplinary  expertise across design, engineering, planning,  construction, and social sciences to address  the complex task of decarbonising the built  environment. Drawing from its core research  themes of transition, design, and production,  the Centre presents a framework that can be  applied to decarbonising healthcare buildings while  ensuring resilience, operational efficiency, and  improved health outcomes for communities. The  Post-Carbon Research Centre’s multidisciplinary  approach offers a pathway forward, aligning the  goal of decarbonisation with the need for resilient,  efficient, and healthy hospital environments.  Cutting across three main research themes, the  Centre’s research is organised within four clusters,  providing a collaborative research environment  to support cross-disciplinary research. Research  under the Buildings cluster focuses on the  informed implementation of automation and digital  technologies in buildings which are important  for the design, construction and operation of  healthcare buildings that are complex in nature. How are we assessing existing buildings? Existing programs, such as the National Australian  Built Environment Rating System (NABERS)3, enable  public hospitals to maintain high energy efficiency  standards, thereby serving as examples for the  wider market. NABERS evaluates the environmental  performance of public buildings based on actual  operational data over a 12-month period. For  the commercial building sector, NABERS and  Commercial Building Disclosure (CBD) programs  have helped slash energy use in the commercial  building sector, where buildings that began  disclosing their energy performance under CBD in  2012 have cut their energy use by an average of  42%4. Currently, a program to expand CBD to other  buildings, including hospitals, before 2030 is being  planned by the Federal Government.  In Victoria, 133 public hospitals have participated  in the 2024 NABERS Sustainable Portfolio Index,  where the Victorian Health Building Authority  (VHBA) rated the energy and water efficiency of  133 public hospitals, representing approximately  2.9 million sqm of area and 6.5 million occupied  bed-days5. While VHBA records this information  in Victoria, similar agencies in other Australasian  jurisdictions collect this data under the auspices  of the Australasian Health Infrastructure Alliance  (AHIA). Valuable real-world data on the energy  performance of hospitals have been captured  through such programs. As a result, more and  more building stakeholders are acknowledging  the benefits of being transparent about the  environmental performance of healthcare  buildings. However, many private hospitals and  small healthcare facilities and community health  centres are yet to embrace these programs.  Regular energy audits are another crucial tool for  healthcare buildings striving to reduce their carbon  footprint and improve operational efficiency.  These Decarbonisation audits provide valuable  benchmarks, helping healthcare buildings assess  their current energy consumption patterns and  identify areas where improvements can be made.  For example, a recent audit of 161 buildings used  to accommodate the provision of holistic care   ===== PAGE 23 ===== The Health Advocate  •  NOVEMBER 2024    23 services amongst Victoria’s Aboriginal Community  Controlled Organisations undertaken by the VHBA  in collaboration with the Victorian Aboriginal  Community Controlled Health Organisation,  (VACCHO) identified annual abatement  opportunities of 174,827 kilograms CO2-e from  reducing gas use and 10,462,397 kilograms CO2-e  from reducing electricity use. Any resulting savings  from investment in electrification, behind-the- meter solar, and energy efficiency would deliver  more services to Victoria’s Aboriginal community  that help close the gap. By consistently monitoring  energy usage, healthcare buildings can track the  success of energy-saving initiatives and make data- driven decisions to enhance efficiency.  Are new buildings designed better? The Post-Carbon Centre’s experts in architecture  and engineering are well-positioned to reimagine  healthcare building design, incorporating cutting- edge digital tools like Building Information  Modelling (BIM) and digital twins to optimise  energy performance. There are guidelines such as  the ‘Guidelines for sustainability in capital works’  by VHBA4 that provide advice and guidance on  how to build sustainable and resilient buildings.  The guidelines require all-electric infrastructure  for facilities under 10,000 square meters, and for  larger facilities to include a plan to transition away  from natural gas. The aim is for Victoria’s public  hospitals and health services to be powered by  100% carbon neutral renewable electricity by 2025  to support the 2050 net zero carbon target by  reducing the use of gas. While guidelines for the design and construction  of new hospitals are leading to better outcomes,  the gains achieved may be being offset by the  scale of newer facilities. With many contemporary  hospitals across Australia now exceeding 100,000  sqm, the energy required to run and maintain  these significant facilities is escalating. How well  utilised are these enormous hospitals? Could the  gains in non-bricks and mortar service provision  accelerated during COVID lead to more efficient  health environments?  Building resilience Designing healthcare buildings that not only reduce  energy use but also create healing environments  is essential. While health care facilities care  for affected people during disaster events,  extreme weather events such as heatwaves and  bushfires impact healthcare facilities at all levels  affecting, their basic functioning. Many healthcare  buildings serve vulnerable populations, and their  role in maintaining public health becomes even  more critical as climate-related health issues,  such as respiratory diseases and heat-related  illnesses, become more prevalent. Passive design  principles such as daylighting, shading, and the  use of appropriate envelope materials can tackle  climate resilience to some extent, but ensuring  the security of hospital energy supplies and  communication infrastructure is equally important. >  pixabay  ===== PAGE 24 ===== 24    The Health Advocate  •  NOVEMBER 2024 Older healthcare assets Hospitals have one of the highest embodied carbon  footprints per square meter in the construction  sector6. Therefore, reusing existing buildings or  refurbishing them with latest energy efficiency  technologies is a more sustainable option than  building new ones. Renovating older hospital  facilities is not straightforward as they are too  outmoded for today’s patient expectations and  fast-advancing medical field and has limited  adaptation capability to unforeseen situations  like the COVID-19 pandemic. Adaptive reuse of  hospital buildings is not a new concept. While  the courtyard hospitals built during the miasma  period when the healing properties of air flow and  daylight were considered essential to good health  were superseded by the modern sealed and air- conditioned box, those same court-yard hospitals  were coveted for their amenity and became ideal  campuses for universities or research parks. Many  of Melbourne’s pre-deinstitutionalisation asylums,  for example, set in large garden settings, built with  verandas, openable windows, excellent thermal  mass and other passive design features, have been  recycled into research buildings, schools and even  high-end residential enclaves. Could the same be  the future of Victoria’s sub-acute hospitals, which  are in desperate need of renewal at a time when  the provision of sub-acute services is shifting  toward more at-home care models? Could these  same sites, located across metropolitan Melbourne  and rural and regional Victoria, be a solution to  our housing crisis?  Towards a sustainable future   for healthcare buildings The Post-Carbon Centre’s commitment to  translating research into real-world applications  means that its decarbonisation strategies are  designed to be implemented at scale, with  attention to the social, political, and regulatory  contexts in which healthcare buildings operate.  This ensures that decarbonisation efforts are  equitable, accessible, and aligned with public  health goals.  ha REFERENCES 1 Bawaneh, K.; Ghazi Nezami, F.; Rasheduzzaman, M.; Deken,  B. 2019, Energy Consumption Analysis and Characterization of  Healthcare Facilities in the United States.

Eugenie is the lead author   of the Detecting and reducing  leaks from nitrous oxide   in healthcare facilities —   A practical guide. THE WHY   Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas  with a global warming potential 265 times that  of carbon dioxide. Its average atmospheric  lifetime of 110 years means that nitrous oxide  released today will have warming effects into  the next century. The 2023 National Climate  and Health Strategy identified that medical  N2O use contributed 300 kilo tonnes of CO2  emissions in the 2020-21 financial year, or 20%  of the Australian health system’s total Scope   1 emissions.  While N2O continues to have an established  role in certain areas of clinical care, such as  obstetrics and paediatric procedures outside  the operating theatre, its use in anaesthesia  has reduced dramatically. In a survey of  Australian anaesthetists in 2017, two thirds  of anaesthetists reported using N2O in less  than 20% of their anaesthetics. Despite this,  Australian hospitals continue to purchase large  amounts of N2O. Multiple studies, in Australia  and overseas, have found large discrepancies  between hospital purchased N2O and clinical  use.

Leaks can occur in multiple locations of the N2O  infrastructure, such as along the manifold-pipeline  system, connecting valves, wall outlets or at the  point of clinical administration,  and in both older  and newer systems.  The evidence now suggests that all healthcare  facilities must consider their N2O infrastructure is  likely to contain leaks, which are both financially  wasteful and harmful to the environment. Hospitals  can consider testing their N2O infrastructure  for leaks or may consider moving straight to  decommissioning the pipeline and moving to  cylinders at the point of care to reduce waste. THE HOW The University of Melbourne, in conjunction with  the Australian Government’s Department of Health  and Aged Care, and the Interim Australian Centre  for Disease Control, has published Detecting and  reducing nitrous oxide leaks in healthcare: A  practical guide.  The guide provides information to assist clinicians  and health facility managers to identify the most  appropriate method for their health service to test  for N2O leaks, to make informed choices about N2O  supply (piped vs cylinders), reduce and remove  N2O supply where not necessary and reduce N2O  leaks through regular monitoring of N2O supply.  Figure 1. Decision pathway to assist in choice of method to detect N2O leaks   (from Detecting and reducing nitrous oxide leaks in healthcare facilities — A practical guide)  ===== PAGE 27 ===== The Health Advocate  •  NOVEMBER 2024    27 Key recommendations from the guide include: 1. Avoiding the use of N2O where possible  2. Isolating N2O flow for areas in the facility   where N2O is no longer in use 3. Avoiding the installation of new N2O  infrastructure 4. Decommissioning existing N2O pipelines   if appropriate The Prince Charles Hospital, in Brisbane is  the first large tertiary hospital in Australia to  decommission its reticulated N2O infrastructure,  demonstrating that health services should consider  decommissioning as a cost-effective alternative   to testing, particularly if they have low clinical   use of N2O.  For services where decommissioning N2O  infrastructure is currently not considered an  option, Detecting and reducing nitrous oxide leaks  in healthcare: A practical guide describes four  methods that have been used successfully   in Australia and internationally to detect leaks:  Method 1 Discrepancy: Developed by the United  Kingdom’s Nitrous Oxide Project, this method  compares the N2O amount purchased to the   N2O amount clinically used, to estimate the  amount leaked.  Method 2 Cylinder weighing: Developed at Alfred  Health, this method weighs a single N2O cylinder  attached to the manifold over a period of time  to determine the amount of N2O supplied to the  N2O reticulated system. Amount of N2O leak is  calculated by change of cylinder weight during no  clinical use or using Method 1 if N2O is being used.  Method 3 Pressure testing: Developed by the  Green Theatres team in Western Australia, this  method detects leaks by measuring pressure  decreases in the fix volume pipeline during a  period of no clinical use.  Method 4 Flow monitoring: Initially developed   at Sunshine Hospital, Melbourne, this method uses  purpose-built flow metres to measure the quantity  of N2O used in a specific area of the hospital to  assist in detecting leaks.

Addressing and minimising N2O leaks in  healthcare is an important step in reducing  healthcare’s greenhouse gas emissions that has  been ignored for too long. The sector has the  ability, and an obligation, to act to minimise  unnecessary N2O emissions and the associated  wasted financial cost.  ha Read the ‘Detecting and reducing leaks from  nitrous oxide in healthcare facilities — A  practical guide’ here: https://www.health. gov.au/sites/default/files/2024-09/detecting- and-reducing-leaks-from-nitrous-oxide-in- healthcare-facilities-a-practical-guide_0.pdf “Hospitals can consider testing their N2O  infrastructure for leaks or may consider moving  straight to decommissioning the pipeline and moving  to cylinders at the point of care to reduce waste.”  ===== PAGE 28 ===== 28    The Health Advocate  •  NOVEMBER 2024 High burden from   chronic respiratory conditions DR LUISE KAZDA  Research Fellow  in Health Systems  Sustainability,  Healthy  Environments and  Lives (HEAL) Global  Research Centre,  Health Research  Institute, University  of Canberra Chronic respiratory conditions in Australia Chronic respiratory conditions like asthma and  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) carry  a high disease burden in Australia, with around 34%  of Australians self-reporting at least one type of  chronic respiratory condition (see AIHW: Chronic  respiratory conditions). The burden of disease of  both asthma and COPD has been linked to socio- economic disadvantage with a higher prevalence  of disease among people from more disadvantaged  areas and from more remote regions. Other risk  factors for respiratory conditions include genetic  risk and environmental exposures such as cigarette  smoking and air pollution. In recent years, several  natural events, such as the severe Australian  bushfires in 2019/20 and meteorologically adverse  conditions combined with very high pollen  counts (‘thunderstorm asthma’ events) occurred.  These have had huge impacts on the Australian  population and the health care system, with  hospitalisations and emergency department  presentations for respiratory conditions spiking  and associated economic costs increasing. Climate  change is making these adverse environmental  conditions more common, further increasing  the burden of asthma and COPD on patients and  demands on the health care system.

A joint statement from  the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality  in Health Care, the Interim Australian Centre for  Disease Control, and the Council of Presidents  of Medical Colleges, has called for low-emission,  climate-resilient and culturally safe models of  care. Australia’s first National Health and Climate  Strategy lists ‘decarbonisation’ as one of four  objectives, specifically referring to metered dose  inhalers (MDIs) as a significant ‘carbon hotspot’  in clinical care and as a priority for action. It is  estimated that these alone account for 3% of the  National Health System’s (NHS) carbon footprint  in the UK3. These high emissions inhalers contain  potent greenhouse gases (hydrofluorocarbon) as  propellants, producing between 10 and 30 times  as much carbon dioxide equivalent emissions as  dry powder inhalers (DPIs), which are very often  clinically equivalent. The recently completed  review of Australia’s health technology assessment  policies and methods for the Australian Government  recommends reporting of greenhouse gas emissions  associated with health technology products, with  specific reference to respiratory inhalers where,  ‘knowledge of embodied emissions could enable  clinicians to prescribe (and patients to ask for)  the most environmentally friendly option’ (HTA  Methods and Policy Review, Recommendation 43). Transition to low carbon respiratory inhalers   is achievable, but needs good data and   concerted action There are substantial differences between countries  in the estimated proportion of respiratory inhalers  sold that are MDIs. In Sweden, only 13% of inhalers  are MDIs, while in England they make up around  70% of inhalers4. These differences in prescribing  patterns are thought to be primarily influenced  by cost, marketing strategies and prescribers’ and  patients’ familiarity with certain inhaler types, not  by appropriateness of the device for the patient5.  In Australia, data on all inhalers dispensed at  national level, including over the counter sales,  are currently lacking. Approximately half of short- acting beta2 agonist (SABA) MDIs (e.g. Ventolin)  used in Australia are purchased over the counter  at pharmacies without a script, but these are  not captured in national pharmaceutical benefits  scheme (PBS) dispensing datasets.                      > pixabay  ===== PAGE 30 ===== 30    The Health Advocate  •  NOVEMBER 2024 Asthma Australia, the national peak body  for people with asthma, in partnership with  Deakin University, have published ‘The National  Sustainable Asthma Care Roadmap’, informed  by comprehensive stakeholder roundtable  discussion. In line with the National Health and  Climate Strategy, a priority action item for the  Roadmap is the establishment of a data dashboard  including baseline measures on inhaler use for  benchmarking and tracking trends in high and  low emissions inhalers over time. Simultaneously,  the National Asthma Council, the peak body for  clinicians in this field, is calling for a reduction  in environmental impacts from asthma care,  specifically citing the overuse of SABA inhalers,  most of which are MDIs in Australia, as a key focus  for action. The frequent use of SABA inhalers is an indicator  for poor asthma control and is associated with an  increased risk of exacerbations in both asthma  and COPD. As such, the use of SABA alone is no  longer recommended by national and international  asthma guidelines. Nevertheless, they remain  the most frequently purchased type of inhaler  in Australia. Concerningly, the National Asthma  Indicator on suboptimal asthma control does not  show any improvements and reports that 18% of  people aged 40 or under who were dispensed at  least one SABA inhaler, were dispensed more than  two of these in one year — indicating substantial  overuse and poor disease control. To improve our understanding of the population  groups with poor asthma/COPD control, and which  groups account for most high emission inhaler  use, there needs to be easier access to sales  data to researchers and the public. With more  complete data on total inhaler use, we can better  design, implement and tailor interventions to  enable equitable high-quality, low-carbon, chronic  respiratory care. Sustainable, high-quality, respiratory care The ‘principles for sustainable clinical practice‘  provide a helpful framework for thinking about  sustainable respiratory care. Implementing the  principles of prevention (e.g. tobacco control,  better housing, reducing air pollution), patient  empowerment (e.g. effective asthma action  plans), lean service delivery (the right care at  the right time, including limiting overdiagnosis6  and overtreatment), are done alongside moving  to low carbon alternative treatments (i.e. low  carbon respiratory inhalers). The transition to  sustainable respiratory care will need to include  educating clinicians and patients on good asthma/ COPD management to reduce SABA reliance as  well as increasing awareness at all levels about  the high carbon footprint of MDIs. Co-developing  solutions with patients and clinicians, and affected  communities, is essential.   ha  ===== PAGE 31 ===== The Health Advocate  •  NOVEMBER 2024    31 REFERENCES 1.

These carbon emissions, in turn,  contribute to human harm. As an example, in the  three months of the 2022 European summer, there  were an estimated 61,672 heat-related deaths, with  heat-related deaths globally being projected to  increase 5-fold by 2050.  In November 2023 the Australian Government  launched the National Health and Climate Strategy,  committing Australia to a net-zero health system by  2050. There is limited research, however, on how to  achieve this decarbonisation. The majority (60-70%)  of healthcare emissions arise from the provision  of clinical care (medical equipment, consumables,  pathology etc.) rather than from building energy  usage. Healthcare, therefore, cannot rely only on  transitioning to renewable energy to be net-zero  by 2050, and instead must develop lower carbon  pathways of care while not adversely impacting  patient safety. The problem is that there is a lack  of carbon data on individual medical devices and  procedures to develop these pathways. The Healthcare Carbon Lab (HCL) was launched  in July of 2024, funded by the University of  Melbourne’s Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry  and Health Sciences. It is being undertaken in  collaboration with Western Health, Melbourne,  which is acting as the physical lab for us to  undertake research and implement mitigation  strategies. The primary aim of the HCL is to  carbon footprint commonly used medical devices  and procedures. This will allow clinicians or other  stakeholders, such as health economists, when they  are undertaking health technology assessments,  to compare different ways of providing care. In  addition, this process will also help identify carbon  hotspots, and hence provide information on the  best places to focus mitigation strategies.  The carbon footprints are being quantified using  environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). LCA  measures environmental emissions over the whole  life cycle (raw material extraction, manufacture,  use, and end of life), ensuring that any mitigation  strategies in one part of the life cycle do not shift  the burden to another part, or that reducing one  “The primary aim of the HCL is to  carbon footprint commonly used  medical devices and procedures.”  ===== PAGE 33 ===== The Health Advocate  •  NOVEMBER 2024    33 emission does not increase another (e.g. reducing  carbon emissions increases ozone depletion or  water use). It does this by creating an inventory of  all materials and energy used over the whole life  cycle (e.g. fuel used for mining machinery, or the  energy used for recycling).  The HCL is collecting foreground data, and more  specifically, the weights and compositions of  devices and the energy use of equipment. As an  example, a syringe is made up of a polypropylene  barrel and plunger and a rubber seal and is  wrapped in a polyethylene film. Each of these  components is weighed, and the exact composition  of each component is determined using a mass  spectrometer. These are then modelled using  background LCA databases, that contain the  emissions associated with processes like mining  emissions or from plastic manufacture. In addition  to the composition of devices, we include all  the emissions from a device’s lifecycle, such as  sterilisation, transport, and end of life (e.g. landfill,  incineration or recycling).  As there are thousands of individual medical  devices, the HCL is utilising procurement data  from Western Health to determine the most to  least procured items, and then preferencing data  collection to those items that are more commonly  used. We have started with items in the intensive  care unit and are now moving to the rest of the  hospital.  The aim of the HCL is to have a database  containing the carbon footprints of devices  and procedures that is accessible to as many  clinicians, health economists and researchers,  hospital administrators and procurement staff, and  policymakers as possible. We are investigating ways  that this will be funded, whether by government or  through a subscription, as living databases require  ongoing maintenance to ensure that data is up to  date and to pay the licence fees for background  LCA databases. Our hope is that the HCL database  will provide the necessary fundamental research  to help drive the move towards low-carbon  healthcare.  ha Photoshop AI generated  ===== PAGE 34 ===== 34    The Health Advocate  •  NOVEMBER 2024 DR KRISTEN  PICKLES  Research Fellow,  Wiser Healthcare  Research  Collaboration, School  of Public Health,  University of Sydney PROF ALEXANDRA  BARRATT  Professor of Public  Health, Wiser  Healthcare Research  Collaboration,  Sydney School  of Public Health,  University of Sydney The Wiser Healthcare   Net Zero Program A partnership to address the carbon footprint of   NSW Health hospitals  DR ERIN MATHIEU  Senior Lecturer,  Academic Director,  Wiser Healthcare  Research  Collaboration, School  of Public Health,  University of Sydney PROF KATY BELL  Professor of Clinical  Epidemiology, Wiser  Healthcare Research  Collaboration,  Sydney School  of Public Health,  University of Sydney  ===== PAGE 35 ===== The Health Advocate  •  NOVEMBER 2024    35 NSW Health Net Zero Clinical program  For the pilot program, which ran from June 2022– June 2024, ten clinicians (‘Net Zero Leads’) were  selected to lead exemplary sustainability projects  of scalable, low-carbon models of care. Funding  was provided to back-fill the clinicians from their  usual clinical activities one day per week. The pilot  program was inspired by the successful Sustainable  Specialties in the United Kingdom1. To support this initiative, a new partnership was  established between academic researchers from  Wiser Healthcare, HEAL, and NSW Health’s Climate  Risk and Net Zero Unit to support intervention  design and evaluation of the sustainability projects.  The NSW Health Net Zero Leads Academic  Partnership was the first of its kind in Australia,  adding value to the first significant, strategic  investment by a state health department towards  achieving net zero healthcare. It is an essential step  in achieving Australia’s commitment to the United  Nations to implement a Low-carbon health system  and aligns strongly with the new National Health  and Climate Strategy of the Australian Government  (released November 2023).  The Wiser Healthcare—Net Zero Partnership is  a potential model for research generation and  evaluation of sustainable health care quality  improvement projects.  Net Zero Clinical Leads Health system changes require innovations across  every service and specialty. To achieve this change,  ten clinicians from different specialties across NSW  were appointed to lead the implementation of  environmentally sustainable healthcare initiatives  in their clinical settings. Their clinical areas were  chosen for diversity with specific targeting of  carbon hotspots. Each of the clinical leads acted as  change agents within their department and hospital  while also undertaking specific discrete projects  that may be scaled up for potential roll-out across  the state.                                                          > “The Wiser Healthcare—Net Zero  Partnership is a potential model for  research generation and evaluation  of sustainable health care quality  improvement projects.” Photoshop AI generated  ===== PAGE 36 ===== 36    The Health Advocate  •  NOVEMBER 2024 The Wiser Healthcare Net Zero  Partnership The Partnership was formed by the engagement  of 9 University of Sydney members (6 academics,  two professional staff and one PhD student) with  the NSW Health’s Climate Risk and Net Zero Unit  in November 2022. The purpose was to develop  research capability amongst the clinical Leads and  provide robust measurement and evaluation of  quality improvement initiatives aimed at reducing  the carbon footprint of processes and procedures  administered in the clinical setting. Via Wiser  Healthcare and HEAL, the Net Zero Leads had  access to Australia’s best experts in sustainable  healthcare, providing a platform for NSW Health   to lead national reform. This partnership generated significant new  knowledge for health system sustainably, a priority  area for reform of healthcare within NSW (Future  Health Strategy 2022-2032). The sustainability  projects included: reduction in unnecessary use  of non-sterile gloves (allied health), improved  management of pharmaceutical waste (pharmacy),  reusable surgical linen and barrier gowns (surgery  and ICU), switching off CT scanners when not  in use (medical imaging), reducing unnecessary  pathology testing (emergency medicine), reducing  use of volatile anaesthetic gases with high carbon  footprints (anaesthetics). This innovative partnership has had   direct beneficial impacts on healthcare  delivery in NSW, by increasing the  delivery of sustainable healthcare  The projects supported by the academic  partnership not only achieved increased clinician  engagement and capabilities to conduct robust  research in sustainable healthcare, but also  demonstrated benefits to health care efficiency,  financial savings, and carbon emission reductions.  Several of the interventions have now been  adopted in multiple other hospitals throughout the  state, demonstrating beneficial impacts beyond the  initial site. There have also been beneficial impacts  on the generation of new knowledge, with 12  manuscripts under consideration or in preparation  for publication in peer-reviewed journals; 8 of  these report project interventions and evaluation  outcomes, and four are evidence reviews.

Karen’s first retirement only lasted five months  and, reflecting on it now, she realises she just  needed a bit of a break. She managed to stay retired for four years the  second time, but after a big interstate move and  renovating her home, she found herself looking  around for her next challenge. Back in the game Karen is one of a growing number of Australians who  are “unretiring”. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics,  there are around 40,000 more people aged 65   and over in the workforce than the same time a  year ago. The reasons for returning to work after retirement  are many and varied, including cost-of-living  pressures, social interaction, and a sense of  purpose. For Karen, it was the promise of more intellectual  stimulation that encouraged her to apply for a job. “I think it’s the joy of trying to solve a problem   or come up with different solutions to things,”   Karen says. “That was the thing for me that really triggered it. “I also think sharing your knowledge with others   is really wonderful at this stage of life. “I’m really loving it because I’m working for a fund  that’s so devoted to members, as well as trying to  get system change, which is really interesting.” Weighing it up There can be a number of financial implications to  explore if you’re considering returning to work: •	 If you’re receiving the Age Pension, you’ll need to  let Centrelink know about any additional income  within 14 days. Under the Work Bonus, eligible  pensioners can earn $300 a fortnight without  reducing their pension. •	 If you’re receiving an income from your super,  you can switch your account back into the  accumulation phase. It’s important to know that  this will have tax implications. •	 You could also keep your super in the income  stream phase to supplement your income and  open a new accumulation account for your  employer contributions.  Unretired   and rehired You’ve heard of retirees going back to work. But what about  returning to the workforce after you’ve retired twice?  ===== PAGE 39 ===== The Health Advocate  •  NOVEMBER 2024    39 There can be other costs to consider before putting  your hand up for a new job: •	 Don’t forget to factor in things like petrol and  vehicle maintenance, or public transport and  buying your lunch, which can be more expensive  than eating at home. •	 And if you’re caring for someone, you may need  to hire a carer while you’re at work. Considering reversing your retirement? If you’re thinking of returning to the workforce,  Karen has some tips. “Think about what really makes you interested  about work and the things that really matter to  you,” she says. “And put an application in. Because I think a lot   of retired people don’t. You might think you’re going  to get a negative reaction because of your age, but  that’s not always the case.” With many industries across Australia facing  staff shortages, employers are eager to fill their  vacancies and retirees are in demand. In fact, according to recruiter Robert Half, 58% of  Australian employers have hired a retiree in the past  12 months, and a further 37% would consider it. And why wouldn’t they? “There are great employers out there like HESTA  who want that knowledge brought in,” Karen says. “Let’s face it, once you’ve been at work a long  time, you do have a lot of knowledge about yourself,  as well as what you can do.” Issued by H.E.S.T.

One of the ways we do  this is to trial new initiatives. Many people with lung and heart conditions  live with breathlessness every day. Even when  they receive good medical care, this distressing  symptom stops people from doing simple day- to-day activities. Many people with chronic  breathlessness and their family/carers experience  anxiety, depression and social isolation. Chronic  breathlessness is a frequent reason for Emergency  Department visits and hospital admissions, resulting  in high health care costs for services, out-of-pocket  expenses and increased care and support needs  provided by carers. Internationally, growing research evidence  supports the use of symptom-based care to lessen  the effects of breathlessness on the quality of  life and distress for carers and families. There is  compelling evidence that in the year after receiving  brief symptom-based interventions through a  Breathlessness Intervention Service, unplanned  hospital admissions reduce by as much as 50-60%.  Despite this, few services are available in Australia  that focus on the management of this troubling  symptom.   People living with   breathlessness support   new trial of in-home physio MIREI CHURTON   Capital Health Network  Project Officer  ===== PAGE 41 ===== The Health Advocate  •  NOVEMBER 2024    41 a) New model of care: in-home physio  To address this issue, CHN engaged the University  of Technology Sydney, Southside Physio, consumers,  and clinicians to co-design and develop a pilot of  a Breathlessness Intervention Service in the ACT.  The ACT Breathlessness Intervention Service (ABIS)  is addressing the local primary and community  care needs. This pilot is contributing towards  growing evidence about how a Breathlessness  Intervention Service could work best for our local  community. It also highlights to clinicians the role  of non-pharmacological interventions, including  engagement of Allied Health practitioners, in  managing breathlessness to reduce distress and  improve the quality of life of patients and their  carers.  The ABIS Pilot program is delivered by the  Southside Physio Mobile team. Requiring a medical  referral, clients receive an initial home visit by  a Physiotherapist, with 2 to 5 follow-ups at home  or by phone. Interventions are non-pharmacological  and address the ‘Breathing, Thinking and  Functioning’ components of breathlessness. Both  the patient and their carer are supported by ABIS. The ABIS trial is supported by funding from CHN  through the Australian Government’s Greater  Choice for At Home Palliative Care Program. b) Key outcomes Over a 16-month period (March 2023 — July  2024), 93 patients completed the ABIS program  with 4-6 home visits from the Physiotherapist.  All patients achieved improvement on at least  one outcome measure, such as reduced severity  of breathlessness, or improved performance of  nominated activity of daily living. Another key outcome of the ABIS trial is that  some patients reported not calling an ambulance  when they usually would. 23% of patients who  received at least one visit said they thought about  calling an ambulance on 44 occasions, but instead  self-managed using ABIS techniques. Unpaid family carers of people living with  breathlessness also benefited from the ABIS trial.  58/77 (75%) of carers of discharged patients (who  provided at least two data points) reported at least  a one-point improvement from ‘not confident’  to ‘somewhat’ or ‘very confident’ in managing  symptoms of breathlessness from their first session  in comparison to their last session.  c) Independent evaluation  New referrals are no longer being accepted.   The ABIS trial will be evaluated by the University   of Technology Sydney, with the report due in   March 2025.  > “Many people with lung and  heart conditions live with  breathlessness every day.

Tony loved his garden and produced  almost all of his food himself. He had a few olive  trees and was passionate about producing several  products with them. Due to being anxious about  feeling breathless, Tony reduced his activity level  severely. This led to an increase in pain due to  his osteoarthritis, which then further reduced his  activity level. Through the program, Tony increased  his activity level using a slow introduction to some  functional activities around and inside his house.  Due to the education given, Tony was not scared  or anxious to go into a state of being breathless  and could manage it with breathing techniques.  Slowly his osteoarthritis pain improved, and  he managed a higher level of activity. Initially,  Tony highly considered knee replacements, but  after completing the program, his pain reduced  enough to not require surgery. By the end of the  ABIS program, Tony managed to have a full olive  production going. Tony was loving every moment  of it and was so appreciative of what the program  meant to him. Tony can now implement the ABIS  techniques that he learnt through the program for  the rest of his life.

The Strategy lays out a whole-of-government plan  for addressing the health and wellbeing impacts  of climate change, whilst also addressing the  contribution of the health system to climate change.  It consolidates work across Australia that has been  occurring at state, territory, regional and local  levels.  The Strategy has benefited from strong community  and stakeholder engagement, including from  health service providers, aged care providers, peak  bodies, academia and industry. It prioritises co- design with First Nations leaders and community  representatives. The Strategy includes 49 actions to be  implemented over five years and since its launch  in December last year, we have made considerable  progress across a range of areas.  On an international level, the Australian  Government has joined the World Health  Organization’s Alliance for Transformative Action  on Climate and Health (ATACH), an alliance  of 85 countries committed to strengthening  climate adaptation and resilience and low carbon  sustainable health systems (Action 5.3). We also  signed a public statement of collaboration with  the United Kingdom and the United States to  decarbonise healthcare supply chains (Action 5.2). After contributing to the National Climate Risk  Assessment and National Adaptation Plan developed  by the Department of Climate Change, Energy,  Environment and Water (Actions 3.1 and 3.2), we are  now developing a Health National Adaptation Plan  to complement the National Adaptation Plan and  set out a coordinating framework for the health and  wellbeing impacts of climate change. We are also  currently developing guidance on climate-health risk  assessment and adaptation planning for healthcare  (Action 3.3). Among the many actions necessary to reduce  health system gas emissions, a key task is to set  standards and ensure strategic alignment among  health organisations. Along this line, the Australian  Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care  has piloted an ‘Environmental Sustainability and  Climate Resilience’ module across almost 50 hospital  sites across the country with a view to informing  the next edition of the National Safety and Quality  Health Service Standards (mandatory accreditation  standards) due in 2027. In October, Australian medical colleges together  with the Australian Commission on Safety and  Quality in Healthcare and the interim Australian  Centre for Disease Control announced joint work  to develop a framework for action on climate and  health emphasising prevention, minimising harmful  and wasteful care, and reducing emissions from high  value care (progressing Actions 4.7, 4.8 and 7.1).  Evidence-gathering and review are crucial  building blocks that inform the approach of the  Strategy. Several reports are nearing completion,  including baseline estimates of health greenhouse  gas emissions (Action 4.1), a mapping review of  Australian research on climate change and health  National Health   and Climate Strategy:  Update  ===== PAGE 45 ===== The Health Advocate  •  NOVEMBER 2024    45 interventions (Action 7.2), ​a review of sustainability  in food and catering policies in Australian public  hospitals (Action 4.15), and a review of interventions  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from health  system waste (Action 4.16). The National Health and  Medical Research Council (NHMRC) also launched a  Targeted Call for Research (Action 7.3). Aiming to reduce emissions from medicines  and anaesthetic gases, we have worked with the  University of Melbourne to develop and release  a practical guide, ‘Detecting and reducing  leaks from nitrous oxide in healthcare facilities’  (Action 4.13). This will assist facilities and health  practitioners identify faults in piped supplies  of nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas that is also  an occupational health and safety concern. We  have also engaged with states and territories,  anaesthetics professional organisations and the  Council of Australian Therapeutic Advisory Groups  to reduce emissions from the anaesthetic gas  desflurane (Action 4.12). Addressing greenhouse gas  emissions from respiratory inhaler propellants, we  have participated in roundtables with medical and  non-government organisations responsible for lung  health, organised by peak body, Asthma Australia.  They have now launched a National Sustainable  Asthma Care Roadmap which will accelerate work  to reduce emissions from respiratory inhalers and  improve asthma care, contributing to the fulfilment  of Action 4.14. Governance structures have now been established  and committees have commenced their work,  including a Program Board of senior Australian  Government staff; a Climate and Health Expert  Advisory Group; and a State and Territory Working  group. In September, an Implementation Plan was  published on the National Health and Climate  Strategy website. Other resources are available for  download, including the strategy itself. We welcome  continued engagement in the policy making process.  The path to decarbonisation and readying the  health system for climate change is a long one  which extends beyond the timeline of the Strategy.  Transformation requires concerted action by  everyone working within the health system, as well  as other sectors and the wider community. While  there has been great progress, there is still much  more work to do: roll up your sleeves and help us  tackle the greatest health threat of this century!  ha The Hon Ged Kearney, Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care, launched Australia’s first National Health and Climate in 2023.  ===== PAGE 46 ===== 46    The Health Advocate  •  NOVEMBER 2024 MAJA VAN BRUGGEN DIRECTOR   Sustainability Action,   NT Health Strategic and operational transformation for  health care sustainability is trickier than ever  with increasing demand, decreasing budgets and  frequently shifting priorities and players. How do  you decide where to spend your time and what  you should lead or support or just monitor in  order to make a difference? Firstly, keep an eye on the problems you are  trying to solve. The current global impacts  of climate change are occurring more quickly  than anticipated with seven of nine planetary  boundaries now breached1 so maintaining line of  sight to the global mission of addressing the climate  crisis, helps achieve clarity of purpose, reduce   local distractions and enable effective prioritisation  of effort. One practical strategy to achieve this clarity  of purpose is to ‘join the dots’. Start with a  clear problem at the global level (for example,  healthcare systems globally account for over 4%  of global CO2 emissions2), then identify key data  or research which helps bring the problem into  sharper focus at a more local level (for example, in  Australia healthcare accounts for 7% of Australia’s  CO2 emissions3 and, of these emissions, food/ accommodation and transport account for two  of the top three Scope 3 emissions4). Then insert  your own jurisdictional priority challenge and/ or applicable data (i.e. in relation to food, you  could highlight estimated facility food waste, or in  relation to transport, you could highlight emissions  (and costs) of transport based on your current  models of care).  By describing the problem in increasingly specific  dimensions at the national, local and organisational  levels, you can prioritise (and communicate) clearly  ‘why’ and ‘how’ your efforts contribute directly to  urgent global healthcare sustainability efforts. This  joining of the dots also helps to highlight potential  opportunities. For example, clinical care accounts  Tackling the tricky stuff System transformation at speed. Where can you start? “Are you a knowledge  sharer, an influencer of  change or a connector  of people?”  ===== PAGE 47 ===== The Health Advocate  •  NOVEMBER 2024    47 for 80% of Australia’s health care emissions and,  of this, 30% is identified as low value care5. This  means, by targeting evidence based, college  supported Choosing Wisely recommendations in  relation to low value related activity, hospitals  could reduce their emissions… and costs, patient  impacts and workload. This equips you to more  powerfully influence potential collaborators,  colleagues and/or decision makers, because your  approach is mission centric and data informed. Once you have clarity of purpose, you need to  consider your own expertise and strengths. Are  you a knowledge sharer, an influencer of change  or a connector of people? Each of these roles are  critical in triggering or accelerating organisational  and social change6. Understanding your strengths  and how to apply them in these roles will help you  to prioritise where and how you spend your limited  time for maximum value. In addition to your own capabilities, it is  important to consider the context in which you  are trying to make a difference. Given the urgency  of sustainability action in healthcare, aligning or  integrating sustainability efforts into existing  initiatives and strategic priorities is a powerful and  immediate opportunity to influence change. This  could involve: •	 Aligning with top priorities — scan  organisational strategies to identify priority  goals and frame environmental sustainability  opportunities and objectives in terms which  align with the existing stated priorities. For  example, healthcare workforce shortages across  local, national and global contexts demand a  reimagining of how healthfulness is achieved  across populations. Value based health care  (VBHC) is about achieving the best possible  outcomes for people receiving care with the     >  supplied  ===== PAGE 48 ===== 48    The Health Advocate  •  NOVEMBER 2024 lowest possible use of resources. Applying this  VBHC lens to health system redesign aligns  environmental and workforce sustainability in  healthcare to be addressed simultaneously. •	 Following the money — identify what is already  funded and integrate a sustainability lens into  it. Alternatively, identify where savings could be  achieved and highlight the return on investment  of prioritising an environmental sustainability  priority. This could mean incorporating relevant  sustainability concepts, evidence or metrics  into project design, business planning, tender  development or service redesign. For example,  investment in virtual health care infrastructure. •	 Highlighting co-benefits — many sustainability  actions have multiple co-benefits (i.e. good  for patients, staff, the budget and the planet).  Helping key staff and decision makers understand  this and encouraging them to apply this to  strengthen proposals or business cases can better  highlight sustainability co-benefits and overall  value (and criticality) of sustainability action.  For example, applying targeted evidence based  recommendations from the Choosing Wisely  framework to reduce low value care in a health  service has benefits for patients (less invasive/ stressful/time consuming), staff (frees time for  higher value functions), the budget (saves health  system costs in terms of consumables, waste and  time) and the planet (less emissions and product  waste into the environment). To really accelerate system transformation,  framing the message is important. This could  include describing problems in a health context,  for example, at the strategic level, framing the  climate issue as a health issue by consistently  reinforcing that human health is dependent on  planetary health (and vice versa) helps to boost the  urgency and authority of the issue across sectoral  ‘boundaries’. At an organisational level, framing  sustainability as a powerful co-benefit helps to  lower barriers and build a sustainability mindset  which supports the diffusion of sustainability  ownership and action across the organisation.  At the operational level, given there is so much  to do, if there are barriers in one area (such as no  dedicated budget, no interest, no capacity) then  refocussing your time and efforts to priorities  where enablers exist (such as champions keen to  help, colleagues with clarity of purpose, aligned  initiatives which are funded) allows you to make  progress. Key enablers which you can use to frame  “The bigger and more diverse your network of colleagues  and collaborators is, the greater your potential to influence  priorities, share important opportunities to align effort and  leverage collective mission oriented action.”  ===== PAGE 49 ===== The Health Advocate  •  NOVEMBER 2024    49 sustainability actions (or co-benefits) include: •	 The accreditation process (for example,  preparing to meet the Environmental  Sustainability and Climate Resilience Healthcare  Module) •	 risk management (for example, preparing to  meet climate related financial disclosures) •	 financial sustainability (for example, highlighting  savings through initiatives such as reducing  low value care through the Choosing Wisely  framework, reducing inappropriate glove use  through targeted campaigns and other evidence  based sustainability initiatives) •	 clinical redesign (for example promoting, co- designing or supporting value based health care  approaches) •	 quality improvement (for example partnering  with the Quality Improvement (QI) staff in your  health service to embed sustainability concepts  across all applicable QI initiatives). Strategic and operational transforming is a  team effort. You are not alone. The bigger and  more diverse your network of colleagues and  collaborators is, the greater your potential to  influence priorities, share important opportunities  to align effort and leverage collective mission  oriented action. The bottom line is that you are best placed to see  opportunities to align effort and reframe thinking  when you have broad networks (friends and  colleagues spanning multiple sectors, professions  and interests) combined with clarity of purpose  (linking a global problem with a local problem). Ultimately, unlike arbitrary targets, budget  allocations and project deadlines, the planetary  boundaries are not negotiable, so clarity of purpose  and urgency of strategically targeted and aligned  actions are powerful ways to avoid distractions and  tackle the tricky stuff at speed.   ha References:  1: Azote for Stockholm Resilience Centre, based on analysis in  Richardson et al 2023  2: Health Care Without Harm, Health Care’s Climate Footprint,  September 2019, https://global.noharm.org/resources/health-care- climate-footprint-report  3: Malik, A, Lenzen, M, McAlister, S and McGain, F, The carbon  footprint of Australian health care, Lancet Planet Health 2018,  Volume 2, Issue 1, e27-35 https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf ?pii=S2542-5196%2817%2930180-8  4: Health Care Without Harm, Global Road Map for Health Care  Decarbonisation, Australia, 2014, https://healthcareclimateaction. org/fact-sheets/en/English%20-%20Australia  5: Barratt, A.L., Bell, K.J., Charlesworth, K. and McGain, F.

The Roadmap will provide a blueprint for how the  NSW Health system is working towards the NSW  Government’s net zero targets of a 50% reduction  (based on 2018-19 levels) by 2030 and net zero  by 2050. NSW Health has consulted extensively in  developing the Roadmap, with over 2,200 staff and  public contributions. The Roadmap is anticipated  for release in early 2025. Reducing low-value care and  decarbonising evidence-based care More than half of the health system’s carbon  footprint is from clinical care: pharmaceuticals,  medical devices, equipment, food services, staff  and patient transport. We recognise that everyone  has a role to play in our transition to net zero,  including our frontline staff. Earlier this year, our pilot Net Zero Leads  program concluded. The program supported  clinicians to step out of their clinical practice on a  fractional basis to lead net zero initiatives. Some  of the successful initiatives focused on reducing  the impact of healthcare waste, switching to  greener products or procedures, and reducing or  eliminating single-use equipment. Examples include  Tina Wilkie’s Gloves Off! project, A/Prof Deepak  Bhonagiri’s ICU barrier gown project and   Dr Anthony Hull’s desflurane project. For 2024-2027, the program has been expanded  to include multi-disciplinary Hubs across known  carbon hotspots in theatres, ICU, ED, endoscopy,  women’s health, general medicine and renal care.  Appointed clinicians are responsible for becoming  exemplars and guiding decarbonisation in their  service or specialty.  Desflurane  Anaesthetic gases account for approximately five  per cent of a hospital’s greenhouse gas emissions.  Awareness has grown about the environmental  impact of desflurane.

Investing in innovation We recognise that staff have innovative and  impactful ideas that can improve the sustainability  of our health system. Earlier this year, we  announced the second round of recipients of the  Sustainable Futures Innovation Fund*. This initiative  was established in December 2023 to provide  dedicated start-up funding for staff-led innovation  projects that improve patient care and reduce the  environmental footprint of NSW Health.

The award recognises  the achievements of the health system and  workforce to reduce NSW Health’s environmental  footprint, whilst continuing to deliver high-quality  healthcare and patient experience. This year, three impressive teams have been  identified as award finalists with initiatives that  focus on reducing the impact of clinical and textile  waste and reducing the carbon footprint of care at  all levels. These sustainability leaders and clinical  champions are critical to supporting our transition  towards a high-quality, low-carbon and climate  resilient health system.  ha GraphicStock  ===== PAGE 52 ===== 52    The Health Advocate  •  NOVEMBER 2024 DR BRIAN O’CONNELL  Emergency Physician,   Net Zero Lead - NSW  Health, Climate and  Health Alliance (CAHA)  Board member MICHELLE ISLES  CEO Climate and Health  Alliance (CAHA) Climate change is increasing the demand for  healthcare, while exacerbating adverse health  outcomes through direct impacts on health, such  as illness associated with fossil fuel exposure, and  indirect impacts linked to increasingly frequent  climate disasters. Budgets of Federal, State and  Territory governments in Australia now must  account for ‘unnatural’ disaster management.   In 2023-24, the Australian Government expected  to spend $101.0 billion on health, while climate  disasters cost the economy an estimated $38   billion annually. How can the health systems respond to these  growing costs and impacts? One area of focus is the dual opportunity of  assessing value of care and the environmental  impact of its delivery. In Australia, healthcare  accounts for an estimated 7% of national emissions.  Emissions can be attributed to direct emissions  from facilities, energy sources used in provision of  care, and the production and disposal of medical  goods and services. The carbon footprint of  Australian healthcare approximates almost half   the entire construction sector. A growing population and climatic factors are  contributing to an increased demand for patient  care — but is the care we provide high value?  Australian clinicians order over 500 million tests  annually. Unfortunately, evidence shows that  some 30% of clinical care is low-value, and 10%   even cause iatrogenic harm. Evidence is mounting to demonstrate value for  care, the environment and budget. Striving for  high-value, low carbon care can be addressed  at multiple scales; through national policy,  jurisdictional ambition, consumers, supply chains,  and the health service level. At the Climate and Health Alliances’ 2024  Greening the Healthcare Sector Forum, improving  the value of care is a priority discussion. Consumer health and value of care is a significant  challenge, boldly taken on in the recently-launched  National Sustainable Asthma Care Roadmap (the  Roadmap). One in nine Australians live with asthma,  and for around half of those people, it’s poorly  controlled. The main causes of poor control are  the overuse of ‘reliever’ medicines (predominantly  salbutamol), and the underuse of ‘preventer’  High-Value, Low Carbon  Care in action What is it? How you can get started  ===== PAGE 53 ===== The Health Advocate  •  NOVEMBER 2024    53 medicines (predominantly inhaled corticosteroids). Addressing a key action in the National Health  and Climate Strategy, the Roadmap was recently  delivered by Asthma Australia and Deakin  University’s Dr Mike Forrester. Recommendations  from the Roadmap include a campaign to inform  people with asthma about how to improve asthma  control — which has the potential to reduce  emissions in itself — and how they can reduce  emissions from alternative inhalers where suitable  devices are available. At the health systems level, Associate Professor  Christopher Leung will share progress of the  Victorian Choosing Wisely scaling collaborative,  established to reduce unnecessary tests,  treatments and procedures in 11 metropolitan  and regional health services. Within each health  service, clinical and project leaders were engaged,  and reductions in low-value care practices were  calculated. Mixed methods were used to determine  engagement by interdisciplinary clinicians and  patients. The nexus between low-value care and  unnecessary resources is further explored by  Kimberley Walter of Fiona Stanley Fremantle  Hospital, who will share an approach to sustainable  pathology practices. Variation in pathology testing can lead to  unnecessary patient discomfort, consume limited  resources, and increase emissions. Over-testing  causes physical, psychological, social, and financial  harm — while under-testing can result in delayed  or inaccurate diagnoses, leading to adverse  outcomes and higher costs. Unnecessary testing  not only offers minimal benefit, but also incurs a  high environmental cost, straining services under  extreme pressure. Additionally, low-value testing  for one patient may delay essential testing for  another, resulting in preventable harm. During COVID-19, models of care were adapted  to treat patients at home through virtual care.  Virtual care is a priority initiative for NSW Health,  and recognised as an important addition to in- person care. As the largest health district in NSW,  Hunter New England Local Health District (LHD) is  challenged to provide equitable access within its  vast geographical landscape. Ambitions in virtual care, along with their  ambitious Sustainable Healthcare: Together Towards  Zero strategy, will see the Hunter New England  LHD become the first carbon and waste neutral  health system in Australia. Hunter New England  LHD’s Jennifer Rutherford will share incredible  progress, including savings of 941,3069 tonnes of  carbon between January to August 2024, attributed  to 22,935 outpatient appointments via virtual care,  saving 3,342,664km of patient travel. Nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas that  leaks from healthcare facilities, representing some  70,000 tonnes of CO2e per annum across Australia.  Dr Cas Woinarski and the team at Barwon Health  are addressing this impact, and have assessed that  an estimated 50-100% of nitrous oxide use does  not improve patient’s care and its use, along with  associated emissions, could be avoided.
