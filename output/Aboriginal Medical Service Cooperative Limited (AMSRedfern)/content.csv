The AMS is a founding member of the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation  (formally NAIHO 1974) and of the NSW Aboriginal Health Resource Committee 1984 (now known as the  Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council of NSW). NACCHO and the AHMRC are the national  and state umbrella bodies respectively for Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services. We strive to improve the quality and range of our services through community interaction and  evaluation. We recognise that the unacceptable state of Aboriginal health will never improve  substantially while Aboriginal people are denied human rights and recognition of ownership of land. — National Aboriginal Health Strategy, 1989 our vision The Aboriginal Medical Service  Cooperative Limited (AMS Redfern)  will continue to be the leader in  Aboriginal Health for our people  and Communities across Australia.  AMS Redfern is the voice for health  and wellbeing through patient  advocacy and self-determination  for now and into the future. We see health as: “Not just the physical wellbeing of the individual  but the social, emotional and cultural wellbeing of the whole  community, this is a whole-of-life view and also includes the cyclical  concept of life-death-life.”   our Purpose To elevate, dignify and sustain the health of Aboriginal  people to an optimum level consistent with our holistic  concept of health, grounded by our values and beliefs,  cultural integrity and uncompromising  self-determination.  This includes the delivery and co-ordination of  healthcare services to the Aboriginal community,  through intervention, prevention and promotion  of healthcare services. 3 2	 Aboriginal Medical Service Co-operative Limited Annual Report 2022-2023 3 2	 Aboriginal Medical Service Co-operative Limited  ===== PAGE 3 ===== Contents   Chairperson Report 	 	 	 	 	 6 Organisational Structure		 	 	 	 7 CEO Report		 	 	 	 	 	 8 Financials	 	 	 	 	 	 	 10 Auditor’s Reports	 	 	 	 	 	 12 Committees and Meetings	 	 	 	 17 50 Year Gala Dinner	 	 	 	 	 18 Service Reports	 	 	 	 	 	 22 Trainee Spotlight	 	 	 	 	 	 28 The Exchange Building	 	 	 	 	 29 Community Events		 	 	 	 	 30 Our Staff	 	 	 	 	 	 	 34 Social Media	 	 	 	 	 	 35 For our  Elders 5 4	 Aboriginal Medical Service Co-operative Limited Annual Report 2022-2023 5  ===== PAGE 4 ===== Chairperson Report I am pleased to present the Annual Report  for 2022–2023 on behalf of the Board of  Directors of the Aboriginal Medical Service  Co-operative Limited (AMS Redfern). In the past year, the Board of Directors  meticulously evaluated our progress in  alignment with our strategic plan and  vision. Our commitment to collaborating  harmoniously with the local community to  develop programs and provide health services  that cater to our unique health needs, while  reinforcing self-determination, has remained  at the forefront of all our efforts. We have  listened to our patients’ needs, prioritised  patient-centered care, and embraced our  understanding of healing. Through our initial  evaluation, it is evident that the collective  efforts across all levels of our organisation  are significantly contributing to our overall  success. Our strategy of service expansion has been  realised and complements our vision for  growth. The new facility at 117a Redfern Street  enables us to offer a broader range of primary,  specialist, and allied health services, which  enhances our multidisciplinary approach to  medical care. By enhancing accessibility to  services, our objective is to improve the health  and well-being of the Aboriginal community  and we are committed to sustaining this  mission into the future. Through sound governance practices and  a robust management framework, coupled  with the tireless dedication of our staff and  community, we have successfully maintained  our position as a financially viable and self- sustained organisation. Our trajectory of  financial success is favourably positioned to  support our future goals of continuous growth. Recognising the significance of education  and training across all organisational levels,  the Board of Directors, senior management,  and frontline staff have actively engaged in  training. Ongoing education sessions for all  staff across the organisation continue on a  regular basis which enriches our decision- making and governance skill and ensures  our staff are well-versed in all aspects of our  operations and governance. As we shift our perspective on health to  an even more holistic approach, we aim to  deepen our cultural integration in care. We  aim to improve the community’s sense of  belonging and contribute positively to our  overall mental health, and we have been  fortunate to deliver a number of programs to  address this. As we build upon the achievements of  our past, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to  the Board of Directors for their dedication  and diligent work in shaping our Strategic  Plan. Their ongoing commitment to the  organisation is truly commendable. I eagerly  anticipate the continued collaboration with  our CEO and the Board to bring the  numerous goals we have set  for our organisation and  community into reality. With gratitude, Edie Coe  Chairperson,  Board of  Directors AMS Redfern wants you to  shape our future.  Become a member for just $1.  You can contribute to the  development of our community.

One of the most notable aspects of the past  year has been our shift in service delivery.  As the world continued to navigate the  challenges posed by the pandemic, we  recognised the importance of personal  connection and the irreplaceable value of in- person interactions. Therefore, we made the  strategic decision to transition from a hybrid  telehealth service (providing a mixture of face- to-face and telehealth appointments) back to a  face-to-face walk-in service only. This ensures  that our clients receive the personalised care  they deserve. As a result, we have seen an  increase in clients completing their annual  Health Assessment (715), which is the most  valuable tool we have for providing our clients  with a regular comprehensive review of their  health, in hopes to prevent acute health  episodes and chronic illnesses.   In line with this shift, we formally opened  117a Redfern Street (The Exchange Building),  which now houses a range of clinics, visiting  specialists, and the exercise clinic. This  enables us to provide comprehensive and  holistic healthcare services to our community.  With new spaces available for client care,  we have initiated deeper engagement with  specialists and begun planning new programs  that will address the health inequalities we  face. To support this expansion, we have  recruited several Aboriginal Health Worker  Trainees, who will play an instrumental role  in our organisation’s success by ensuring  the maintenance of our self-determination  through a sustainable Aboriginal workforce  that provides care to our own people and  community. Maintaining strong relationships with our  partner organisations is the key to improving  the health of our clients and our overall  success and when emerging from a prolonged  period of reduced interactions due to  COVID-19, we were able to celebrate our  achievements in safeguarding our community  over the recent years. This celebration took  the form of the inaugural Inner City Aboriginal  Health Challenge, where we took part in an  Oz-Tag tournament with Sydney Local Health  District. Similarly, we commemorated 50  years of AMS Redfern with a Gala Dinner. This  event provided a platform to honour our past  and current staff, community, and esteemed  partners; allowing them to reflect on the  positive impacts of their contributions since  our doors first opened in 1971. The past twelve months have marked a period  of significant growth and development for  our organisation where we have embraced  change and remained dedicated to enhancing  the health and lives of our community. Our  journey persists and I am confident that  with the continued support of our partners,  community, and exceptional team, we will  achieve even greater heights in the years  ahead. Thank you for your continued trust and  support.

In 1971, Redfern experienced a rapid increase in its Aboriginal population as a consequence of the  1967 referendum, which signalled the end of the official apartheid system. Subsequently, many  Aboriginal people from rural areas migrated to Sydney in pursuit of better job opportunities and  an improved quality of life. The core mission of AMS Redfern from its inception was to introduce the concept of Aboriginal  Community Controlled Healthcare and offer healthcare services to the local Aboriginal  community. The principles of self-determination formed the foundation of AMS Redfern’s work, as  it tirelessly tackled the issues of neglect and racism that Aboriginal people faced in mainstream  healthcare services.  Initially, AMS Redfern operated from a storefront on Regent Street in Redfern, later relocating to  Turner Street thanks to the generous donation of land by the Sisters of Mercy. The early days  of AMS Redfern relied on the dedication of volunteers, including doctors, nurses, nuns, medical  students/practitioners, and local Aboriginal individuals, all of whom played pivotal roles in the  organisation’s development.  Notable figures such as Professor Fred Hollows, Gary Foley, Sol Bellear, Gordon Briscoe, Naomi  Mayers, Marie Bashir, Dulcie Flower, Lyn Mundine, Mum Shirl, and Paul Coe were instrumental in  the establishment of AMS Redfern.  During their address to the audience, LaVerne Bellear (CEO), Edie Coe (Chair of the Board  of Directors) and Ricky Lyons (Director) all reflected on the triumphs and challenges of the  organisation since 1971, and echoed an acknowledgment to the thousands of people and  partnering organisations who have contributed to the success of the organisation since it began.

With the reduced risk of COVID-19 affecting services this year, the focus of the Medical Clinic has  been to deliver preventative health services through face-to-face appointments, and ensuring  regular recalls for our clients living with chronic diseases.  By reviewing and better understanding our client’s health journeys, the clinic has implemented  a range of strategies to increase the clinics catchment of Aboriginal Health Assessments (715’s),  including refining internal and external clinical referral processes.  Our ongoing review of patient feedback and community consultation continues as we look toward  imbedding a wide range of the community feedback we receive into our daily practice, and our  medical staff have been innovative in addressing these areas for service improvement. In line with the opening of our additional site at The Exchange Building (117a Redfern Street), the  Medical Clinic has recruited new staff to a number of positions to support the operations of our  growing organisation and community.
