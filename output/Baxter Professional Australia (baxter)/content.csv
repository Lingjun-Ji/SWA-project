From the Chair,  President and CEO Company Profile Corporate Responsibility  Commitment 2030 Corporate  Responsibility Goals Cross-Cutting  Commitments Appendix  ===== PAGE 3 =====   3 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT JOSÉ (JOE) E. ALMEIDA Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer From the Chair, President and CEO Baxter’s Mission to Save and Sustain Lives  encompasses far more than our broad portfolio  of healthcare products: it reflects our abiding  commitment to make a meaningful difference across  the communities where we live, work and serve  more than 350 million patients each year. This passion has been fundamental to our corporate  character since our founding nearly a century ago.  Most recently it has been brought to life through  our 2030 Corporate Responsibility Commitment,  a decade-spanning framework launched in 2021  focused on creating lasting environmental, social  and economic value across three critical pillars:  Empower Our Patients, Protect Our Planet, and  Champion Our People and Communities. We  consistently measure and evaluate our performance,  identify opportunities to drive even greater impact  and communicate our progress through this  important publication—our annual Corporate  Responsibility Report. Each of our 2030 Corporate Responsibility Goals is  advanced through clearly stated initiatives, financial  support and governance measures, to help ensure  progress and accountability. In 2023, we made  further progress in this journey, and you can find  many noteworthy highlights in the pages that follow. To spotlight just a few, Baxter: •	 Completed 150 energy-conservation projects   in 2023, which are estimated to reduce   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by approximately  21,100 metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent   per year beginning in 2024—nearly double the  GHG emissions reduction achieved with energy  projects completed in 2022 •	 Published our first report against the Task  Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures  framework •	 Announced a partnership with UNICEF and a  $2.5 million commitment through the Baxter  International Foundation to improve climate- smart access to safe drinking water and  sanitation in water-challenged regions of Egypt •	 Invested nearly $4.5 million in multiyear  programs through Baxter and the Baxter  International Foundation to support science,  technology, engineering and mathematics  (STEM) students at Historically Black Colleges  and Universities in the United States as well  as scholarships for ethnically diverse students  pursuing healthcare careers in Ireland  •	 Continued to achieve top quartile workplace  safety performance, as measured by total  recordable incident rate In 2023, Baxter also advanced a broad slate of  strategic transformation initiatives designed  to strengthen our business and promote even  greater impact for our wide-ranging stakeholder  base. We implemented a new global operating  model to streamline and simplify our business  structure into four global segments, divested  our BioPharma Solutions business and prepared  for the planned separation of our Kidney Care  segment, currently expected to occur in the  second half of 2024. The goal of these and related  initiatives is to get closer to our customers,  accelerate innovation and better position  Baxter to make a sustained impact for the many  stakeholder communities that depend on us. As our corporate profile evolves (including  after completion of the proposed Kidney Care  separation), we will continue to ensure that  our long-range corporate responsibility goals  align with our opportunities, business and  trajectory. As always, the Baxter team remains  strongly committed to doing business the right  way while working to address key priorities  that affect our patients, customers, employees,  communities and other stakeholders. I salute  our Baxter employees around the world—a team  approximately 60,000 strong—whose dedication  powers our performance as a corporate  responsibility leader. From the Chair,  President and CEO Company Profile Corporate Responsibility  Commitment 2030 Corporate  Responsibility Goals Cross-Cutting  Commitments Appendix  ===== PAGE 4 =====   4 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Company Profile  Every day, millions of patients, caregivers and  healthcare providers rely on Baxter’s broad portfolio  of essential healthcare products, therapies and digital  health solutions used across the care continuum.  Everything we do converges at the critical intersection  where products that save and sustain lives meet the  healthcare professionals and caregivers who make  it all happen. Throughout the companyʼs history, we  have demonstrated a commitment to research and  development (R&D), and we have a rich history of  firsts, from the first commercially manufactured  intravenous (IV) solutions to the first portable kidney  dialysis machine, among others. Our broad portfolio helps us to meet the needs of  health systems, clinicians and patients as we work to  better understand their diverse and critical needs. Our  portfolio includes sterile IV solutions, infusion systems  and devices, parenteral nutrition therapies, acute  and chronic dialysis therapies, inhaled anesthetics,  generic injectable pharmaceuticals, surgical hemostat  and sealant products, advanced surgical equipment,  smart bed systems, patient monitoring and diagnostic  technologies, and respiratory health devices. Baxter  is currently targeting separating the Kidney Care  business, which includes our acute and chronic dialysis  therapies, in the second half of 2024.  Our Mission is to Save and Sustain Lives. To achieve  this, we aim to transform healthcare with a customer  focus to help to improve patient outcomes, enhance  workflow efficiency and enable cost-effective care. COMPANY OVERVIEW, 2023* Corporate headquarters: Deerfield, Illinois, United States REVENUE BY SEGMENT (CONTINUING OPERATIONS), 2023* INNOVATION We are advancing innovation to improve care outcomes and  address the needs of patients, caregivers and customers. In 2023, Baxter invested more than $650 million in R&D.  Our robust product pipeline is designed to help clinicians  be more efficient and effective as they treat patients  across multiple care settings, including hospitals,  nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, ambulatory  surgery centers, kidney dialysis centers, physicians’  offices and patients’ homes under physician supervision.  Within connected care, we develop devices and software  that can connect, communicate and/or analyze data to  help transform healthcare. Within our core therapies,  we leverage our deep history and experience to design  products and solutions that help address patient and  provider needs. While proposed new product launches are subject to  obtaining required regulatory approvals and clearances,  we continue to prepare to introduce innovations to help  improve care for patients around the world. These include  digital health and connected care solutions for the  hospital and home, a next-generation airway-clearance  therapy, a platform for intelligent alarms, expansion  of an infusion pump platform to additional markets,  developments in home dialysis technology, surgical  devices, generic injectables, drug-delivery offerings,  complex pharmaceutical formulations and more. Innovation is also essential to driving progress toward  our 2030 Corporate Responsibility Commitment and  Goals. For instance, using advanced technologies, we  work to consistently enhance the safety and quality of  our products. By transitioning toward a more circular  approach to making and delivering products, we strive  to meet rapidly evolving market demands, reduce waste  and maximize materials value throughout the product  life cycle.

We are driven by the  possibility of making a meaningful difference in the world—  not just today, but for generations to come. Our approach to  corporate responsibility is grounded in creating a more  sustainable and responsible business model with innovations   in healthcare at the core.  We remain focused on our 2030 Corporate Responsibility  Commitment and Goals, which strive to create comprehensive  and lasting value through our three pillars: Empower Our  Patients, Protect Our Planet, and Champion Our People and  Communities. These pillars are bolstered by strong governance  and cross-cutting commitments to responsible practices   across our business. With more than 30 years of reporting on our environmental  performance, we have consistently broadened and enhanced our  reporting on the corporate responsibility topics that are priorities  for Baxter and our stakeholders. For example, since 2019, we have  published an annual Sustainability Accounting Standards Board  (SASB) Index in alignment with the Medical Equipment & Supplies  Sustainability Accounting Standard. In December 2023, we issued  our inaugural report against the framework established by the  Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) as a  stand-alone and subsequently published supplement to our 2022  Corporate Responsibility Report. Baxter’s current TCFD Index is  included in the Appendix of this report. Disclosing a broad range  of corporate responsibility metrics enables stakeholders to better  assess our programs and performance.  Performance Goals Our 2030 Corporate Responsibility Commitment features 10 goals  for prioritized action, which we disclose progress toward in this  report. Setting goals across a broad range of topics demonstrates  our commitment, reinforces accountability and helps to drive  ongoing improvement. In connection with the proposed separation  of Baxterʼs Kidney Care business, we will assess our commitment  and goals and adjust them as needed and if appropriate. United Nations  Sustainable  Development Goals We are proud to affirm our support for the United  Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and  2030 Agenda—a global blueprint for achieving a more  sustainable future. While our business and corporate  responsibility initiatives align with certain of the UN  SDGs, we focus especially on the following: GOAL 12: Responsible  Consumption    and Production GOAL 3: Good   Health and   Well-Being GOAL 6:   Clean  Water and  Sanitation BAXTER CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY PILLARS AND CROSS-CUTTING COMMITMENTS PHOTO:  Children celebrating the setup of water connections.

We routinely engage with our primary  stakeholder groups, including through professional  membership associations, to assess the corporate  responsibility topics that are most relevant to our business. Materiality 2  To understand and prioritize topics that are important to the  long-term sustainability of our business and most relevant  to our stakeholders, we periodically conduct assessments  that are commonly referred to as “materiality assessments.”  These analyses (which may differ from those conducted for  financial statement or other disclosure purposes) inform our  corporate responsibility strategy, commitment and goals.  See a list of our material topics (as defined during our 2022  assessment) and their impacts across our value chain.   For more information about the process we undertook and  the key findings of that assessment, see page 8 of our   2022 Corporate Responsibility Report. As part of the company’s corporate governance outreach program, members of Baxter’s management  team and members of the Board, including the company’s Lead Independent Director, the Chair of the  CHC Committee and the Chair of the NCGPP Committee, engage with investors on a range of topics.  Beginning in April 2023 and through early 2024, the company engaged in discussions with stockholders  representing approximately 35% of the company’s outstanding shares (calculated as of Dec. 31, 2023).  Topics discussed included: •	 Company strategy and performance (including the proposed separation of the Kidney Care   business and the completed divestiture of the BioPharma Solutions business) •	 The implementation of our simplified operating model •	 Corporate governance matters (including Board composition, diversity and refreshment   and the 2023 stockholder proposals) •	 The Board’s leadership structure •	 Executive compensation (including the 2023 Say on Pay vote and related considerations) •	 Corporate responsibility initiatives  Stockholder feedback is a consideration in Board discussions and was shared with the full Board  and relevant committees.

In connection with the proposed separation of Baxterʼs Kidney Care business, we will assess our commitment and goals and adjust them as needed and if appropriate.   Our 2030 Corporate Responsibility Goals support Baxterʼs top quartile goals, which include: Patient safety  and Quality Best place  to work Growth through  innovation Industry-leading  performance From the Chair,  President and CEO Company Profile Corporate Responsibility  Commitment 2030 Corporate  Responsibility Goals Cross-Cutting  Commitments Appendix  ===== PAGE 11 =====   11 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT APPROACH AND PROGRESS People in developing countries are at a higher risk of  developing kidney disease and have less access to the  life-sustaining therapy needed to survive the disease.  For this reason, Baxter works to reach patients in  these countries through our PD portfolio, with the goal  of doubling the number of patients reached between  2020 and 2030.  While we achieved growth in access to care globally in  2023, there were challenges in reaching patients in  underserved countries. This was driven by slower patient  growth than expected in key markets due to the prolonged  effects of pandemic-driven mortality issues from COVID-19.  Although this contributed to an overall drop in the number  of underserved patients we reached with our PD portfolio  in 2023, we continued to help drive access to care globally,  including in developing markets such as Latin America  and Eastern Europe.   During the year, we continued our efforts to increase  access to PD for underserved kidney patients through the  following three focus areas. Driving shared decision-making:  We provide practical  tools and information to help patients work with their  healthcare providers to choose therapies that best align  with their lifestyle goals. Highlights from 2023 include: •	 Broadened access to the My Kidney Journey website1   to include the Middle East, and doubled the number  of users—reaching 500,000 new visitors through this  patient- and clinician-focused platform   •	 Expanded our PD Ambassador Program to educate  clinicians about the benefits of PD while providing a  discussion forum for new publications and developments  in the treatment of chronic kidney disease2  Advocating for access to PD:  We continue to support  public policies, economic analyses and collaborations  that advance access to PD. In 2023, we conducted work in nearly 20 countries to improve access to PD.  Highlights include: •	 Working with governments in Eastern Europe, Latin  America and Southeast Asia to advocate for greater  patient access to home dialysis •	 Continuing our leadership of the International Home  Dialysis Roundtable (which includes patient advocacy  groups, clinical societies and industry representatives  from 32 countries), including the launch of a home  dialysis resource center for patients and caregivers  Expanding innovation and services:  Innovation that  meets the local needs of patients is critical to expanding  access to care. In 2023, we continued to expand the  use of Sharesource, our digital health platform for  remote patient management. As of the end of 2023, this  platform had connected 70,000 patients in 85 countries  and helped to facilitate 70 million treatments.   Moving forward:  Due to the proposed separation of  Baxterʼs Kidney Care business, 2023 will be the final  year Baxter reports against this goal, although the  Kidney Care business will continue to focus on  expanding access to care.  APPROACH AND PROGRESS Baxter is committed to patient safety and strives to  deliver high-quality, defect-free products. In 2023,  we continued our multiyear effort to reduce the rate  of leaks for our sterilized solutions and sets, making  substantial progress in expanding the program from  eight to 37 sites and achieving a 9% reduction in  leak defects year over year. We believe there will be  further improvements as we implement new capability  enhancements across our manufacturing facilities in  the coming years.  We remain committed to achieving our goals with a  renewed vision and an acute focus on reducing leaks.  Strengthening our foundation:  Excellence in  execution and complying with regulatory requirements  are foundational in helping to ensure the quality of our  products. Baxter continues to make capital investments  to update our facilities and implement new technology  systems and analytical tools that help drive robust,  data-driven decision-making to strengthen our  processes and controls. Innovating for the future:  Baxter uses digital  solutions to improve products and processes and  implements systems to help detect and remove defects.  For example, our quality and integrated supply chain  teams use tools that provide advanced real-time data  analytics and insights for certain of our processes.   We also use sensors to proactively monitor equipment  health and detect anomalies in real time to help achieve  Reach More Underserved Kidney Patients  Consistently Improve Manufacturing Capabilities     	 	 	 	 	    Double the number of patients reached in underserved markets*  through our peritoneal dialysis (PD) portfolio.   *Countries outside of the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Korea, Australia and New Zealand (198,000 patients in base year 2020). 2030 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY GOAL 	 	        As of the end of 2023, we were helping to care for approximately 185,000 patients in  underserved markets through our PD portfolio, 6.6% fewer than our baseline.

From the Chair,  President and CEO Company Profile Corporate Responsibility  Commitment 2030 Corporate  Responsibility Goals Cross-Cutting  Commitments Appendix  ===== PAGE 12 =====   12 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT APPROACH AND PROGRESS Baxter4 has a long-standing commitment to reducing GHG  emissions, conserving resources and limiting our impact  on the environment. Between 2005 and 2015, we reduced  our absolute GHG emissions by 19%. We reduced GHG  emissions by another 13.6% between 2015 and 2020. Our  Climate Action Roadmap outlines our plans to achieve  carbon neutrality for our direct operations by 2040. Further,  we report against the framework established by the Task  Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).  Scope 1 and 2 emissions:  In 2023, Baxter’s total   Scope 1 and 2 emissions5 from operations equaled   570,000 metric tons CO2e, a 4.6% decrease in absolute  emissions compared with 2020. During the year, in addition  to energy-efficiency initiatives, we worked to decrease our  GHG emissions through fuel switching, cogeneration,  alternative energy systems, on-site renewable energy  systems and renewable electricity procurement. Energy:  Energy is one of our most significant manufacturing  costs, accounting for 99% of Baxter’s GHG emissions from  operations in 2023. Our Global Energy Program, certified to  ISO 50001, applies this standard to the company’s facility-level  energy management systems (some of which are also certified  individually). Through our Lean Energy Program, Baxter’s  manufacturing facilities advance through four levels (Gold,  Silver, Bronze and Prerequisite) by meeting criteria for program  and technical requirements and standards of operational  excellence. In 2023, we used 3.0 million megawatt hours  (MWh) of energy,6 0.2% less than in 2022 in absolute terms. Site-specific energy assessments help us identify  opportunities to conserve energy, such as  implementing new technologies or adopting best  practices, where appropriate. In 2023, we completed  150 energy-conservation projects for an investment of  approximately $25 million across our manufacturing  sites. We estimate these projects will save approximately  43,800 MWh of energy and $10 million in energy-related  costs, and will reduce GHG emissions by approximately  21,100 metric tons CO2e annually.7  By the end of 2023, 33% of our energy use for operations  was derived from renewable sources, amounting to  979,000 MWh annually.8 In addition to our existing on-site  renewable energy projects, we completed two on-site  solar installations in 2023 that are expected to produce  approximately 2,400 MWh and reduce GHG emissions by  approximately 860 metric tons CO2e annually.9 In 2023,  we purchased 528,000 MWh of electricity generated from  100% certified renewable power.  Scope 3 emissions:  While our carbon neutrality goal  focuses on Scope 1 and 2 emissions, Baxter continues to  calculate and focus on Scope 3 GHG emissions10 across  our value chain, including through supplier engagement  and our efforts to reduce emissions from product  transport. For example, in 2023, we reduced air freight  in favor of less carbon-intensive modes of shipping,  and we optimized truck and container loads in the  Americas and Europe, Middle East and Africa regions.  For additional performance details see the Appendix   of this report. APPROACH AND PROGRESS Water is a critical natural resource for our products and  for the well-being of the communities where we operate.  Water review and assessments:  As part of our 2030  water management goal, we undertook a multiyear,  comprehensive review of our strategic manufacturing sites  to understand the local conditions and considerations of  each. This included water risk and resilience assessments,  infrastructure assessments and facility surveys. In 2023,  we completed 17 water risk and resilience assessments,  reaching a total of 21 over a two-year period (representing  75% of Baxter’s total water use).  Informed by an external evaluation of assessments  conducted in 2022 and 2023, a summary of mitigation  measures was developed, categorized by risk and  organized by site, along with related cost analysis. As a  result, we identified a preliminary list of 14 priority sites  for which we will develop strategic water management  plans and determine timeframes for the execution of  improvement projects.      Water management:  In 2023, we used approximately  15 million cubic meters11 of water in total, a 2% increase  compared with 2022, due to process changes and an  increase in production at some sites. We consistently focus on implementing conservation and  efficiency projects at many of our manufacturing facilities,  with an emphasis on sites located in water-stressed areas.  For example, in 2023, we upgraded equipment at our facility  Achieve Carbon Neutrality for Direct  Operations by 2040  Implement Strategic Water Management Plans     	 	 	 	 	    Achieve carbon neutrality for our direct operations by 2040 and  reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 25% by 2030, aligned with a well-below 2⁰ Celsius  science-based target. (Base year 2020) 2030 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY GOAL 	 	        In 2023, we reduced absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 4.1% compared with 2022 and  4.6% compared with our base year 2020. We estimate that the energy-conservation projects we completed during  the year as part of our Climate Action Roadmap will reduce GHG emissions by approximately 21,100 metric tons  carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), nearly double the reduction we achieved with energy projects completed in 2022.

PERFORMANCE  	 	       In 2023, we achieved our milestone to use a risk-based approach to identify prioritized locations   for strategic water management plans. This included the completion of 17 water risk and resilience assessments   during the year, in addition to assessments and surveys conducted in prior years. A total of 14 facilities will move  forward with water management plans. in Toongabbie, Australia, and addressed leaks and other  maintenance issues at our Irvine, California site. These  actions reduced water consumption across the two sites  by approximately 12,100 cubic meters in 2023 compared  with 2022. We use the World Resources Institute Aqueduct Water  Risk Atlas version 4.0 to map and analyze current  and future risks associated with water stress at our  manufacturing sites with the most significant water use.12  Our 59 manufacturing sites with the most significant  water use represented 95% of our total water use in 2023.  Of these sites, 32 are in medium-high, high and extremely  high water-stress areas. See detail.  Wastewater compliance:  Wastewater discharged from  Baxter operations remains an important focus of our  compliance program. We take a proactive, systematic  approach to identifying, evaluating and managing  wastewater issues. In 2023, these activities included  refreshing the minimum requirements for facility  wastewater-treatment operations, performing compliance  assurance assessments at some sites, reviewing permits  to understand compliance measures and engaging  external consultants to perform evaluations of  wastewater-treatment operations at key facilities to  identify improvement opportunities.

From the Chair,  President and CEO Company Profile Corporate Responsibility  Commitment 2030 Corporate  Responsibility Goals Cross-Cutting  Commitments Appendix  ===== PAGE 13 =====   13 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT APPROACH AND PROGRESS Baxter drives sustainable practices in our global supply  chain and seeks to partner with high-performing,  innovative suppliers to deliver quality products to our  customers and value for our stakeholders. We prioritize  high standards in the areas of environment, labor and  human rights, ethics, and sustainable procurement,  alongside factors of cost, quality and delivery. Our Sustainable Procurement Steering Committee,  which oversees our efforts in this area, is chaired by  our Chief Procurement Officer and includes leaders  from our Supplier Quality, Finance, and Environmental,  Health, Safety and Sustainability (EHS&S) teams. Managing procurement risks:  We are continuing to  integrate our supplier corporate responsibility strategy  into our overall supplier management processes and  conduct periodic assessments of key suppliers to  evaluate cost, delivery, quality and risk. Our supplier corporate responsibility risk profile includes  in-depth risk mapping for applicable Baxter suppliers13  based on location, performance, and goods and services  provided. In addition to providing Baxter with aggregate  data about risk across multiple dimensions of corporate  responsibility, the profile also gives us visibility to  individual supplier reporting in each of these areas. This  risk profile helps us identify and prioritize suppliers with  the greatest corporate-responsibility-related risks for  additional due diligence, corrective action plans   and/or on-site audits. Supplier corporate responsibility audits:  Expanding  our auditing scope will help to improve our understanding  of corporate responsibility management and activities  within Baxterʼs supplier base and help identify areas for  improvement. In 2023, we continued developing our ability  to audit suppliers’ corporate responsibility management  systems and performance. This process is ongoing,  and we plan to use internal auditing resources as well  as third-party collaborations. During the year, we also  developed the Global Supplier Standards Manual—a  foundational document that includes a centralized set of  standards, against which we will measure performance.  We plan to begin conducting corporate responsibility  audits in 2025 for any suppliers we identify as high risk  based on supplier risk profiles and supplier corporate  responsibility survey scores. Supplier corporate responsibility survey:  We collaborate  with EcoVadis, a globally recognized assessment  platform that rates businessesʼ sustainability practices,  to conduct an annual survey of our suppliers’ corporate  responsibility programs and performance in the areas  of environment, labor and human rights, ethics, and  sustainable procurement. Through this program,  Baxter and participating suppliers can access detailed  scorecards with information about strengths, benchmark  comparisons and improvement areas. We also leverage  the EcoVadis system to create corrective action plans for  suppliers falling below our performance standards and to  determine when on-site audits will be necessary. We plan  to include survey scores in business reviews with strategic  suppliers in the future. APPROACH AND PROGRESS Our approach to reducing waste is broad, ranging from  product design and materials use to manufacturing  and distribution. We are working to identify all waste  generation sources at Baxter and prioritize our top waste  mitigation opportunities by the end of 2024.  To support this work, in 2023, we conducted three  manufacturing site waste assessments. We also initiated  a circular economy pilot at our Cali, Colombia, and  Cuernavaca, Mexico, facilities. Beginning with education  for our employees and an exploration of how circularity  principles can be applied to our manufacturing processes,  this pilot will help inform our materials and waste  management plans at these sites and others.  Materials use in products and packaging:  Because  materials use is a key driver of Baxter’s environmental  footprint, we work to reduce materials use in products  without affecting efficacy, and to avoid or minimize  materials of concern.  We also develop products that enable at-home care, which  can lower environmental impact compared with hospital  care. In 2023, we completed a life cycle assessment and a  care pathway study, showing that the self-administration of  antibiotics using a Baxter elastomeric pump in the patient’s  home can reduce waste, climate and water impacts by  91%, 85% and 78% respectively, compared with 22 days of  antibiotics administered through inpatient hospital care.14   Additionally, we strive to reduce materials use in  packaging and explore opportunities to substitute with  Advance Sustainable Procurement Implement Strategic Materials and  Waste Management Plans     	 	 	 	 	    Integrate Baxter’s sustainable procurement strategy across 90%  of our supplier spend.*  *As measured by supplier commitment to Baxter’s Ethics & Compliance Standards and Baxter’s completion of corporate responsibility audits   within our supply base. 2030 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY GOAL 	 	                       In 2023, 53% of our suppliers, by spend, committed to Baxter’s Ethics & Compliance  Standards (through affirmations made in underlying supplier contracts).** We also developed the Baxter Global  Supplier Standards Manual, to support conducting supplier corporate responsibility audits in the future.  **The balance of supplier spend is governed by Baxter’s purchase order terms and conditions, which help ensure suppliers comply with our guidelines 	 	 and all applicable laws.  PERFORMANCE  2030 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY GOAL 	 	 	 	 	    Implement prioritized waste mitigation opportunities* in Baxter’s  integrated supply chain, from procurement to distribution.  *Identify prioritized waste generation sources by the end of 2024. PERFORMANCE  	 	       In 2023, we completed comprehensive waste assessments at three manufacturing sites and  began a circular economy** pilot at two sites. We also continued to mitigate waste through process efficiency, waste  reduction at the source, reuse, recovery, recycling and landfill diversion.  **Circular economy is a model of keeping materials in circulation and avoiding waste. environmentally preferable alternatives. For example,  Baxter is changing the packaging of our Tissue Guard  products from a jar containing chemical sterilization  solution to a double-pouch system, where the patch is  terminally sterilized, eliminating the need for solution.  The new packaging should reduce materials use by 42%  to 67% by weight, depending on the product, saving an  estimated 32 metric tons of materials annually.15 This  change will also help to reduce related electricity use and  water consumption in the manufacturing process. Operations:  In 2023, Baxter produced 78,600 metric tons  of total waste (down 2.6% from 2022), 70,100 metric tons   of nonhazardous waste (down 3.9% from 2022) and  8,500 metric tons of regulated waste (up 9.2% from 2022).16  In 2023, 71.8% of our total waste was diverted from  landfill, including 62.2% recycled and 9.6% incinerated  with energy recovery. Product distribution:  Baxter aims to conserve natural  resources and reduce waste during product distribution.  For example, of the pallets we shipped to European  customers in 2023, we recovered 32% for our own reuse  and sold another 15% to our carriers for reuse. Of the  total pallets we purchased in the Europe, Middle East and  Africa region, 26% were preused. Product end-of-life:  While Baxter’s 2030 waste goal  focuses on our integrated supply chain, product end-of-life  remains a priority for our company. We have programs to  facilitate recycling of disposable products in select locations,  and we service and redeploy electromechanical devices  for reuse.

Fostering human rights takes many forms at Baxter  and is reflected in our policies and initiatives in areas  including workplace inclusion, employee safety, supply  chain labor practices, ethical conduct, access to  healthcare, and patient, employee and customer privacy. Protecting human rights in our supply chain: Baxter’s suppliers must commit to respecting  human rights, either in accordance with our  Global Human Rights Policy or under their own similar  policies. Suppliers with whom Baxter contracts must  confirm they agree to comply with our guidelines,  which include our Supplier Quality and Ethics and  Compliance Standards for Baxter Suppliers and the  Baxter Code of Conduct.  In 2023, we published our first annual Due Diligence  Report under the Norwegian Transparency Act of 2022.  In addition, Baxter publishes a UK Modern Slavery  Statement and an Australia Modern Slavery Statement  each year. In 2023, we conducted mandatory training  for our applicable procurement staff on Australia- specific modern slavery legislation in that country.   We also have position statements related to the  California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and  conflict minerals, and we publish an annual Conflict  Minerals Report.   We work to enhance our company’s culture of belonging and  to embed diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) across all  aspects of our business. We focus on four strategic pillars: Workforce:  Increasing the diversity of our workforce  makes us a more agile and innovative company. This  begins with our Board of Directors (including the  Compensation and Human Capital Committee) and  leadership teams, who influence and inspire our desired  culture and drive greater representation throughout the  organization. See information regarding Board diversity in  Baxter’s 2023 Proxy Statement.  Our hiring process includes an inclusive and expansive  candidate-sourcing strategy and an aim to create diverse  interview panels. Baxter also has processes to help avoid  inadvertently overlooking employees for development,  sponsorship, succession, advancement and retention  opportunities. In addition, many employees establish or  continue mentoring relationships, which fosters greater  opportunities and networks within the company. Workplace:  We embed DE&I across our workplace  through inclusive leadership and engagement with  employees who advocate for inclusion throughout our  company. Examples include: •	 Global Inclusion Council: These executive leaders are  responsible for demonstrating inclusive leadership and  driving actions that create a workplace culture where all  employees can feel they belong. •	 Business Resource Groups (BRGs): Nine affinity groups  provide forums for employees to build networks, develop  skills, experience cultural connections, volunteer and  support business initiatives. •	 Activating Change Today (ACT) Council: Chaired by our  CEO, this council supports our multiyear ACT initiative to  drive meaningful, sustainable change and address racial  injustice within the workplace and in the communities  and markets we serve globally. Baxter also develops mutually beneficial  relationships with small and diverse suppliers  as we strive to increase the diversity of our  supplier base. In 2023, we spent $563 million with   small businesses, $148 million with women-owned  businesses and $134 million with minority-owned  businesses. A third-party review estimates that our  spending with diverse suppliers directly supported   $716 million in economic output as well as $156 million  in employee income and more than 2,000 jobs.5  Marketplace:  We strive to adopt inclusive product  design from concept to launch and enhance  engagement with diverse healthcare professionals,  patients, caregivers and other stakeholders. Our  efforts to tackle health disparities include sponsoring  community programs that work to improve patient  access to healthcare and reduce healthcare provider  biases, including promoting a more diverse pipeline  of healthcare professionals. This includes support  for scholarships at Historically Black Colleges and  Universities (HBCUs), as well as universities in Ireland,  to assist students pursuing health and science degrees  with the goal of increasing the diversity of healthcare  providers in the medical community.  In 2023, we hosted educational events for employees  to enhance awareness around healthcare disparities.  During the year, we also convened a consensus meeting  with experts in health disparities and critical care to  develop a white paper, which should be published in 2024,  to expand awareness and understanding of disparities in  critical care research so that researchers and healthcare  providers can begin to mitigate related effects.  Baxter also partners with several organizations,  including the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation,  the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the National  Minority Quality Forum, to advance successful lobbying  and advocacy efforts in support of health equity for  underserved communities.   •	 Transformation Champion Network: This group   of diverse leaders from across Baxter fosters  understanding and engagement and champions   change by listening, building awareness, advocating   for employees and providing critical feedback to   inform our inclusion initiatives. Baxter provides employees with training, tools and  resources to build cultural awareness and competence   to engage more authentically. To reinforce the value of  inclusion throughout the company, we conduct surveys   to measure manager effectiveness, including inclusive  leadership. Baxter’s total compensation philosophy provides  market-competitive pay and benefits globally while  rewarding employees for strong individual and business  performance. We periodically assess our efforts through  pay audits and reviews. Communities:  Baxter works to promote inclusion and  equity in our communities by driving advocacy in partnership  with community organizations. For example, aligned with  our ACT initiative, we partnered with Direct Relief to provide  Baxter products to nearly 600 community health centers and  free-and-charitable clinics and pharmacies in the United  States and its territories for the purpose of improving  access to healthcare for underserved communities. As of  the end of 2023, Baxter had donated $2.6 million worth of  products through this program. In addition, to encourage  local community engagement, the Baxter International  Foundation provides each of our nine BRGs with a two-year  grant to extend to a nonprofit that supports diversity and  inclusion initiatives. In 2023, $450,000 was distributed to  organizations focusing on a range of priorities, including  increasing access to science, technology, engineering and  math (STEM) education for youth in Ireland, delivering  healthcare to rural communities in Mexico and championing  disability rights through employment and community  engagement opportunities in the Chicago, Illinois, area.

The following table is a summary of corporate responsibility risk profiling of 38,634 Baxter suppliers, based on 2023 analysis using the EcoVadis IQ tool.*  * The performance categories presented in this table align with the EcoVadis methodology. “Advanced” indicates structured and proactive corporate responsibility (CR) approach; policies and tangible actions on major topics with significant CR reporting.  “Moderate” indicates structured and proactive CR approach; policies and tangible actions on major topics with basic CR reporting. “Partial” indicates no structured CR approach; few tangible actions on selected topics; certifications related to  sites and/or products are only partial. “Insufficient” indicates no engagements or tangible actions regarding CR. Data for each year reflects suppliers participating in Baxter’s supplier CR survey program as of Jan. 31 of the subsequent year. In  some cases, segments may not add up to 100% due to rounding. A minor subset of suppliers with small businesses of 25 employees or fewer do not receive a score. Data for 2021, 2022 and 2023 includes Baxter’s BioPharma Solutions business,  which was divested at the end of the third quarter of 2023. * The performance of risk categories presented in this table aligns with the EcoVadis methodology. Risk levels are based on 1) inherent risk, which is the corporate responsibility risk of a company based  on its industry and country or EcoVadis rating and 2) procurement risk, which is based on Baxter spend data. “Undefined” refers to companies with 25 employees or fewer that have a Data Universal  Numbering System (DUNS) number that cannot be matched to a specific industry and do not receive a score. In some cases, segments may not add up to 100% due to rounding. Data includes Baxter’s  BioPharma Solutions business, which was divested at the end of the third quarter of 2023. * Data excludes Baxter’s BioPharma Solutions business, which was divested at  the end of the third quarter of 2023.

From the Chair,  President and CEO Company Profile Corporate Responsibility  Commitment 2030 Corporate  Responsibility Goals Cross-Cutting  Commitments Appendix  ===== PAGE 31 =====   31 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Appendix: LRQA Independent Assurance Statement Terms of engagement LRQA was commissioned by Baxter  Healthcare Corporation to provide  independent assurance on select  sections of data and information in  Baxter’s 2023 Corporate Responsibility  Report (“the Report”) against the  assurance criteria below. As described  below, some sections of the Report  were verified to a reasonable level of  assurance and at the materiality of the professional judgement  of the verifier, while others were verified to a limited level of  assurance and materiality of the professional judgement of the  verifier. Our assurance does not extend to any other information  included in the Report. The assurance process is conducted using  LRQA’s verification procedure. LRQA’s verification procedure is  based on current best practice, is in accordance with ISAE 3000  and ISAE 3410 and uses the principles of inclusivity, materiality,  responsiveness, and reliability of performance data. Our assurance engagement covered data and claims in the  Report and associated data in the Report appendix for Baxter’s  operations and activities in operationally controlled sites  worldwide and specifically the following requirements: •	 Verifying conformance with: •	 Baxter’s internal reporting requirements for facility  environmental, health, safety and sustainability  performance. •	 Evaluating the accuracy and reliability of data and information,  to a reasonable level of assurance, for only the selected sections  of the Report listed below: •	 Achieve Carbon Neutrality for Direct Operations by 2040 •	 Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions verification is  documented under a separate assurance statement. •	 Implement Strategic Water Management Plans •	 Implement Strategic Materials and Waste Management Plans •	 Achieve Top Quartile Workplace Safety Performance •	 The following material in the Report Appendix: •	 Data Summary: Achieve Carbon Neutrality for Direct  Operations by 2040; Implement Strategic Water  Management Plans; Implement Strategic Materials and  Waste Management Plans; Environmental, Health, Safety  and Sustainability Governance and Additional Disclosures;  Achieve Top Quartile Workplace Safety Performance. •	 Value Chain Energy Usage and GHG Emissions (Energy,  Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions) •	 Facilities with ISO 14001, ISO 45001, ISO 50001 and Green  Building Certifications •	 The following Additional Disclosures: Achieve Carbon  Neutrality for Direct Operations by 2040; Implement  Strategic Water Management Plans •	 Evaluating the accuracy and reliability of data and information, to  a limited level of assurance, for only the selected sections of the  Report listed below: •	 Scope 3 emissions subsection of Achieve Carbon Neutrality for  Direct Operations by 2040 section •	 Advance Sustainable Procurement •	 Protecting Human Rights in Our Supply Chain subsection of  Human Rights section •	 Supplier Diversity subsection of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion  section •	 The following material in the Report Appendix: •	 Data Summary: GHG Emissions from Product Transport  section of Achieve Carbon Neutrality for Direct Operations  by 2040; Advance Sustainable Procurement; Supplier  Diversity and Economic Impact of Spending with Diverse  Suppliers sections of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion •	 Value Chain Energy Usage and GHG Emissions—Scope 3  emissions •	 Additional Disclosures (Advance Sustainable Procurement) Our assurance engagement excluded the data and information of  Baxter’s suppliers, contractors and any third-parties mentioned in  the Report. LRQA’s responsibility is only to Baxter. LRQA disclaims any liability  or responsibility to others as explained in the end footnote.  Baxter’s responsibility is for collecting, aggregating, analyzing and  presenting all the data and information within the Report and for  maintaining effective internal controls over the systems from which  the Report is derived. Ultimately, the Report has been approved by,  and remains the responsibility of Baxter. LRQA’s Opinion Based on LRQA’s approach for the categories stated above as verified  to reasonable assurance, except for the effect of the matters  described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion, we believe that Baxter  has, in all material respects: •	 Met the requirements above; and •	 Disclosed accurate and reliable performance data and  information The opinion expressed is formed on the basis of a reasonable level  of assurance and at the materiality of the professional judgement of  the verifier. Based on LRQA’s approach for the categories listed above as verified  to limited assurance, except for the effect of the matters described in  the Basis for Qualified Opinion, nothing has come to our attention that  would cause us to believe that Baxter has not, in all material respects: •	 Met the requirements above; and •	 Disclosed accurate and reliable performance data and  information. The opinion expressed is formed on the basis of a limited level of  assurance1 and at the materiality of the professional judgement  of the verifier. Basis for Qualified Opinion Baxter was not able to provide supporting evidence for some of the  data and information in the following sections of the Report:   Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and energy savings values in the  Achieve Carbon Neutrality for Direct Operations by 2040 section  of the Report and Report appendices; waste quantities in the  Implement Strategic Materials and Waste Management Plans  section of the Report appendices; and water quantities in the  Implement Strategic Water Management Plans section of the Report  appendices. This lack of supporting evidence was not material.  LRQA’s approach LRQA’s assurance engagements are carried out in accordance  with our verification procedure. The following tasks were  undertaken as part of the evidence-gathering process for this  assurance engagement: •	 Auditing Baxter’s data management systems to confirm  that there were no significant errors, omissions or  mis-statements in the Report. We did this by reviewing the  effectiveness of data-handling procedures, instructions  and systems, including those for internal verification. We  also spoke with those key people responsible for compiling  the data and drafting the Report; •	 Conducting site tours of select facilities and reviewing  processes related to the control and reporting of  environmental and safety data and records; •	 Interviewing relevant employees of the organization  responsible for managing environmental and safety data  and records; •	 Verifying a sample of historical environmental and safety  data and records back to source for the calendar year 2023; •	 Verifying a sample of claims made in the Report text for the  sections listed above; and •	 Verifying a sample of data metrics included in the appendix  table for the sections listed above. Observations Further observations and findings, made during the assurance  engagement, are: •	 Supplier diversity information was only confirmed against a  summary report from supplier.io. LRQA did not verify data  provided in the summary report. •	 LRQA confirmed that Baxter has human rights policies in place,  including requirements for their suppliers. LRQA did not perform  any social audits. LRQA recommends that Baxter perform a  social audit to confirm suppliers are following the policy. LRQA’s standards, competence and independence LRQA implements and maintains a comprehensive management  system that meets accreditation requirements for ISO 14065  Greenhouse gases – Requirements for greenhouse gas validation  and verification bodies for use in accreditation or other forms  of recognition and ISO/IEC 17021 Conformity assessment –  Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of  management systems that are at least as demanding as the  requirements of the International Standard on Quality Control 1 and  comply with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued  by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants. LRQA ensures the selection of appropriately qualified individuals  based on their qualifications, training and experience. The outcome  of all verification and certification audits is then internally reviewed  by senior management to ensure that the approach applied is  rigorous and transparent. LRQA is Baxter’s certification body for ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO  45001. The verification and certification audits are the only work  undertaken by LRQA for Baxter and as such do not compromise our  independence or impartiality.

Copyright © LRQA, 2024. 1 The extent of evidence-gathering for a limited assurance engagement is less than  for a reasonable assurance engagement. Limited assurance engagements focus on  aggregated data rather than physically checking source data at sites. Consequently,  the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially  lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable  assurance engagement been performed. RELATING TO BAXTER’S REPORT FOR THE 2023 CALENDAR YEAR This Assurance Statement has been prepared for Baxter in accordance with our contract.

Strategy (continued)  RECOMMENDED DISCLOSURE BAXTER DISCLOSURE a) Describe the climate-related risks and   opportunities the organization has identified over   the short, medium, and long term (continued) CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS AT BAXTER Physical—Acute Risk: Increased severity of hurricanes/cyclones/typhoons •	 Time horizon: Short term, medium term, long term •	 Part of the value chain: Direct operations •	 Impact on business: Decreased asset value or asset useful life leading to write-offs, asset impairment or early retirement of existing assets; decreased revenues due to  reduced production capacity •	 Management’s response: Baxter maintains business continuity plans at all facilities to prepare for, respond to and recover from extreme weather events and geopolitical  crises, among other incidents. See section 2.c for detail. Mitigation activities to address increased severity of hurricanes/cyclones/typhoons include improving building  structural integrity and enhancing overall site resilience and emergency response capabilities to address the impacts of severe storms. We have been optimizing our global  manufacturing platform to increase flexibility regarding where critical products are produced for specific markets. We also pre-position critical raw materials outside of  forecasted storm zones. Baxter facilities plan and implement energy projects that reduce GHG emissions, improve system redundancy and robustness, and decrease our  reliance on local power utilities. Project status is monitored periodically and performance is measured quarterly. At high-risk facilities, the company also maintains robust  water-supply systems, including storage tanks, to reduce the risk of impacts on facility operations related to disruptions in local utilities and infrastructure. Risk: Increased water scarcity related to climate change •	 Time horizon: Short term, medium term, long term •	 Part of the value chain: Direct operations •	 Impact on business: Increased difficulty obtaining needed water at certain manufacturing locations •	 Management’s response: During 2022–2023, we performed assessments at manufacturing sites that represented 75% of water usage in manufacturing, to understand the  local water conditions and considerations of those locations. See section 3.a and Implement Strategic Water Management Plans for additional detail. Transition—Policy and legal Risk: Emerging regulation related to GHG emissions and climate change  •	 Time horizon: Short term, medium term, long term •	 Part of the value chain: Direct operations •	 Impact on business: Increased operating costs •	 Management’s response: Our Global Energy Program tracks energy use, costs and GHG emissions for all Baxter manufacturing sites on a monthly basis. The program  reports performance to management quarterly, supporting progress toward facility- and company-level energy-efficiency improvement and GHG emissions-reduction goals.  Additionally, the program identifies projects (including associated capital requirements, annual projected cost savings and GHG emissions reductions) to prioritize for each  facility. Site-specific energy assessments help Baxter identify opportunities to conserve energy, such as implementing new technologies or adopting best practices where  appropriate. Our Global Energy Program, which is certified to ISO 50001, applies the ISO 50001 standard to the company’s facility-level energy management systems (some of  which are certified individually). Baxter’s energy procurement team also works with our suppliers to source renewable and economical energy for our manufacturing facilities.  Reductions in GHG emissions help to mitigate risk in this area. This area is rapidly evolving, so to inform our efforts we continually monitor emerging and existing local, state,  regional, federal and global legal and regulatory requirements relating to climate change, including regulating GHG emissions and related reporting requirements, alternative  energy policies and sustainability initiatives. Transition—Reputation Risk: Increased stakeholder concern regarding Baxter’s GHG emissions  •	 Time horizon: Short term, medium term, long term •	 Part of the value chain: Downstream •	 Impact on business: Decreased revenues due to reduced demand for products and services •	 Management’s response: Baxter engages with a wide variety of stakeholders to share information about the company’s climate-related programs, policies, goals and performance.  This engagement includes communications such as our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, SASB Index, CDP Climate and CDP Water submissions, Environmental, Health,  Safety and Sustainability (EHS&S) Policy and this TCFD Index, among others. This includes detailed information about action plans and initiatives, such as energy-conservation  projects and renewable energy procurement, that support Baxter’s GHG emissions-reduction goals. Reductions in GHG emissions help to mitigate risks in this area.

Strategy (continued)  RECOMMENDED DISCLOSURE BAXTER DISCLOSURE a) Describe the climate-related risks and  opportunities the organization has identified over  the short, medium, and long term (continued) Baxter has identified the climate-related opportunities summarized below. CLIMATE-RELATED OPPORTUNITIES AT BAXTER Opportunity: Improved resource efficiency •	 Time horizon: Short term, medium term, long term •	 Part of the value chain: Direct operations •	 Impact on business: Reduced operating costs •	 Management’s response: See the description of Baxter’s Global Energy Program in the “Emerging regulation related to GHG emissions and climate change” risk described   on the previous page, as well as Achieve Carbon Neutrality for Direct Operations by 2040. Opportunity: Transitioning to lower­-GHG-emission energy sources  •	 Time horizon: Short term, medium term, long term •	 Part of the value chain: Direct operations •	 Impact on business: Reduced operating costs •	 Management’s response: Our initiatives to reduce GHG emissions and achieve our carbon neutrality goal include fuel switching (including biomass), cogeneration, alternative  energy systems, on-site renewable energy systems and renewable electricity procurement. Baxter’s energy procurement team sources renewable and economical energy for our  manufacturing facilities. Using lower-GHG-emission energy sources helps Baxter reduce exposure to possible fossil fuel price increases and costs related to current and potential  future carbon regulations. These efforts help to reduce GHG emissions and help meet the rising expectations of customers and other stakeholders, while enhancing Baxter’s  reputation and potential to be a preferred low-carbon supplier. Opportunity: Developing innovative new products and services •	 Time horizon: Short term, medium term, long term •	 Part of the value chain: Downstream •	 Impact on business: Increased revenues resulting from higher demand for products and services •	 Management’s response: Baxter manages these opportunities through the companyʼs four business segments that address long-term business strategies, research and  development (R&D), customer corporate responsibility expectations and sustainability strategies and priorities. We consistently review our product portfolio and shift our  investments and other capital allocation decisions to help drive innovation where we have compelling opportunities to serve patients and healthcare professionals where such  opportunities are aligned with the company’s business objectives. The cost to realize this opportunity is a proportion of R&D expenditures focused on lower-carbon, more  efficient therapies. See Implement Strategic Materials and Waste Management Plans for more detail. b) Describe the impact of the climate-related risks  and opportunities on the organization’s businesses,  strategy, and financial planning Baxter’s capital project management process and corporate planning activities take into account climate-related risks and opportunities (as well as ESG more generally).   This supports a broad and integrated approach in these areas. Capital governance and stage gate process: To drive standardization, agility and stakeholder collaboration in the capital project management process, Baxter follows a rigorous  stage gate process for all Integrated Supply Chain capital projects valued above preset thresholds. This involves consistent steps both prior to and following project approval. The front-end loading (FEL) document is used for all projects entering this process. The FEL document provides business, quality and design basis information, as well as product  safety requirements, related to the capital appropriation. It also delivers a consensus technical recommendation to the project team and includes project performance criteria and  identified associated risks. In addition, the report includes information such as project overview, schedule, capital category and cost summary, among other factors. Climate-related risks and opportunities are integrated into the capital projects evaluation process in multiple ways. For relevant projects, the FEL document captures information  related to the effects on GHG emissions and how to address related risks and offset possible GHG emissions increases. All capital projects valued above preset thresholds go through  a peer review process, which includes project team members as well as subject matter experts and key stakeholders from across the organization, including EHS&S. Those projects  require EHS&S sign-off, and the organization conducts a review that includes the potential impact of those projects on Baxter’s 2030 Corporate Responsibility Goals. From the Chair,  President and CEO Company Profile Corporate Responsibility  Commitment 2030 Corporate  Responsibility Goals Cross-Cutting  Commitments Appendix  ===== PAGE 39 =====   39 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Appendix: Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Index (continued) 2. Strategy (continued)  RECOMMENDED DISCLOSURE BAXTER DISCLOSURE b) Describe the impact of the climate-related risks  and opportunities on the organization’s businesses,  strategy, and financial planning (continued) Corporate planning: Baxter’s ERM process (see section 3.c) is an important input into the company’s annual operating plan (AOP) and long-range plan (LRP). Some of the  information that is required for the AOP and LRP processes—such as investment requests, mitigation funding, growth hurdles and related solutions—includes references to the  top risks noted in the ERM. Therefore, if a Baxter segment or global function is the owner of a top risk (including climate-related and other ESG risks), it must provide mitigation  plans along with its AOP and LRP submissions. ESG projects have a distinct category within our AOP and LRP processes, providing visibility within each business segment and  across the company. Funding those projects, which supports progress toward our 2030 Corporate Responsibility Goals, is a priority for Baxter. c) Describe the resilience of the organization’s  strategy, taking into consideration different climate- related scenarios, including a 2˚C or lower scenario The following activities support the resilience of Baxter’s strategy related to climate change.  Scenario planning and response: Baxter regularly runs exercises across different facilities to assess how they respond to risk scenarios that are outside of their control  and identify opportunities for learning and improvement. These scenarios cover a broad range of issues—including geopolitical, financial, supply chain, employment and  environmental, among others—that have the potential to impact our facilities in significant ways. Environmental scenarios may include several risks that are related to climate  change, such as hurricanes, flooding, fire, tornadoes and drought. Through this process, participants determine how they would respond to and address the scenario presented to them. This helps us understand the resilience of our strategies  and processes related to those issues and identify opportunities for improvement that can be applied to all locations as appropriate. Follow-up actions are then determined as  appropriate for each site, and inform mitigation efforts and business continuity planning. Baxter also developed our science-based 2030 GHG emissions-reduction goal for direct operations using a well-below 2⁰ Celsius scenario (see section 4.c).  Crisis response: Baxter’s incident response and management tools help the company prepare for, respond to and recover from extreme weather events and geopolitical crises   as quickly as possible. This supports employees and key business outcomes, while minimizing downtime. We have various systems in place to support resilience in advance of and during incidents. To keep informed about the broad range of possible incidents across Baxter  geographies globally, we subscribe to a third-party, real-time risk-monitoring and feedback tool.  Some of our approaches are tailored to specific geographies and risks. For example, every year Baxter facilities in the Caribbean region complete hurricane risk preparedness  checklists. If we determine that a hurricane currently underway could impact a specific facility, that location takes action according to a predefined checklist for that imminent event. When a crisis occurs, our incident command system provides a standardized way to communicate and fill specific roles at impacted sites. Appropriate regional and global leaders  receive updates from Global Security as needed based on the severity of the incident and the level of impact on Baxter. To support the response and ongoing information exchange,  Baxter maintains business continuity plans that provide leaders with the alert management tools and guidance needed to respond to and recover from crises. These incident  response resources support communication capabilities, incident analysis and key operational actions. The company also provides regular updates to employees, as appropriate,  regarding climate-related risks to our employees and operations, such as hurricanes, flooding and heat waves.  Following crisis events, Baxter coordinates and prioritizes resources to help facilities and operations to return to functioning order. We conduct post-incident analysis as an  integral part of incident management for continuous improvement. 3. Risk Management RECOMMENDED DISCLOSURE BAXTER DISCLOSURE a) Describe the organization’s processes for  identifying and assessing climate-related risks Baxter relies on a range of processes and inputs from across the company to identify and assess climate-related risks. Facility risk analysis: Baxter’s business segments lead a key part of the company’s risk-identification and -assessment processes at each facility. Risks are prioritized by  classifying facilities as high, medium or low risk to business continuity based on factors that would significantly impact the company’s ability to manufacture and distribute  products through the supply chain and ultimately deliver products to patients. Site vulnerability to external forces is assessed, including climate-related physical risks (acute  and chronic risk) and climate-related transition risks (policy and legal, technology, market and reputation risk).

Risk Management (continued)  RECOMMENDED DISCLOSURE BAXTER DISCLOSURE a) Describe the organization’s processes for  identifying and assessing climate-related risks  (continued) EHS&S risk model: Baxter uses an EHS&S risk model to identify and assess the relative EHS&S risk presented by each Baxter facility, including risks related to climate  change. To model the relative risk of each facility, the model evaluates the inherent hazards of the operation. These are generally hazards that are basic to the type and  nature of the facility, including size, complexity, location, type of processes, air emission sources, water discharges, waste generation, safety hazards, industrial hygiene risks  and similar factors. The risk model assesses a multitude of factors in three main categories: facility profile (type of operation, location, etc.), environmental factors and health and safety factors.  Each facility is rated as high, medium or low risk for each factor, and factors are weighted in the model to determine an overall score for each facility. Several factors  considered in the model relate to climate change, including natural disasters (such as hurricanes, flooding and wildfires), severe weather, water stress, source of water and  total water used for manufacturing. Baxter uses the model to summarize relative risk by facility and to assess risk categories or specific risk factors across the portfolio. Outputs from the risk model, in conjunction with other performance indicators, inform Baxter’s decisions about how to most efficiently and effectively allocate resources  to manage identified risks, including the number and allocation of EHS&S personnel assigned to different regions or facilities, audit schedules, training and other forms of  compliance assistance. Environmental management review: As part of Baxter’s ISO 14001 environmental management system certification, the company conducts a management review  annually that covers progress against environmental objectives and goals; significant environmental aspects and related impacts; how Baxter is addressing challenges;  analysis of the company’s EHS&S strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats; and other related areas. The management review standard requires us (at the  corporate and facility levels) to consider changes in external and internal issues that are relevant to the environmental management system; the needs and expectations of  interested parties, including compliance and regulatory obligations; significant environmental aspects; and risks and opportunities, among other factors. Baxter’s EHS&S risk model, annual property loss/risk management reports and other factors inform site selection and scope for environmental assurance reviews each  year, as well as the scope of the environmental management system reviews. Energy use, GHG emissions and climate change are an important focus of these reviews,  alongside other environmental and safety topics and legal and regulatory compliance. The environmental management review process informs the development of  objectives, goals and plans for the following year and drives continuous improvement. Water risk assessments: As part of our 2030 water management goal, we undertook a multiyear, comprehensive review of our strategic manufacturing sites to understand  the local conditions and considerations of each. We considered the physical, regulatory and reputational risks associated with water management at our sites, including  external boundaries, water accounting, wastewater discharge, compliance obligations and impacts to our current water quality and water supply, among other concerns, as  we focused on opportunities to improve water efficiency in our operations, protect watersheds and provide access to clean water within local communities. These assessments enhance our understanding of current and future water availability and threats to water quality near our sites, and how various climate scenarios might  impact Baxter, including stormwater and groundwater assets, so we can take action as appropriate. They also provide information about threats related to dependency  (such as well or utility failure), proximity (such as releases from nearby industry), malevolent acts (such as vandalism), natural hazards (such as earthquakes or storms)  and operational threats (such as aging infrastructure). See section 4.c and Implement Strategic Water Management Plans for additional detail. Corporate Responsibility Steering Committee and Corporate Responsibility Council: Baxter’s executive cross-functional Corporate Responsibility Steering Committee  and Corporate Responsibility Council play key roles in identifying, assessing and communicating climate-related risks across the company (see section 1.b for more detail). Enterprise risk management: Top risks identified through the site-level processes described above are escalated to the formal ERM process (see section 3.c) that is  presented to the Chair, President and CEO and the Operating Committee for review, as needed, and to the Board at least once per year.

Risk Management (continued)  RECOMMENDED DISCLOSURE BAXTER DISCLOSURE b) Describe the organization’s processes for  managing climate-related risks  In general, similar to other categories of risk that impact the company, Baxter manages identified climate-related risks in the following ways: •	 Risk mitigation (e.g., controls such as policies, procedures and targeted projects/initiatives)  •	 Risk transfer (e.g., insurance purchases)  •	 Risk acceptance (e.g., risks with low expected impact where no immediate action is required)  More specifically, Baxter’s approach to addressing climate-related risks includes the following.  Global facilities: Baxter’s business segments lead systematic risk-based mitigation planning for the company’s facilities, including for risks related to climate change such  as natural disasters, including hurricanes. Business continuity plans, developed for all facilities based on an assessment of local and other risks, include steps to be taken  during an event and those needed for recovery, such as employee protection planning and communications planning. These plans are developed by a core team of multiple  functions/areas including IT, supply chain, security, EHS&S, procurement and manufacturing. Business continuity plans also include plans to make the company more  resilient when risk cannot be mitigated or eliminated. Supply chain: For supply chain climate risk management, we analyze our global production capabilities and, when appropriate and feasible, create redundancies to minimize  the number of sole sources for critical products. Baxter also identifies opportunities for energy projects such as cogeneration and on-site renewable energy that have the  potential to reduce the company’s reliance on both the local utility grid and fossil fuels and reduce GHG emissions. See the “Management’s response” information in section 2.a for details about how Baxter manages each of those specific risks. See the Baxter Climate Action Roadmap, which we published in 2022, for a summary of planned actions to drive progress toward our 2030 and 2040 GHG emissions-reduction goals. c) Describe how processes for identifying, assessing,  and managing climate-related risks are integrated  into the organization’s overall risk management Baxter integrates identification, assessment and management of climate-related risks into our ERM processes. The company’s ERM program is designed to identify, assess and prioritize strategic, financial, operational, technological and reputational risks with the potential to have  sustained impact on the company. In connection with the annual refreshment of the company’s LRP and finalizing the company’s AOP for the coming year, company  management (including its internal auditors) revisits these risks and identifies top risks for regular monitoring and for the development of related mitigation plans.  Additionally, an executive-level ERM committee composed of cross-functional leadership meets regularly to evaluate and prioritize risks with further escalation and updates  to the Chair, President and CEO and the Board as appropriate. Climate-related risks may be identified through the assessment portion of our ERM activities, which includes rolling interviews with key leaders and voting workshops  annually with the Operating Committee. Risks are scored and ranked based on the following factors:  •	 Impact: Potential effects over the next one to two years in the categories of financial, operational, reputation, strategic and legal/regulatory/compliance. •	 Likelihood: The probability that the impact(s) will occur, ranging from remote to almost certain. •	 Management preparedness: The ability of management and control activities to mitigate either the likelihood and/or the impact of a risk.  Mitigation plans are developed for identified risks and summarized in a risk action matrix, which applies both at the site and corporate levels. See sections 3.a and 3.b (above) for more detail about how climate risk identification, assessment and management are integrated into processes throughout Baxter.

The topics in the Materiality Assessment Findings table in the Appendix  are listed in alphabetical order, grouped by Priority ESG Topics and Other Material ESG Topics. The listing within each category does not reflect the presumed  importance or “materiality” of any particular topic to Baxter or our stakeholders. 2	 Ditto. 2030 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY GOALS Reach More Underserved Kidney Patients 1	 Available in 32 languages and 40 countries. 2	 As of Dec. 31, 2023, there were a total of 53 PD Ambassadors, with 41 representing developing countries. Of the 30 countries with PD Ambassadors, 27 were  developing countries. Consistently Improve Manufacturing Capabilities 3	 Parametric release helps demonstrate that our sterile products maintain high quality standards throughout the entire manufacturing process. We use this  program to get products to patients faster while assuring the highest quality. Achieve Carbon Neutrality for Direct Operations by 2040 4	 Baxter’s carbon-reduction plan covers all Baxter sites, including all legacy Hillrom sites, which are now part of the Baxter Healthcare Systems & Technologies  business segment. 5	 Scope 1 emissions are direct GHG emissions from sources we own or control, such as on-site fuel combustion. Scope 2 emissions are indirect GHG emissions  associated with purchased electricity and energy for owned/controlled facilities. The market-based method is used for Scope 2 unless otherwise stated.  6	 This includes energy consumed by Baxter-operated facilities; it excludes energy related to company-operated vehicles. 7	 Estimated energy and financial savings and GHG emissions reduction are calculated for the 12 months following project implementation. Energy reduction is  calculated excluding the impact of new cogeneration installations. 8	 Excludes energy consumption associated with Baxter-operated mobile sources. In 2023, biomass fuel for boilers at two of our locations (one in the United  States and one in Italy) accounted for 10.5%, and the renewable energy component of our purchased electricity and renewable energy certificates together  represented 22.2%. Additionally, on-site geothermal, solar photovoltaic and solar hot water systems made a small contribution. During the year, emissions  from the Baxter-operated biomass boilers equaled 119,000 metric tons CO2. In accordance with the GHG Protocol, these are not included in reported Scope 1 and  Scope 2 emissions. However, also in accordance with the GHG Protocol, we include CO2e emissions from the CH4 and N2O components of biomass combustion  in our reported Scope 1 emissions. 9	 Estimated energy savings and GHG emissions avoidance are calculated for the 12 months following project implementation. 10	 Baxter’s Scope 3 emissions relate to activities within the company’s value chain, but outside of our direct control. These emissions are based on various  assumptions and estimates and are verified by a third party to a limited assurance level (see assurance statement). See Baxter Value Chain Energy Usage and  GHG Emissions for detail. Implement Strategic Water Management Plans 11	One cubic meter equals 1,000 liters or 264 gallons.  12	The World Resources Institute water tool defines baseline water stress as total annual water withdrawals (municipal, industrial and agricultural) expressed  as a percentage of total annual available flow. Higher values indicate more competition among users. 	 Low: Less than 10% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually. 	 Low-Med: Between 10% and 20% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually. 	 Med-High: Between 20% and 40% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually. 	 High: Between 40% and 80% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually. 	 Extremely High: More than 80% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually. Advance Sustainable Procurement 13	 Applicable suppliers are those that have a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number and with which we have historical spend. Implement Strategic Materials and Waste Management Plans 14	 Baxter data on file, 2023.   15	 The savings described for the project are calculated on an annualized basis (12 months from each project completion date), though savings should continue  beyond one year. 16	 Baxter policies require facilities to dispose of all hazardous or other regulated waste at disposal sites that Baxter has inspected or from which the company  has otherwise received sufficient assurance of acceptable performance. Regulated waste is waste for which regulations require a special manner of disposal,  including hazardous waste. 2030 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY GOALS (CONTINUED)  Invest in Underserved Communities Globally 17	 Baxter donates a broad portfolio of medical products, supplies and therapies for acute and chronic conditions. Recipient nonprofit partners determine  the reported value of Baxter-donated products at wholesale value or fair market value, depending on the product and country of origin.  18	 Baxterʼs Global Interactions Policy provides guidance for corporate charitable giving to help promote compliance with applicable law and with Baxter policy.  We have local Contributions Management Committees in select countries, clusters of countries or regions. Where they exist, those local committees have  decision-making authority, in accordance with the Global Interactions Policy, for contribution requests from educational institutions, not-for-profit or charitable  healthcare organizations and patient organizations. The Baxter International Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Baxter International Inc., is a separate legal  entity governed by its own board of directors and distinct grantmaking guidelines that govern its charitable contributions to nonprofit organizations. Achieve Top Quartile Workplace Safety Performance 19	 High-frequency injuries that Baxter is targeting to reduce in the near term include ergonomics and slips/trips/falls. 20	Work-related injuries or illnesses requiring medical attention beyond first aid, including cases with days lost. All rates based on 100 full-time employees  working one year, which equals 200,000 work hours. For tracking purposes, Baxter follows U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration  recordkeeping requirements worldwide. Thus, in cases where an injury occurs and conflicting medical opinions arise as to the number of days away and/ or restricted days that should be recorded, we record on the basis of the most authoritative physician’s opinion. We include occupational diseases and  illnesses, such as hearing loss and ergonomic disorders. Due to privacy regulations in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, we do not classify or  report injuries by gender. Supervised contracted employees are included in the injury statistics reported and are not tracked separately. Independent  contractors are not included in Baxter’s injury data, because they are supervised by other organizations. 21	Major incidents are defined as those that result in death of a Baxter employee, contractor or visitor associated with work being performed at a Baxter  facility, or are directly caused by visiting a Baxter facility, or associated with work or travel activities while a Baxter employee is away on company  business. Severe incidents are defined as those that result in amputations, debilitating injuries that result in permanent loss of use of a body part or  other disease to the human body, severe burns, severe fractures (overnight hospitalization or surgery, major leg or arm bones, multiple fractures to  hand or foot, fracture of skull), as well as reportable exposure events. Recordable and lost time incidents which result in hospitalization with medical  treatment are also classified as severe incidents, regardless of injury type. Increase Representation of Women and Ethnic Minorities in Leadership Roles 22	 “Ethnic minorities,” within the context of our 2030 goal, refers to the United States Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Commission Categories, which  include Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Two or  More Races. 23	Our 2030 goals related to increasing the representation of women and ethnic minorities in leadership roles are based on assumptions about labor  market conditions. “Labor market conditions” refers to the availability of talent in the marketplace in the communities where we operate and serve, and  specifically looks at census data, as well as our internal pipeline. These labor market conditions can change over time so we will continue to monitor  and adjust our goals as needed. CROSS-CUTTING COMMITMENTS Ethics and Compliance  1	 Related policies address conflicts of interest; corporate opportunities; confidentiality; data privacy; proper use of company assets; maintaining accurate  business records; compliance with laws, rules and regulations; and reporting of any illegal or unethical behavior, among other items.  2	 The scope of these audits of distributors includes fulfillment of due diligence and contract requirements, services obtained from distributors and  payments made to them, as well as the adequacy and accuracy of distributorsʼ books and records in the context of their business with Baxter, among  other areas. 3	 In 2023, these included Brazil, Ecuador, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan and the UK.  Privacy and Data Protection  4	 Training is provided to employees with a Baxter email address. Employees without a Baxter email address, such as those in manufacturing, do not  participate. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion  5	 “Economic output” includes revenues earned by suppliers and businesses in the company’s supply chain and their communities.  MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT FINDINGS 1	 Our approach to the disclosures included in this report differs from our approach to the disclosures we include in other reports, including our filings  with the SEC. For example, in this report, we are not using the terms “material” and “materiality” as defined for the purposes of financial and SEC  reporting in the United States. Instead, the terms refer to environmental, social and economic topics that may be significant to our stakeholders and  to the company, which we use to inform our corporate responsibility strategy, priorities and goals, and reporting. The topics in this table are listed  in alphabetical order, grouped by Priority ESG Topics and Other Material ESG Topics. The listing within each category does not reflect the presumed  importance or “materiality” of any particular topic to Baxter or our stakeholders. Appendix: Endnotes From the Chair,  President and CEO Company Profile Corporate Responsibility  Commitment 2030 Corporate  Responsibility Goals Cross-Cutting  Commitments Appendix  ===== PAGE 44 =====   44 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Appendix: Endnotes (continued) DATA SUMMARY 1	 Some metrics in this Data Summary relate to the companyʼs 2030 Corporate Responsibility Goals. Other metrics relate to other ESG topics. 2	 Data in this section for 2021, 2022 and 2023 excludes Baxter’s BioPharma Solutions business, which was divested at the end of the third quarter of 2023.

Some data for 2021 and 2022 is updated  from data reported in the Baxter 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report to improve accuracy, and in the case of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, to reflect  updated GHG-emission factors. Some totals may vary from the sum of items in the category, due to rounding. 9	 Excludes energy consumption associated with Baxter-operated mobile sources and renewable electricity generated on-site. 10	 2022 and 2023 data for this metric reflects the integration of the Hillrom business, which Baxter acquired in December 2021. Data for 2021 is not included,  due to lack of comparability. 11	 Excludes energy consumption associated with Baxter-operated mobile sources. 12	 2021 and 2022 data excludes legacy Hillrom sites. 13	 In 2021, we were unable to perform on-site energy assessments due to COVID-19-related travel restrictions. 14	 In some cases, segments may not add up to 100% due to rounding. Data may differ slightly from the totals stated in the Baxter Operations Total line of the  Value Chain Energy Usage and GHG Emissions table due to rounding. 15	 Number includes Scope 3 emissions plus Scope 1 emissions for product transport. Some totals may vary from the sum of items in the category, due to rounding. 16	 “Water usage” aligns with the definition of “water withdrawal” in GRI 303: Water and Effluents 2018: “Sum of all water drawn from surface water,  groundwater, seawater, or a third party for any use over the course of the reporting period.” 17	 Water usage from Baxter’s 59 manufacturing sites with the most significant water usage, representing 95% of the company’s total annual water usage. The  World Resources Institute water tool defines baseline water stress as the total annual water withdrawals (municipal, industrial and agricultural) expressed  as a percentage of the total annual available flow. Higher values indicate more competition among users. Low: Less than 10% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually. Low-Med: Between 10% and 20% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually. Med-High: Between 20% and 40% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually. High: Between 40% and 80% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually. Extremely High: More than 80% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually. 18	 Estimated total water pollutant levels for treated wastewater discharged directly into waterways, for the six Baxter sites that have direct discharges. BOD5  refers to five-day biological oxygen demand; COD refers to chemical oxygen demand; TSS refers to total suspended solids. When actual performance data  was not available, estimates are based on performance at similar facilities or on other measured performance indicators. 19	 Data in this section for 2021, 2022 and 2023 includes Baxter’s BioPharma Solutions business, which was divested at the end of the third quarter of 2023.  20	 2021 data is Oct. 1, 2020 through Sept. 30, 2021. 2022 and 2023 data is calendar year. 2022 data is updated from data reported in the Baxter 2022 Corporate  Responsibility Report to align with calendar year. 21	 Excludes waste associated with U.S. Renal Home Care operations, since patients dispose of unused product rather than returning it to Baxter for  disposal. Also excludes construction and demolition debris, remediation waste, wastewater treatment sludge and discarded manufacturing- and  process-related machinery or equipment. Removing these waste categories from the company total allows for more consistent evaluation of facility  performance and trends over time. 22	 Excludes production by-products reused on-site, construction and demolition debris, wastewater treatment and discarded manufacturing- and process-related  machinery or equipment. Includes discarded/returned products (such as intravenous solution, dextrose solution, etc.) that are nonhazardous in nature  but may be classified as regulated in some countries. Excludes waste associated with U.S. Renal Home Care operations, since patients dispose of unused  product rather than returning it to Baxter for disposal. DATA SUMMARY (CONTINUED) 23	 Includes recycling and incineration with energy recovery. 24	 Excludes waste recycled on-site, remediation waste, construction and demolition debris and wastewater treatment sludge. Includes certain waste streams  (such as waste oils, batteries, fluorescent lamps, light ballasts and asbestos) not classified as regulated in some locations. 25	 In compliance with the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive. Data excludes Hillrom. 26	 During 2021, PVC Collected for Recycling and Aluminum Bottles Recycled data for Australia also includes New Zealand. In Australia and New Zealand,  Baxterʼs Home Patients PD Recycling Program was suspended in some locations during 2020 due to COVID-19, and reinstated during 2022. Some other  data in this section is not available for 2021 due to different presentation in past reports. 27	 Values correspond to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) Program data reported for 2021 and 2022. Data includes  eight facilities in the continental United States and Puerto Rico only. Data for 2023 is not available as of report publication date. 28	 Includes air emissions associated with on-site energy generation. Emission factors from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency publication  “Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors,” AP-42, Fifth Edition, Volume 1: “Stationary Point and Area Sources.” 29	 For the purpose of this calculation, manufacturing includes pharmaceutical locations, and our sites in Sondalo and Grosotto, Italy, and Castlebar and  Swinford, Ireland, are counted separately. Outside of manufacturing locations, the balance of 17 ISO-certified sites consists of compounding (six), offices  (five), and planning and fulfillment (six). 30	 “Professional” includes individual contributors. 31	 “Other” includes American Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander and two or more races. 32	 Calculation methodology for 2023 updated to align the top-level data with the ethnic representation breakdown by Vice President and Above, Director,  Manager and Professional in the right column. 33	 In some cases, segments may not add up to total due to rounding.  34	 Includes product donations as well as Patient Assistance Programs. Variations in Baxter’s annual product donations are due to fluctuations in community  needs, the need and volume of disaster relief response, the regulatory environment, product availability, manufacturing processes and changes in product  mix and marketing. We identify opportunities to donate and respond to community and humanitarian aid partner requests as appropriate. Value of products  donated (provided at no cost) is provided by partners based on wholesale acquisition cost at the time of donation. This number may be greater or less than  the value of Baxter products distributed during the year by our relief partners. See Invest in Underserved Communities Globally. 35	 Contributions to U.S.-based 501(c)(3) organizations for programs within and outside of the United States. 36	 Based on hourly rates of $29.95 per volunteer hour for 2021, $31.80 per volunteer hour for 2022 and $33.49 per volunteer hour for 2023, as published by  Independent Sector. Volunteer hours are self-reported by Baxter employees.   37	 The regional breakdown of the data included in this section reflects the structure of the EHS&S organization and the categorization of data in the EHS&S  global information management system through 2023.  38	 Work-related injuries or illnesses requiring medical attention beyond first aid, including cases with days lost. All rates based on 100 full-time employees  working one year, which equals 200,000 work hours. For tracking purposes, Baxter follows U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration  recordkeeping requirements worldwide. Thus, in cases where an injury occurs and conflicting medical opinions arise as to the number of days away and/ or restricted days that should be recorded, we record on the basis of the most authoritative physician’s opinion. We include occupational diseases and  illnesses, such as hearing loss and ergonomic disorders. Due to privacy regulations in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, we do not classify or  report injuries by gender. Supervised contracted employees are included in the injury statistics reported in this table and are not tracked separately.  Independent contractors are not included in Baxter’s injury data, because they are supervised by other organizations. 2021 and 2022 data includes COVID-19  cases. Public health guidance varies around the world concerning isolation and quarantine days for COVID-19. Probable work-related COVID-19 cases  average 10 days lost per CDC guidance and account for days away from work due to the illness. 39	 Work-related injuries or illnesses that cause an employee to lose at least one full day after the date of the incident. 40	 The number of days lost (including weekends and holidays) recommended by the most authoritative physician’s opinion due to work-related injuries or  illnesses. We do not count the date of injury and date of return to full duty as lost days. 41	 The number of days recommended by the most authoritative physician’s opinion that an employee or supervised contractor is unable to work full duty  (including weekends and holidays) due to a work-related injury or illness. We do not count the date of injury and date of return to full duty as restricted days. 42	 Baxterʼs historical DART rate calculation combines the number of days lost, days restricted and days transferred, as a measure of severity. 43	 Each year, profiles untouched for the previous three years are removed from the active database. 44	 This data refers to facilities with 25 or more employees, in locations where smoke-free status is allowed by law. 45	 Data includes vaccinations given September of the year noted through January of the following year, aligned with the typical flu season for North America. 46	 Data in this section for 2021 and 2022 includes Baxter’s BioPharma Solutions business, which was divested at the end of the third quarter of 2023.

Data for 2022 reflects the  acquisition of Hillrom. Baxter did not administer a Best Place to Work survey in 2023 due to large-scale organizational changes.  From the Chair,  President and CEO Company Profile Corporate Responsibility  Commitment 2030 Corporate  Responsibility Goals Cross-Cutting  Commitments Appendix  ===== PAGE 45 =====   45 2023 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Appendix: Endnotes (continued) DATA SUMMARY (CONTINUED) 49	 New item on Best Place to Work survey in 2022, included in the overall Inclusion index. 50	 United States and Puerto Rico. Data is calendar year. Accounts payable data is sent to a third party, which categorizes spending. HUBZone is a U.S.  Small Business Administration program for small companies that operate and employ people in historically underutilized business zones. Spending  with suppliers that qualify for more than one category may be included in the totals for each of the relevant categories. Spend with Small Disadvantaged  Businesses data for 2022 is updated from data reported in the Baxter 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report, for accuracy.  51	 United States and Puerto Rico. Data is calendar year. “Economic output” includes revenues earned by suppliers and businesses in the company’s  supply chain and their communities. “Indirect” includes impacts at the businesses from which suppliers (and their suppliers) purchase goods and  services. “Induced” includes impacts generated in the communities of the suppliers’ employees associated with purchases made by these employees  and jobs supported through those purchases. Data for 2022 is updated from data reported in the Baxter 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report, to  include Puerto Rico. Estimated Indirect and Induced data for 2021 and 2022 is updated from data reported in the Baxter 2022 Corporate Responsibility  Report, for accuracy. 52	 “Technical/Clerical” includes employees in operational and administrative/clerical roles. 53	 Scores indicate the percentage of survey participants who responded favorably to statements related to each of the categories listed. Baxter did not  administer a Best Place to Work survey in 2023 due to large-scale organizational changes. Engagement and Inclusion questions were added to the 2023  Manager Effectiveness survey administered in November 2023.  54	 This data includes training hours for employees and contractors. It does not represent all employee and contractor training and development but does  capture a large portion of training for most employees and contractors. VALUE CHAIN ENERGY USAGE AND GHG EMISSIONS 1	 Baxter used the World Resources Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development The Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol)  to calculate emissions data from fossil fuel use. We used country electricity emission factors published by the International Energy Agency and the  Association of Issuing Bodies (for residual mixes), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) E-Grid U.S. and Canada National Inventory Report  regional electricity emission factors to calculate GHG emissions related to electricity consumption. 2	 LRQA verified to a reasonable level Baxter’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions. LRQA also verified to a limited level Baxter’s Scope 3 GHG emissions. 3	 Baxter Operations data for 2021, 2022 and 2023 excludes Baxter’s BioPharma Solutions business, which was divested at the end of the third quarter of  2023. Some data for 2021 and 2022 is updated from data reported in prior-year Baxter Corporate Responsibility Reports for accuracy and to reflect updated  GHG emission factors. 4	 We used the GHG Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition to determine GHG emissions associated with using biomass  fuel, principally wood/wood waste, as a boiler fuel at two Baxter locations. These emissions were calculated as 123,000, 111,000 and 119,000 metric tons CO2  in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. CO2e emissions from CH4 and N2O components of biomass combustion are included in reported Scope 1 emissions. 5	 Baxter used the GHG Protocol to calculate GHG emissions associated with reported fuel usage by company-managed sales and distribution fleet vehicles  and other vehicles. We estimated fuel usage for some international sales vehicles based on regional sales information. 6	 Refrigerant emissions represent reported HFC and other refrigerant losses by each Baxter location. We calculated associated GHG emissions using  emission factors for each reported refrigerant.  7	 Includes the purchase of electricity generated from 100% certified renewable electricity (Belgium, Brazil, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Mexico,  Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK and United States). 8	 For 2021, 2022 and 2023, Scope 3 categories 1, 4, 6 and 7 include Baxterʼs BioPharma Solutions business, which was divested at the end of the third  quarter of 2023. Scope 3 categories 9, 11 and 12 include BioPharma Solutions for 2021 and 2022 and exclude BioPharma Solutions for 2023. Scope 3  categories 2, 3 and 5 exclude BioPharma Solutions for 2021, 2022 and 2023. Scope 3 categories 8, 10, 13, 14 and 15 are not applicable to Baxter. Emissions  associated with category 8 (upstream leased assets) are included in Baxterʼs Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Category 10 is no longer relevant since Baxterʼs  BioPharma Solutions business was divested at the end of the third quarter of 2023. Baxter does not have significant downstream leased assets (category  13), franchises (category 14) or significant investments (category 15). Some data for 2021 and 2022 is updated from data reported in prior-year Baxter  Corporate Responsibility Reports for accuracy and to reflect updated GHG emission factors.  9	 Estimated based on global expenditures by category and emission factors from Conversion factors kgCO2 per £ spent, by SIC code 2020, UK Government  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra), 2012.   10	Estimated based on capital expenditures and the machinery and equipment emission factor from Conversion factors kgCO2 per £ spent, by SIC code 2020,  Defra, 2012. 11	Estimated based on Baxter’s actual yearly energy usage by energy type and GHG emission factors for each energy type per GaBi life cycle assessment  software.  12	Estimated based on shipment of products to our customers using EcoTransIT World software, which is compliant with the GHG Protocol and the Global  Logistics Emissions Council Framework. 13	Estimated emissions for wastewater treatment by municipalities and off-site waste recycling and disposal based on Baxter’s waste generation by type,  UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting and the U.S. EPA GHG Emission Factors Hub. 14	Estimated emissions from air travel, rental vehicles and hotel room stays provided by Baxter’s global travel providers. Also includes emissions from  personal vehicle mileage. Emission factors from UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting and U.S. EPA. VALUE CHAIN ENERGY USAGE AND GHG EMISSIONS (CONTINUED) 15	Estimated based on the number of Baxter employees by country and statistics on commuting time and transport mode split into public transport,  passenger cars, taxi and motorcycle, and walking or bicycling. Emission factors for each mode were obtained from Defra.  16	Estimated based on previous Baxter product LCAs as well as the company’s revenue by product type. Category 1 emissions were extrapolated to other  categories depending on the product type. 17	Estimated based on previous Baxter product LCAs as well as the company’s revenue by product type. Category 1 emissions were extrapolated to  other categories depending on the product type. Data for 2021 and 2022 is updated from data reported in prior-year Baxter Corporate Responsibility  Reports to reflect changes in the calculation methodology. Specifically, we have removed the following gases from the Use of Sold Products  category, and have instead disclosed them separately: HFE-236ea2, CHF2OCHFCF3 (Desflurane); HCFE-235da2, CHF2OCHClCF3 (Isoflurane); and  HFE-347mmz1, (CF3)2CHOCH2F (Sevoflurane). This is consistent with The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard  (revised edition), The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard and The Greenhouse Gas Protocol Accounting and  Reporting Standard Amendment. In 2023, the estimated emissions of these optionally reported gases were 1,455,000 metric tons CO2e. 18	Totals do not include CO2 emissions from Baxter-owned wood-fired boilers. See endnote 4 to the left for detail. FACILITIES WITH ISO 14001, ISO 45001, ISO 50001 AND GREEN BUILDING CERTIFICATIONS 1	 As of Dec. 31, 2023.  2	 Data excludes Baxter’s BioPharma Solutions business, which was divested at the end of the third quarter of 2023. 3	 Facilities transitioned to ISO 45001 from OHSAS 18001. 4	 The building with green certification noted is one of several buildings at the designated location. 5	 The building with green certification is an extension of an existing building at the designated location. SUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD INDEX 1	 Approximately 98% of recalled or corrected units related to an equipment failure in one specific product. 2	 Differences compared with data on FDA websites may be due to timeframe (the date Baxter takes an action may differ from the date FDA classifies  that action), definition of “recall” (FDA data includes actions taken even if the product is not removed or corrected) or classification by product group  vs. product code (FDA counts each impacted product code within a product family as a distinct recall).   3	 Conformité Européenne (CE) marking appears on products traded on the extended single market in the European Economic Area (EEA). TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES INDEX 1	 Identify prioritized locations using a risk-based approach by the end of 2023. 2	 As measured by supplier commitment to Baxter’s Ethics & Compliance Standards and Baxter’s completion of corporate responsibility audits within  our supply base.

This drive was evident at the start of 2023 as we  announced an array of initiatives to help redefine  and strengthen our trajectory in a shifting  healthcare landscape. These actions included  the proposed spinoff of our Renal Care and Acute  Therapies (Kidney Care) businesses into an  independent, publicly traded company, and the  move to a fully revamped operating model that we  are in the process of implementing, all centered on  sparking heightened innovation, better navigating  our environment and bringing us closer to our  customers.1 These efforts were launched barely a  year after our acquisition of Hillrom, which itself  greatly expanded our portfolio and capabilities as a  medtech leader.  Our transformative spirit is fueled by underlying  values that remain foundational and unwavering,  rooted in our Mission to Save and Sustain Lives  and our commitment to responsible corporate  citizenship. Our 2030 Corporate Responsibility Commitment  and Goals, launched in 2021, represent a  framework to help create lasting environmental,  social and economic value across three critical  pillars: Empower Our Patients, Protect Our Planet  and Champion Our People and Communities. Each  has a set of clearly stated initiatives, financial  support and governance measures to help ensure  progress and accountability. In 2022, we made  progress toward our goals, and you can find many  noteworthy milestones throughout this report.  JOSÉ (JOE) E. ALMEIDA Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Among the year’s highlights, Baxter:   •	 Completed more than 160 energy conservation  projects, helping avoid an estimated 10,600  metric tons CO2e of greenhouse gas (GHG)  emissions for the year, in addition to completing  three new on-site solar installations that  are expected to reduce GHG emissions by  approximately 1,400 metric tons CO2e annually •	 Achieved 16.4% year-over-year improvement in  manufacturing process capability for prioritized  products by reducing the rate of leaks for  sterilized solutions and sets •	 Made $51 million in philanthropic investments to  benefit underserved communities through Baxter  and the Baxter International Foundation •	 Continued to advance ACT: Activating Change  Today, our multidimensional effort to promote  racial justice, by investing in scholarships  supporting students at Historically Black Colleges  and Universities, community engagement,  healthcare equity programs and the attraction   and development of diverse talent •	 Conducted a new “materiality assessment” to help  ensure that Baxter’s corporate responsibility focus  areas continue to evolve with stakeholder priorities •	 Announced plans to publish our first report  aligned with the Task Force on Climate-related  Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework, in a  stand-alone publication in 2023 Our commitment to the global community is  also demonstrated by how Baxter and the Baxter  International Foundation respond to natural  disasters and other humanitarian emergencies. We  support relief efforts through product donations  and financial assistance, plus the commitment of  employees who go above-and-beyond to maintain  patient access to our life-sustaining therapies  and volunteer their time to help. Included among  our 2022 efforts, Baxter engaged in a multitiered  response to the war in Ukraine, including substantial  grants to support the work of organizations on the  scene. More recently, we responded swiftly following  the devastating February 2023 earthquake in Turkey  and Syria, supporting disaster relief with cash  grants and product donations managed through our  humanitarian partners Direct Relief and Americares.  Thanks to the focus and determination of our  colleagues globally, Baxter continues to be cited  frequently as a corporate responsibility leader.  Among 2022 recognitions, Baxter was named  to 3BL Media’s list of the 100 Best Corporate  Citizens and JUST Capital’s America's Most JUST  Companies. We are also proud to be included on the  FTSE4Good Index series and S&P Global’s Dow Jones  Sustainability Indices (DJSI)—both DJSI World and  DJSI North America.  Looking ahead, as we prepare to update facets  of our corporate responsibility goals in line with  our evolving business portfolio and profile, our  underlying commitment holds firm. The Baxter team  is dedicated to doing business the right way, and  in line with our corporate responsibility priorities.  I salute our Baxter employees around the world,  whose passion powers our performance as a  healthcare leader and responsible corporate citizen. From the Chairman, President and CEO Company Profile Corporate Responsibility Commitment 2030 Corporate  Responsibility Goals Cross-Cutting  Commitments Appendix From the Chairman, President and CEO  ===== PAGE 4 =====   4 2022 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Company Profile Every day, millions of patients, caregivers and healthcare  providers rely on Baxter’s leading portfolio of essential  healthcare products, therapies and digital health solutions  used across the care continuum. Everything we do  converges at the critical intersection where products that  save and sustain lives meet the healthcare professionals  and caregivers who make it all happen. Operating at this  intersection has kept Baxter at the industry forefront for  more than 90 years. We have a longstanding commitment  to research and development (R&D) and a rich history of  medical firsts, from the first commercially manufactured  intravenous (IV) solutions to the first portable kidney  dialysis machine, and many more. Bolstered by the acquisition of Hillrom in December 2021,1  our broad portfolio enables us to meet health systems,  clinicians or patients wherever they are in their journey  and better understand their diverse and critical needs  along the way. Our portfolio includes acute and chronic  dialysis therapies; sterile IV solutions; infusion systems  and devices; parenteral nutrition therapies; inhaled  anesthetics; generic injectable pharmaceuticals; surgical  hemostat, sealant and adhesion prevention products;  advanced surgical equipment; smart bed systems; patient  monitoring, communication platforms and diagnostic  technologies; and respiratory health devices. Our mission is to save and sustain lives. To achieve this,  we aim to transform healthcare by helping to improve  patient outcomes, enhance workflow efficiency and enable  cost-effective care.  INNOVATION We are focused on developing powerful and practical  innovations intended to transform healthcare.  We believe transformation starts with compassion  for the challenges our customers and patients face  every day. We innovate to turn those challenges  into opportunities, offering intuitive technology that  clinicians can use to individualize care for each patient.  In 2022, Baxter invested more than $600 million in  R&D. Our robust product pipeline is designed to help  clinicians be more efficient and effective as they treat  patients across multiple care settings, including  hospital bedsides, operating rooms, intensive care  units, dialysis clinics, physiciansʼ offices and patientsʼ  homes. For example, we are expanding availability of  our new infusion pump platform to additional markets.  In addition, while proposed new product launches are  subject to obtaining all required regulatory approvals  and clearances, we are preparing to introduce  several innovations to help improve care for patients  around the world, including digital health solutions  for the hospital and home, a next-generation airway  clearance therapy, a new platform for intelligent  alarms, a next-generation smart bed platform,  new developments in home dialysis technology,  generic injectables, drug delivery offerings, complex  pharmaceutical formulations and more. Innovation is also essential to driving progress toward  our 2030 Corporate Responsibility Goals. Through a  multifaceted approach, we are working to access new  markets and reach more kidney patients in developing  countries. By transitioning toward a more circular  approach to making and delivering products, we strive  to meet rapidly evolving market demands, reduce waste  and maximize materials value throughout the product  life cycle. These examples and many others are  included throughout this report.

We are driven by the possibility of making a  meaningful difference in the world—not just today,  but for generations to come. This is why our approach  to corporate responsibility is grounded in creating a  more sustainable and responsible business model  with innovations in healthcare at the core.  We are currently focused on our 2030 Corporate  Responsibility Commitment and Goals, which  strive to create comprehensive and lasting value  by empowering our patients, protecting our planet  and championing our people and communities.  These pillars are bolstered by strong governance  and cross-cutting commitments to responsible  practices across our business.  With more than 30 years of reporting on our  environmental performance, we have consistently  broadened and enhanced our reporting on the  environmental, social and governance (ESG)  topics that are priorities for Baxter and our  stakeholders. For example, since 2019, we have  published an annual Sustainability Accounting  Standards Board (SASB) Index in alignment  with the Medical Equipment and Supplies  Sustainability Accounting Standard. Additionally,  we intend to report against the framework  established by the Task Force on Climate-related  Financial Disclosures (TCFD) beginning later  this year (likely as part of a stand-alone and  subsequently published supplement to this  United Nations Sustainable  Development Goals We are proud to affirm our support for the United Nations  Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and 2030  Agenda—a global blueprint for achieving a more   sustainable future.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS OVERSIGHT Baxter’s Board of Directors plays a critical role in corporate  responsibility oversight. The full Board is regularly updated  on corporate responsibility matters, including our goals  and industry trends. The Board’s Quality, Compliance and  Technology (QCT) Committee and Nominating, Corporate  Governance & Public Policy (NCGPP) Committee share  oversight for ESG-related matters, with the QCT Committee  focused on topics related to environmental sustainability  and compliance and the NCGPP Committee focused  on other aspects of corporate responsibility, including  charitable contributions, public policy, access to healthcare  and other social and governance matters.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY STEERING  COMMITTEE With the inauguration of our 2030 Corporate Responsibility  Commitment and Goals, we launched an executive cross- functional Corporate Responsibility Steering Committee  to provide direction and oversight to our ESG initiatives  and set and advance our corporate responsibility strategy  and culture. This committee meets or receives updates  quarterly to monitor policies, action plans and strategies  as well as other matters of significance to the company’s  reputation as a socially responsible organization. It provides  guidance to Baxter’s Corporate Responsibility Council. As part of the company’s corporate  governance outreach program, members of  Baxter’s management team and members  of the Board, including the company’s Lead  Independent Director and the Chair of the  NCGPP Committee, engage with investors  on a range of topics. In the fall of 2022,  the company engaged in discussions with  stockholders representing approximately  40% of the company’s outstanding shares  (calculated as of Dec. 31, 2022). Topics  discussed included company strategy and  performance, the continued integration of  Hillrom, corporate governance matters  (including board composition, diversity  and refreshment), the Board’s leadership  structure, executive compensation and  corporate responsibility initiatives.

ESG TOPICS DESCRIPTION Upstream Downstream Baxter  Operations POTENTIAL IMPACT WITHIN   BAXTER'S VALUE CHAIN Materiality 1 To understand and prioritize topics that are important to the long-term sustainability of our business and most relevant to our stakeholders, we periodically conduct assessments that are commonly referred to as “materiality assessments.”  These analyses (which may differ from those conducted for financial statement or other disclosure purposes) inform our corporate responsibility strategy, commitment and goals.  In 2022, we worked with an external consultant to conduct a new materiality assessment. The objectives of this analysis were to help Baxter to assess our approach to corporate responsibility following the acquisition of Hillrom in late 2021 and to  align with the evolving interests of Baxter and our stakeholders. We developed an initial list of ESG topics relevant to Baxter, based on leading disclosure frameworks and peers’ ESG reports and other disclosures. Interviews were conducted with  more than 20 Baxter executives, representing a range of functions, businesses and geographies, as well as more than 20 external stakeholders, including customers, industry associations, investors, NGOs, patient advocacy groups and suppliers.  Participants ranked ESG topics by importance to stakeholders and importance to business success. Following review with Baxter’s management team, a list of material ESG topics was finalized, including a list of six priority ESG topics.

Driving shared decision making:  We provide  practical tools and information to help patients work  with their healthcare providers to choose therapies  that best align with their lifestyle goals. Highlights  from 2022 include:  •	 Made grants to the American Association of Kidney  Patients to raise awareness about the benefits  of PD and support informed discussions about  therapy options  •	 Began building a unique e-learning program  for nephrologists and their nursing staffs to  implement shared-decision-making techniques  with patients    •	 Enhanced the MyKidneyJourney website1 with  new educational videos and articles about kidney  disease and treatment  •	 Supported ongoing growth of a PD Ambassador  Program to educate clinicians about the benefits  of PD and the role they play in shared decision  making and digital health2   Advocating for access to PD:  We continue to  support public policies, economic analyses and  collaborations that advance access to PD. In 2022,   we conducted work in approximately 20 countries to  improve access to PD. Highlights include:  •	 Worked with governments in Eastern Europe and  Southeast Asia to help them advocate for greater  patient access to home dialysis •	 Hosted the third International Home Dialysis  Roundtable for patient advocacy groups, clinical  societies and industry representatives from 27  countries, which published a paper in 2022 on the  importance of catheter access: Peritoneal Catheter  Insertion: Combatting Barriers Through Policy Change  •	 Sponsored hands-on programs to train nearly 400  nephrologists from 19 countries3 on catheter insertion  (which is necessary to begin PD treatment) Expanding innovation and services:  Innovation  that meets the local needs of patients is critical to  expanding access to care. Highlights from 2022 include: •	 Worked with China’s National Health Security  Administration to gain approval for the use of  Baxter’s Extraneal PD Solution (a non-glucose  option) and secure reimbursement, which will make  the treatment more accessible and affordable for  patients in that country •	 Continued to expand the use of Sharesource, our  digital health platform for remote patient management,  which now connects 58,000 patients in 84 countries  and has helped to facilitate 51 million treatments APPROACH AND PROGRESS Baxter is committed to patient safety and to delivering  high-quality, defect-free products. We work across  the entire quality system, looking beyond compliance  and taking proactive steps to improve the quality of  upstream components and enable more consistent,  effective manufacturing processes.  In 2021, we identified sterilized solutions and sets  as our priority area to drive toward best-in-class  performance, and we are investing in related  manufacturing processes across our plants. We will  identify additional products and sites to prioritize for  improvement in the coming years. The following key  strategies help us to achieve our goal to deliver safe,  high-quality products that work reliably and are free  of defects. Manufacturing excellence:  We focus on facility  infrastructure, processes and systems to ensure a  continual state of control. This enables us to optimize  our production lines and equipment effectiveness,  minimize scrap and rework, and consistently release  high-quality products into the marketplace. During  2022, 65 of the 86 product categories we tracked  reached their performance targets. Internal governance:  Cross-functional senior  leaders engage in strategic reviews that include visibility  to real-time data and analytics for product safety and  quality performance across the entire portfolio, which  helps us identify priority products for improvement. Data-driven decision making:  Our Production  Cycle Optimization process leverages analytical tools,  robust data sets and controls across our manufacturing  processes. We aim to detect quality defects early and  fix those problems at their point of origin. In 2022, we  implemented tools to provide advanced real-time data  analytics for 29 processes. Collaboration with global regulators:  We continue  to pursue collaborative solutions with global regulators  to advance patient safety and help ensure our products  are of the highest quality. In 2022, we accelerated  our parametric release4 strategy, partnered with  regulators to gain approval and expanded the number of  manufacturing facilities and products using parametric  release across Asia and Europe.

Between 2005 and  2015, we reduced our absolute GHG emissions by  19%. We reduced GHG emissions by another 13.6%  between 2015 and 2020. In 2021 we established a goal  to achieve carbon neutrality for our direct operations  by 2040, and we published our Baxter Climate Action  Roadmap in 2022.   Scope 1 and 2 emissions:  In 2022, Baxter’s total  Scope 1 and 2 emissions5 from operations equaled  615,000 metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e),  a 1.3% decrease in absolute emissions compared with  2020 (see Baxter’s total GHG emissions footprint,  including Scope 3). During the year, in addition to  energy-efficiency initiatives, we worked to decrease  our GHG emissions through fuel switching,  cogeneration, alternative energy systems, on-site  renewable energy systems, renewable electricity  procurement and green buildings.  Energy:  Energy is one of our most significant  manufacturing costs, accounting for 99% of Baxter’s  GHG emissions from operations in 2022. Our global  energy program applies the ISO 50001 standard to the  company’s facility-level energy management systems.  In 2022, we used 3.1 million megawatt hours (MWh) of  energy,6 4.2% more than in 2021 in absolute terms.  Site-specific energy assessments help us identify  opportunities to conserve energy, such as  implementing new technologies or adopting best  practices. In 2022, we completed 163 energy  conservation projects for an investment of $5.9 million  across our manufacturing sites. We estimate that  these projects saved 39,700 MWh of energy and   $4.0 million and avoided 10,600 metric tons CO2e   of GHG emissions during 2022.7  By the end of 2022, 30% of our energy use for  operations was derived from renewable sources,  equivalent to 944,000 MWh on an annual basis.8  We completed three new on-site solar installations  in 2022 that are expected to produce approximately  2,300 MWh and reduce GHG emissions by  approximately 1,400 metric tons CO2e annually.9  In 2022, we purchased 566,000 MWh of electricity  generated from 100% certified renewable power.  Scope 3 emissions:  Although our carbon  neutrality goal focuses on Scope 1 and 2 emissions,  Baxter continues to calculate and address Scope 3  GHG emissions10 across our value chain. Our focus  on supplier engagement, sustainable design, the  CONTRAfluran Anesthetic Gas Capture system  and decreasing emissions from product transport  addresses the Scope 3 categories where we have  the largest impacts. See Value Chain Energy Usage  and GHG Emissions for detail. APPROACH AND PROGRESS Water is a critical natural resource for our products  and for the well-being of the communities where we  operate. Baxter’s Environmental, Health, Safety and  Sustainability (EHS&S) Policy outlines our commitment  to drive programs that will help us achieve our  environmental goals and reduce Baxter’s environmental  impacts, including those related to water use and  wastewater discharges. As part of our 2030 water management goal, we are  performing a comprehensive review of our manufacturing  sites to understand the local conditions and considerations  of each. We consider the physical, regulatory and  reputational risks associated with water management at  our sites, including external boundaries, water accounting,  wastewater discharge, compliance obligations and  impacts to our current water supply, among other  concerns, as we focus on opportunities to improve water  efficiency in our operations, protect watersheds and  provide access to clean water within local communities.  In 2022, we completed four water risk and resilience  assessments, representing 22% of Baxter’s total water  use, and performed eight wastewater compliance  evaluations. Additionally, we continued conducting  infrastructure assessments, which we began in 2021,  completing a total of eight assessments by the end of  2022. We also sent a survey to our manufacturing sites11  to obtain additional compliance-related data we will use  to evaluate risks related to critical water issues.  Water management:  In addition to analyzing the  impacts of water use across our business, we are focused  on implementing conservation and efficiency projects at  many of our manufacturing facilities. For example, in 2022,  our Cuernavaca, Mexico, facility implemented two water  recovery and reuse projects, resulting in a savings of  25,500 cubic meters of water annually.12, 13 In addition,   as the result of work in recent years to optimize its  operations, our Valtellina, Italy, facility has been able to  reduce water consumption, including a reduction of  167,000 cubic meters of water in 2022 compared with  2021. In 2022, we used approximately 15 million cubic  meters of water, a 0.5% increase compared with 2021.  We use the World Resources Institute Aqueduct Water  Risk Atlas version 3.0 to map and analyze current  and future risks associated with water stress at our  manufacturing sites with the most significant water use.14  Our 60 manufacturing sites with the most significant  water use represented 96% of our total water use in 2022.  Of these sites, 28 are located in medium-high, high and  extremely high water-stress areas. See detail.  Wastewater:  Wastewater discharged from Baxter  operations remains an important focus of our compliance  program. We take a proactive, systematic approach to  identifying, evaluating and managing wastewater issues.  In 2022, these activities included compliance assurance  assessments, permit compliance reviews and evaluations  by external consultants of wastewater treatment  operations to identify opportunities for improvement.  Achieve Carbon Neutrality for Direct  Operations by 2040  Implement Strategic Water Management Plans      	 	 	 	 	    Achieve carbon neutrality for our direct operations by 2040  and reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions 25% by 2030, aligned with a well-below  2⁰ Celsius science-based target.

We also continued infrastructure  assessments for selected manufacturing sites and surveyed our manufacturing sites to collect critical data.**                **The survey did not include former Hillrom manufacturing sites. 2030 Corporate  Responsibility Goals Cross-Cutting  Commitments Appendix From the Chairman, President and CEO Company Profile Corporate Responsibility Commitment ASSURANCE  STATEMENT ASSURANCE  STATEMENT  ===== PAGE 13 =====   13 2022 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT APPROACH AND PROGRESS Baxter drives sustainable practices in our global supply  chain and partners with high-performing, innovative  suppliers to deliver quality products to our customers  and value for our stakeholders. We prioritize high  standards in the areas of environment, labor and human  rights, ethics and sustainable procurement, alongside  factors of cost, quality and delivery.  In 2022, we continued our work to better understand the  impact of our supply chain and to increase engagement,  planning and related activities to reach our corporate  responsibility goal. To accelerate our efforts, we held  six training sessions, attended by 257 of our suppliers  (equivalent to 6% of the suppliers targeted by our 2030 goal).  Our Sustainable Procurement Steering Committee,  which oversees our efforts in this area, is chaired by our  Chief Procurement Officer and includes leaders from  our Supplier Quality, Finance and EHS&S teams. Managing procurement risks:  We are integrating our  supplier corporate responsibility strategy into our overall  supplier management processes and conduct periodic  assessments of key suppliers to evaluate cost, delivery,  quality and risk.  In 2022, we created a corporate responsibility risk profile  for applicable Baxter suppliers,15 including those we  integrated into our business as part of the Hillrom  acquisition. These profiles include in-depth corporate  responsibility risk mapping based on location, performance,  and goods and services provided. The profiles will help  us prioritize suppliers with the greatest corporate  responsibility-related risk factors for additional due  diligence, corrective action plans and/or on-site audits.   Supplier corporate responsibility audits:    We are increasing our ability to audit suppliers’  corporate responsibility management systems and  performance. To accomplish this, we are exploring  the development of internal auditing capabilities as  well as third-party collaborations. Expanding our  auditing scope will improve our understanding of  corporate responsibility activities and management  within Baxter's supplier base and help identify areas  for improvement. In 2023, we plan to begin conducting  these corporate responsibility audits for any suppliers  we identify as high risk based on supplier risk profiles  and supplier corporate responsibility survey scores.  Supplier corporate responsibility survey:    We collaborate with EcoVadis to conduct an annual  survey of our suppliers’ corporate responsibility  programs and performance in the areas of environment,  labor and human rights, ethics and sustainable  procurement. Participating suppliers can access  detailed scorecards with information about strengths,  benchmark comparisons and improvement areas. We  also leverage the EcoVadis system to create corrective  action plans for suppliers falling below our performance  standards and to determine when on-site audits will  be necessary, and we plan to include survey scores in  business reviews with strategic suppliers in the future. APPROACH AND PROGRESS We are working to identify all waste generation  sources at Baxter and prioritize our top waste  mitigation opportunities by the end of 2024. In  2022, we surveyed Baxter-controlled warehouses  to gather information about waste management  practices and we aligned our newly acquired Hillrom  facilities with our waste management metrics.  Sustainable design:  Through sustainable  design, we minimize environmental impact and  capture more value from the natural resources  used to manufacture, transport, use and recover  our products. To support these efforts, we require  an EHS&S assessment during the development  process for all new products.16   Materials use in products and packaging:   Because materials use is a key driver of Baxter’s  environmental footprint, we work to reduce  materials use in products without affecting  efficacy, and to avoid or minimize materials of  concern. Additionally, we reduce materials use in  packaging and explore opportunities to substitute  with environmentally preferable alternatives. In  2022, for example, we substituted paper leaflets  with 2D matrix codes for IV bags manufactured  for distribution in Spain, which is expected to save  nine metric tons of paper annually.17  Operations:  In 2022, Baxter produced 78,600 metric  tons of total waste (down 1.7% from 2021), 71,000  metric tons of nonhazardous waste (down 1.4%), and  7,600 metric tons of regulated waste (down 4%).18  In 2022, 78.2% of our total waste was diverted  from landfill, including 70.8% recycled and 7.4%  incinerated with energy recovery. Plastic scrap from manufacturing is our largest  waste stream. In 2022, several of our facilities,  including Cuernavaca, Mexico; Marsa, Malta; San  Vittore, Switzerland; and Valtellina, Italy,  implemented process improvements that reduced  plastic waste by 100 metric tons.19   Product distribution:  To conserve natural  resources and reduce waste during product  distribution, we recover pallets for reuse and  purchase second-hand pallets. In our Europe, Middle  East and Africa (EMEA) region, we recovered 27% of  the European pallets we shipped to customers for our  reuse and sold 17% to our carriers. Of the total pallets  we purchased in EMEA, 14% were secondhand.  Product end-of-life:  While Baxter’s 2030 waste  goal focuses on our integrated supply chain, product  end-of-life remains a priority for our company. We  have programs to facilitate recycling of disposable  products in select locations, and we service and  redeploy electromechanical devices for reuse. Implement Strategic Materials and  Waste Management Plans      	 	 	 	 	    Integrate Baxter’s sustainable procurement strategy across  90% of our supplier spend.*  *As measured by supplier commitment to Baxter’s Ethics & Compliance Standards and Baxter’s completion of corporate responsibility audits within our supply base. 	 	        In 2022, we confirmed commitment to Baxter’s Ethics & Compliance Standards for 51%  of our suppliers, by spend (through related affirmations made in the underlying supplier contracts). In addition,  we laid the foundation to begin conducting corporate responsibility audits or supplier surveys for any suppliers  we identify as high risk based on supplier risk profiles and supplier corporate responsibility survey scores. 2030 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY GOAL PERFORMANCE  2030 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY GOAL PERFORMANCE  	 	 	 	 	   Implement prioritized waste mitigation opportunities* in Baxter’s  integrated supply chain, from procurement to distribution.  *Identify prioritized waste generation sources by the end of 2024.

We aim to make a  meaningful difference in local communities and tackle  some of the world’s toughest health and other social  challenges through product donations and charitable  financial investments from Baxter and the Foundation. Product donations:  We manufacture products twice a  year specifically for donation to our trusted humanitarian  partners, Americares and Direct Relief, so they can rely  on having Baxter’s critically needed, long-dated products  year-round—not solely during emergency situations. We  also supported U.S. medical outreach teams that travel  overseas to provide charitable care to underserved  populations, and we continued to make chemotherapy  drugs available through our U.S. Patient Assistance  Program to support cancer patients who have financial  barriers to access and lack insurance or prescription drug  coverage. In 2022, we donated products valued at more  than $35 million.20 Corporate financial contributions:21  Our corporate  giving includes financial donations to increase access to  patient care through education and advocacy support. We  also support cultural institutions in the United States to  create meaningful engagement opportunities for local  employees and enhance business interests through  professional membership associations. Baxter International Foundation financial  contributions:  The Foundation partners with nonprofit  organizations worldwide to increase access to healthcare  for the underserved; bolster science, technology,  engineering and math (STEM) education to develop the  next generation of healthcare innovators; and promote  community resilience primarily through disaster relief and  diversity, equity and inclusion investments. In alignment with  its strategic pillars, the Foundation focuses on long-term  investments through its Signature Partnerships worldwide. The Foundation also awards merit-based scholarships to  our employees’ children and supports and amplifies the  giving and volunteer efforts of Baxter’s employees through  its Matching Gift and Dollars for Doers programs.  Disaster relief:  We make investments in disaster  preparedness, immediate response plans and long-term  recovery efforts in collaboration with our humanitarian  partners. In 2022, we provided cash and products for  Hurricane Fiona, Hurricane Ian and flooding in Kentucky,  among other natural disasters, and we provided  humanitarian aid for Ukraine.  See the Data Summary for full philanthropic giving data.  Learn more about how Baxter Gives Back to communities  worldwide. APPROACH AND PROGRESS At Baxter we aim for a zero-harm workplace. We  prioritize the elimination of major and high-frequency  injuries,22 complemented by ongoing digital analytics  and employee engagement, training and mentoring to  drive continual improvement. Baxter follows a management systems approach  guided by our global EHS&S requirements. We define  the responsibilities of corporate, regional and facility- level occupational health and safety professionals  and hold leaders accountable for achieving goals and  targets. In 2022, the EHS&S organization reported  employee safety performance to senior leadership and  manufacturing and supply chain management monthly.  EHS&S also communicates performance annually to  Baxter’s Board of Directors. During the year, we continued to engage our operational  workforce in hazard/near-miss identification and  immediate corrective actions where feasible. In addition,  we focused on best practices related to powered  industrial trucks (such as forklifts) and lock-out/tag-out  procedures for minor servicing to improve our practices  and reduce injuries for related processes. We continue  to target our most frequently occurring incidents:  ergonomics, slips/trips/falls and cuts/lacerations.  Focusing on high-hazard sources, we analyze our most  severe historical incidents with a cross-functional  team to identify root-cause trends, formulate mitigation  strategies and share knowledge across the organization.  We hold “stand down” meetings as a forum for  operational leaders to engage employees in frontline  education concerning specific risks.  Injuries and illnesses:  In 2022, Baxter’s total  recordable incident rate23 rose to 0.40, compared with  0.33 in 2021.24 Despite the increase, Baxter still ranked  in the top quartile. One major incident and 16 severe  incidents25 occurred at Baxter in 2022. As described  earlier, we continue to share lessons learned about  employee injury trends, implement actions to drive  improvement, and engage operational leaders in an  effort to reduce injury and illness rates and improve  workplace safety performance. BeWell@Baxter:  Through BeWell@Baxter, our  global employee health and wellness program, we  promote healthy lifestyles. In 2022, our Wellness Days  focused on topics such as mental health, financial  wellness, stress management, career wellness and  environmental wellness. In 2022, 30% of employees  participated in the Exercise Challenge and 27%  completed a Personal Wellness Profile.26 In addition,  92% of facilities worldwide took part in Healthy Eating  Month, an annual campaign focused on making  informed food choices and promoting the importance  of a balanced diet and exercise. See the Data Summary for health and wellness  metrics, as well as workplace safety data by region  and major incidents.

We  track the representation of women globally and  underrepresented minorities in the United States  at every career level across the employee life  cycle from hiring through exit. On a quarterly  basis, Baxter leaders review this anonymized and  aggregated data to understand the company’s  progress and identify potential opportunities to help  further advance diversity across the organization. While all forms of diversity at every career level  are important to Baxter, our 2030 goals focus on  women (globally) and ethnic minorities (United  States) in leadership roles27, 28 because they provide  the greatest opportunities for us to measure  meaningful change. We have robust, multiyear  data sets for these groups, as well as mechanisms  to continue gathering and verifying data moving  forward. See the Data Summary for additional  diversity data. We aim to achieve our diversity representation goals  by continuing our efforts to attract, retain and develop  diverse talent and foster an inclusive workplace.   	 	 	 	 	   Through hiring, promotion and retention, aspire to increase  representation of women in leadership roles globally to 40%.* *Assuming labor market conditions continue to support the goal. Leadership role is defined as director and above. (See endnote 28 for additional detail.)   	 	       As of Dec. 31, 2022, 35% of people in leadership roles at Baxter globally were  women, down from 36% in 2021.    2030 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY GOAL PERFORMANCE  2030 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY GOAL PERFORMANCE  	 	 	 	 	   Through hiring, promotion and retention, aspire to increase  representation of ethnic minorities in leadership roles in the United States to 25%.* *Assuming labor market conditions continue to support the goal. Leadership role is defined as director and above. (See endnotes 27 and 28 for additional detail.)  	 	       As of Dec. 31, 2022, 22% of people in leadership roles at Baxter in the United States  were ethnic minorities, down from 24% in 2021.   We believe the Hillrom acquisition likely  contributed to some decline in our  representation numbers, in 2022, due to the  addition of approximately 10,000 employees  with generally lower representation of gender  and ethnic diversity. Inclusive culture:  In addition to our  aspirational diversity representation goals,   we are equally focused on advancing an  inclusive culture where all people feel they  belong and can be their authentic selves.   We have metrics and reporting in place to  assess and share how we are doing in this  area (e.g., our Best Place to Work survey data).  This measurement and assessment provides  essential input that is critical to advancing our  DE&I strategy.

We  prioritize following legal requirements, being honest  and fair, encouraging questions and valuing discussion.  The integration of the Hillrom business has provided an  opportunity to combine best practices and update our  processes to represent the combined company. In 2022,  we also updated policies and procedures to proactively  ensure ongoing adherence to evolving global trade  regulations and sanctions. Companywide accountability:  Baxter has  compliance committees for each country or cluster of  countries where we operate, and we hold mandatory  meetings at least quarterly to facilitate discussion  among local leadership about key issues, challenges  and risks. We also have similar compliance committees  for some global functions, based on risk.  Training:  In 2022, we required the following ethics  and compliance training for employees:  •	 Annual Code of Conduct training (completed by 99%  of employees)  •	 Updated trade compliance training (relevant  functions globally) •	 Job-specific ethics and compliance courses,  covering Baxter’s Global Interactions Policy and  Third Party Program (relevant employees)  •	 Workshops/trainings on ethical interactions with the  medical community and government officials (Sales)  Baxter’s strict prohibition of off-label promotion  is included in our annual training to the Sales  organization. In addition, we provide training to all third  parties that undergo our due diligence process.  Third Party Program:  Our Third Party Program policy  outlines the standards and processes used to review,  retain and monitor new and existing third parties for  compliance with our anticorruption expectations. Compliance assessments:  Baxter completes  risk-based compliance assessments and audits each  year, which cover antibribery, anticorruption and trade  compliance, among other topics.  Compliance monitoring:  Baxter uses a data  analytics–based monitoring system to review  compliance risk metrics and facilitate forensic  monitoring procedures. Each year, we select  representative countries and global business units for  monitoring.1 This enables us to perform near-real-time  monitoring of metrics related to travel, entertainment,  interactions with healthcare professionals and  government officials, and corruption-related due  diligence for certain in-scope third parties.  Global Interactions Policy:  This policy defines the  principles and rules governing our interactions with  government officials and members of the medical  community, including the continued implementation  of anticorruption programs to help ensure that  these relationships and the related fair market value  payments are for necessary and genuine services.    Ethics and Compliance helpline:  Reports received  via the Ethics and Compliance helpline involving  allegations of misconduct are promptly triaged for  investigation. For the substantiated cases closed  in 2022, appropriate remediation was or is being  implemented where warranted. In substantiated cases  involving employee misconduct, employees received  appropriate disciplinary action based on the nature of  the misconduct and other relevant factors. Baxter is committed to respecting the privacy of our  employees, patients and customers and protecting  the security of our infrastructure and products. This  commitment is reinforced through executive oversight,  policies and standards, and mandatory employee training. Regulations and standards:  We monitor regulations  globally, including relevant developments and actions  related to the EU General Data Protection Regulation,  the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  (HIPAA), the California privacy law and similar laws  that are being enacted in other states, and other legal  developments in regions where we do business. In addition  to external regulations, we hold ourselves accountable to  our own rigorous internal policies and standards. Oversight:  Our Board of Directors (Board) Audit  Committee provides oversight for IT security matters  generally (including cybersecurity incidents), and the  Quality, Compliance and Technology Committee provides  oversight for product cybersecurity matters. Cybersecurity:  The Global IT Security Operations   team helps to protect Baxter against cyberattacks  using a range of defenses to secure our assets, reduce  detection time and improve recoverability:  •	 We conduct routine exercises with business  stakeholders and third-party responders to promote  awareness and improve processes.  •	 Post-incident review meetings and reports provide  insight into how we can update our response strategies.  •	 Our proactive, threat hunting process helps to protect  our systems against evolving security threats.  •	 We engage with external rating agencies that assess  Baxter’s cyber risk to improve our internal evaluations  and vulnerability management processes.    •	 Our policies and processes for asset management  ensure proper management of data on retired hardware.  To further strengthen cybersecurity across our network  and portfolio of products, Baxter became a Common  Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) Numbering Authority  in early 2022. In addition, Baxter is a member of the  Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center. Customer communication:  Our customers can  access our online Product Security summary to learn  about security vulnerabilities that might affect Baxter  products. In addition, Baxter has Brand Indicators for  Message Identification (BIMI), which adds an extra layer  of authentication to emails and displays our logo in  recipients’ inboxes, to demonstrate authenticity.  Training:  We continue to raise privacy and security  awareness with all Baxter users through annual  mandatory training2 and recurring reinforcement  through virtual events and updated materials. Our Third  Party Risk Management program includes assessment  and monitoring of security standards and control  procedures for critical external suppliers.

As  outlined in our Global Human Rights Policy, we respect  the human rights, dignity and diverse contributions of  all individuals. Fostering human rights takes many forms at Baxter  and is reflected in our policies and initiatives in areas  including workplace inclusion; employee safety; supply  chain labor practices; ethical conduct; access to  healthcare; and patient, employee and customer privacy. Protecting human rights  in our supply chain: Baxter’s suppliers must commit to respecting human  rights, either in accordance with our Global Human  Rights Policy or under their own similar policies. Any  suppliers with whom Baxter contracts must confirm they  agree to comply with our Supplier Quality and Ethics  and Compliance Standards for Baxter Suppliers and the  Baxter Code of Conduct.  Each year Baxter publishes a UK Modern Slavery Statement  and an Australia Modern Slavery Statement. We also have  position statements related to the California Transparency  in Supply Chains Act of 2010 and conflict minerals, and we  publish an annual Conflict Minerals Report.  We work to enhance our company’s culture of belonging and  to embed diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) across all  aspects of our business. We focus on four strategic pillars:  Workforce:  Increasing the diversity of our workforce  makes us a more agile and innovative company. This  begins with our Board of Directors and leadership teams,  who influence and inspire our desired culture and drive  greater representation throughout the organization. See  information regarding Board diversity in Baxter’s 2022  Proxy Statement.  Our hiring process includes an inclusive and expansive  candidate sourcing strategy, diverse interview panels, and  an aspirational goal of 50% diverse candidates on interview  slates, which we exceeded in 2022. Baxter also conducts  Workforce Diversity Reviews with company leaders, to help  ensure that employees from underrepresented groups3 are  not inadvertently overlooked for development, sponsorship,  succession, advancement and retention opportunities.  We offer mentoring opportunities to all employees, and our  Business Resource Groups (BRGs) offer a global mentoring  program designed to connect their diverse membership with  Baxter leaders. To support career growth for women and  underrepresented ethnic minorities, we partner with external  organizations to offer leadership development programs.  Workplace:  We embed DE&I across our workplace  through inclusive leadership, accountability measures and  engagement with employees who advocate for inclusion  throughout our company. Examples include:  •	 Global Inclusion Council: These executive leaders act  as DE&I champions and are responsible for driving  DE&I priorities companywide.  •	 BRGs: Nine employee-run affinity groups provide  forums for employees to develop skills, experience  cultural connections and support business initiatives. •	 Activating Change Today (ACT) Council: Chaired by our  CEO, this council supports our multiyear ACT initiative   Marketplace:  We strive to adopt inclusive product  design from concept to launch and enhance  engagement with diverse healthcare professionals,  patients, caregivers and other stakeholders. Our  efforts to tackle health disparities include sponsoring  community programs that improve patient access  to healthcare and reducing healthcare provider  biases, including promoting a more diverse pipeline  of healthcare professionals. In 2022, we hosted  educational events for employees worldwide to  enhance awareness around healthcare disparities  and promote equity in product design, development  and commercialization. Baxter also partners with  several organizations, including the Congressional  Black Caucus Foundation, the National Minority Quality  Forum and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to  advance successful lobbying and advocacy efforts in  support of health equity for underserved communities. to drive meaningful, sustainable change and address  racial injustice within the workplace and in the  communities and markets we serve globally. Baxter provides employees with training, tools and resources  to build cultural awareness and competence to engage  more authentically, and we require all employees to take a  self-guided e-learning module about unconscious bias.  One of the ways we work to achieve equity at Baxter is  through a total compensation philosophy that provides  market-competitive pay and benefits globally while  rewarding employees for strong individual and business  performance. We periodically assess our efforts through  pay audits and reviews.  Through our annual Best Place to Work survey, employees  rate Baxter’s workplace across multiple categories,  including inclusion. In 2022, employees indicated a strong  sense of belonging and a belief that diverse perspectives  are valued. We also conduct surveys to measure manager  effectiveness, including related to inclusive leadership. Communities:  Baxter works to advance racial justice and  equity in our communities by driving advocacy efforts in  partnership with community organizations. For example,  aligned with our ACT initiative, we have provided grants  to the American Diabetes Association, Thurgood Marshall  College Fund, NAACP and YWCA, among others. Baxter also develops mutually beneficial  relationships with small and diverse  suppliers as we strive to increase the diversity of our  supplier base. In 2022, we spent $598 million with small  businesses, $77 million with women-owned businesses  and $97 million with minority-owned businesses. A third- party review estimates that our spending with diverse  suppliers supported $659 million in economic output as  well as $126 million in employee income earned and more  than 1,500 jobs.4  From the Chairman, President and CEO Company Profile Corporate Responsibility Commitment 2030 Corporate  Responsibility Goals Cross-Cutting  Commitments Appendix ASSURANCE  STATEMENT ASSURANCE  STATEMENT  ===== PAGE 19 =====   19 2022 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Appendix: About This Report EXTERNAL REPORTING STANDARDS To develop our corporate responsibility reporting approach,  we have considered the disclosure frameworks and  guidance of leading sustainability standards and reporting  organizations, including the Global Reporting Initiative  (GRI), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board  (SASB), the United Nations Sustainable Development  Goals and third-party raters and rankers focused on  environmental, social and governance matters.

The following table is a summary of corporate responsibility risk profiling of 38,634 Baxter suppliers, based on 2022 analysis using  the EcoVadis IQ tool.*  BAXTER MANUFACTURING SITES IN LOCATIONS WITH WATER  STRESS RISK, 2022 (as determined in accordance with the World  Resources Institute Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas version 3.0)  See page 12 for additional detail.  * The performance categories presented in this table align with the EcoVadis methodology. “Advanced” indicates structured and proactive corporate responsibility (CR) approach; policies and tangible actions on major topics with significant CR  reporting. “Moderate” indicates structured and proactive CR approach; policies and tangible actions on major topics with basic CR reporting. “Partial” indicates no structured CR approach; few tangible actions on selected topics; certifications related  to sites and/or products are only partial. “Insufficient” indicates no engagements or tangible actions regarding CR. Data for 2020 reflect suppliers participating in Baxter’s supplier sustainability monitoring program, as of March 2, 2021. Data for 2021  reflect suppliers participating in Baxter’s supplier sustainability monitoring program, as of Jan. 31, 2022. Data for 2022 reflect suppliers participating in Baxter’s supplier sustainability monitoring program, as of January 31, 2023. In some cases,  segments do not add up to 100% due to rounding. * The performance of risk categories presented in this table aligns with the EcoVadis methodology. Risk levels are based on 1) inherent risk, which is the corporate responsibility  risk of a company based on its industry and country or EcoVadis rating, and 2) procurement risk, which is based on Baxter spend data. The category of Sustainable Procurement  does not add up to 100% because a subset of suppliers do not have a related scorecard with EcoVadis as they go through a qualification process. Percentages in the Overall row  do not add up to 100% due to rounding. Data in the Total Partners row do not add up to the total noted above because eight suppliers do not have a risk categorization.

Introduction and Objectives of Work Baxter International Inc. (Baxter) engaged Apex  Companies, LLC (Apex) to provide assurance of selected  sections of Baxter’s 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report. This Assurance  Statement applies to the Subject Matter included within the scope of work  described below. This information and its presentation in Baxter’s 2022 Corporate  Responsibility Report (“the Report”) are the sole responsibility of the  management of Baxter. Apex was not involved in the drafting of the  Report. Our sole responsibility was to provide independent assurance on  the accuracy of the Subject Matter. Baxter’s 2022 Corporate Responsibility  Report marks the 14th year for which we have provided assurance. Scope of Work The scope of our work was reasonable-level assurance of the following  information included within the Report for the period Jan. 1, 2022, to Dec.  31, 2022 (the “Subject Matter”). •	 Data and information included in the following sections of the Report: 	 >	Achieve Carbon Neutrality for Direct Operations by 2040 •	 Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions verification is documented under a  separate verification opinion declaration >	Implement Strategic Water Management Plans >	Implement Strategic Materials and Waste Management Plans >	Achieve Top Quartile Workplace Safety Performance •	 Related material in the Report Appendix, including: >	 Data Summary—Achieve Carbon Neutrality for Direct Operations by  2040; Implement Strategic Water Management Plans; Implement  Strategic Materials and Waste Management Plans; Environmental,  Health, Safety and Sustainability Governance and Additional  Disclosures; Achieve Top Quartile Workplace Safety Performance >	 Value Chain Energy Usage and GHG Emissions (Energy, Scope 1 and  Scope 2 GHG emissions) >	 Facilities with ISO 14001, ISO 45001, ISO 50001 and Green Building  Certifications >	 Additional Disclosures (Achieve Carbon Neutrality for Direct  Operations by 2040; Implement Strategic Water Management Plans) The scope of work also included limited-level assurance of the following  Subject Matter: •	 Data and information included in the following sections of the Report: 	 >	Achieve Carbon Neutrality for Direct Operations by 2040 (Scope 3 GHG 	 	 emissions) •	 Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions verification is documented under  a separate verification opinion declaration >	Supplier Diversity in the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion section >	Protecting Human Rights in Our Supply Chain in the Human Rights  section >	Advance Sustainable Procurement •	 Related material in the Report Appendix:	 >	 Data Summary—Supplier Diversity and Advance Sustainable  Procurement >	 Value Chain Energy Usage and GHG Emissions—Scope 3 emissions >	 Additional Disclosures (Advance Sustainable Procurement) Our assurance does not extend to any other information included in the Report. Reporting Boundaries The following are the boundaries Baxter used for reporting  sustainability data: •	 Operational control •	 Worldwide Reporting Criteria The Subject Matter needs to be read and understood together with  Baxter’s internal reporting requirements for facility environmental,  health, safety and sustainability performance, as well as information  described in the text, appendix, data tables and notes of the Report. Limitations and Exclusions Excluded from the scope of our work is any verification of information  relating to: •	 Activities outside the defined assurance period, which is the 2022  calendar year •	 Positional statements (expressions of opinion, belief, aim or future  intention) by Baxter and statements of future commitment •	 Any financial data previously audited by an external third party •	 Data and information included in sections of the Report not listed  in the scope of work above This assurance engagement relies on a risk-based selected sample  of sustainability data and the associated limitations that this entails.  This independent statement should not be relied upon to detect all  errors, omissions or misstatements that may exist. Responsibilities The preparation and presentation of the Subject Matter in the Report  are the sole responsibility of the management of Baxter. Apex was  not involved in the drafting of the Report or of the Reporting Criteria.  Our responsibilities were to: •	 Provide independent assurance about whether the Subject Matter   has been prepared in accordance with the Reporting Criteria •	 Form an independent conclusion based on the assurance  procedures performed and evidence obtained •	 Report our conclusions to the stakeholders of Baxter Assessment Standards We performed our work in accordance with Apex’s standard  procedures and guidelines for external Assurance of Sustainability  Reports and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements  (ISAE) 3000 Revised, Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or  Reviews of Historical Financial Information (effective for assurance  reports dated on or after Dec. 15, 2015), issued by the International  Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. A materiality threshold of  ±5% was set for the assurance process. The work was planned and carried out to provide reasonable, rather  than absolute, assurance of the Subject Matter except for the Scope  3 GHG emissions and Product Distribution in the Achieve Carbon  Neutrality for Direct Operations by 2040 section; Protecting Human  Rights in Our Supply Chain in the Human Rights section; Supplier  Diversity in the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion section; and the  Advance Sustainable Procurement section, which was carried out  to provide limited assurance. We believe that our work provides an  appropriate basis for our conclusions. Summary of Work Performed As part of our independent verification, our work included: •	Assessing the appropriateness of the Reporting Criteria for the  Subject Matter •	Conducting interviews with relevant Baxter personnel who are  responsible for collecting and reporting performance data and  other Subject Matter •	Reviewing documentary evidence provided by Baxter •	Reviewing Baxter’s systems for quantitative data aggregation  and analysis during meetings with personnel in Baxter’s  Deerfield and Round Lake, Illinois, offices •	Assessing assumptions made and the data scope and reporting  boundaries. Auditing consolidated performance data, including  review of a sample of data-to-source documentation •	Auditing a selection of the Subject Matter to the corresponding  source documentation •	Auditing performance data and processes during in-person  audits of operating sites located in Alliston, Ontario (remote);  Amata City, Thailand (remote); Guayama, Puerto Rico; Irvine,  California; Lessines, Belgium; Round Lake, Illinois; and São  Paolo, Brazil (remote) •	Assessing the disclosure and presentation of the Subject Matter  with emphasis on principles of accuracy, accessibility, balance,  clarity, comparability, reliability and timeliness and to ensure  consistency with the Reporting Criteria Conclusion On the basis of our methodology and the activities described  above, it is our opinion that the Subject Matter within assured  sections including: Achieve Carbon Neutrality for Direct  Operations by 2040; Implement Strategic Materials and Waste  Management Plans; Implement Strategic Water Management  Plans; and Achieve Top Quartile Workplace Safety Performance  sections of the Report; the Environmental, Health, Safety and  Sustainability Governance and Additional Disclosures section  of the Data Summary; and other related material in the Report  Appendix: •	Is presented in accordance with the Reporting Criteria and is, in  all material respects, fairly stated •	Is presented in a clear, understandable and accessible manner •	Allows readers to form a balanced opinion of Baxter’s activities  and performance during calendar year 2022 Also, on the basis of our methodology and the activities described  above: •	 Nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the data and  information in the following sections: Scope 3 GHG emissions  in the Achieve Carbon Neutrality for Direct Operations by 2040  section; Protecting Human Rights in Our Supply Chain in the  Human Rights section; Supplier Diversity in the Diversity, Equity  and Inclusion section and the Advance Sustainable Procurement  section of the Report are inaccurate or that the information is not  fairly stated. •	 It is also our opinion that Baxter has established appropriate  systems for the collection, aggregation, analysis and review of  the Subject Matter. JOHN A. ROHDE  Apex Companies, LLC  Lakewood, Colorado May 25, 2023 TREVOR DONAGHU  Apex Companies, LLC  Pleasant Hill, California Additional Commentary During the assurance process, Apex observed that Baxter  continues to improve its overall data collection and reporting  processes at the site and corporate level. Opportunities for  improving facility-level data collection, reporting and procedural  documentation at some facilities were noted. In addition, there are  opportunities for improvements to processes for compilation of  corporate environmental data. We recommend that Baxter corporate personnel continue  to support individual facility personnel with collection and  consolidation of site-specific metrics that are included in reporting.

COMPANY PROFILE 1	 Unless stated otherwise, the 2022 content and data in this report reflect the integration of the Hillrom business, which we acquired in December 2021. As we continue  the integration of Hillrom into our operations, we are further enhancing our ability to assess, disclose and manage the impacts of the legacy Hillrom operation. We are  continuing to evaluate and refine our corporate responsibility strategy and initiatives following the acquisition, and we may make changes to our existing strategies,  initiatives, methodologies, analysis and data as disclosed in this report.  CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY COMMITMENT 1	 Our approach to the disclosures included in this report differs from our approach to the disclosures we include in other reports, including our filings with the SEC. For  example, in this report, we are not using the terms “material” and “materiality” as defined for the purposes of financial and SEC reporting in the United States. Instead,  the terms refer to environmental, social and economic topics that may be significant to our stakeholders and to the company, which we use to inform our corporate  responsibility strategy, priorities and goals, and reporting. The topics in this table are listed in alphabetical order, grouped by Priority ESG Topics and Other Material ESG  Topics. The listing within each category does not reflect the presumed importance or “materiality” of any particular topic to Baxter or our stakeholders. 2030 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY GOALS Reach More Underserved Kidney Patients 1	 Available in 22 languages and 39 countries. 2	 As of Dec. 31, 2022, there were a total of 50 PD Ambassadors, with 41 representing developing countries. Of the 30 countries with PD Ambassadors, 26 were developing countries. 3	 Including Algeria, Bahrain, Brazil, China, Colombia, Egypt, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Morocco, Oman, Poland, Slovenia, South Africa, Sudan, Tunisia, Turkey and UAE. Consistently Improve Manufacturing Capabilities 4	 Parametric release is an innovative sterile product release program based on demonstrated control of validated manufacturing processes. Through this program, we can  get products to patients quickly, without sacrificing quality. Achieve Carbon Neutrality for Direct Operations by 2040 5	 Scope 1 emissions are direct GHG emissions from sources we own or control, such as on-site fuel combustion. Scope 2 emissions are indirect GHG emissions associated with  purchased electricity and steam for owned/controlled facilities. Baxter’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions have been verified by a third party to a reasonable assurance level  (see verification statement). The market-based method is used for Scope 2 unless otherwise stated. See Value Chain Energy Usage and GHG Emissions for additional detail. 6	 This includes electricity, fuel and purchased steam consumed by Baxter-managed and Baxter-operated facilities; it excludes energy related to company-operated vehicles. 7	 Estimated energy and financial savings as well as GHG emissions avoidance include savings from 2021 projects that carried over into 2022 in the 12 months following  project implementation. 8	 In 2022, biomass fuel for boilers at two of our locations (one in the United States and one in Italy) accounted for 7.9%, and the renewable energy component of our  purchased electricity and renewable energy certificates together represented 22.5%. On-site geothermal, solar photovoltaic and solar hot water systems also contributed  a small amount. During the year, emissions from the Baxter operated biomass boilers equaled 152,000 metric tons CO2. In accordance with the GHG Protocol, these  are not included in reported Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. However, also in accordance with the GHG Protocol, we include CO2e emissions from the CH4 and N2O  components of biomass combustion in our reported Scope 1 emissions.  9	 Estimated energy savings as well as GHG emissions avoidance are calculated for the 12 months following project implementation. 10	 Baxter’s Scope 3 emissions relate to activities within the company’s value chain, but outside of our direct control. These emissions are based on various assumptions and  estimates and are verified by a third party to a limited assurance level (see verification statement). Implement Strategic Water Management Plans 11	 The survey did not include former Hillrom manufacturing sites.  12	 One cubic meter equals 1,000 liters or 264 gallons. 13	 The savings described are calculated on an annualized basis (12 months from each project completion date), though savings should continue beyond one year. 14	 The WRI water tool defines baseline water stress as total annual water withdrawals (municipal, industrial and agricultural) expressed as a percentage of total annual  available flow. Higher values indicate more competition among users. 	 Low:  Less than 10% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually. 	 Low-Med:  Between 10 and 20% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually. 	 Med-High:  Between 20 and 40% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually. 	 High:  Between 40 and 80% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually. 	 Extremely High:  More than 80% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually. Advance Sustainable Procurement 15	 Applicable suppliers are those that have a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number and with which we have historical spend. Implement Strategic Materials and Waste Management Plans 16	 The product portfolio Baxter acquired as part of the Hillrom integration was not included in this assessment process during 2022.  17	 Savings are calculated on an annualized basis (12 months from each project completion date), though savings should continue beyond one year. 18	 Baxter policies require facilities to dispose of all hazardous or other regulated waste at disposal sites that Baxter has inspected or from which the company has  otherwise received sufficient assurance of acceptable performance.  19	 Savings for Cuernavaca, Mexico; San Vittore, Switzerland; and Valtellina, Italy, are from 2022. Savings for Marsa, Malta, are calculated for 12 months following project  implementation (beginning in 2022 and ending in 2023).  Appendix: Endnotes 2030 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY GOALS (CONTINUED) Invest in Underserved Communities Globally 20	 Baxter donates a broad portfolio of medical products, supplies and therapies for acute and chronic conditions. The valuation of these donated products originating  in the United States is reported by recipient nonprofit partners at wholesale acquisition cost (WAC). Value of donated products originating outside the United  States is reported by recipient partners at fair market value (FMV) for the country where the products are sourced. Value of medical devices and equipment is  reported at list price where products are sourced.  21	 Baxter's Global Interactions Policy provides guidance for corporate charitable giving to help ensure compliance with the law and with Baxter policy. We have  local Contributions Management Committees in select countries, clusters of countries or regions. Where they exist, those local committees have decision- making authority for contribution requests from educational institutions, not-for-profit or charitable healthcare organizations, and patient organizations. The  Baxter International Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Baxter International Inc., is a separate legal entity governed by its own board of directors and distinct  grantmaking guidelines that govern its charitable contributions to nonprofit organizations. Achieve Top Quartile Workplace Safety Performance 22	 Injuries Baxter is targeting to reduce in the near term include ergonomics, slips/trips/falls, and cuts/lacerations. 23	 Work-related injuries or illnesses requiring medical attention beyond first aid, including cases with days lost. All rates based on 100 full-time employees  working one year, which equals 200,000 work hours. For tracking purposes, Baxter follows U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration recordkeeping  requirements worldwide. Thus, in cases where an injury occurs and conflicting medical opinions arise as to the number of days away and/or restricted days  that should be recorded, we record on the basis of the most authoritative physician’s opinion. We include occupational diseases and illnesses, such as hearing  loss and ergonomic disorders, within our broader categories of cases, but do not track or report those items separately. Due to privacy regulations in our  Europe, Middle East and Africa region, we do not classify or report injuries by gender. Supervised contracted employees are included in the injury statistics  reported and are not tracked separately. Independent contractors are not included in Baxter’s injury data, because they are supervised by other organizations. 24	 Rates include COVID-19 cases. Public health guidance varies around the world concerning isolation and quarantine days for COVID-19. Probable work-related  COVID-19 cases average 10 days lost per CDC guidance and account for days away from work due to the illness. 25	 Major incidents are defined as those that result in death of a Baxter employee, contractor or visitor associated with work being performed at a Baxter facility, or  directly caused by visiting a Baxter facility, or associated with work or travel activities while a Baxter employee is away on company business. Severe incidents are  defined as those that result in amputations, debilitating injuries that result in permanent loss of use of a body part or other disease to the human body, severe burns,  severe fractures (overnight hospitalization or surgery, major leg or arm bones, multiple fractures to hand or foot, fracture of skull), as well as reportable exposure  events. Recordable and lost time incidents which result in hospitalization with medical treatment are also classified as severe incidents, regardless of injury type.  26	 Each year, profiles untouched for the previous three years are removed from the active database. Increase Representation of Women and Ethnic Minorities in Leadership Roles 27	 “Ethnic minorities,” within the context of our 2030 goal, refers to the United States EEO Categories, which include Black/African American, Latino/Hispanic, Asian  American, Native American and two or more races. 28	 Our 2030 goals related to increasing the representation of women and ethnic minorities in leadership roles are based on assumptions about labor market conditions.  “Labor market conditions” refers to the availability of talent in the marketplace in the communities where we operate and serve, and specifically looks at census data,  as well as our internal pipeline. These labor market conditions can change over time so we will continue to monitor and adjust our goals as needed. CROSS-CUTTING COMMITMENTS Ethics and Compliance  1	 In 2022, this included Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, France, India, Italy, South Korea, Thailand and our U.S. Advanced Surgery business. Privacy and Data Protection  2	 Training is applied according to valid Baxter email. Employees without a Baxter email address, such as those in manufacturing, do not participate. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion  3	 Underrepresented groups: employee populations that may be inadequately represented and disproportionately lower than in the general population (e.g., gender,  race/ethnicity, disability, LGBTQ+, generation, veteran status). 4	 Jan. 1, 2022, through Dec. 31, 2022. “Economic output” includes revenues earned by suppliers and businesses in the company’s supply chain and their communities.  Data does not include economic impacts in Puerto Rico. DATA SUMMARY 1	 Some metrics in this Data Summary relate to the company's 2030 Corporate Responsibility Goals. Other metrics relate to other ESG topics. 2	 Differences compared with data on FDA websites may be due to timeframe (the date Baxter takes an action may differ from the date FDA classifies that action),  definition of “recall” (FDA data includes actions taken even if the product is not removed or corrected), and classification by product group vs. product code (FDA  counts each impacted product code within a product family as a distinct recall). 3	 Product Recall Rate is defined as the number of unique product codes corrected or removed from the market per total Baxter-owned unique product codes sold globally. 4	 As of 2022, Baxter had 75 FDA-registered establishments available for inspection. 5	 The regional breakdown of the data included in this section reflects the structure of the Environmental, Health, Safety and Sustainability (EHS&S) organization and the  categorization of data in the EHS&S global information management system through 2022. Some data for 2020 and 2021 are updated from data reported in the Baxter  2021 Corporate Responsibility Report to reflect the Hillrom acquisition, to combine the segments North America and Latin America into the segment Americas, to  improve accuracy and in the case of GHG emissions, to reflect updated GHG emission factors. Some totals vary from sum of items in category, due to rounding. 6	 Excludes energy consumption associated with Baxter-operated mobile sources and renewable electricity generated on-site. 7	 2022 data for this metric reflects the integration of the Hillrom business, which Baxter acquired in December 2021. Data for 2020 and 2021 are not included, due  to lack of comparability. 8	 Excludes energy consumption associated with Baxter-operated mobile sources. From the Chairman, President and CEO Company Profile Corporate Responsibility Commitment 2030 Corporate  Responsibility Goals Cross-Cutting  Commitments Appendix  ===== PAGE 36 =====   36 2022 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Appendix: Endnotes (continued) DATA SUMMARY (CONTINUED) 9	 Legacy Hillrom sites are excluded.  10	 In 2020 and 2021, we were unable to perform on-site energy assessments due to COVID-19–related travel restrictions. 11	 In some cases, segments do not add up to 100% due to rounding. Data may differ slightly from the totals stated in the Baxter Operations Total line of the Value Chain  Energy Usage and GHG Emissions table due to rounding.  12	 Number includes Scope 3 emissions plus Scope 1 emissions for product transport. Some totals vary from sum of items in category, due to rounding.  13	 “Water usage” aligns with the definition of “water withdrawal” in GRI 303: Water and Effluents 2018: “Sum of all water drawn from surface water, groundwater,  seawater, or a third party for any use over the course of the reporting period.”  14	 Water usage from Baxter’s 60 manufacturing sites with the most significant water use, representing 96% of the company’s total annual water usage. The WRI water tool  defines baseline water stress as the total annual water withdrawals (municipal, industrial and agricultural) expressed as a percentage of the total annual available flow.  Higher values indicate more competition among users.  	 Low:  Less than 10% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually.   	 Low-Med:  Between 10 and 20% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually.  	 Med-High:  Between 20 and 40% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually.  	 High:  Between 40 and 80% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually.  	 Extremely High:  More than 80% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually. 15	 Estimated total water pollutant levels for treated wastewater discharged directly into waterways. Data do not include one facility that operates zero-discharge systems in  accordance with local regulatory requirements. BOD5 refers to five-day biological oxygen demand; COD refers to chemical oxygen demand; TSS refers to total suspended solids.  When actual performance data were not available, estimates are based on performance at similar facilities or on other measured performance indicators.  16	 Fiscal year basis (Oct. 1 through Sept. 30 of the year noted). 17	 Excludes waste associated with U.S. Renal Home Care operations, since patients dispose of unused product rather than returning it to Baxter for disposal. Also excludes  construction and demolition debris, remediation waste, wastewater treatment sludge and discarded manufacturing and process-related machinery or equipment. Removing  these waste categories from the company total allows for more consistent evaluation of facility performance and trends over time. 18	 Excludes production by-products reused on-site, construction and demolition debris, wastewater treatment and discarded manufacturing and process-related machinery or  equipment. Includes discarded/returned products (such as intravenous solution, dextrose solution, etc.) that are nonhazardous in nature but may be classified as regulated in  some countries. Excludes waste associated with U.S. Renal Home Care operations, since patients dispose of unused product rather than returning it to Baxter for disposal. 19	 Incineration with energy recovery is considered recycling. 20	 Excludes waste recycled on-site, remediation waste, construction and demolition debris, and wastewater treatment sludge. Includes certain waste streams (such as waste  oils, batteries, fluorescent lamps, light ballasts and asbestos) not classified as regulated in some locations.  21	 In compliance with the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive. Data excludes Hillrom.  22	 During 2020, PVC collection through our program in New Zealand was on hold due to COVID-19. During 2021, PVC Collected for Recycling and Aluminum Bottles Recycled data  for Australia also includes New Zealand. In Australia and New Zealand, Baxter's Home Patients PD Recycling Program was suspended in some locations during 2020 due to  COVID-19, and re-instated during 2022. Some other data in this section are not available for 2021 due to different presentation in past reports.  23	 Values correspond to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) Program data reported for reporting 2020 and 2021. It includes facilities in the  continental United States and Puerto Rico only. Data for 2022 are not available as of report publication date.  24	 Includes air emissions associated with on-site energy generation. Emission factors from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency publication “Compilation of Air Pollutant  Emission Factors,” AP-42, Fifth Edition, Volume 1: “Stationary Point and Area Sources.”  25	 For the purpose of this calculation, manufacturing includes pharmaceutical locations; and our sites in Sondalo and Grosotto, Italy, and Castlebar and Swinford, Ireland, are  counted separately. Outside of manufacturing locations, the balance of 17 ISO certified sites also includes compounding (6), offices (5), and planning and fulfillment (6). 26	 Americas includes the United States (with Puerto Rico), Canada and Latin America. 27	 “Professional” includes individual contributors. 28	 “Other” includes American Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander and two or more races. 29	 In some cases, segments do not add up to total due to rounding. 30	 This breakdown was not calculated prior to 2021. 31	 Includes product donations as well as Patient Assistance Programs. Variations in Baxter’s annual product donations are due to fluctuations in community needs, the need  and volume of disaster relief response, the regulatory environment, product availability, manufacturing processes and changes in product mix and marketing. We identify  opportunities to donate and respond to community and humanitarian aid partner requests as appropriate. Value of products donated (provided at no cost) is provided by  partners based on wholesale acquisition cost at the time of donation. This number may be greater or less than the value of Baxter products distributed during the year by  our relief partners. See Invest in Underserved Communities Globally. 32	 Contributions to U.S.-based 501(c)(3) organizations for programs within and outside of the United States.   33	 Based on hourly rates of $28.54 per volunteer hour for 2020, $29.95 per volunteer hour for 2021, and $31.80 per volunteer hour for 2022 (as of April 2023), as estimated  by Independent Sector; volunteer hours are self-reported by Baxter employees.   34	 The regional breakdown of the data included in this section reflects the structure of the Environmental, Health, Safety and Sustainability (EHS&S) organization and the  categorization of data in the EHS&S global information management system through 2022. Some data for 2020 and 2021 are updated from data reported in the Baxter  2021 Corporate Responsibility Report, to combine the segments North America and Latin America into the segment Americas. 35	 Work-related injuries or illnesses requiring medical attention beyond first aid, including cases with days lost. All rates based on 100 full-time employees working one year,  which equals 200,000 work hours. For tracking purposes, Baxter follows U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration recordkeeping requirements worldwide. Thus,  in cases where an injury occurs and conflicting medical opinions arise as to the number of days away and/or restricted days that should be recorded, we record on the basis  of the most authoritative physician’s opinion. We include occupational diseases and illnesses, such as hearing loss and ergonomic disorders, within our broader categories  of cases, but do not track or report those items separately. Due to privacy regulations in our Europe, Middle East and Africa region, we do not classify or report injuries by  gender. Supervised contracted employees are included in the injury statistics reported below and are not tracked separately. Independent contractors are not included in  Baxter’s injury data, because they are supervised by other organizations.   36	 Work-related injuries or illnesses that cause an employee to lose at least one full day after the date of the incident.   37	 The number of days lost (including weekends and holidays) recommended by the most authoritative physician’s opinion due to work-related injuries or illnesses. We do not  count the date of injury and date of return to full duty as lost days.   38	 The number of days recommended by the most authoritative physician’s opinion that an employee or supervised contractor is unable to work full duty (including weekends and  holidays) due to a work-related injury or illness. We do not count the date of injury and date of return to full duty as restricted days.   39	 Each year, profiles untouched for the previous three years are removed from the active database.  40	 Where smoke-free status is allowed by law. 41	 Data include vaccinations given September of the year noted through January of the following year, aligned with the typical flu season for North America. 42	 2020 Board of Directors diversity data are as of the end of 2020. 2021 data are as of June 27, 2022. 2022 data are as of June 23, 2023. 43	 Scores indicate the percentage of survey participants who responded favorably to statements related to each of the items listed. Baxter did not administer a Best Place to  Work survey in 2020 due to impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data for 2022 reflect the acquisition of Hillrom.   DATA SUMMARY (CONTINUED) 44	 New item on Best Place to Work survey in 2022, included in the overall Inclusion index. 45	 United States and Puerto Rico. Data for 2020 are fiscal year basis (Oct. 1 through Sept. 30 of the year noted). Data for 2021 and 2022 are calendar year. Accounts  payable data are sent to a third party, which categorizes spending. HUBZone is a U.S. Small Business Administration program for small companies that operate  and employ people in Historically Underutilized Business Zones. Spending with suppliers that qualify for more than one category may be included in the totals for  each of the relevant categories.  46	 Data for 2020 and 2021 include United States and Puerto Rico. Data for 2022 includes United States. 2020 data are October 1, 2019, through September 30, 2020. 2021  and 2022 data are calendar year. “Economic output” includes revenues earned by suppliers and businesses in the company’s supply chain and their communities.  “Indirect” includes impacts at the businesses from which suppliers (and their suppliers) purchase goods and services. “Induced” includes impacts generated in the  communities of the suppliers’ employees associated with purchases made by these employees and jobs supported through those purchases. 47	 “Professional” includes individual contributors.  48	 “Technical/Clerical” includes employees in operational and administrative/clerical roles.  49	 Americas includes the United States (with Puerto Rico), Canada and Latin America. 50	 Scores indicate the percentage of survey participants who responded favorably to statements related to each of the categories listed. Baxter did not administer a Best  Place to Work survey in 2020 due to impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data for 2022 reflect the acquisition of Hillrom. 51	 These data do not represent all employee training and development but do capture a large portion of training for most employees.     VALUE CHAIN ENERGY USAGE AND GHG EMISSIONS 1	 Baxter used the World Resources Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development Greenhouse Gas Protocol to calculate emissions data from  fossil fuel use. We used country electricity emission factors published by the International Energy Agency and AIB (for residual mixes), and the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) E-Grid U.S. and Canada NIR regional electricity emission factors to calculate GHG emissions related to electricity consumption. 2	 Apex Companies, LLC verified to a reasonable level Baxter’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions. Apex Companies, LLC also verified to a limited level Baxter’s  methodology for determining Scope 3 GHG emissions. 3	 Data for 2020 and 2021 are updated from data reported in the Baxter 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report to include operations that were previously part of Hillrom. Some  data are also updated for accuracy and to reflect updated GHG emission factors.  4	 We used the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition to determine GHG emissions associated with using biomass  fuel, principally wood/wood waste, as a boiler fuel at two Baxter locations. These emissions were calculated as 167,000, 169,000 and 152,000 metric tons CO2 in 2020,  2021 and 2022, respectively. CO2e emissions from CH4 and N2O components of biomass combustion are included in reported Scope 1 emissions.  5	 Baxter used the Greenhouse Gas Protocol to calculate GHG emissions associated with reported fuel usage by company-managed sales and distribution fleet vehicles  and other vehicles. We estimated fuel usage for international sales vehicles based on regional sales information. 6	 Refrigerant emissions represent reported CFC, HCFC and HFC refrigerant losses by each Baxter location. We calculated associated GHG emissions using emission  factors for each reported refrigerant. 7	 Includes the purchase of electricity generated from 100% certified renewable electricity (Belgium, Brazil, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,  UK and United States).  8	 Estimated based on global expenditures by category and emission factors from Table 13—Indirect emissions from the supply chain, UK Government Department for  Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, 2012 (updated 2019). We updated the methodology for this report; in previous reports we estimated based on an environmentally  extended input-output model from an independent third party and Baxter’s revenue and sector of operation. 9	 Estimated based on capital expenditures and the machinery and equipment emission factor from Table 13—Indirect emissions from the Supply Chain, UK  Government Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, 2012 (updated 2019).  10	 Estimated based on Baxter’s actual yearly energy usage by energy type and GHG emission factors for each energy type per GaBi life cycle assessment software. 11	 Estimated based on shipment of products to our customers using the EcoTransIT World Software that is compliant with the GHG Protocol and the Global Logistics  Emissions Council Framework. 12	 Estimated emissions for wastewater treatment by municipalities and off-site waste recycling and disposal based on Baxter’s waste generation by type, UK  Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting and the U.S. EPA WARM model.  13	 Estimated based on domestic and international air mileage, rental vehicle CO2e emissions or mileage, hotel room stays provided by Baxter’s global travel providers and  personal vehicle mileage. Emission factors from UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting, U.S. EPA, and Carbonfund.org Business Travel Calculator. 14	 Estimated based on the number of Baxter employees by country and statistics on commuting time and transport mode split into public transport, passenger cars, taxi  and motorcycle and walking or bicycling. Emission factors for each mode were obtained from Defra.  15	 Emissions associated with upstream leased assets are included in Baxter’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions. 16	 Estimated based on previous Baxter product LCAs as well as the company’s revenue by product type. Category 1 emissions were extrapolated to other categories  depending on the product type. 17	 Estimated based on revenue from Baxter’s contract services business and the basic pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations emission factor  from Table 13–Indirect emissions from the supply chain, Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, 2012 (updated 2019). Multiplied by 10%—assuming final  packaging is 10% of pharma product footprint. 18	 Estimated based on production quantities and global warming potential information for certain types of products. Emissions for certain other products estimated based on  previous Baxter product LCAs as well as the company’s revenue by product type. Category 1 emissions were extrapolated to other categories depending on the product type. 19	 Totals do not include CO2 emissions from Baxter-owned wood-fired boilers. See endnote 4 above for detail.

By adding the talent and capabilities of medical  technology leader Hillrom, we are creating new  opportunities to expand the reach of our combined  portfolio across sites of care and global geographies,  as well as sparking new potential to make a  difference for patients and their clinicians through  our rapidly growing connected care capabilities. The strength of the Baxter–Hillrom combination is  rooted in the values that our teams bring together,  starting with our shared dedication to saving and  sustaining lives and emphasis on responsible  corporate citizenship. These twin commitments were  much in evidence across Baxter throughout 2021, as  the healthcare landscape continued to be dominated  by the devastating impact of COVID-19. Baxter’s medically essential products have placed us  squarely on the front lines of this battle from the  start. Our impact in this space was further amplified  in 2021, as we partnered in the manufacture of  multiple COVID-19 vaccines on a contract basis. The  pandemic also remained a key focus of our philan- thropic efforts, as Baxter and the Baxter International  Foundation supported a range of institutions and  communities in need. As ever, we honor the first  responders, clinicians and others throughout the  global healthcare ecosystem who give of their hearts  and expertise in this continuing fight. In July 2021, Baxter launched our 2030 Corporate  Responsibility Commitment and Goals, a decade-spanning  framework to create lasting social, environmental and  economic value across three critical pillars: Empower  Our Patients, Protect Our Planet, and Champion Our  People and Communities. Each has a set of clearly  stated initiatives, financial support and governance  measures to ensure progress and accountability.  You can find many noteworthy highlights of our 2021  efforts in the pages that follow. To spotlight just a few,  Baxter: •	 Invested approximately $9 million to implement  nearly 200 energy conservation projects across our  manufacturing sites globally. We estimate that  these projects will save 33,800 megawatt hours of  energy and avoid 8,800 metric tons carbon dioxide  equivalent of greenhouse gas emissions annually. •	 Reduced our water use by 7.7% in water-stressed  areas and reduced waste generation by 9%,  compared with 2020 and indexed to revenue. •	 Continued to advance ACT: Activating Change Today,  our multidimensional effort to promote racial  justice, by investing in scholarship, community  engagement and healthcare equity programs, and  the attraction and development of diverse talent. •	 Assessed our ability to report using the Task Force  on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)  framework.  •	 Heightened our philanthropic investments in  underserved communities to $52 million in   total charitable giving by Baxter and the Baxter  International Foundation. Thanks to the focus and determination of our  colleagues globally, we continue to be cited routinely  as a corporate responsibility leader. Among recent  recognition, Baxter ranked in the Top 10 of  Newsweek’s 2021 list of America’s Most Responsible  Companies. We are also proud to be included on the  S&P Global’s Dow Jones Sustainability Indices  (DJSI), including both DJSI World and DJSI North  America, each year since their inception (1999 and  2005, respectively). As of this writing, the devastating war in Ukraine is  having a tragic human cost; yet the compassion of  Baxter employees is again evident in our unrelenting  drive to make a difference when crisis strikes. Baxter  is now engaged in a multitiered humanitarian  response, including, to date, more than $3.5 million  in product donations as well as nearly $1 million in  direct financial aid—a cash total reflecting, in part,  the incredible personal generosity of our employees  as matched by the Baxter International Foundation. Regardless of the challenges and uncertainties that  inevitably lie ahead, the Baxter team is committed to  doing business the right way and in line with our  environmental, social and governance priorities.   I salute our Baxter employees around the world,  whose passion powers our performance as a  responsible corporate citizen. JOSÉ (JOE) E. ALMEIDA   |   Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer  ===== PAGE 4 ===== Introduction Baxter 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report   4 2030 Corporate  Responsibility Goals Corporate Responsibility Commitment Empower   Our Patients Protect   Our Planet Appendix Champion Our People  and Communities Cross-Cutting  Commitments Company Profile Every day, millions of patients, caregivers and health- care providers rely on Baxter’s leading portfolio of  diagnostic, critical care, kidney care, nutrition, hospital  and surgical products used across patient homes,  hospitals, physician offices and other sites of care. For  90 years, we’ve been operating at the intersection  where vital innovations that save and sustain lives meet  the healthcare providers who make it happen. Our  corporate responsibility commitment is fundamental  to our ability to deliver on this mission as we grow our  business sustainably and strive to meet the needs of  all our stakeholders. Baxter provides a broad portfolio of essential healthcare  products, including acute and chronic dialysis therapies;  sterile intravenous (IV) solutions; infusion systems and  devices; parenteral nutrition therapies; inhaled anes- thetics; generic injectable pharmaceuticals; surgical  hemostat and sealant products; advanced surgical  equipment; smart bed systems; patient monitoring and  diagnostic technologies; and respiratory health devices. On Dec. 13, 2021, Baxter completed its acquisition of  Hillrom, a global medical technology leader. Hillrom  brings a highly complementary product portfolio and  innovation pipeline that will enable Baxter to provide  a broader array of medical products and services to  patients and clinicians across the care continuum  and around the world. Together, we have the ability to  transform healthcare by helping to improve patient  outcomes, enhancing workflow efficiency and enabling  more cost-effective healthcare solutions. Baxter’s combination with Hillrom unlocks the next  phase of our transformation journey, presenting a new  wave of potential to drive greater impact for patients,  healthcare providers, employees, investors and other  stakeholders we serve worldwide. Baxter’s heritage and global reach provide a distinct  perspective on the needs of patients and caregivers  around the world. We have a longstanding commitment  to research and development (R&D) and a rich history  of medical firsts, from the first commercially manufac- tured IV solutions to the first portable kidney dialysis  machine, and many more. Each of our approximately  60,000 employees1 is dedicated to ensuring that Baxter  is there when and where patients need care—from  hospitals and clinics to physician offices and homes,  in rural areas and major cities around the world. We will continue to transform healthcare by supporting  opportunities that will cultivate the next generation of  innovators, investing in the pursuit of new discoveries  and research, and partnering with world-renowned  institutions to further our impact. We underpin this  work with a commitment to conduct our business   with integrity, attract and develop a more diverse and  inclusive workforce, increase operational efficiency  and innovate more sustainable products. GLOBAL PRESENCE Baxter (including Hillrom) touches the lives of more  than 350 million people every year.

Our products  and services are essential building blocks of health- care. We innovate to bring smarter, more personalized  care to the world with new technologies and therapies  for patients and providers. These efforts are bolstered  by our partnerships with clinical experts and leaders  in digital health and the broader healthcare industry  who diversify our discovery process.  We aspire to transform healthcare by helping providers  improve care outcomes, enhance workflow efficiencies  and enable more cost-effective healthcare solutions.  With approximately 2 million ''smart devices''2 globally,   we are advancing new solutions across the care continu- um, including device connectivity, data visualization and  analytics tools, care communications, and monitoring  and sensing innovations. Our goal is for our innovations  to work together in a connected system that surrounds  the patient and their care team. We are also transforming the way we operate by  empowering our people to learn and innovate at  scale using digital technology. Our goal is to help our  people and our customers to reach their full potential  by driving data, insights and deep partnerships to  advance our mission of saving and sustaining lives.  In 2021, our companywide digital transformation  initiative led to new customer service and therapy  support tools for patients and healthcare providers  and new digital health solutions in clinical nutrition  and home dialysis. We also deployed more than  20 new digital solutions internally to support our  operations, from manufacturing planning to quality  tracking and beyond.  Baxter’s robust product pipeline is designed to help  clinicians be more efficient and effective as they treat  patients across multiple care settings, including the  hospital bedside, operating room and intensive care  unit; dialysis clinic; physician’s office and at home.  We expect to introduce several innovations to help  improve care for patients around the world, including  digital health solutions for the hospital and home, a  new infusion pump platform, a new digital-ready   ophthalmoscope and otoscope to transform physical  examinations, new developments in home dialysis  technology, generic injectable drug offerings and more.

As a global leader in healthcare, delivering on our mission to save and  sustain lives is more vital than ever. We continue to protect the health and safety of our employees; increase the supply of critically necessary  products and therapies; share our industry expertise, including partnering to manufacture COVID-19 vaccines; and provide philanthropic  support to communities in need.

Racism, intolerance,  marginalization and discrimination affect our colleagues, families, friends and communities  worldwide in countless forms. In 2020, we launched ACT: Activating Change Today, a global,  multidimensional and multiyear initiative to advance racial justice. While this initiative was  prompted by the murder of George Floyd in the United States, ACT is intended to address  other racial/ethnic minority injustices around the world as well. In the United States, the  focus of our ACT effort is on the Black community. Outside of the United States, our regional  and country teams are working to address injustices that affect various races and ethnicities,  throughout the EMEA and APAC regions. We expect to continue expanding our efforts in  other countries in 2022 and beyond. As the name suggests, ACT is about taking action to drive results. We want to achieve  meaningful, sustainable change and be part of the solution to the complex, longstanding,  multifaceted societal issue of racial injustice. We are acting with a sense of urgency,  prioritizing initiatives around the world that we believe will make the biggest impact.  We have aligned our ACT initiatives to our four DE&I strategic pillars—workforce, workplace,  communities and marketplace—to ensure we approach this issue in a comprehensive manner.  Learn more about our most recent ACT:ions. This is a generational defining moment. I know that the conversations are  tough… conversations of race, of social injustice, of systemic oppression.  But we should have them anyway.” NOSA, TERRITORY BUSINESS MANAGER, ADVANCED SURGERY Employees heard from their colleague, Nosa, on his views and experiences with institutional and systemic racism in the United States.

Our corporate responsibility work is grounded in three pillars and bolstered by our approach to good   governance and cross-cutting commitments to responsible practices across our business.  Our 2030 Corporate Responsibility Commitment features 10 goals for prioritized action. We have reported our environmental performance for 30 years and have consistently broadened and enhanced  our reporting on the ESG issues that are priorities to Baxter and our stakeholders. Baxter published its first  Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Index in 2020 (based on 2019 information), in alignment  with the Medical Equipment and Supplies Sustainability Accounting Standard. In addition, in early 2022,  we commissioned a third party to conduct a gap analysis comparing the information in our 2020 Corporate  Responsibility Report and our 2021 CDP Climate Change disclosure with the Task Force on Climate-related  Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework. We are actively evaluating our ability to report against the TCFD  framework generally and in light of potential evolving regulatory disclosure requirements. Performance Goals Every year, we measure and evaluate our performance, communicate progress and challenges, and  identify opportunities to drive even greater impact across our business and society. Setting goals across  a broad range of ESG issues demonstrates our commitment, reinforces accountability and helps to drive  ongoing improvement. This report states progress toward Baxter’s 2030 Corporate Responsibility Goals.  We developed our 2030 goals through broad engagement with Baxter executives, our Board of Directors (Board),  subject matter experts across the company, investors, nongovernmental organizations and other external  stakeholders. Industry and cross-industry benchmarking, as well as our most recent materiality assessment,  also informed the process. Given the scale and scope of the challenges we face as a society, we chose a  10-year timeframe for most of our goals to advance meaningful progress related to these substantive issues.

Following is a representative sample of how driving progress in corporate responsibility contributes to business value. BUSINESS VALUE DRIVER EXAMPLES Employee Attraction   and Retention •	 We follow a fair and inclusive hiring process, which includes an inclusive candidate sourcing strategy, diverse interview panels and a target to ensure that at least 30% of candidates on the interview  slates for roles of manager or above are diverse.   •	 Baxter conducts Best Place to Work surveys, through which our employees rate the company’s workplace across various categories. See summary data in the Baxter Data Summary as well as  results related to workplace inclusion.  •	 We believe that our commitment to sustainability, environmental stewardship, and safe and healthy workplaces helps us to attract, engage and retain top talent.   Operational Efficiency     •	 In 2021, we implemented 196 energy conservation projects. We estimate these projects will save 33,800 megawatt hours of energy and $3.3 million and avoid 8,800 metric tons carbon dioxide  equivalent of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions annually.1 See Energy Management. •	 Recycling at Baxter generated $2.5 million in net income during the year. See Implement Strategic Materials and Waste Management Plans. License to Operate  •	 We maintain global strategies and programs to help ensure that we meet privacy regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation; human rights-related legislation such as the  California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010; and product materials restrictions such as the EU RoHS Directive, EU REACH Regulation and EU Medical Devices Regulation. This supports  our continued access to key markets. See Materials of Concern, Protecting Human Rights in Our Supply Chain and Privacy and Data Protection.  •	 We prioritize regulatory compliance as the foundation of our environmental, health, safety and sustainability (EHS&S) program. See Environmental, Health and Safety Performance.  •	 Baxter supports communities in need where we have an operational presence through partnerships that address environmental, social and economic needs (such as water access, sanitation and  hygiene or WASH projects). See Implement Strategic Water Management Plans.    Risk Reduction •	 We have strengthened our EHS&S governance to identify and mitigate environmental risks; implemented programs to enhance physical infrastructure at our manufacturing facilities; and made  substantial capital investments at our critical sites to ensure their operational longevity. See Environmental, Health and Safety Performance.  •	 We identify and manage climate- and water-related risks as part of our global risk management activities, have implemented a GHG emissions-reduction strategy as well as water management and  waste mitigation plans and continue to build resiliency across our supply chain. See Achieve Carbon Neutrality for Direct Operations by 2040, Implement Strategic Water Management Plans, and  Implement Strategic Materials and Waste Management Plans. •	 Product and process improvements are designed to enhance patient safety and product quality and decrease risk of regulatory actions.

Governance •	 ESG matters are subject to oversight at the highest levels of Baxter, including our Executive Leadership Team (whose annual incentive compensation is tied, in part, to ESG metrics) and our Board   of Directors (with two committees sharing oversight for ESG matters and the Board as a whole reviewing ESG matters at least annually). See Corporate Responsibility Governance and Management.  •	 The diversity of our Board provides key insights related to corporate responsibility and strategic initiatives, operational performance and financial control. See Our Leadership. •	 We manage environmental aspects and risks, as well as health and safety hazards and risks, in accordance with the most current International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 and   ISO 45001 standards, and we provide oversight and assurance for our EHS&S programs through a structured audit process. See Environmental, Health and Safety Performance.  Reputation •	 Maintaining high ethical standards, ensuring strong labor and environmental practices in our supply chain and working to support communities where we have an operational presence all   contribute to our corporate responsibility goals and to our reputation as a leading corporate citizen. See Implement Strategic Water Management Plans, Advance Sustainable Procurement,  Invest in Underserved Communities Globally, Ethics and Compliance, Human Rights, and Recognition. Revenue •	 Innovation to enhance patient safety and product quality drives our ability to meet patient needs and ultimately improves health outcomes. See Continually Improve Manufacturing Capabilities. •	 Customers increasingly consider environmental and social performance in proposal reviews and purchasing decisions.  •	 Our efforts to expand access to care, particularly in the renal space for underserved markets, unlock new opportunities for revenue growth.

We routinely engage with our primary stakeholder groups to assess the ESG issues  that are most relevant to our business. We also periodically conduct in-depth materiality assessments to  better understand the relative importance of a broad range of ESG issues to our business and stakeholders. Stockholder Outreach As part of the company’s corporate governance outreach program, members of Baxter’s management team  and members of the Board, including the company’s Lead Independent Director, engage with investors on  a range of topics. In the fall of 2021, the company engaged in discussions with stockholders representing  approximately 30% of the company’s outstanding shares (calculated as of Dec. 31, 2021).  Topics discussed with stockholders in 2021 included company strategy and performance (including the  company’s response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), the proposed Hillrom acquisition (which was  completed on Dec. 13, 2021), corporate governance matters (including Board composition, diversity  and refreshment and proposed changes to the company’s Certificate of Incorporation to adopt written  consent), the Board’s leadership structure, executive compensation and corporate responsibility initiatives  (including the company’s 2030 Corporate Responsibility Goals). Stockholder feedback was shared with the  full Board and relevant committees. Materiality To understand and prioritize issues that are critical to the long-term sustainability of our business and most  relevant to our stakeholders, we periodically conduct materiality assessments. These analyses (which may differ  from those conducted for financial statement or other disclosure purposes) inform our corporate responsibility  strategy, commitment and goals. See a list of our material corporate responsibility issues (as defined during our  2018 assessment) and their impacts across our value chain. For more information about the process we undertook  and the key findings of that assessment, see page 6 of our 2018 Corporate Responsibility Report.  As a result of the Hillrom acquisition, Baxter plans to undertake a materiality assessment in 2022 to help   ensure the company’s corporate responsibility focus continues to align with the interests of the company and   its stakeholders. We will include the results of this analysis in our next corporate responsibility report.

(Baseline: 198,000 patients in 2020) PERFORMANCE:   In 2021, we reached more than 204,000 patients in underserved   markets through our PD portfolio. Given the number of barriers to care in these  markets, we are taking a staged approach—beginning with awareness and  education—that we intend to accelerate in future years.   APPROACH AND PROGRESS Increasing access to Baxter’s lifesaving products for  patients and caregivers globally is one of our company’s  top priorities. Our 2030 goal to reach more kidney patients  in developing countries emphasizes the importance of  supporting this underserved population.  People in developing countries are at a higher  risk of developing kidney disease and have less  opportunity to access the life-sustaining therapy  needed to survive the disease. Though estimations  vary, it is believed that up to nearly 10 million people  worldwide require renal therapy, yet fewer than  3 million people receive treatment.1 Home-based  PD offers patients the opportunity to manage their  therapy at home, provides equal or better outcomes  for many and is often less costly when compared  with clinic-based hemodialysis. PD also provides  patients, who have immune dysfunction, an  opportunity to socially distance themselves to reduce  the risk of viral infections, such as COVID-19. In 2021, we focused on the following programs  and activities as we began laying the foundation to  increase access to PD in developing countries.  Hosted second International Home Dialysis  Roundtable  Sponsored hands-on PD catheter   training for nearly  400 nephrologists  from  19 countries              50,000+ patients in 70   countries connected to their clinicians  via Sharesource  APPROACH TO REACHING RENAL PATIENTS IN   UNDERSERVED MARKETS We are taking a three-pronged approach to reach our 2030 goal. Empower   Our Patients Protect   Our Planet Appendix Champion Our People  and Communities Corporate Responsibility Commitment Introduction 2030 Corporate  Responsibility Goals Cross-Cutting  Commitments Driving Shared Decision Making Choosing an appropriate therapy option is an  important decision for people with chronic  kidney disease. Patients must be aware of and  informed about their options so they can  advocate for the treatment choice that is best  for them. Engagement between trusted and  informed clinicians and patients is critical to  increasing patients’ awareness of treatment  options and accelerating the adoption of PD. In  2021, Baxter launched a campaign to raise  clinician and patient awareness about the  benefits of PD so they can have more informed  discussions about therapy options.  Driving Shared Decision Making Advocating for Access to PD  Expanding Innovation and Services  ===== PAGE 16 ===== Baxter 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report   1 6 Empower   Our Patients Protect   Our Planet Appendix Champion Our People  and Communities Corporate Responsibility Commitment Introduction 2030 Corporate  Responsibility Goals Cross-Cutting  Commitments Our global Safer at Home awareness campaign  educated patients and key stakeholders about home  dialysis as an important therapy option during the  COVID-19 pandemic and discouraged patients from  delaying or opting out of therapy for fear of contracting  the virus. In 2021, we continued to use social media  channels to drive awareness globally and sponsor  patient societies in delivering educational campaigns  to their members and the general public.  We also launched the MyKidneyJourney website,  which was available in 28 countries as of the end of  2021, including many developing countries. This locally  customizable website provides objective pre-dialysis  education for patients and caregivers who are seeking  additional disease and therapy information. Although  clinicians can direct patients to the site, it does not  require clinician referral, making it easy to access for  patients and family members.  In addition, we established our PD Ambassador  Program in 2021. Through this program, we invited  local opinion leaders to learn more about the current  clinical benefits of PD, the role they play in shared  decision making and patient choice, the importance   of home dialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic and  beyond, and digital health with the Sharesource  remote patient management platform as a home  therapy enabler. By the end of the year, we had  established a group of 50 PD Ambassadors from   30 countries2 who can consistently communicate   the benefits of PD and advocate for its use.  Advocating for Access to PD We support public policies, economic analyses and  collaborations that advance access to PD. In 2021,  we hosted a second International Home Dialysis  Roundtable to continue work that this same group  began in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  This group continues collaborating to identify and help  address the global challenges and opportunities  related to access to home dialysis. These annual  discussions are unique in that they represent a broad,  multinational gathering of patient advocacy groups,  clinical societies and industry representatives from 27  countries, including developing countries in Asia  Pacific, Europe and other regions.  While the roundtable was originally created to confront  access-to-care challenges presented by the COVID-19  pandemic, the forum also identified the benefit of   prioritizing and addressing—either individually or in  collaboration—systemic challenges to home dialysis   on an ongoing basis. This group was responsible for an   important call to action, published in Kidney Medicine,  and several advocacy outreach communications to   policymakers throughout the year.  Expanding Innovation and Services Innovation that meets the local needs of patients is  critical to expanding access to care. With the proper  awareness and education, we are working to expand  access to our PD portfolio, including our digital health  platform, in developing countries.  For example, Sharesource remote patient management,  our digital health platform, allows healthcare profession- als to securely view data from their patients’ recently  completed home dialysis treatment, which is automati- cally collected after each automated peritoneal dialysis  (APD) session. With real-time access to treatment data  through Sharesource, healthcare professionals can  remotely adjust patients’ home device settings without  requiring additional trips to the clinic. Sharesource leads  to other therapeutic benefits, including fewer dropouts,  improved adherence, and improved patient-reported  outcomes, as well as cost reduction. More than 50,000  Awareness and Training for PD Catheters In order to begin PD therapy, a patient must have a catheter inserted into their abdominal area. Completing  this critical first step in a timely manner is a common barrier to PD therapy adoption and was especially  challenging during the height of the pandemic when several countries deemed PD catheter insertion to be  elective and suspended the procedure along with other elective surgeries. To support access to life-saving  PD therapy, Baxter worked with healthcare professionals, medical societies and ministries of health globally  to have catheter insertion procedures deemed an essential, non-deferable procedure, removing one barrier  to patients beginning PD therapy.  In 2021, we launched an educational campaign directed at nephrologists interested in placing catheters.  The campaign included webinars, instructional videos, e-learning modules and interactive aids to raise  awareness and encourage nephrologists to add PD catheter insertion to their practices. We also sponsored  hands-on PD catheter training programs that trained nearly 400 nephrologists from 19 countries, including  Algeria, Bahrain, Brazil, China, Colombia, Egypt, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Morocco, Oman, Poland,  Slovenia, South Africa, Sudan, Tunisia, Turkey and UAE.  patients in 70 countries are connected to their clinicians  via Sharesource. This platform and other innovations  will continue to drive progress in this area. Visit our  website for patient stories. MOVING FORWARD >> Increasing the number of patients we reach in any   market is complex and multifaceted. For example, the  COVID-19 pandemic continues to present significant  challenges for patients with kidney disease, and we will  continue to advocate for access to care in the home to  reduce potential risks associated with kidney patients  contracting the virus.  We expect incremental growth toward achievement of  our goal during the next few years as we continue to drive  shared decision making and advocate for safe, effective  home-based dialysis through a focus on awareness and  education. We anticipate this multifaceted approach will  eliminate barriers to care and accelerate our ability to  reach patients over time. We will continue to prioritize  flexibility and agility as we drive progress toward our  long-term plans.

(Baseline year: 2021) PERFORMANCE:   In 2021, we gathered data to establish a capability baseline for our  sterilized solutions and sets, and refined the infrastructure and processes necessary to  enhance product quality and report progress. In future reports, we will disclose progress  from this baseline toward our target.  Production Cycle   Optimization process implemented   70%+  of Baxter manufacturing sites will benefit from   process improvements for sterilized solutions  APPROACH AND PROGRESS Baxter develops products that save and sustain  lives worldwide, delivering on our mission and  representing our most important contribution  to society. As we work to keep this promise to  patients, caregivers and customers, we look  beyond compliance and take proactive steps  to enable more consistent, effective manufac- turing processes. Our aim is to deliver safe,  high-quality products that work reliably and are  free of defects. Prioritizing quality and safety  also helps to drive down customer complaints  and product recalls while improving supply  chain continuity and resilience.  In 2021, we identified sterilized solutions and sets as a  priority area for improvement. We are investing in man- ufacturing processes that help us drive down the rate of  leaks in these sterile products across our plants. More  than 70% of our manufacturing sites produce sterilized  solutions and sets and will benefit from these process  improvements. As we make progress in this priority  area, we will identify additional products for process  improvements to prioritize in the coming years.  Collaboration within our company and with regulators  helps ensure quality across the product life cycle. Our  multifaceted approach includes several key strategies. Manufacturing standards: As we maintain and improve  quality standards across our manufacturing sites, we  focus on three primary areas: the physical facilities,  critical systems used in product manufacturing and  mechanisms to ensure a continual state of control.   By improving our process controls to address potential  issues upstream, we can optimize our production lines  and equipment effectiveness, minimize scrap and  rework, and consistently release high-quality products  into the marketplace. Internal reviews: We employ multifunctional   governing and operating mechanisms that aid us in  performing in-depth technical evaluations, identifying  necessary improvements to individual products and  implementing those improvements worldwide. Our  robust strategic reviews provide our cross-functional  leadership with improved visibility and a greater   understanding of product safety and quality perfor- mance across the entire portfolio. These product  reviews will provide important feedback to help us  identify priority products for manufacturing process  improvements as we work toward our goal. Patient Safety and  Product Quality Facility Quality  and Control Quality Systems Performance We take a holistic, innovative approach to quality across the product  life cycle, and our commitment to continuous improvement builds   on decades of insight and expertise. INTEGRATED APPROACH TO QUALITY Empower   Our Patients Protect   Our Planet Appendix Champion Our People  and Communities Corporate Responsibility Commitment Introduction 2030 Corporate  Responsibility Goals Cross-Cutting  Commitments  ===== PAGE 18 ===== Baxter 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report   1 8 Empower   Our Patients Protect   Our Planet Appendix Champion Our People  and Communities Corporate Responsibility Commitment Introduction 2030 Corporate  Responsibility Goals Cross-Cutting  Commitments Digital transformation: Baxter is rethinking how the  medical products industry approaches product  release and control across the value chain. We have  implemented a Production Cycle Optimization (PCO)  process that leverages digital tools, robust data sets  and strict controls across our manufacturing pro- cesses to help ensure we are producing safe,  high-quality products. Our aim is to detect quality  defects early in the manufacturing process and fix  those problems at their point of origin, which then  has a positive impact across our manufacturing  processes.  Checking quality throughout production and using  data-based decision making to improve our processes  gives us confidence that we are consistently releasing  high-quality products into the marketplace. In addition,  because we collect evidence of quality throughout  production, we were able to qualify products from  two additional sites for parametric release in 2021.  Parametric release allows us to release and distribute  these products more efficiently by removing the need  for additional testing at the end of the manufacturing  process. Building on this success, we will be enrolling  more sites in the future.   In 2021, we created a system that enables us to con- sistently capture and connect data across our manu- facturing sites, replacing time-intensive manual tasks  with automated workflows. This tool is configured to  gather data from each site, which is then aggregated  into a single, global, cloud-based solution that helps  us track critical steps in our PCO processes as we  work toward the parametric release of products. Collaboration with global regulators: Through our  strategic engagement with global regulatory bodies,  we continue to pursue collaborative solutions to  advance patient safety and help ensure our products  are of the highest quality and present the lowest   possible risk to patients.  For example, using the data-backed evidence we have  gathered through our manufacturing controls and  quality processes, we are working with regulators so  that the guidance for required inspections is relevant  for our products and the broader industry. Through this  collaboration we are working to positively influence  regulatory standards, such as FDA Guidance for  “Inspection of Injectable Products for Visible Particu- lates.” We will continue to work collaboratively with  regulatory agencies around the world with the interest  of ensuring that regulatory expectations support the  manufacturing of safe, high-quality products for  customers. For more information about product safety and quality,  see our Sustainability Accounting Standards Board  (SASB) index and the Baxter Data Summary.  MOVING FORWARD >> Building on the digital system we established in 2021  to capture and connect data across our manufacturing  sites, we are identifying and prioritizing opportunities  to implement enhanced controls through our PCO  process as we strive to improve our manufacturing  process capabilities. The combination of better data  and improved manufacturing capability will also help  us collaborate with global regulators to implement  more efficient release techniques, such as the para- metric release of our solution products.   ===== PAGE 19 ===== Baxter 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report   1 9 Protect   Our Planet Corporate Responsibility Commitment Introduction 2030 Corporate  Responsibility Goals Empower   Our Patients Appendix Champion Our People  and Communities Cross-Cutting  Commitments Achieve Carbon Neutrality for   Direct Operations by 2040 . . . . . . . . . 20 Implement Strategic Water   Management Plans. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25 Advance Sustainable   Procurement . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 28 Implement Strategic Materials   and Waste Management Plans . . . . . 30 Environmental, Health, Safety   and Sustainability Governance   and Additional Disclosures . . . . . .. . 33 Protect Our Planet Prioritize operational  excellence and  environmental stewardship  across our value chain Photo:  Several  employees in  Colombia participate  in forest protection  and conservation  volunteering.

We also established the necessary teams and  infrastructure to help accelerate progress in the coming years.  5.3%  decrease in product   transport GHG emissions* APPROACH AND PROGRESS   The effects of climate change are complex and wide- ranging. Severe storms, droughts, forest fires and  other climate-related impacts take a significant toll  on human health, ecosystems, communities and  businesses. Urgency is increasing both for collective,  global action and a continued corporate response.  Baxter’s goal to achieve carbon neutrality for our  direct operations by 2040 demonstrates our broader  commitment to conserve resources and limit our  impact on the environment.  As part of our global risk management activities, Baxter  identifies, manages and mitigates the company’s  climate-related risks by building resilience across  our supply chain. We have strengthened and  expanded our manufacturing supply network by  diversifying manufacturing, identifying secondary  suppliers, enhancing business continuity planning and  implementing alternative energy projects. For more  information about our governance, strategy and risk  management, see Corporate Responsibility Governance  and Management, our response to CDP Climate Change  and our Climate Change & Energy Position Statement. In 2021, we established a cross-functional team and  strengthened the governance and infrastructure  needed to make progress on our carbon neutrality  commitment. We also continued our work to reduce  energy consumption and GHG emissions across our  company. Although Scope 3 emissions are currently  outside the boundaries of our carbon neutrality goal,  we will continue to report on our efforts to minimize  these emissions.

This is a 0.4% decrease in absolute  emissions compared with 2020 and a 7.4% decrease  indexed to revenue.  Reducing energy use is vital to our sustainability  strategy, as energy use accounted for 99% of Baxter’s  GHG emissions from operations in 2021. During the  year, in addition to energy-efficiency initiatives, we  decreased our GHG emissions through fuel switching,  cogeneration, alternative energy systems, on-site  renewable energy systems, renewable electricity  procurement and green buildings.  For example, in 2021, we replaced a diesel boiler  with a water-to-water electric heat pump at our  manufacturing facility in San Vittore, Switzerland,  which is expected to reduce the site’s energy use by  7% and avoid 144 metric tons CO2e annually. We also  introduced innovative technology at our manufacturing  facility in Cali, Colombia, to recover heat from our  sterilization process and use it to preheat the water  going into the sterilization system. We expect this to  reduce the site’s energy use by 2% and avoid 180  metric tons CO2e annually.2 By the end of 2021, 30% of our energy use for  operations was derived from renewable sources,  equivalent to 846,000 megawatt hours (MWh) on an  annual basis. Biomass fuel for boilers at two of our  locations3 accounted for 9.5%, and the renewable  energy component of our purchased electricity and  renewable energy certificates together represented  20%. On-site geothermal, solar photovoltaic and solar  hot water systems also contributed a small amount.  Baxter’s energy procurement team sources sustain- able and economical energy for our manufacturing  facilities. Globally in 2021, we purchased more than  430,000 MWh of electricity generated from 100%  certified renewable power. This included more than  200,000 MWh for our U.S. sites and more than  201,000 MWh for our European manufacturing sites  (94% of the electricity Baxter uses for manufacturing  in the region). In 2021, we were recognized as the  43rd largest corporate purchaser of renewable  energy in the United States.4   For a regional breakdown of GHG emissions from   Baxter operations see the Baxter Data Summary. From late 2020 through 2021, we  installed on-site solar systems at  three of our manufacturing facilities.5  •	 Amata, Thailand:  A 994 kilowatt  system that generated 1,247 MWh  in 2021 and provided 17% of the  site’s electricity needs  •	 Haina, Dominican Republic:   A 1 megawatt (MW) system,   which is expected to generate  about 1,645 MWh annually  and provide 39% of the site’s  electricity needs based on current  consumption levels •	 Lessines, Belgium:  A 1.2 MW  system, which is expected to  generate 1,272 MWh annually  and provide 8% of the site’s  electricity needs based on current  consumption levels GHG EMISSIONS (SCOPE 1 AND 2) FROM BAXTER OPERATIONS* Thousand Metric Tons CO2e Metric Tons CO2e per Million Dollars of Sales   2019  2020  2021 Scope 1  300        313  338 Scope 2  297        287  260 Metric Tons CO2e per  53  51  47 Million Dollars of Sales 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 * Some data for 2019 and 2020 are restated from data reported in the Baxter  2020 Corporate Responsibility Report to improve accuracy and to reflect  updated GHG emission factors.

Energy efficiency is integral to our climate  strategy, as it saves money while reducing  environmental impact.   Our global energy program applies the ISO 50001  standard to the company’s facility-level energy  management systems. By the end of 2021, 22  Baxter facilities (47% of participating locations6)  met ISO 50001 requirements.  In 2021, we used 2.9 million MWh of energy,7 4.4%  more than in 2020 in absolute terms and 3.1% less  indexed to revenue. Our energy costs increased  0.1% compared with 2020, up $220,000. Site-specific energy assessments help us  identify opportunities to conserve energy, such  as implementing new technologies or adopting  best practices. In 2020 and 2021, we were unable  to perform on-site energy assessments due to  COVID-19-related travel restrictions. Despite this  setback we continued identifying potential energy  projects and driving project performance by  establishing bi-monthly meetings with global  energy managers and regional engineering  executives. We also conducted cross-facility  benchmarking focused on energy conservation  opportunities within the regions and businesses. As a result, in 2021, we invested $8.9 million to  implement 196 energy conservation projects  across our manufacturing sites globally. We  estimate that these projects will save 33,800  MWh of energy and $3.3 million and avoid 8,800  metric tons CO2e of GHG emissions annually.8 We have operated a Lean Energy Program  for our manufacturing facilities since  2007. It includes four levels—Prerequisite,  Bronze, Silver and Gold. Facilities meet the  criteria for each level as they advance in  pursuit of Gold. Each level includes program  requirements, standards of operational  excellence and technical requirements.  By year-end 2021, 43 of 47 facilities9 met  Prerequisite criteria. Of those, 34 also met  Bronze, 19 met Silver and 5 met Gold. GHG Emissions Across the Value Chain  Although our carbon neutrality goal focuses on Scope  1 and 2 emissions, Baxter continues to calculate and  address Scope 3 GHG emissions10 across our value  chain. We estimate our 2021 GHG emissions footprint  (Scope 1, 2 and 3) at 5.259 million metric tons CO2e,  up 3% from 2020. The main factors contributing to this  rise were increased sales and production of certain  products in 2021. We strive to minimize waste across the product  life cycle and help healthcare providers meet their  GHG emissions reduction goals. In 2020, Baxter  announced a partnership with ZeoSys Medical to pilot  the CONTRAfluran   Anesthetic Gas Capture system.  This system allows hospitals to collect anesthetic  gases exhaled in operating rooms, preventing their  release into the atmosphere and thereby reducing  hospitals’ related GHG emissions. We have piloted  this capture system in nine European countries  and are considering further expansion. See  our 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report for  more information about how the CONTRAfluran  Anesthetic Gas Capture system works and its  environmental benefits. Since 2015, we have offset GHG emissions related  to global business air travel with United Airlines  through the CarbonChoice program. In 2021, this  represented 14% of Baxter’s air travel emissions  and included 758 metric tons CO2e offset on Baxter’s  behalf through Sustainable Travel International’s  portfolio of high-quality carbon offsets, including the  Trocano Araretama Conservation Project, which is a  REDD+-certified forest conservation project located  in the state of Amazonas, Brazil.

Only a small portion of product transportation–related  GHG emissions are Scope 1 and therefore covered by  our carbon neutrality goal. However, we continue to  measure and manage all emissions (including Scope 3)  across our global supply chain. Our worldwide GHG emissions from product transport  totaled 425,800 metric tons CO2e in 2021.11 This is  equivalent to 84 kilograms CO2e per metric ton of  products transported, a decrease of 5.6% compared with  2020. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in  air freight associated with prioritizing quick delivery of  renal supplies and other Baxter products urgently  needed during the COVID-19 pandemic, though these  shipments did continue to keep air freight higher than  pre-pandemic levels. Of these emissions, 17,100 metric  tons CO2e are Scope 1 emissions attributed to our distribu- tion vehicles and covered by our carbon neutrality goal. Baxter’s approach to improving efficiency and decreasing  emissions from product transport includes:  Technology innovation: In 2021, the primary transpor- tation service provider utilized by Baxter for our UK  customers began replacing fossil fuels with biofuel.  This conversion helped reduce GHG emissions associ- ated with our UK transportation activities by more than  2,000 metric tons CO2e in 2021 and is expected to  reduce GHG emissions by about 4,000 metric tons CO2e  on an annual basis.12 We also started using biofuel for  our distribution activities in Brazil, specifically in the  regions of Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo and the  countryside of São Paulo. The switch to biofuel helped  us reduce our GHG emissions by approximately 300  metric tons CO2e in 2021.  In addition, for export shipments out of Europe, we  implemented a project to shift 700 temperature- controlled shipping containers per year to standard,  non-temperature-controlled containers. We estimate  this will reduce associated GHG emissions by more  than 1,000 metric tons CO2e annually.12  Environmentally responsible partnerships: Baxter  participates in the U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency’s SmartWay program as both a Carrier and  Shipper Partner. We also participate in the Clean  Cargo initiative, which focuses on environmentally  responsible ocean shipping. Baxter uses EcoTransIT  software and methodology to capture and report our  emissions data in alignment with industry best   practices. These partnerships help Baxter calculate  our transportation emissions with greater accuracy. Modal shift: In 2021, we changed the default mode  of transport for our elastomeric infusion pumps from  air to sea between the United States and Europe,  decreasing costs and GHG emissions. Congestion in  some U.S. ports prevented conversion of all shipments,  but we expect to expand this practice in future years.  The temporary obstruction of the Suez Canal in 2021  significantly delayed ocean shipments between Europe  and Asia and impacted global supply chains. As Baxter  worked to mitigate supply disruptions for our customers  and patients, we shipped more than 1,200 metric tons  of products by rail instead of air between Europe and  China. This helped us avoid an additional 8,000 metric   tons CO2e of GHG emissions that would have occurred if  those products had instead been shipped by air.  Optimizing the distribution network: The majority of  our EMEA export shipments pass through our ocean  export consolidation center in Antwerp, Belgium, where  shipments from different warehouses throughout  Europe are combined to ensure optimized loads. This  reduces the total number of containers shipped and  saves money while increasing supply frequency.  In addition, we are moving production for some products  closer to the markets those products serve. For example,  we began producing hemodialysis products bound for our  European market in Malta rather than in Mexico.   In 2021, we improved the pallet configuration for  transportation of our renal solutions manufactured in  Canlubang, Philippines, and transported to India and  Thailand. Transporting more products per pallet results  in fewer containers; we expect this to reduce GHG  emissions by about 60 metric tons CO2e annually.12 MOVING FORWARD >> Technology transformation across Baxter will support a  more refined understanding of our GHG emissions and  help us drive progress and capitalize on the growing  demand for lower-carbon healthcare products.  As we work to cut our own GHG emissions over the next  decade, we will continue to prioritize energy efficiency  initiatives and renewable electricity use, including  purchased electricity and on-site projects, such as biomass.  For example, we are planning to install cogeneration to  supply electricity to two of our manufacturing facilities in  Puerto Rico. In addition to providing the sites with a less  carbon intensive source of electricity, these projects will  make the sites more resilient to disruptions in service  from the local utility due to extreme weather events, such  as Hurricane Maria in 2017. We will also consider other  alternative fuel sources as innovation in this area advances.  We are actively evaluating our ability to report against  the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures  (TCFD) framework generally and in light of potential  evolving regulatory disclosure requirements.

PERFORMANCE:   In 2021, we collected data from all of our manufacturing sites, which we will  use as we work toward our 2023 milestone of prioritizing locations for water management.  We also continued upgrading our manufacturing infrastructure and modernizing our  operations to improve efficiency and reduce operational risk moving forward.   APPROACH AND PROGRESS A healthy water supply is critical for the well-being  of our patients, the communities where we operate  and our business. Although water management is a  global concern, it must be addressed at the local and  regional levels. We consider the physical, regulatory  and reputational risks associated with water man- agement at our sites as we focus on opportunities to  improve water efficiency in our operations, protect  watersheds and provide access to clean water within  local communities.   In 2021, we identified and allocated the resources we  should need to achieve our goal. We also engaged  internal stakeholders to uncover information and  processes that will advance our work in this area  and to establish partnerships across Baxter as we  developed our roadmap and began working toward our  commitment to implement strategic water   management plans.  We are performing a comprehensive review of our  manufacturing sites to understand the local context  of each. This includes the impact that our operations,  including wastewater discharge, have on the current  local water supply and additional opportunities to  improve our water efficiency. This information will  be critical as we work to prioritize our top water  management opportunities by the end of 2023. We  have also started making changes that will modernize  our operations and reduce water use at some of  our facilities with the highest usage. These changes  may increase reported water use initially due to the  introduction of new equipment and processes, but they  will ultimately help us mitigate water-related risks.  In addition, in 2021, we continued our longstanding  water management activities across the company,  including efficiency and wastewater management at  our manufacturing sites as well as community water  projects.  Baxter transparently reports the water-related impacts  of our business in this report (see the following page  and the Baxter Data Summary) and in our annual  response to CDP Water Security, the most recent of  which received a B based on 2020 data. This CDP Water  Security score is in the management band and was  higher than the average scores for the North America  region and the Medical Equipment & Supplies Sector,  both of which were B-.

Learn more about EHS&S governance at Baxter.  We work to better understand the impacts of water use  across our business and implement conservation and  efficiency projects at our manufacturing facilities.  In 2021, we used approximately 14.7 million cubic  meters of water,1 a 0.6% increase compared with  2020 and a 6.6% decrease indexed to revenue. Water is an important raw material for our business,  and we recognize that water-related risks have the  potential to negatively impact our operations and  the communities where we operate. Water issues  vary significantly by location, and we keep a close  eye on water stress across our sites, understanding  it is a physical risk that could negatively impact our  business continuity. We use the World Resources  Institute Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas version 3.0   to map and analyze current and future risks   associated with water stress at our most significant  water-use locations.2 Our 49 most significant water-use locations  represented 96% of our total water use in 2021. Of  the 49 sites, 23 are located in medium-high, high  and extremely high water-stress areas as indicated  in the chart below. Of these facilities, 10 use less  than 100,000 cubic meters of water per year,  reducing the facilities’ exposure to water risk   and related impacts across associated watersheds.  During the year, water use at these 23 sites   decreased by 0.5% in absolute terms and by 7.7%  indexed to revenue compared with 2020.  SELECTED WATER EFFICIENCY PROJECTS, 2021 BAXTER MANUFACTURING SITES IN LOCATIONS  WITH WATER STRESS RISK LOCATION PROJECT BENEFITS* Tianjin,  China We implemented a project to recover condensed steam from our  boiler, which was then reused to decrease overall water use at the  site.

For details about our self-reported  environmental incidents, including exceedances  of permitted wastewater discharge limits, see  Compliance.  Our systematic wastewater risk management  program identifies emerging issues. As part of  our proactive commitment, we take an aggressive  approach to wastewater operations and how we  identify, evaluate and manage wastewater issues. In  2021, we undertook the following related activities:  •	 Maintained training efforts to strengthen operations •	 Continued evaluating the effectiveness of facility  change management processes for wastewater  operations   •	 Continued assessing wastewater permit compliance  procedures and recommended improvements •	 Established one-on-one recurring meetings   with sites to address specific compliance and   performance issues •	 Engaged a third party to review compliance  measures and provide design assurance for  wastewater improvement projects at high-priority  facilities Supporting Access to Clean Water Access to clean water is a basic human right that  is crucial for good health and well-being, proper  sanitation and hygiene, and disease prevention.  Unfortunately, this vital natural resource is limited in  many areas of the world, disproportionately affecting  communities with already constrained health  infrastructure. Baxter and the Baxter International  Foundation (the Foundation) invest in projects that  support access to clean water in water-stressed  areas where we have facilities. In 2021, we continued our work to provide  communities in Guatemala and India with access  to clean water. In addition, the Foundation has  a Signature Partnership with UNICEF USA to  increase access to clean water, sanitation and  hygiene in Colombia. Learn more about our global  water initiatives. MOVING FORWARD >> Analysis of the data we gathered from our  manufacturing sites in 2021 will inform what  additional assessments are needed so we can  prioritize water management opportunities with  the highest potential impact. This may include  onsite assessments as well. In addition, we  anticipate that our new EHS&S information  management system will improve data collection  and analysis.

As part of this process, we also examine  the financial risk of suppliers to help ensure we avoid  disruptions in supply. We work with suppliers who  receive low scores in the areas of quality and delivery  to develop continuous improvement plans. Scores from  our annual Supplier Corporate Responsibility Survey  (see table at right) feed directly into this assessment. In 2021, we defined the scope for more in-depth  sustainability risk mapping for all our suppliers based  on location, performance, and goods and services  provided. This will help us prioritize suppliers with the  greatest corporate responsibility-related risk factors  for additional due diligence, corrective action plans  and/or on-site audits.  In addition, using a trusted third-party service, we  receive near-real-time notifications when disruptions  occur in areas of the world where our suppliers are  located. These could include natural disasters, fires,  major weather events or geopolitical activity. Using  this information, we are able to respond quickly to  help ensure supply continuity. Supplier Audits In 2021, more than 630 audits of Baxter suppliers  were conducted related to management systems for  product quality. Learn more about our approach to  product quality.  In addition, we are increasing our capacity and  developing our capability to audit suppliers’  sustainability management systems and performance  related to environment, labor and human rights,  ethics and sustainable procurement. To accomplish  this, we are exploring the possibility of developing  our internal sustainability auditing capabilities or  collaborating with third-party auditors. Expanding the  scope of our auditing will improve our understanding  of our supplier base and help us identify areas for  improvement. We plan to begin conducting these  corporate responsibility audits in 2023.  Supplier Corporate Responsibility Survey Baxter collaborates with business sustainability  ratings firm EcoVadis to conduct an annual survey of  our suppliers’ corporate responsibility programs and  performance. The assessment covers environment,   labor and human rights, ethics, and sustainable  procurement. Results in 2021 included data from 369  Baxter suppliers, an increase from 211 suppliers in  2020. Of the 369 participating suppliers in 2021, 47%  are from Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA); 41%  from the Americas; and 11% from Asia Pacific (APAC). 1    Suppliers have access to detailed scorecards on  the EcoVadis platform, including information about  strengths and benchmark comparisons, as well as  actionable improvement areas. We use these score- cards to drive ongoing improvement and anticipate  increased participation as we expand supplier  engagement in the coming years. We also include  survey scores in our business reviews with strategic  suppliers for ongoing discussion and monitoring. In  the future, we plan to further leverage the EcoVadis  system to create corrective action plans for suppliers  falling below our performance standards and deter- mine when on-site audits are necessary.  MOVING FORWARD >> Baxter will continue investing in our people,  technology and processes to integrate our  sustainable procurement strategy throughout   our supply chain and put systems in place to  help us more efficiently and effectively measure  progress and improve performance over time. In  the coming years, we will roll out a robust supplier  audit program that complements our risk mapping  process. We are also working to further integrate  supplier sustainability considerations throughout  our procurement functions. Industry Collaboration   Baxter collaborates with other healthcare  companies and organizations to improve efficiency  and advance responsible procurement. For  example, we are a member of the Pharmaceutical  Supply Chain Initiative, an organization that  facilitates knowledge sharing in support of  responsible supply chain practices. In addition, to establish a secure supply chain,  we participate in programs such as the Customs  Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (CTPAT)  program, which supports a secure and reliable  supply of lifesaving medical products. This  includes shipments of raw materials and finished  products both to and from various Baxter  locations, foreign suppliers, distributors and  customers. As an importer and exporter, Baxter  has been recognized as a Tier III Partner (the  highest level possible) in the program since 2011.

PERFORMANCE:   In 2021, we continued to mitigate waste at Baxter through process   efficiency, waste reduction, recovery, recycling and landfill diversion. We also further   engaged stakeholders to identify additional opportunities for reduction and to inform our  strategy and facilitate prioritization of waste generation sources by 2024.  77.1%  overall recycling rate***  9.0%  overall reduction in  waste generation* *Compared with 2020 and indexed to revenue.  **Certain waste streams at two facilities in Europe have government-mandated requirements. These waste streams are excluded from the total. ***Incineration with energy recovery is considered recycling. APPROACH AND PROGRESS Ineffective materials and waste management leads  to natural resource depletion and increased waste  generation, impacting the environment and human  health. At Baxter, we strive to gain a comprehensive  understanding of waste-related impacts across our  value chain to reduce waste and drive a transition  from a linear approach of “take, make, dispose,” to  a more circular approach that maximizes materials  value throughout the product life cycle.  We are working to identify all waste generation sources   at Baxter and prioritize our top waste mitigation  opportunities. In 2021, we refined our strategy by  conducting benchmarks, gathering data and engaging  internal stakeholders across Baxter—including  colleagues on our finance, procurement, EHS&S and  operational excellence teams, among others.   We also continued our longstanding waste  mitigation efforts related to sustainable design,  materials use, operations, product distribution and  end-of-life recovery.  Sustainable Design Through sustainable design, we minimize our  environmental impacts and capture as much  value as possible from the natural resources used  to manufacture, transport, use and recover our  products. To support these efforts, we require  an EHS&S assessment during the development  process for all new products. This assessment  evaluates EHS&S and regulatory considerations  and requirements across our value chain, covering  materials use, waste and other factors. The  assessment also includes more detailed life cycle  assessment (LCA)–based computer modeling of  proposed products and may involve comparison with  existing products. For select new and established  products, we use full LCAs to evaluate and help  improve product sustainability performance.  Materials Use in Products and Packaging Materials use is a key driver of Baxter’s environmental  footprint and getting the most value possible from  materials is central to our transition toward a more  circular approach.  Products  Baxter works to reduce materials use in products  without affecting efficacy, and to avoid or minimize  materials of concern. See several examples in the  Baxter 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report.  Driving innovation to improve clinical outcomes can  also decrease materials use and waste. Recent studies  indicate that several Baxter products can help reduce  hospitalizations and the length of hospital stays.  This in turn can decrease the associated materials  use and related environmental impacts. For example:  •	 Our Sharesource remote patient management  platform may improve survival rates and reduce  hospitalizations. Learn more.  •	 Expanded hemodialysis therapy, enabled by the  Theranova dialyzer, may reduce hospitalization  rates by 18% compared with standard hemodialysis.  Learn more.  •	 Using active hemostatic products alone was  associated with lower rates of bleeding-related  complications, shorter hospital stays and reduced  total hospital costs compared with combined use  of passive and active hemostats.

Examples  from 2021 include:1 •	 Australia and New Zealand: At all of our com- pounding sites in Australia and New Zealand,  we replaced non-recyclable foil and polystyrene  with recyclable, biodegradable package lining  made from 100% sheep’s wool in boxes used to  distribute products to customers. The new liner  provides additional cushioning for the products  and protection from heat and moisture.  •	 Mexico: For our IV solutions and renal products  (6L and twin bag) being distributed in Mexico,  our Cuernavaca site replaced the solvent-based  adhesive used for the cardboard shipping boxes  with a water-based adhesive. For our 6L renal  solutions being shipped to the United States,  the site replaced virgin cardboard boxes sourced  from the United States with boxes made from  100% recycled content that are manufactured by a  local vendor. We expect these efforts to eliminate  the use of 1,396 metric tons of virgin material on  an annual basis. •	 Belgium: We implemented a project at our  facility in Lessines to reduce the thickness of the  low-density polyethylene (LDPE) liner in the   Nutrition product carton box. We expect this  project to reduce LDPE use by 57 metric tons  per year and save $165,000 annually. Operations Baxter works to reduce nonhazardous and regulated  waste, and to increase recycling at our manufacturing  and office facilities.  Plastic scrap from manufacturing was our largest  waste stream, representing more than 40% of our  nonhazardous waste in 2021. As a result, reducing  plastic scrap is a significant priority for our company  and several of our facilities implemented or contin- ued reuse, reduction and recycling projects in 2021.  Examples include:  •	 Italy: In 2020, our manufacturing sites in Valtellina  (Grosotto and Sondalo) partnered with a waste  company to convert scrap film into small plastic  granules that are used as raw materials to  produce plastic items, such as boxes and pallets.  In 2021, we diverted 182 metric tons of plastic  scrap for reuse through this initiative, of which  28 metric tons were used for production of plastic  pallets for Valtellina.  •	 Switzerland: In San Vittore, we reduced film scrap  by 70 metric tons compared with 2020. In 2021,  the site captured and converted 930 metric tons of  film into plastic granules that were sold externally.  •	 United States: Our Marion (North Cove), North  Carolina, facility captures plastic scrap and then  regrinds and recycles it for reuse in manufactur- ing processes. In 2021, the site used nearly 2,500  metric tons of PVC regrind and 168 metric tons of  high-density polyethylene (HDPE) regrind. To manage waste disposal appropriately and to com- ply with applicable regulatory requirements, Baxter  requires facilities to dispose of all hazardous or other  regulated waste at disposal sites that Baxter has  inspected or from which the company has otherwise  received sufficient assurance of acceptable perfor- mance. Baxter applies the same waste site auditing  standards worldwide and trains internal auditors  to evaluate disposal site risk consistently. In addi- tion, Baxter works with CHWMEG, Inc., a nonprofit  organization that enables companies to collectively  purchase expert waste site audits.  Waste reduction and recycling help us decrease  the waste we send to landfills. In 2021, 21 of our  manufacturing sites2 (41% of the total) achieved or  exceeded landfill diversion rates of 95%. Thirteen  additional sites (25% of the total) achieved diversion  rates of 80% or higher.  BAXTER 2021 WASTE AND RECYCLING IN OPERATIONS     * Total waste includes nonhazardous and regulated waste. To more closely reflect production efficiency and support consistent evaluation of facility performance and trends,            we exclude certain nonroutine, nonproduction-related waste streams from our total waste performance data. These waste streams are construction and demolition debris,          remediation waste, wastewater treatment sludge and discarded manufacturing and process-related machinery or equipment.   ** We report “regulated waste” rather than “hazardous waste.” This term includes some materials that would otherwise be classified as nonhazardous waste in some countries, 	        which helps Baxter harmonize waste reporting across locations. In addition to waste typically considered hazardous (such as toxics and corrosives), we also include oils,            biohazardous or infectious materials, batteries, fluorescent lamps and other materials that may not be defined as hazardous waste by national legislation at the point of origin. *** Incineration with energy recovery is considered recycling.   71,200   metric tons  Total Waste* Nonhazardous Waste Regulated Waste** 5,300  metric tons  (7.5% of total waste) 14.0%  decrease in absolute  terms, compared  with 2020 20.2% decrease indexed to  revenue, compared  with 2020 65,900  metric tons  (92.5% of total  waste) 0.9% decrease in  absolute terms,  compared with 2020 8.0% decrease indexed  to revenue,  compared with 2020 Recycling*** 79.6%  of nonhazardous waste recycled 77.1%  overall  recycling rate  48.6%  of regulated waste recycled $2.5  million in net income generated through recycling Photo:  Wool liners protect  and insulate compounded  products in Australia and  New Zealand.  ===== PAGE 32 ===== Baxter 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report   3 2 Protect   Our Planet Corporate Responsibility Commitment Introduction 2030 Corporate  Responsibility Goals Empower   Our Patients Appendix Champion Our People  and Communities Cross-Cutting  Commitments Product Distribution Baxter aims to conserve natural resources and reduce  waste wherever possible during product distribution. Our EMEA region uses more than 1 million pallets a  year. In 2021, we introduced a conservation project to  reduce cost and pallet turnover. This initiative increases  pallet circularity and extends pallet life through:  •	 Increasing the return rate for pallets we ship to  customers so we can reuse those pallets for future  shipments  •	 Replacing wooden pallets used for home deliveries  with plastic pallets, which we reuse for subsequent  deliveries •	 Recovering U.S. pallets received in Europe for reuse  in U.S.-bound shipments •	 Using second-hand pallets or pallets made from  recycled content  We expect this initiative to significantly reduce the  number of pallets Baxter purchases, leading to sub- stantial cost savings. Furthermore, we have created  global guidance for recycled pallet use. Product End-of-Life While Baxter’s 2030 goal to implement strategic  materials and waste management plans focuses on  our integrated supply chain, product end-of-life  remains a priority for our company. We work with  customers, industry peers and recycling and disposal  vendors to facilitate the recycling and responsible  treatment of medical products. To support broader  advances in this area, Baxter is a charter member of  the Healthcare Plastics Recycling Council (HPRC). Disposable Medical Products Baxter has programs to facilitate recycling for  patients and hospitals in Australia, New Zealand,  Guatemala and Colombia.  Australia and New Zealand: We collaborate with  partners to recover used Baxter PVC fluid bags and  aluminum anesthetic gas bottles from hospitals in  Australia and New Zealand. In 2021, we collected  140 metric tons of PVC and 0.5 metric tons of alu- minum bottles for recycling, saving our customers  approximately $106,000 that would have otherwise  been spent on disposal. Guatemala: We partner with Biotrash, a Central  American waste management company, to collect  and recycle PVC and polypropylene from hospitals  and dialysis clinics in Guatemala, equaling 15.3  metric tons in 2021. Biotrash recycles PVC to make  shoe soles and uses recovered polypropylene to  manufacture bricks for use in its own facilities. Colombia: In 2021, Baxter Renal Care Services in  Colombia collected 69.4 metric tons of PVC for  recycling from dialysis clinics and home dialysis  patients. The collection program for home dialysis  patients alone was responsible for 38.4 metric tons  of the PVC collected, a significant increase compared  with 14.7 metric tons collected the prior year. We  partner with organizations that use the recovered  PVC to make chairs, water hoses, accessories for  purses, shoe soles and other items. Electronic Equipment Some of the electromechanical medical devices we  sell, such as automated peritoneal dialysis (APD)  cyclers, support serviceability, repair and reuse.  We lease certain types of electromechanical medical  products to customers and patients, which allows  for those products to be returned to Baxter. In 2021,  most of our previous generation of APD cyclers in  EMEA reached end-of-service. The decommissioned  devices were sent to a Baxter recovery center for  critical spare parts harvesting or for recertification  for reuse in other markets. This recovery of about  6,200 devices and spare parts avoided approximately  105 metric tons of waste. Regulations in many countries worldwide require  responsible recycling of electronic products when  reuse is no longer an option. In 2021, our vendors  recovered approximately 110 metric tons of electronic  equipment in the EU on Baxter’s behalf, in compliance  with the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment  (WEEE) Directive. Our WEEE website provides custom- ers detailed information on how to return or dispose of  Baxter products in accordance with the directive. MOVING FORWARD >> Assessing waste generation sources across Baxter will  provide us with opportunities to improve data quality,  address information gaps and standardize processes.  Our employees and cross-functional collaboration will  be essential in striving toward our 2030 waste goal. We  also expect near-term opportunities as we implement  a new EHS&S information management system.

At the  same time, we prioritize environmental compliance  and operational excellence. These efforts have been  cost-effective and enhance the company’s environ- mental performance while furthering our objective  to be an environmental leader in our industry.  We  also work to identify and reduce the environmental  impacts of our supply chain and products. Baxter’s EHS&S Policy outlines our commitment  within our operations and across the value chain  to prioritize compliance, promote health and safety,  and protect the planet.  ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY  PERFORMANCE In 2021, we took significant steps to further  strengthen EHS&S governance, adding dedicated  roles to our team focused on our assurance  activities, management systems and our digital  transformation. This new structure re-affirms our  commitment to compliance and operational  excellence, supports achievement of our goals and  helps to create long-term business value. Management Systems We follow a management systems approach guided by  our global EHS&S requirements. We apply the ISO 14001  standard to manage our environmental aspects and   the ISO 45001 standard to manage our health and safety  hazards and risks. As of year-end 2021, 62 Baxter  locations were ISO certified, of which 61 met ISO 14001  and 45 met ISO 45001 requirements. Of these 62 total  certified locations, 47 are manufacturing sites (78% of  total Baxter manufacturing locations2). Audits Baxter’s EHS&S audit program helps to ensure that  our facilities have programs that satisfy applicable  regulatory requirements and are consistent with our  EHS&S requirements, objectives and goals. In addition  to conducting internal EHS&S audits in 2021, Baxter  also utilized third parties to conduct EHS&S audits in  26 facilities.3 Compliance Environmental compliance and health and safety   compliance are foundational to Baxter’s EHS&S  program. We address instances of noncompliance with  urgency, work to identify root causes and implement  controls to help prevent recurrence. In 2021, we  received 12 environmental Notices of Violation (NOVs).  Eight NOVs were related to events that occurred prior  to 2021, and the other four were related to events that  occurred in 2021. Eleven were received at facilities  Environmental, Health, Safety and Sustainability  Governance and Additional Disclosures  Apex Companies, LLC has provided assurance  on the content in this section.  ===== PAGE 34 ===== Baxter 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report   3 4 Protect   Our Planet Corporate Responsibility Commitment Introduction 2030 Corporate  Responsibility Goals Empower   Our Patients Appendix Champion Our People  and Communities Cross-Cutting  Commitments STRIVING FOR FULL MATERIALS  DISCLOSURE Baxter’s corporate responsibility approach prioritizes  compliance with product chemical and medical device  regulations. Working with a third party, we collect data  from suppliers to determine the use of materials of  high concern. This helps us to confirm compliance with  global material regulations and assists us in proactively  monitoring the impact that changes in global legislation  might have on our product portfolio. We also continue  to leverage third-party testing, which provides us with  full material data and LCAs for many of our devices,  helps validate device compliance with chemical legis- lation, and provides information we need to respond  to environmental questionnaires from customers. As  of the end of 2021, we completed testing for 173 of  our products, which covered more than 16,500 parts.  This included many of our electromechanical devices,  which are the most complex products in our portfolio  in terms of number of parts and materials. Additionally, as a member of MedTech Europe, we are  working with other multinational pharmaceutical/ medical device companies to drive full materials  disclosure in global material compliance, and we  contribute to several working groups. We support  greater understanding of the hazardous substances  requirements of the EU Medical Device Regulation by  sharing information within Baxter and across the  industry related to our full materials disclosure  testing and analysis program, including materials  commonly used in products that could potentially be  replaced or eliminated. This supports consistent  interpretation and efficient compliance with related  regulations within the industry. To inform our efforts,  we also monitor ongoing developments with the  RoHS Directive and REACH Regulation. MATERIALS OF CONCERN Our global strategies and programs help ensure  that we meet product materials restrictions. In  addition, we work to avoid or minimize materials of  concern as part of our EHS&S product reviews and  by consulting numerous regulatory lists. These reg- ulations and lists include, but are not limited to: •	 EU REACH Substances of Very High Concern •	 EU RoHS Directive •	 EU Medical Devices Regulation •	 U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act •	 U.S. SEC conflict minerals •	 California Proposition 65 In 2021, we continued to move away from products  containing substances of concern in all regions.  This includes launching a non-DEHP version of  30 solution sets and 19 irrigation solutions, and  retiring eight elastomeric infusion pumps which  contained DEHP in the Americas, EMEA and APAC.  We also upgraded our Evo IQ LVP Pump (in the  Americas, EMEA and APAC) and Starling Monitors  (in EMEA) to RoHS-3 compliance. Additionally,  Baxter converted 120 global solution sets to limit  perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in accordance with  EU regulations. Other substances we seek to avoid or minimize  include endocrine disrupters, latex, phthalates,  volatile organic compounds and others that might  not be included in the lists above. See Baxter’s  position statements on Proposition 65, REACH,  and conflict minerals, and our most recent Conflict  Minerals Report. in the United States and Puerto Rico, and one was  received at a Baxter Renal Care Services site in  Colombia for an event that occurred in 2016. No  fines related to the environmental NOVs noted above  were assessed in 2021. We also received two health  and safety letters during the year, one at a facility  in China and the other at a site in the United States.  One health and safety fine for $7,802 was assessed in  2021 related to the NOV in the United States. View the  Baxter Data Summary for more detail.   Wastewater discharged from Baxter operations has  historically been, and remains, an important focus  of our compliance program. In 2021, 85% of Baxter’s  self-reported environmental incidents were exceed- ances or noncompliances of permitted wastewater  discharge requirements; 93% of those were from the  Americas region (North America and Latin America)  and the remaining 7% were from the EMEA region.  None of these noncompliances resulted in a fine. To  manage these matters, Baxter applied both internal  and external resources and worked to enhance  internal wastewater operational practices, training  and other facility engagement opportunities.  Baxter has reduced emissions of hazardous air  pollutants (HAPs) significantly during the last several  decades as it has been an area of focus since 1988.  Baxter continues to reduce emissions of HAPs. In  2021, HAPs from our Mountain Home, Arkansas,  facility were reduced by more than 65% of 2020 levels  due, in part, to the investment of what will be a total  of over $50 million in state-of-the-art control tech- nology. We continue to evaluate additional upgrades  across our facilities.

By pledging to contribute  $275 million over the next 10 years, we aim to tackle some of the world’s toughest health and social challenges  by leveraging our expertise and experience, as well as our employees’ passion to accelerate community-driven  solutions alongside leading global partners. We cultivate innovative partnerships and catalyze positive impact in  communities where our employees live and work, prioritizing social investments and solutions where we can make  a meaningful difference.  We engage three philanthropic channels to reach underserved communities, helping those with the least  resources remove barriers to healthcare access. These include product donations and charitable giving from  Baxter and the Baxter International Foundation (the Foundation).  Product Donations Through Baxter’s product donations, we address unmet healthcare needs and improve health outcomes in un- derserved communities by supporting community-based health programs, medical missions and natural disaster  preparedness and response efforts. To advance our commitment, we proactively build product donations into our  corporate responsibility strategy by manufacturing products twice a year purposely for donation to our trusted  humanitarian partners. This manufacture-to-donate strategy, an industry best practice, enables partners to rely  on having Baxter’s critically needed, long-dated products available year-round—not solely during emergency  situations—to help provide sustained support for underserved communities around the world. In 2021, we donated  products valued at more than $36 million1 through this program to Americares, Direct Relief and Partners In Health. We also continued to make chemotherapy drugs available through our U.S. Patient Assistance Program. This program  supports cancer patients who have financial barriers to access and lack insurance or prescription drug coverage. 2030 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY GOAL:   Invest $275 million in underserved  communities through strategic partnerships and product donations from Baxter and the  Baxter International Foundation. PERFORMANCE:   In 2021, Baxter and the Baxter International Foundation invested  nearly $52 million in underserved communities through strategic partnerships,  grants and product donations. *By Baxter and the Baxter International Foundation.  **Through the Baxter Manufacture-to-Donate program. Value of products donated (provided at no cost) is provided by partners based on wholesale acquisition cost at the time of donation.

Since 1996,  Baxter and the Foundation have provided $19 million  to advance STEM education. In 2021, key partnerships  included:  •	 The Illinois Science and Technology Institute’s  annual STEM Challenge engaged 24 Baxter  employees to serve as mentors for high school  students participating in the six-month program  to develop innovative solutions for real-world  business challenges in STEM fields. During the  year, students were tasked with developing new  technologies to improve patient health outcomes  through telehealth and access to clean water. •	 Since 1996, Baxter and the Foundation have  supported FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition  of Science and Technology) Robotics’ mission, to  inspire young people to be science and technology  leaders and innovators. As a founding member,  we’ve provided more than $3 million in funding for  local teams and regional competitions.  In addition to supporting organizations devoted to STEM  education, the Foundation also awards merit-based  scholarships to our employees’ children. A third party  evaluates student applications based on academic,  extracurricular and employment accomplishments. In  2021, the Foundation awarded 103 new scholarships  and renewed 160 scholarships for students from 29  countries worldwide.  The Foundation supports and amplifies the giving  and volunteer efforts of Baxter’s employees through  its Matching Gift and Dollars for Doers programs. In  2021, the Foundation provided more than $709,000  to match employee giving and $40,000 in Dollars for  Doers volunteer grants.  In 2021, the Foundation also continued sponsoring  prize programs that recognize organizations and indi- viduals who have made outstanding contributions and  exhibited leadership in healthcare research and health  service delivery.  •	 The William B. Graham Prize  •	 The Foster G. McGaw Prize •	 The Episteme Award  Reaching Vulnerable Communities Globally Through Americares Baxter partners with humanitarian organizations in various ways to carry out our mission to save and sustain  lives. One of our longstanding partners is Americares, an organization we have collaborated with since 1987.  Through our Manufacture-to-Donate program, Americares distributes Baxter products globally to provide  relief in emergency situations. In 2021, we donated products valued at $2.5 million3 to this partner. We also  became a supporter of the Americares Emergency Response Fund to help ensure pre-positioned funding  is available for rapid deployment through its emergency network at the onset of a disaster. In addition,  we support U.S. medical outreach teams that travel overseas to provide charitable care to underserved  populations. While fewer medical mission trips occurred in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Americares  distributed Baxter products in 15 countries as part of 32 medical mission trips.

Baxter 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report   3 8 BAXTER GLOBAL CHARITABLE GIVING, 2021 Disaster Relief We provide disaster relief support through in- vestments in preparedness, immediate response  and recovery efforts that expand access to care  in collaboration with our humanitarian partners.  Our response to disasters can include product  donations as well as cash giving from the Baxter  International Foundation. In 2021, we provided  disaster relief globally in the form of cash and  products, including for an earthquake in Haiti,  tornadoes and storms in the United States and  global COVID-19 humanitarian response efforts. MOVING FORWARD >> Our approach to community investment has evolved in  recent years due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a greater  focus on racial justice. We have expanded our efforts to  increase access to healthcare and promote commu- nity resilience through strategic engagement with our  partners. We have gained a greater understanding of their  most pressing needs and responded accordingly with our  community investments. We expect this trend to continue.   To further elevate our strategic approach, we plan to  build digital monitoring and evaluation systems to collect,  analyze and share data related to the impact of our giving.  We will also expand opportunities for our employees to  engage in community support around the world.  * Reflects programmatic location of Baxter  International Foundation grants and  scholarships and business and facility cash  donations mapped by location of Baxter  office outside the United States.

Every  employee has the right to a work environment free of  recognized hazards, with safety protocols to help keep  them injury-free. This is a fundamental value for our  company as we strive to be a best place to work. Our  strategy for the next decade prioritizes the elimination  of major and high-frequency injuries,1 complemented  by ongoing digital analytics and employee engagement,  training and mentoring to drive continual improvement.  Baxter follows a management-systems approach guided  by our global Environmental, Health, Safety and Sustain- ability (EHS&S) requirements. For more about Baxter’s  EHS&S Policy and management system, see Environ- mental, Health, Safety and Sustainability Governance and  Additional Disclosures. We define the responsibilities of  corporate, regional and facility-level occupational health  and safety professionals and hold leaders accountable for  achieving goals and targets. In 2021, the EHS&S  organization reported employee safety performance to  senior leadership and manufacturing and supply chain  management monthly. EHS&S also communicates  performance annually to Baxter’s Board of Directors.  During the year, we continued to engage our operational  workforce in hazard identification and immediate  corrective actions where feasible. Injury and illness  metrics provide focus for Baxter’s safety, occupational  health and industrial hygiene efforts. We continue to  target ergonomics, as well as slips, trips and falls—two  of the primary sources of injury at the company. Focusing on high-hazard sources, we analyze our most  severe historical incidents with a cross-functional team  to identify root-cause trends, formulate mitigation  strategies and share knowledge across the organization.  We hold “stand down” meetings as a forum for  operational leaders to engage employees in frontline  education concerning specific risks. During these  meetings, all other operational activity stops so employees  can focus on an emerging trend or specific risk. We are also integrating health and safety considerations  throughout Baxter’s product quality system so that  safety becomes even more central to our core business  operations. Improving Ergonomics for  Baxter Product Delivery Drivers  In 2021, we conducted a pilot program to evaluate  ergonomic techniques used by drivers who deliver  Baxter renal products to patients’ homes. Through  this program we captured video of the drivers  performing various delivery tasks and then used  artificial intelligence to identify the detailed body  mechanics required for those tasks. We evaluated  eight tasks, comparing different techniques  to determine best practices and potential  opportunities to improve ergonomics and help  avoid injuries. These will provide the basis for  future coaching and training of drivers.

Our ongoing  work to drive continuous improvement, raise  awareness about common injuries sustained by  employees and engage operational leaders in  efforts to reduce injury and illness are helping  to improve our workplace safety performance.  Four major incidents4 occurred at Baxter in  2021, compared with 12 the prior year. See the Baxter Data Summary for workplace  safety data by region and major incidents. Baxter’s occupational health function, in partnership  with Human Resources and Global Communications,  develops health and wellness strategies for the  company to help our employees take care of their  personal well-being. A global team of diverse health  professionals and volunteers, known as Local  Champions, helps refine and implement these  approaches and set priorities. Through BeWell@Baxter, our global employee  health and wellness program, we promote healthy  lifestyles. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic,  we transitioned BeWell@Baxter campaigns to virtual  sessions or activities and launched Monthly Wellness  Days to emphasize the importance of physical, mental  and social well-being. In 2021, these programs  MOVING FORWARD >> As we look ahead, we will continue to prioritize a  zero-harm workplace in an effort to drive down  injuries. In future years, we expect to enhance  our approach with digital solutions and data  analytics to develop risk profiles and identify  leading indicators for prioritization. We will also  continue to engage our employees with real-time  coaching about safe work practices and empower  them to take charge of safety in the workplace.  Finally, we will drive continuing improvement  through standardized global training, safety  engineering for equipment and mentoring activities. focused on total well-being and included topics  such as mental health, stress management,  career wellness, environmental wellness and the  importance of laughter.

APPROACH AND PROGRESS One critical way Baxter supports diversity, equity and  inclusion (DE&I) at our company is through a holistic and  comprehensive analysis of internal diversity metrics. We  track the representation of women globally and under- represented minorities in the United States at every  career level across the employee life cycle from hiring  through exit. We include this data in quarterly dash- boards that Baxter leaders review to understand the  company’s progress and identify potential opportunities  to help further advance diversity across the organization. Baxter has reported employee ethnic and gender  diversity data in our corporate responsibility report  for more than two decades, with increasing detail  over time. For the last several years, we have also  reported aspirational diversity representation goals  based on leading industry benchmarks. In 2021, we  relied on a data-driven approach to help us establish  appropriate goals for our company by engaging a third  party to conduct rigorous labor market and internal  availability analyses. While all forms of diversity at every career level are  important to Baxter, our current goals focus on women  (globally) and ethnic minorities (United States) in lead- ership roles.1,2  We focus on these two areas because we  believe they provide the greatest opportunities for us to  drive meaningful change. We have robust, multiyear data  sets in these areas, as well as mechanisms to continue  gathering and verifying data moving forward. See the  Baxter Data Summary for additional diversity data. We aim to achieve our diversity goals by continuing our  efforts to attract, retain and develop diverse talent and  foster an inclusive workplace. We will further develop  our detailed plans to help achieve these goals in 2022  and will continue to report progress annually. While our aspirational diversity goals are a priority for  Baxter, we are equally focused on advancing an inclusive  culture where all people feel they belong and can be  their authentic selves. We have metrics and reporting in  place to assess and share how we are doing in this area  (e.g., our Best Place to Work survey data). This ongoing  measurement and assessment provides essential input  that is critical to advancing our DE&I strategy.  Learn more about how we drive diversity in leadership  and across all levels of the company. MOVING FORWARD >> We plan to evaluate and refine our goals as needed after  periodic assessments of labor market data compared  with our workforce data and will report any directional  changes in future reports.  2 percentage points  women in leadership roles (globally)*   2 percentage points  ethnic minorities in leadership roles (United States)*   Champion Our People  and Communities Corporate Responsibility Commitment Introduction 2030 Corporate  Responsibility Goals Empower   Our Patients Protect   Our Planet Appendix Cross-Cutting  Commitments  ===== PAGE 42 ===== Baxter 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report   4 2 Cross-Cutting  Commitments Corporate Responsibility Commitment Introduction 2030 Corporate  Responsibility Goals Empower   Our Patients Protect   Our Planet Champion Our People  and Communities Appendix Ethics and Compliance . . . . . . . 43 Human Rights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 45 Diversity, Equity and   Inclusion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .46 Privacy and Data Protection . . . 51 Our 2030 Corporate  Responsibility  Commitment and  Goals are bolstered  by our approach to  good governance and  responsible business  practices.

We prioritize following  legal requirements, being honest and fair, keeping  promises, encouraging questions and valuing  discussion—always reinforcing the importance of  personal accountability and integrity. Patients,  doctors, customers, regulators, investors, communi- ties and our employees count on it. COMPANYWIDE ACCOUNTABILITY Baxter has compliance committees for each country  or cluster of countries where we operate to further  integrate ethics and compliance in strategic plans  and day-to-day activities. To help ensure the local  implementation of our global ethics and compliance  program, the business lead of each country or cluster  holds mandatory quarterly meetings to facilitate  discussion among local leadership about key issues,  challenges and risks in their area. This approach, in  conjunction with enterprise-wide established codes,  policies, trainings and monitoring and assessment  practices, enables us to more effectively target  specific needs and drive ownership of and responsi- bility for ethics and compliance worldwide.

In 2021, approximately 97%  of employees completed the training. In addition to  this training, we conducted an employee engagement  campaign to reinforce the importance of ethics and  compliance. More than 17,000 email-enabled employ- ees received a questionnaire, asking them to indicate  whether they had read and agreed to comply with the  Baxter Code of Conduct and to affirm that they were  aware of their responsibility to report any violations.  Of those who received the questionnaire, more than  98% affirmed their commitment to these items. We  developed a related communication campaign to reach  those who did not receive the formal questionnaire.1   Select employees also complete ethics and compliance  online courses relevant to their jobs every other year  on a rotational basis. These courses cover topics  addressed in Baxter’s Global Interactions Policy and  Third Party Program.  Training for our Third Party Program policy is avail- able in 18 languages. In 2021, 10,300 employees took  this training. We also offer training to all third parties  through our due diligence processing tool. In 2021,  we updated the training for third parties to reflect  changes in our Global Interactions Policy.  In addition to the anticorruption content covered by the  Code of Conduct and Global Interactions Policy training,  our sales force participates in business-led, interactive  workshops/trainings related to ethical interactions  with the medical community and government officials,  including discussion of real-life scenarios. At Baxter,  off-label promotion is strictly prohibited by policy.  This prohibition is included in our annual training to  the Sales organization.

The program  and policy apply to Baxter employees, officers  and directors involved in the review, retention and  monitoring of third parties.  In 2021, we launched an Annual Certification Ques- tionnaire to all existing third parties to help assure  that our third-party partners continue to comply with  the terms of their agreements with Baxter and with  all applicable laws, rules and regulations. COMPLIANCE ASSESSMENTS  Baxter completes risk-based compliance  assessments and audits each year, which cover  antibribery, anticorruption and trade compliance,  among other topics. Our Global Ethics and  Compliance function selects locations to audit and  assess based on factors such as business complexity,  size, risk of corruption, the nature of interactions  with the medical community and third parties,  enforcement trends and the results of compliance  monitoring and investigations. Compliance  assessments and audits also focus on relationships  with third parties that represent the company to  customers, including the medical community,  patients and government officials and entities. In 2021, we conducted two compliance assessments  using Global Audit and Ethics and Compliance  resources: one in our Europe, Middle East and Africa  (EMEA) region and one in Latin America. These  assessments were performed remotely as a result  of COVID-19.  We also performed remote compliance audits of 24  distributors globally in 2021. The audits covered eight  distributors in EMEA, seven in Latin America and nine  in Asia Pacific. Additionally, Baxter worked with external consultants  to perform a legal risk assessment of the company’s  Trade Compliance and Anti-Trust programs. We are using  the findings from these exercises to further enhance  and mature our program policies and operations. COMPLIANCE MONITORING Baxter has deployed a data analytics–based  monitoring system. The tool is used to perform review  of compliance risk metrics, as well as facilitates  forensic monitoring procedures in eight countries,  including Brazil, China, Italy and Vietnam, among  others. The countries are selected on the basis of  their past monitoring and assessment results,  feedback from Ethics and Compliance Assessments,  country compliance environment and taking into  account past investigations, if any. This system  enables us to perform near-real-time monitoring of  metrics related to travel, entertainment, interactions  with healthcare professionals and government  officials and corruption-related due diligence for  certain in-scope third parties. Transactions identified  as potentially problematic are reviewed by the Ethics  and Compliance Investigations team as appropriate.  RELATIONSHIPS WITH HEALTHCARE  PROFESSIONALS AND GOVERNMENT  OFFICIALS Baxter is committed to transparent reporting about  relationships with the medical community and  government officials. This includes the continued  implementation of anticorruption programs to help  ensure that these relationships and the related fair  market value payments are for necessary and genuine  services. Our Global Interactions Policy defines the  principles and rules governing our interactions with  government officials and members of the medical  community. In 2021, we released an update to the policy  related to virtual interactions and related controls.  The Global Interactions Policy also provides guidance  for corporate charitable giving to help ensure compli- ance with the law and with Baxter policy. We have  local Contributions Management Committees in  select countries, clusters of countries or regions.  Where they exist, those local committees have  decision-making authority for charitable contribution  requests from nonprofit and for-profit healthcare and  patient organizations. The Baxter International  Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Baxter Interna- tional Inc., is a separate legal entity governed by its  own Board of Directors and distinct grantmaking  guidelines that govern its charitable contributions to  nonprofit organizations. ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE HELPLINE  In 2021, Baxter logged 634 reports from 33 countries  into our Ethics and Compliance Helpline system and  closed 638 cases that were received through 2021.2  All  reports received during the year involving allegations  of misconduct were promptly triaged for investigation.  For the substantiated cases closed in 2021, appropriate  remediation (e.g., training or adoption of new or  changed processes) was or is being implemented  where warranted. In substantiated cases involving  employee misconduct, employees received appropri- ate disciplinary action based on the nature of the  misconduct and other relevant factors. Disciplinary  action can include a range of outcomes, including  coaching and training, verbal or written warnings,  compensation reduction or termination.

As outlined  in our Global Human Rights Policy, we respect the  human rights, dignity and diverse contributions of  all individuals.  Fostering human rights takes many forms at Baxter  and is reflected in our policies and initiatives in areas  including workplace inclusion; employee safety;  supply chain labor practices (see below); ethical  conduct; access to healthcare; and patient, employee  and customer privacy. Also see information about our  actions in 2021 related to COVID-19 and racial justice. PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS IN OUR  SUPPLY CHAIN Baxter’s suppliers must commit to respecting human  rights, either in accordance with our Global Human  Rights Policy or under their own similar policies.  Any suppliers who register with Baxter through our  supplier registration portal must read our Global  Human Rights Policy and the Baxter Code of Conduct  and indicate whether they agree with the commitments  therein. To better understand our suppliers’ corporate  responsibility programs and performance, including  related to labor and human rights, we conduct an  annual Supplier Corporate Responsibility Survey. Baxter adheres to supply chain transparency require- ments where applicable, through publicly available  statements. In addition to our Global Human Rights  Policy, Baxter’s UK Modern Slavery Statement declares  our commitments and approach to help ensure that our  local operations and global supply chain are free from  modern slavery practices, including child labor, forced  and bonded labor, and human trafficking. In 2021,  Baxter Australia published its first Modern Slavery  Statement as well. We also have position statements  related to the California Transparency in Supply Chains  Act of 2010 and conflict minerals, and we publish an  annual Conflict Minerals Report.

Baxter’s approximately 60,000 employees1 include people  of different races, ethnicities, genders, orientations,  abilities, backgrounds and beliefs from many different  countries and cultures. We embrace this diversity,   enhancing our company’s culture of belonging and   embedding diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) across  all aspects of our business, including for our employees   and prospective employees, the communities we support  globally through strategic investments, our suppliers,  and our customers and patients. We focus on four  strategic pillars to guide our commitment worldwide  (see graphic).  WORKFORCE Increasing the diversity of our workforce improves the  way we think and innovate and makes us more agile  as a company.  Diversity in Leadership Advancing a diverse workforce begins at the top. We  aim to have our company leadership reflect the diver- sity of our organization and the communities where  we operate. This begins with our Board of Directors  (Board) and leadership teams, which help influence  and inspire our desired culture and drive greater  representation at other levels in the organization. See  the Baxter Data Summary and our 2020 Employment  Information Report (EEO-1) and 2021 EEO-1 Report for  workforce diversity data.  Board Diversity Baxter’s Board is committed to achieving a diverse  and broadly inclusive membership. As a result, and  consistent with our Corporate Governance Guidelines  and the charter of the Nominating, Corporate  Governance & Public Policy Committee, diversity of  background, gender, race, ethnicity, country of origin,  age and experience are relevant factors in the selection  process. Additionally, the Board looks to create a diverse  candidate pool when searching for new directors.  Of the eight directors most recently appointed to  Baxter’s Board, five are women or are ethnically or  racially diverse. The Board believes that having  diverse directors with varying perspectives and a  breadth of experience will positively contribute to  robust discussion and help guide Baxter’s strategy  and long-term value creation.  The Board conducts an annual assessment of itself  and its committees to help identify potential gaps or  areas to augment in light of the company’s strategies,  including by taking into account the overall diversity  of the Board. Approximately 31% of our Board is composed of  female directors and approximately 23% of our  Board is ethnically/racially diverse.2 These percent- ages are scheduled to increase to approximately  33% and to 25%, respectively, on June 30, 2022, in  connection with Peter Hellman’s retirement.

In 2021, to drive more rigor in this  area, we embedded Workforce Diversity Reviews in our  talent strategy discussions with company leaders  globally. These reviews enable discussions about our  organization’s diversity data and metrics, specifically  related to underrepresented groups.3  Our aim for these  reviews is to ensure that underrepresented employees  are not overlooked for development, sponsorship,  succession, advancement and retention opportunities.  Aspirational Leadership  Diversity Goals To drive more accountability and intention to  advance and sustain our leadership diversity, we  have established aspirational goals, as part of our  2030 Corporate Responsibility Commitment and  Goals, to increase the representation of women  (globally) and ethnic minorities (United States) in  leadership roles. We will provide updates on our  progress annually in this corporate responsibly  report. Learn more in Increase Representation of  Women and Ethnic Minorities in Leadership Roles.  Sponsorship and Mentorship Baxter’s sponsorship and mentorship programs  help drive engagement, retention and career  advancement for women and underrepresented  groups. Our mentoring opportunities, resources and  tools are for all employees, including entry level,  middle management and ethnically diverse em- ployee populations. These mentoring relationships  may include traditional, peer or reverse mentoring,  as well as mentoring circles conducted in a group  setting. All employees can participate in mentorship  as part of their development plan at any given point  of the year. Employees can identify mentors and/ or managers can recommend mentorship based on  their employees’ development needs. Baxter’s eight Business Resource Groups (BRGs)  also offer a global mentoring program specifically  designed to connect their diverse membership  with leaders at the company. These mentoring  relationships provide development and coaching  opportunities for employees from a variety of ethnic  backgrounds, genders, sexual orientations and  generations, as well as veterans and those with  disabilities.  Leadership Development  We partner with external organizations to offer lead- ership development programs that support women  and underrepresented ethnic minorities, including:  •	 Black Leadership Academy (McKinsey): This  leadership program helps high-potential Black  employees to reflect on and plan for professional  and personal aspirations to accelerate career  progression. •	 Courageous Conversations about Race   (Pacific Education Group): This program, piloted  with a cohort of Baxter leaders in 2021, helps  build critical skills for having challenging   conversations with a strong focus on racial equity  and race relationships.   •	 HBA Ambassador Program (Healthcare   Businesswomen’s Association): This program  helps women set and reach professional   development goals, facilitated by senior leaders  within the company and guidance from a network  of HBA advisors.   •	 Monthly Global People Manager Meetings:   These live virtual events, led by the CEO, focus on  culture transformation efforts. In 2021, three of  the events explored DE&I by welcoming external  experts along with members of the Baxter com- munity to engage in courageous conversations  about DE&I.

The GIC’s mission is to focus on the advancement  of women and underrepresented groups (including  people of different races/ethnicities, generations and  sexual orientations as well as veterans and people  with disabilities) and to drive inclusive leadership  capabilities and culture. The GIC is responsible for  advocating and driving our global DE&I priorities, as  well as developing and implementing local inclusion  priorities.  In early 2021, we formally embedded the GIC into  Baxter’s executive leadership structure. The GIC  consists of members of our Executive Leadership  Team and the executive sponsors of our BRGs.  This change reinforces the importance of DE&I at  the highest levels of our company and will help  further align the activities of our GIC with those of  our BRGs. Business Resource Groups Baxter’s BRGs are an important component of cre- ating an inclusive and diverse culture within Baxter  and advancing our priorities in the communities  where we operate. These employee-run affinity  groups play a critical role in the company’s efforts  to recruit, retain and engage employees, and they  provide forums for employees to develop skills,  experience valuable cultural connections and sup- port key business initiatives. The BRGs support our  business goals and aim to enhance personal growth  and multicultural understanding, while strength- ening relationships among employees, customers,  business partners and community partners. Our BRGs  have positively impacted employee benefits, policies,  holiday/time off approaches, accessible technology,  racial justice efforts and workplace flexibility. We have eight established BRGs and encourage  all employees to get involved. As of 2022, those  BRGs include: Alliance for Baxter Women, Asian  Leadership Network, BaxVET, Black Professional  Alliance, Early Career Professionals, enABLES,  HOLA and PRIDE. ACT: Activating Change Today Council  In 2020, Baxter established our ACT Council to  advance racial justice globally at Baxter. This council,  chaired by the CEO and composed of employees at  various levels, was established to drive meaningful,  sustainable change and address racial injustice  within the workplace and in the communities and  markets we serve.  While the ACT Council and initiative were prompted  by the murder of George Floyd in the United States,  our intent is to address racial/ethnic injustice around  the world. Learn more.  Measuring Inclusive Leadership   Beginning in 2021, the individual performance  assessment for members of our Senior Leadership  Team (now our Executive Leadership Team) under  our Annual Incentive Plan is determined in  connection with an assessment of our performance  against pre-established measures for key strategic  2021 priorities, which include various ESG issues.  The strategic 2021 priorities are included in the  categories of Patient Safety and Quality (50%  weighting), Best Place to Work (30% weighting)  and Growth Through Innovation (20% weighting).  Following a rigorous qualitative year-end  performance assessment, the weighted total payout  across the three categories for 2021 totaled 105%. In addition, we conduct surveys to measure  manager effectiveness, asking employees to rate  their managers in areas such as inclusive leader- ship, recognition, feedback, development and  workplace flexibility. Managers receive scorecards  that include the results, as well as summaries of  anonymous feedback from employees, and are  expected to address feedback. Inclusive Attraction Approach Baxter follows a fair and inclusive hiring process,  which includes an inclusive candidate sourcing  strategy, diverse interview panels and a target  to ensure that at least 30% of candidates on the  interview slates for roles of manager or above  are diverse. We have initiated additional steps to  mitigate bias in hiring, including analysis of job  descriptions by artificial intelligence to help make  them more inclusive, an automated process to  collect interview feedback, guidance for valuing  differences when assessing skills and an inclusive  global interview guide. We also include a specific  bias check in our hiring process referred to as “Pause  and Discuss,” which is a structured discussion to help  check for unconscious bias in candidate selection  before moving forward with an offer.   WORKPLACE In addition to prioritizing diversity in our workforce,  Baxter cultivates an inclusive workplace culture,  where every employee is treated fairly and feels  respected, valued, seen and heard. Driving Accountability We work to embed DE&I across all aspects of our  workplace through inclusive leadership, accountability  measures and proactive engagement with employees  who advocate for inclusion throughout our company.  Our global DE&I champions are integral to the  implementation of our strategy. Especially critical are  our Global Inclusion Council, Regional Inclusion  Councils, country champion networks and senior  leader sponsorship of our eight BRGs.  We believe that all employees are  personally responsible for fostering  DE&I at Baxter. To that end, we ask all  employees to periodically recommit  to our global All In[clusive] pledge,  affirming that they will do their part  to create a culture of inclusion based  on fairness and open and honest  communication.  ===== PAGE 49 ===== Baxter 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report   4 9 Cross-Cutting  Commitments Corporate Responsibility Commitment Introduction 2030 Corporate  Responsibility Goals Empower   Our Patients Protect   Our Planet Champion Our People  and Communities Appendix Building Cultural Competence to Advance  Workplace Inclusion Baxter provides employees with training, tools and  resources to build cultural awareness and compe- tence to engage more authentically with each other.  Resources include leadership toolkits for managing  global, diverse teams; holding inclusive meetings;  personalized cultural assessments; exploring  dimensions of diversity as a team; and mitigating  day-to-day biases across many of our human  resources processes. Many employees also work  on global teams, enabling them to build cultural  competence through daily interactions, and we  encourage employees to practice simple acts of  inclusion in their day-to-day routines. We work to embed awareness of unconscious bias  throughout our company and require all employees  to take a self-guided e-learning module about uncon- scious bias. In addition, we have integrated prompts  in key human resources processes, such as hiring  activities, talent assessment, succession planning and  feedback, to help employees think about their biases  as they undertake these activities. Inclusive Pay and Benefits One of the ways we work to achieve equity at Baxter is  by implementing a total compensation philosophy that  provides market-competitive pay and benefits globally  while rewarding employees for strong individual and  business performance. Baxter is also committed to  periodically assessing our efforts through robust pay  audits and reviews.  After controlling for legitimate factors such as  type of role, prior work experience, tenure in the  organization, tenure in role and geographic location,  a review of our 2021 pay equity study of U.S. salaried  workforce revealed no significant pay differences  among men, women and ethnic minorities. In addition,  approximately 35% of our employees work in positions  (largely in our plant locations) where salary levels  are based solely on the job or the job and tenure,  eliminating the possibility of pay equity discrepancies. Baxter provides competitive and inclusive employee  programs and benefits that support career advancement,  workplace flexibility and employee wellness. To  support working parents and caregivers, we also offer  parental leave, adoption and fertility benefits, mento- ring for new parents, lactation services and benefits,  backup childcare and subsidized care, educational  support for working parents, caregiver services and  an employee assistance program.  Throughout the global pandemic, we have worked to  help employees cope with the impacts of COVID-19.  For example, Baxter provides resources to help  employees prioritize wellness and work-life balance  as well as tips for using Baxter’s technology to stay  connected and productive. Our WorkSmart Virtually  resources help employees cultivate habits to work  remotely with ease, connect with co-workers, build  team effectiveness and lead through crisis with  empathy and emotional intelligence. We also rolled  out a meditation app globally to help our employees  prioritize mental health and well-being during this  stressful time and introduced monthly wellness days  and nutritional coaching for U.S.-based employees. For many years, Baxter has recognized the increasing  demands on employees to manage their personal  and work lives, and we respect the need for different  approaches to where, how and when work gets done.  We provide employees and managers with tools and  resources to navigate ad hoc or ongoing flexible  arrangements and encourage employees to speak  with managers about what options might be right for  them and their jobs.

Supporting Underserved Communities Baxter and the Baxter International Foundation have  committed to invest $275 million in underserved  communities over the next 10 years to address global  health and social challenges, such as increasing access  to healthcare, fostering STEM (science, technology,  engineering and math) education, and promoting  community resilience. Aligned with our ACT initiative,  we have provided grants to the American Diabetes  Association and the Thurgood Marshall Fund. Learn  more in Invest in Underserved Communities Globally.   In addition, Baxter is currently partnering with  several organizations focused on advancing public  policy options related to health disparities. Baxter  has a longstanding relationship supporting the  Congressional Black Caucus Foundation. Baxter is  also partnering with the National Minority Quality  Forum and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus  Institute to bring more focus to the role that payment  and reimbursement can play in achieving better health  outcomes for communities of color.    Supplier Diversity Baxter develops mutually beneficial relationships with  small and diverse suppliers as we strive to increase  the diversity of our supplier base. In 2021, we increased  our spend with diverse suppliers to 7.3%, up from 5.6%.  This included increased spending in all diverse supplier  categories except for veteran-owned businesses and  small disadvantaged businesses. A third-party review estimates that our spending with  diverse suppliers supported $257 million in economic  output as well as $72 million in employee income  earned and almost 1,200 jobs. The same review  showed that when including estimated indirect and  induced economic impacts, our spending supported  $436 million in economic output as well as about  $140 million in employee income and more than  2,400 jobs.4  We continue to emphasize a strategic approach to  increasing spend and deepening relationships with  diverse suppliers. In 2021, we sponsored an annual  National Minority Supplier Development Council  $189.7 million to small  businesses $72.6 million to minority-owned  businesses $6.0 million to veteran-owned  businesses $2.6 million to HUBZone-certified  businesses $3.5 million to service-disabled veteran–owned businesses $90.3 million to women-owned  businesses $2.3 million to small  disadvantaged businesses $ SPENDING WITH DIVERSE SUPPLIERS, 2021* * Spending with suppliers that certify for multiple categories is included in the total  for each category. United States and Puerto Rico. (NMSDC) matchmaking event and participated in  matchmaking events through the Diversity Alliance  For Science in the areas of research and development,  professional services and packaging.  In 2021, we established a target for our top 50 suppliers  to increase diversity among their suppliers and report  results. During the year, we also committed $150,000 to  support minority-owned businesses impacted by  COVID-19 and civil unrest, and we invested $100,000 to  provide professional development, learning and  training opportunities to Black women. We maintain corporate memberships with many  organizations that promote and certify diverse  suppliers, such as Disability:IN, National Gay and  Lesbian Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC), NMSDC,  Chicago NMSDC, Puerto Rico Minority Supplier  Development Council and Women’s Business  Enterprise National Council. In 2021, in addition to  taking part in the NMSDC matchmaking event, we  participated in meetings led by NMSDC with the  NGLCC and Disability:IN, enabling us to build  stronger relationships with these organizations and  increase matchmaking opportunities. Fostering  relationships with a variety of organizations helps us  identify diverse suppliers for inclusion in our supply  chain, increase our visibility within the diverse  supplier community and advance progress in this  area more broadly. In 2021, we continued to realign our procurement or- ganization to improve collaboration with our company’s  functions and global business units. This improves our  ability to initiate matchmaking with diverse suppliers of  specific categories. This approach will help us identify  opportunities for and potentially increase our spend  with diverse suppliers moving forward. Our supplier registration portal enables registration for  diverse suppliers who are looking for opportunities to  work with Baxter. Using the portal, diverse suppliers  can upload their certificates and answer questions that  will make them more visible to Baxter teams looking  for new suppliers through our internal search tool. The  portal should also improve communications with our  suppliers and help us gather more information related  to spending with our Tier II suppliers so we can track  and measure it more accurately.

MARKETPLACE  Increasing our awareness of health disparities in  underserved communities and extending access to  and use of our products, therapies and resources  to these groups is at the core of our marketplace  inclusion efforts.  We strive to adopt inclusive product design from  concept to launch and enhance our engagement with  diverse healthcare professionals, patients, caregivers  and other stakeholders. Our efforts to tackle these  health disparities include sponsoring community  programs that improve patient access to healthcare  and reducing healthcare provider biases, including  promoting a more diverse pipeline of healthcare  professionals. We provided educational events for  employees worldwide to enhance multicultural  awareness and increase awareness of healthcare  disparities and equity in product design, development  and commercialization. The objective was to ensure  diverse representation of patients and healthcare  professionals among our key opinion leaders and voice  of customer stakeholders.

This  commitment is reinforced through executive oversight,   policies and standards, and mandatory employee training.   We monitor global regulations closely, including  relevant developments and actions related to the  EU General Data Protection Regulation, recently  introduced laws in China related to privacy and data  protection, and other requirements in the places we do  business. In addition to external regulations, we hold  ourselves accountable to our own rigorous internal  policies and standards.  Management and oversight of Privacy and IT security  is a priority for Baxter leadership. Our Information  Risk Committee, co-led by our Chief Privacy Officer  and our Chief Information Security Officer, ensures  Baxter’s privacy and security efforts are aligned  with the company’s broader business initiatives and  that our business leaders are aware of changing  regulatory or technical risks. In addition, two separate  committees of our Board of Directors oversee our IT  security program strategy and efficacy and receive  regular updates. The Audit Committee provides  oversight for IT security matters generally (including  cybersecurity incidents) and the Quality, Compliance  and Technology Committee provides oversight for  product cybersecurity matters. In response to growing and changing cyber threats,  we continually assess and strengthen our cyber  defenses and response capabilities. The Global IT  Security Operations team helps to protect Baxter  against cyberattacks using a range of defenses that  help to secure our assets, reduce detection time  and improve recoverability. We conduct routine   exercises with business stakeholders and third-party   responders to promote awareness and improve  processes. In addition, post-incident review meetings  and reports provide insight into how we can update  our response strategies. Our threat hunting process  helps to protect our systems against evolving security  threats, and we conduct risk-based reviews and due  diligence monitoring through our Governance Risk  and Compliance program.  To further strengthen cybersecurity across our  network and portfolio of Baxter and Hillrom  products, Baxter became a Common Vulnerability  and Exposures (CVE) Numbering Authority in  early 2022. The CVE program is sponsored by the  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency,  which is part of the U.S. Department of Homeland  Security and aims to enable the rapid identification  and resolution of cybersecurity issues. In addition,  Baxter is a member of the Health Information  Sharing and Analysis Center, which we leverage  to inform risk-based decisions and share best  practices with other cybersecurity professionals in  the healthcare industry.  Our customers can access our online Product Security  summary to learn about security vulnerabilities that  might affect Baxter products. In addition, Baxter has  Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI).  BIMI adds an extra layer of authentication to emails  and displays our logo in recipients’ inboxes. This  helps customers and healthcare professionals have  confidence that the emails they receive from Baxter are  genuine and not from fraudulent parties.  We continue to raise privacy and security awareness  with all Baxter users through annual mandatory  training1 and recurring reinforcement through virtual  events and updated materials. We require multifactor  authentication and an always-on virtual private  network (VPN) system to provide additional safeguards  for our employees working remotely. In addition, our  Third Party Risk Management program includes  assessment and monitoring of security standards and  control procedures for critical external suppliers.

Reporting Boundaries The following are the boundaries Baxter used for reporting  sustainability data: •	 Operational control •	 Worldwide Reporting Criteria The Subject Matter needs to be read and understood together with  Baxter’s internal reporting requirements for facility environmental,  health, safety and sustainability performance, as well as information  described in the text, appendix, data tables and notes of the Report. Limitations and Exclusions Excluded from the scope of our work is any verification of information  relating to: •	 Activities outside the defined assurance period, which is the 2021  calendar year •	 Positional statements (expressions of opinion, belief, aim or future  intention) by Baxter and statements of future commitment •	 Any financial data previously audited by an external third party •	 Data and information included in sections of the Report not listed in  the scope of work above This assurance engagement relies on a risk-based selected sample of  sustainability data and the associated limitations that this entails. This  independent statement should not be relied upon to detect all errors,  omissions or misstatements that may exist. Responsibilities The preparation and presentation of the Subject Matter in the Report  are the sole responsibility of the management of Baxter. Apex was not  involved in the drafting of the Report or of the Reporting Criteria. Our  responsibilities were to: •	 Provide independent assurance about whether the Subject Matter   has been prepared in accordance with the Reporting Criteria •	 Form an independent conclusion based on the assurance  procedures performed and evidence obtained •	 Report our conclusions to the stakeholders of Baxter Assessment Standards We performed our work in accordance with Apex’s standard  procedures and guidelines for external Assurance of Sustainability  Reports and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements  (ISAE) 3000 Revised, Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or  Reviews of Historical Financial Information (effective for assurance  reports dated on or after Dec. 15, 2015), issued by the International  Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. A materiality threshold of  ±5% was set for the assurance process. The work was planned and carried out to provide reasonable, rather  than absolute, assurance of the Subject Matter except for the Scope  3 GHG emissions and Product Distribution in the Achieve Carbon  Neutrality for Direct Operations by 2040 section; Protecting Human  Rights in Our Supply Chain in the Human Rights section; Supplier  Diversity in the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion section; and the Advance  Sustainable Procurement section, which was carried out to provide  limited assurance. We believe that our work provides an appropriate  basis for our conclusions. Summary of Work Performed As part of our independent verification, our work included: •	 Assessing the appropriateness of the Reporting Criteria for the  Subject Matter •	 Conducting interviews with relevant Baxter personnel who are  responsible for collecting and reporting performance data and other  Subject Matter •	 Reviewing documentary evidence provided by Baxter •	 Reviewing Baxter’s systems for quantitative data aggregation and  analysis during remote meetings with personnel from Baxter’s  offices in Round Lake and Deerfield, Illinois •	 Assessing assumptions made and the data scope and reporting  boundaries. Auditing consolidated performance data, including  review of a sample of data-to-source documentation •	 Auditing a selection of the Subject Matter to the corresponding  source documentation •	 Auditing performance data during virtual audits of operating sites  located in Ahmedabad, India; Cleveland, Mississippi; Deerfield,  Illinois; Lund, Sweden; Medolla, Italy; and Opelika, Alabama •	 Assessing the disclosure and presentation of the Subject Matter with  emphasis on principles of accuracy, accessibility, balance, clarity,  comparability, reliability and timeliness and to ensure consistency  with the Reporting Criteria Conclusion On the basis of our methodology and the activities described above,  it is our opinion that the Subject Matter within assured sections  including: the Environmental, Health, Safety and Sustainability  Governance and Additional Disclosures; Achieve Carbon Neutrality for  Direct Operations by 2040; Implement Strategic Materials and Waste  Management Plans; Implement Strategic Water Management Plans;  and Achieve Top Quartile Workplace Safety Performance sections of  the Report, as well as related material in the Report Appendix: •	 Is presented in accordance with the Reporting Criteria and is, in all  material respects, fairly stated •	 Is presented in a clear, understandable and accessible manner JOHN A. ROHDE  Apex Companies LLC   |   Lakewood, CO TREVOR DONAGHU  Apex Companies LLC   |   Pleasant Hill, CA May 9, 2022  •	 Allows readers to form a balanced opinion of Baxter’s activities  and performance during calendar year 2021 Also, on the basis of our methodology and the activities described  above: •	 Nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the data  and information in the Responsible Procurement and Logistics  section of the Report are inaccurate or that the information is not  fairly stated. •	 It is also our opinion that Baxter has established appropriate  systems for the collection, aggregation, analysis and review of  the Subject Matter. Additional Commentary During the assurance process, Apex observed that Baxter  continues to improve its overall data collection and reporting  processes at the site and corporate level. Opportunities for  improving facility-level data collection, reporting and procedural  documentation at some facilities were noted. We recommend that Baxter corporate personnel continue  to support individual facility personnel with collection and  consolidation of site-specific metrics that are included in reporting.

Approximately 10,000 of those employees joined Baxter in December 2021 as a result of our acquisition of Hillrom. 2	“Smart device” counts are based on internal estimates and include those devices that can collect and communicate data and are connected or connectable to a network. The  approximate 2 million estimate (post-Hillrom acquisition) includes 1.3 million as previously disclosed by Hillrom at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference on Jan. 15, 2020.   CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY COMMITTMENT 1	Estimated energy and financial savings as well as GHG emissions avoidance are calculated for the 12 months following project implementation. EMPOWER OUR PATIENTS Reach More Underserved Kidney Patients 1	Liyanage, et al. Lancet. 2015; 385(9981) 2	Of the 30 countries with PD Ambassadors, 21 are developing countries.    PROTECT OUR PLANET Achieve Carbon Neutrality for Direct Operations by 2040 1	Scope 1 emissions are direct GHG emissions from sources we own or control, such as on-site fuel combustion. Scope 2 emissions are indirect GHG emissions associated with  purchased electricity and steam for owned/controlled facilities. Baxter’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions have been verified by a third party to a reasonable assurance level (see  verification statement). The market-based method is used for Scope 2 unless otherwise stated. See Baxter Value Chain Energy Usage and GHG Emissions for additional detail.  2	The savings described in this paragraph are calculated on an annualized basis (12 months from each project completion date), though savings should continue beyond one year. 3	In 2021, we used biomass fuels to generate energy in boilers at two Baxter locations: one in the United States and one in Italy. During the year, emissions from the Baxter- operated biomass boilers equaled 151,000 metric tons CO2. In accordance with the GHG Protocol, these are not included in reported Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. However,  also in accordance with the GHG Protocol, we include CO2e emissions from the CH4 and N2O components of biomass combustion in our reported Scope 1 emissions. 4	U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Green Power Partnership Fortune 500 Partners List. As of Oct. 25, 2021. 5	The savings described below for projects in Haina, Dominican Republic, and Lessines, Belgium, are calculated on an annualized basis (12 months from each project  completion date), though savings should continue beyond one year. 6	Participating manufacturing facilities are those with energy costs that exceed $200,000 per year. 7	This includes electricity, fuel and purchased steam consumed by Baxter-managed and Baxter-operated facilities; it excludes energy related to company-operated  vehicles. 8	Estimated energy and financial savings as well as GHG emissions avoidance are calculated for the 12 months following project implementation. 9	Includes manufacturing facilities with energy costs that exceed $200,000 per year. 10	Baxter’s Scope 3 emissions relate to activities within the company’s value chain, but outside of our direct control. These emissions are based on various assumptions and estimates  and are verified by a third party to a limited assurance level (see verification statement). See Baxter Value Chain Energy Usage and GHG Emissions for detail.  11	Includes Scope 1 and Scope 3 GHG emissions for product transport. 12	These savings are calculated on an annualized basis (12 months from the project completion date), though savings should continue beyond one year. Implement Strategic Water Management Plans 1	One cubic meter equals 1,000 liters or 264 gallons. 2	The WRI water tool defines baseline water stress as total annual water withdrawals (municipal, industrial and agricultural) expressed as a percentage of total annual available  flow. Higher values indicate more competition among users.  	 Low: Less than 10% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually. 	 Low-Med: Between 10 and 20% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually. 	 Med-High: Between 20 and 40% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually. 	 High: Between 40 and 80% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually. 	 Extremely High: More than 80% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually. Advance Sustainable Procurement 1	These percentages do not add up to 100% due to rounding. Implement Strategic Materials and Waste Management Plans 1	The savings described below for projects in Cuernavaca, Mexico, and Lessines, Belgium, are calculated on an annualized basis (12 months from each project completion date),  though savings should continue beyond one year. 2	Certain waste streams at two facilities in Europe have government-mandated requirements. These waste streams are excluded from the total. Appendix: Endnotes PROTECT OUR PLANET (CONTINUED) Environmental, Health, Safety and Sustainability Governance and Additional Disclosures 1	The environmental data included in this report are based on 119 reporting locations, of which 51 are manufacturing, 20 are warehouse, and 48 are other types of locations, such  as compounding centers, administrative or clerical. Several of the reporting units comprise multiple locations that report as a single entity. For example, in 2021, Baxter’s 45 renal  therapy sites in Colombia reported as a single entity. The reporting scope excludes certain leased facilities for which environmental performance data are not available or are not  material to Baxter’s overall environmental performance. The health and safety data included in this report are based on 214 reporting locations. The Environmental, Health, Safety  and Sustainability (EHS&S) information reported covers 100% of Baxter’s operations unless noted otherwise. EHS&S data are revised to reflect acquisitions, divestitures and plant  closings as well as to incorporate any corrections necessary due to additional data verification activities (such as EHS&S audits). Data were not revised to include Hillrom. See the  Baxter Data Summary for additional details. 2	For the purpose of this calculation, manufacturing includes pharmaceutical locations; and our sites in Sondalo, Italy, and Grosotto, Italy, are counted separately. Outside of  manufacturing locations, the balance of 15 ISO certified sites also includes compounding (6), offices (5), planning and fulfillment (3), and research and development (1). 3	These audits consisted of 11 ISO external audits, 11 external compliance audits and 4 joint EHS&S & Engineering critical infrastructure reviews. CHAMPION OUR PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES Invest in Underserved Communities Globally 1	Variations in Baxter’s annual product donations are due to fluctuations in community needs, the need and volume of disaster relief response, the regulatory  environment,  manufacturing processes and changes in product mix availability and marketing. We identify opportunities to donate and respond to community and humanitarian aid partner  requests as appropriate. Value of products donated (provided at no cost) is provided by partners based on wholesale acquisition cost at the time of donation. This number may be  greater or less than the value of Baxter products distributed during the year by our relief partners. 2	As of June 2022, based on an hourly rate of $29.95 per volunteer hour, as estimated by Independent Sector (https://independentsector.org/value-of-volunteer-time-2021/); volunteer  hours are self-reported by Baxter employees.  3	Variations in Baxter’s annual product donations are due to fluctuations in community needs, the need and volume of disaster relief response, the regulatory  environment,  manufacturing processes and changes in product mix availability and marketing. We identify opportunities to donate and respond to community and humanitarian aid partner  requests as appropriate. Value of products donated (provided at no cost) is provided by partners based on wholesale acquisition cost at the time of donation. This number may be  greater or less than the value of Baxter products distributed during the year by our relief partners. Achieve Top Quartile Workplace Safety Performance 1	Injuries Baxter is targeting to reduce in the near term include ergonomics; and slips, trips and falls. 2	Each year, profiles untouched for the previous three years are removed from the active database. 3	See Baxter Data Summary endnotes 24–27 for definitions of the injury and illness metrics used in this section. 4	Major incidents are defined as those that result in an employee or contractor being hospitalized overnight (for more than observation), sustaining an amputation or dying. Increase Representation of Women and Ethnic Minorities in Leadership Roles 1	“Ethnic minorities,” within the context of our 2030 goal, refers to underrepresented minority groups in the United States, including Black/African American, Latino/Hispanic, Asian  American, Native American and two or more races. 2	Our 2030 goals related to increasing the representation of women and ethnic minorities in leadership roles are based on assumptions about labor market conditions. “Labor market  conditions” refers to the availability of talent in the marketplace in the communities where we operate and serve, and specifically looks at census data, as well as our internal  pipeline. These labor market conditions can change over time so we will continue to monitor and adjust our goals as needed. CROSS-CUTTING COMMITMENTS Ethics and Compliance 1	Those who did not receive the questionnaire included (for example) shop floor employees, employees without Baxter email addresses, consultants, contractors and other service  providers.   2	The number of cases closed during any given year typically includes some cases opened before the beginning of the year. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 1	As of Dec. 31, 2021. Approximately 10,000 of those employees joined Baxter in December 2021 as a result of our acquisition of Hillrom.  2	Calculations represent the Board’s composition on June 27, 2022. 3	Underrepresented groups: employee populations that are inadequately represented and disproportionately lower than in the general population (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity,  disability, LGBTQ+, generation, veteran status). 4	Jan. 1, 2021, through Dec. 31, 2021. “Economic output” includes revenues earned by suppliers and businesses in the company’s supply chain and their communities.  “Indirect” includes impacts at the businesses from which suppliers (and their suppliers) purchase goods and services. “Induced” includes impacts generated in the  communities of the suppliers’ employees associated with purchases made by these employees and jobs supported through those purchases. Privacy and Data Protection 1	Training is applied according to valid Baxter email. Employees without a Baxter email address, such as those in manufacturing, do not participate.  ===== PAGE 64 ===== Baxter 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report   6 4 Appendix 2030 Corporate  Responsibility Goals Corporate Responsibility Commitment Empower   Our Patients Protect   Our Planet Champion Our People  and Communities Introduction Cross-Cutting  Commitments MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT FINDINGS 1	In this report, we are not using the terms “material” and “materiality” as defined for the purposes of financial and SEC reporting in the United States. Instead, the terms refer to  environmental, social and economic issues that are of significant importance to our stakeholders and to the company. These “material” issues inform our corporate responsibility  strategy, priorities and goals, and reporting. The issues in this table are listed in alphabetical order. The listing does not reflect the presumed importance or “materiality” of any  particular issue to Baxter or our stakeholders. BAXTER DATA SUMMARY 1	Excluding the Financial Performance section, metrics included in this Baxter Data Summary do not reflect Hillrom activity.  2	Differences compared with data on FDA websites may be due to timeframe (the date Baxter takes an action may differ from the date FDA classifies that action), definition of “recall”  (FDA data includes actions taken even if the product is not removed or corrected), and classification by product group vs. product code (FDA counts each impacted product code within a  product family as a distinct recall). 3	Product Recall Rate is defined as the number of unique product codes corrected or removed from the market per total Baxter owned unique product codes sold globally. 4	As of 2021, Baxter had 55 FDA-registered establishments available for inspection. 5	The regional breakdown of the data included in this section reflects the structure of the Environmental, Health, Safety and Sustainability (EHS&S) organization and the categorization  of data in the EHS&S global information management system through 2021. Some data for 2019 and 2020 are updated from data reported in the Baxter 2020 Corporate Responsibility  Report, to improve accuracy and in the case of GHG emissions to reflect updated GHG emission factors. Some totals vary from sum of items in category, due to rounding. 6	Excludes energy consumption associated with Baxter-operated mobile sources and renewable electricity generated on site. 7	Baxter’s Lean Energy Program began in 2007. Early in 2016, we introduced new Lean Energy Program requirements and updated some existing ones to better align the program with ISO  50001 requirements for energy management.  8	In some cases, segments do not add up to 100% due to rounding. Data may differ slightly from the totals stated in the Baxter Operations Total line of the Baxter Value Chain Energy  Usage and GHG Emissions table due to rounding.  9	Number includes Scope 3 emissions plus Scope 1 emissions for product transport. Some totals vary from sum of items in category, due to rounding. 10“Water usage” aligns with the definition of “water withdrawal” in GRI 303: Water and Effluents 2018: “Sum of all water drawn from surface water, groundwater, seawater, or a third party  for any use over the course of the reporting period.”  11	Water usage from Baxter’s 49 sites with the greatest use, representing 96% of the company’s total annual water usage. The WRI water tool defines baseline water stress as the total  annual water withdrawals (municipal, industrial and agricultural) expressed as a percentage of the total annual available flow. Higher values indicate more competition among users.  	 Low—Less than 10% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually.   	 Low-Med—Between 10 and 20% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually.  	 Med-High—Between 20 and 40% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually.  	 High—Between 40 and 80% of the water available to agricultural, domestic and industrial users is withdrawn annually.  	 Extremely High—More than 80% of the water available to agricultural, domestic, and industrial users is withdrawn annually. 12	Estimated total water pollutant levels for treated wastewater discharged directly into waterways. Data do not include one facility that operates zero-discharge systems in accordance  with local regulatory requirements. BOD5 refers to five-day biological oxygen demand; COD refers to chemical oxygen demand; TSS refers to total suspended solids. When actual  performance data were not available, estimates are based on performance at similar facilities or on other measured performance indicators.  13	Fiscal year basis (Oct. 1 through Sept. 30 of the year noted). 14 United States and Puerto Rico. Data for 2019 and 2020 are fiscal year basis (Oct. 1 through Sept. 30 of the year noted). Data for 2021 are calendar year. Accounts payable data are sent  to a third party, which categorizes spending. Other categories include disability-owned, service-disabled veteran–owned, LGBT-owned, small disadvantaged and HUBZone-certified  businesses. HUBZone is a U.S. Small Business Administration program for small companies that operate and employ people in Historically Underutilized Business Zones. Spending with  suppliers that qualify for more than one category may be included in the totals for each of the relevant categories.  15	Excludes waste associated with U.S. Renal Home Care operations, since patients dispose of unused product rather than returning it to Baxter for disposal. Also excludes construction  and demolition debris, remediation waste, wastewater treatment sludge and discarded manufacturing and process-related machinery or equipment. Removing these waste categories  from the company total allows for more consistent evaluation of facility performance and trends over time. 16	Excludes production by-products reused on-site, construction and demolition debris, wastewater treatment and discarded manufacturing and process-related machinery or equipment.  Includes discarded/returned products (such as intravenous solution, dextrose solution, etc.) that are nonhazardous in nature but may be classified as regulated in some countries.  Excludes waste associated with U.S. Renal Home Care operations, since patients dispose of unused product rather than returning it to Baxter for disposal. 17	Excludes waste recycled on-site, remediation waste, construction and demolition debris, and wastewater treatment sludge. Includes certain waste streams (such as waste oils,  batteries, fluorescent lamps, light ballasts and asbestos) not classified as regulated in some locations.  18	Values correspond to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) Program data reported for reporting years 2019 and 2020. It includes facilities in the  continental United States and Puerto Rico only. Data for 2021 are not available as of report publication date.  19	Includes air emissions associated with on-site energy generation. Emission factors from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency publication “Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission  Factors,” AP-42, Fifth Edition, Volume 1: “Stationary Point and Area Sources.” 20	The Baxter 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report stated that Baxter received six Notices of Violation for 2020. During 2021, we received a cancellation notice for one of those Notices of  Violation, so updated the 2020 value to five. 21	In some cases, segments do not add up to total due to rounding. 22	Includes product donations as well as Patient Assistance Programs. Variations in Baxter’s annual product donations are due to fluctuations in community needs, the need and volume  of disaster relief response, the regulatory environment, manufacturing processes and changes in product mix and marketing. We identify opportunities to donate and respond to  community and humanitarian aid partner requests as appropriate. Value of products donated (provided at no cost) is provided by partners based on wholesale acquisition cost at the time  of donation. This number may be greater or less than the value of Baxter products distributed during the year by our relief partners. See Invest in Underserved Communities Globally. 23	Contributions to U.S.-based 501(c)(3) organizations for programs within and outside of the United States.  24	The regional breakdown of the data included in this section reflects the structure of the Environmental, Health, Safety and Sustainability (EHS&S) organization and the categorization of  data in the EHS&S global information management system through 2021. 25	Work-related injuries or illnesses requiring medical attention beyond first aid, including cases with days lost. All rates based on 100 full-time employees working one year, which equals  200,000 work hours. For tracking purposes, Baxter follows U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration recordkeeping requirements worldwide. Thus, in cases where an injury  occurs and conflicting medical opinions arise as to the number of days away and/or restricted days that should be recorded, we record on the basis of the most authoritative physician’s  opinion. We include occupational diseases and illnesses, such as hearing loss and ergonomic disorders, within our broader categories of cases, but do not track or report those items  separately. Due to privacy regulations in our Europe, Middle East and Africa region, we do not classify or report injuries by gender. Supervised contracted employees are included in the  injury statistics reported below and are not tracked separately. Independent contractors are not included in Baxter’s injury data, because they are supervised by other organizations. BAXTER DATA SUMMARY (CONTINUED) 26	Work-related injuries or illnesses that cause an employee to lose at least one full day after the date of the incident. 27The number of days lost (including weekends and holidays) recommended by the most authoritative physician’s opinion due to work-related injuries or illnesses. We do not  count the date of injury and date of return to full duty as lost days. 28	The number of days recommended by the most authoritative physician’s opinion that an employee or supervised contractor is unable to work full duty (including weekends and  holidays) due to a work-related injury or illness. We do not count the date of injury and date of return to full duty as restricted days. 29	Americas includes the United States (with Puerto Rico), Canada and Latin America. 30	“Professional” includes individual contributors. 31	“Other” includes American Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander and two or more races. 32	“Technical/Clerical” includes employees in operational and administrative/clerical roles. 33	Scores indicate the percentage of survey participants who responded favorably to statements related to each of the categories listed. Baxter did not administer a Best Place to  Work survey in 2020 due to impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 34	These data do not represent all employee training and development but do capture a large portion of training for most employees. BAXTER VALUE CHAIN ENERGY USAGE AND GHG EMISSIONS 1	Baxter used the World Resources Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development Greenhouse Gas Protocol to calculate emissions data from fossil fuel use. We  used country electricity emission factors published by the International Energy Agency and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) E-Grid U.S. regional electricity emission  factors to calculate GHG emissions related to electricity consumption. 2	Apex Companies, LLC verified to a reasonable level Baxter’s 2019–2021 Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions. Apex Companies, LLC also verified to a limited level Baxter’s  methodology for determining 2019–2021 Scope 3 GHG emissions. 3	Some data for 2019 and 2020 are updated from data reported in the Baxter 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report for accuracy and to reflect updated GHG emission factors.  4	We used the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition to determine GHG emissions associated with using biomass fuel,  principally wood/wood waste, as a boiler fuel at two Baxter locations. These emissions were calculated as 152,000, 149,000 and 151,000 metric tons CO2 in 2019, 2020 and  2021, respectively. CO2e emissions from CH4 and N2O components of biomass combustion are included in reported Scope 1 emissions. 5	Baxter used the Greenhouse Gas Protocol to estimate GHG emissions associated with reported fuel usage by company-managed sales and distribution fleet vehicles and other  vehicles. We estimated fuel usage for international sales and distribution vehicles based on regional sales information. 6	Refrigerant emissions represent reported CFC, HCFC and HFC refrigerant losses by each Baxter location. We calculated associated GHG emissions using actual emission  factors for each reported refrigerant.  7	Includes the purchase of electricity generated from 100% certified renewable electricity (Belgium, Brazil, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK and  United States). 8	Estimated based on an environmentally extended input-output model from an independent third party and Baxter’s revenue and sector of operation. 9	Estimated based on capital expenditures and the machinery and equipment emission factor from Table 13 - Indirect emissions from the Supply Chain, UK Government  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs. 10	Estimated based on Baxter’s actual yearly energy usage by energy type and GHG emission factors for each energy type per GaBi life cycle assessment software. 11	Estimated based on shipment of products to our customers using the EcoTransIT World Software that is compliant with the GHG Protocol and the Global Logistics Emissions  Council Framework.  12	Estimated emissions for wastewater treatment by municipalities and off-site waste recycling and disposal based on Baxter’s waste generation by type, UK Government GHG  Conversion Factors for Company Reporting and the U.S. EPA WARM model. 13	Estimated based on domestic and international air mileage, rental vehicle CO2e emissions or mileage, and hotel room stays provided by Baxter’s global travel providers,  and personal vehicle mileage. Emission factors from UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting, Greenhouse Gas Protocol Mobile Combustion GHG  Emissions Calculation Tool, and Carbonfund.org Business Travel Calculator. 14	Estimated based on the number of Baxter employees by country and statistics on commuting time and transport mode split into public transport, passenger cars, taxi and  motorcycle, and walking or bicycling. Emission factors for each mode were obtained from Defra.  15	Emissions associated with upstream leased assets are included in Baxter’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions. 16	Estimated based on previous Baxter product LCAs as well as the company’s revenue by product type. Category 1 emissions were extrapolated to other categories depending  on the product type. 17	Estimated based on an environmentally extended input-output model from an independent third party and revenue from Baxter’s contract services business. 18	Estimated based on production quantities and global warming potential information for certain types of products. Emissions for certain other products estimated based on  previous Baxter product LCAs as well as the company’s revenue by product type. Category 1 emissions were extrapolated to other categories depending on the product type. 19	Totals do not include CO2 emissions from Baxter-owned wood-fired boilers. See endnote 4 above for detail. BAXTER FACILITIES WITH ISO 14001, ISO 45001, ISO 50001 AND GREEN BUILDING CERTIFICATIONS 1	As of Dec. 31, 2021. 2	Facilities transitioned to ISO 45001 from OHSAS 18001. 3	The building with green certification noted is one of several buildings at the designated location. SUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD INDEX 1	Differences compared with data on FDA websites may be due to timeframe (the date Baxter takes an action may differ from the date FDA classifies that action), definition of “recall”  (FDA data includes actions taken even if the product is not removed or corrected), and classification by product group vs. product code (FDA counts each impacted product code within  a product family as a distinct recall).
