As we wrapped up our 140 Year Anniversary  celebrations in June, we were reminded of not only  how far St John has come over the decades, but also  how indelibly we are embedded into Australia’s health  and wellbeing landscape, and the Australian psyche.  Our position as one of Australia’s most trusted  charities, and a leading provider of First Aid, health  services, and volunteerism, continues to strengthen.  This is the product of the hard work of our extensive  network of staff, volunteers and members of The  Order of St John.    This year I have seen many great achievements  across our network, and I thank each individual State  and Territory who form part of our federation, for  their continued commitment to our mission and their  excellence in program delivery.   While the reach and impact data we gather tells an  impressive story, it cannot truly capture the myriad  of stories, about the efforts of everyday Australians  who provide care to others in their time of injury,  illness or crisis. In November, we had the pleasure of  highlighting one such story at our Save a Life Awards  held at Government House, with our recipients,  Superintendent Richard Breiner, Mrs Esther Breiner,  and Senior Constable David Quick. Their fast-thinking  actions not only saved a life, but further serve as  inspiration for others about the power of first aid  interventions.     In November, I was proud to host our inaugural  Chancellor’s Dinner at Old Parliament House in  Canberra with our members, supporters, and friends  of St John. This was a night of celebrating our historic  achievements and embracing a theme of “kindness”.  I make specific mention of attendees, the Lord Prior  Professor Mark Compton, Mr Brendan Wood, Deputy  Chancellor of St John Hato Hone, and Matthew  Cannon, CEO of St John Papua New Guinea, as  well as the St John CEOs and Board Members from  around the country, and our corporate sponsors. With  such success, I look forward to making this an annual  event.   We have again had a busy year of collaboration with  our Asia Pacific Leadership Group, which St John  Australia chairs. The highlight for me was a visit to the  Solomon Islands in January with the Chancellor of the  Order, Tom Budd, where we saw first-hand the impact  of a small organisation with very limited resources,  making a huge difference to the lives of Solomon  Islanders. I thank CEO Michael Andrews and Council  Chair Namoi Kaluae for so graciously hosting.  In September 2023, I attended Grand Council in  New Zealand. International meetings such as this  ensure continued connection to our heritage, and  the vision and values of The Order. The wealth of  knowledge within our global community helps St John  to expand and innovate in line with best practice.  Our international connections also remind us that at  times our world experiences significant crises, and  that humanitarian efforts always matter. We would like  to acknowledge our St John peers and their families,  who are living and working through troubled times in  other parts of the world.    We make mention of the vital work of the St John of  Jerusalem Eye Hospital Group, which the Australian  Priory continues to champion. Everyone in that region  has endured a terrible year and yet the Eye Hospital  Group continues to find new ways to reach the people  that need St John most. Our international ophthalmic  programs are in good hands. This year we also  welcomed our new Hospitaller of the Australian Priory,  Daniel Ciccosillo. As a dedicated member of St John  since joining as a cadet, Daniel will bring a unique  experience and perspective to this important role.  I would like to express gratitude to my colleagues on  the Australian Priory Board, and our Federal Council  of CEOs and Board Chairs. I am mindful of how much  we ask of this group within busy schedules, and I am  consistently delighted and impressed by the level  of engagement and strategic input.  This year we  have seen significant work towards brand unification  and the establishment of national partnerships. All  the while, each State and Territory has provided  enthusiastic support to initiatives to strengthen St  John beyond our borders, especially in the Asia  Pacific region.    7    St John Ambulance Australia  Annual Report 2023-2024  ===== PAGE 8 ===== The former Governor General, General the Honourable  David Hurley AC CVO KStJ, finished his term of  office as Governor General at the end of June. This  also marked the end of his time as the Prior of our  Australian Priory. General Hurley and Mrs Hurley  have been (and I’m delighted to report will continue  to be) extraordinary supporters and leaders of St  John. My heartfelt thanks to them both for all that  they have done for our organisation during their  time at Government House. We extend our warmest  wishes to them in their retirement.  Our new Governor  General, Her Excellency the Honourable Ms Sam  Mostyn AC, has been invited to become our new Prior  and continue the unbroken tradition of Governors  General acting as Prior since the Australian Priory  was created over 75 years ago.  I look forward to  showcasing St John’s incredible community service to  Her Excellency.   When we glance back at our year in review I am  always astounded by the level of activity and  achievement. As such, I would like to thank the staff  and volunteers of the Australian Office, for their expert  stewardship of St John in Australia. You will see  their important work reflected in each of the portfolio  reports for the financial year. This team has been ably  led by national CEO, Brendan Maher, and I thank him  for his tireless work to progress our organisation’s  strategic priorities. In particular, his focus on building  greater unity across our federated network, and efforts  to improve our national advocacy and sustainability  profile, will help to unlock our full potential as an  organisation.    To every person and organisation who has helped St  John Ambulance Australia - giving their skills, time,  donations or services in 2023/2024 - on behalf of the  Australian Priory Board, please accept my profound  thanks.    We invite you to review this year’s annual report and  welcome your continued engagement.     Cameron Oxley Annual Report 2023-2024  St John Ambulance Australia    8  ===== PAGE 9 ===== CEO’s Message  Brendan Maher A year moves quickly in busy times, and the 2023/2024  period has seen tremendous achievement and impact for  St John Ambulance Australia, and our broader network.  I  am proud to be able to showcase some of our collective  work through this Annual Report. As always, it does not do  justice to the countless hours put in by our staff, volunteers,  members and supporters - who drive our mission.   This year, we have seen our Australian network support  an estimated 3,388,111 Australians, through our diverse  medical, health and wellbeing services and programs. This  has been achieved by a strong network of 5,281 professional  staff, 11,100 volunteers and 2,481 members of the Order of  St John.     In May of 2024, we united our national voice to thank  our volunteers - acknowledging on a first name basis  every individual who helps make us “St John Strong”. We  continued this acknowledgment at Parliament House in  June, with our cross-partisan Parliamentary Friends of St  John Ambulance Australia event. We are thankful for this  group of parliamentary representatives who are an integral  component of our national advocacy efforts – I invite you to  learn more about them in this report.   I would like to specifically thank the groups and individuals  who make our impact possible. Firstly, my colleagues and  peers within the National Leadership Group - the CEOs of  our State and Territory entities, and their skilled staff. Their  strategic nous and robust operational practices ensure that  St John services are delivered to a world-class standard, in  all corners of Australia.   I make specific mention of the leadership and support of our  Chancellor Cameron Oxley. Notable, is Cameron’s promotion  within the Order of St John in January to the rank of Bailiff  Grand Cross. This is testament to Cameron’s unwavering  commitment to St John in Australia, within the Asia Pacific  region, and further afield within our global neighbourhood.   I also thank our National Board, Federal Council and steering  committees including: Clinical Governance Committee;  National Historical Society; National Training Group;  National Commercial Group; Communications Community  of Practice; National Partnerships Group; National Youth  Group; and newly established Innovation Council, for their  guidance in their respective fields. I am proud that we are  able to lead and/or contribute to such influential staff forums  from our Australian Office.    In 2024 we acknowledged our outgoing Governor General  and Prior, His Excellency, General the Honourable David  Hurley AC DSC (Retd). Mr Hurley and Her Excellency Mrs  Linda Hurley have been active members of The Order, and  9    St John Ambulance Australia  Annual Report 2023-2024  ===== PAGE 10 ===== have championed our engagement with the Australian  community - often hosting us for Investitures and  significant events at Government House in Canberra.  I would like to thank them both for being such  dedicated patrons for our cause. Reiterating the  sentiments from our Chancellor, I also extend a  warm welcome to our new Governor General, Her  Excellency the Honourable Ms Sam Mostyn AC, and  I look forward to building an ongoing connection  between Government House and St John.   This year I have been delighted to attend Investiture  Ceremonies in Canberra, Adelaide, Brisbane, Sydney  and Hobart. I always find great inspiration through  our honours and awards system that is grounded  in history, with relevance today - celebrating the  good work of individuals caring for others and their  communities.    At the Australian Office we have had no shortage  of successes. We have contributed to a national  discussion and government agenda for disaster  response and resilience through the Australian Senate  Select Committee and various submissions, and  furthered our voice in government advocacy as a  network. Together with our States and Territories we  also worked to build our shared, national government  advocacy strategy. Alongside this we have progressed  our work towards greater brand consistency – an  exciting project that is building momentum and  good will.   Our Training Team achieved reregistration of our  National Registered Training Organisation (RTO)  in March, through to 2031. Notable also was the  introduction of a new Certificate IV in Training and  Assessment, which will expand our accredited training  touchpoints with community. Nationally, through our  RTO and that of the Commandery in WA, we issued  286,368 Certificates of Attainment in First Aid.   We have progressed our National Business Enterprise  System – supporting three States & Territories to  launch new websites and continued to build our core  digital assets. I have also been particularly focused  on our investment in strengthening St John’s cyber  security posture across the Australian office, to  improve the practice and protection of our digital  footprint against a changing landscape of threats.  We have sold a whopping 390,000 St John First  aid kits and 3,800,000 St John consumables this  financial year through our National Product Sourcing  Unit - contributing significantly to our organisational  sustainability through social enterprise. This function  not only continues to grow, but maintains the highest  standards of quality and compliance for safety and  ethical procurement. I know this means that Australian  consumers can be confident when they are receiving  goods from St John.     We are also making steady progress in the strategic  partnerships and programs space, including work  that supports our marginalised and vulnerable  populations such as policy and practice for the  safeguarding of children and young people, and the  development of a National Reconciliation Charter.  These areas have been progressed with considerable  stakeholder engagement to uphold our organisational  responsibilities and values.  Our Driver First Aid programs achieved significant  enhancements and engagement - receiving local  government support, community endorsement, and  an industry award. These eLearning packages have  trained over 7,000 Learner Drivers, Young People,  and Truck Drivers. This work has been subject to an  academic evaluation through Queensland University of  Technology with positive results.   I cannot finish without also closing off our 140th  Anniversary. We spent most of the financial year  in celebration of this milestone, which included  several major and national events including our  Chancellor’s Dinner in November, and Save a Life  Awards. Highlighting our impact through the decades,  alongside our staff, volunteers and members was a  memorable experience for our team.   Last but never least, I want to give a shout out to  my Australian Office Team who I am grateful to  work alongside on such meaningful endeavours.  I’m pleased that this report will allow this team to  showcase just some of what they do. Furthermore  it is important that I mention that we farewelled two  much loved and respected members of the Australian  Office team in May, Amanda Power and Gabrielle  Lhuede. Amanda and Gabby made a sustained and  valuable contribution to St John over many years and  will be missed by all. Thank you again to all the staff,  volunteers, members and supporters of St John.

Annual Report 2023-2024  St John Ambulance Australia    12  ===== PAGE 13 ===== About St John  Ambulance Australia  St John Ambulance Australia is a national community  driven organisation with a 141-year history in  Australia. We are recognised as one of Australia’s  most trusted charity organisations.

Through our  Australian networks we reached a combined audience  of an estimated 3,388,111 community beneficiaries in  2023/2024 alone.  St John supports people to develop the skills,  knowledge and confidence to provide first aid in  homes, workplaces, schools, and communities. This  Includes life-saving interventions such as CPR and the  deployment of a defibrillator in response to sudden  cardiac arrest.   We are part of a global network, spanning 44  countries, with the purpose of relieving sickness,  suffering and distress, and preserving human life.

The backbone of St John in Australia is a network  of 11,100 volunteers, with a shared vocation of  physical and mental wellbeing, and a passion  for helping their community. It is in this spirit of  volunteerism that our organisation maintains a  sustainable reach and impact.   13    St John Ambulance Australia  Annual Report 2023-2024  ===== PAGE 14 ===== Strategic Pillars Impact and influence Advocate for the delivery and continuity of  national goals - particularly in relation to high- quality, accessible and equitable health services,  First Aid training and education, access to  defibrillators, and embracing volunteerism.

Our Vision for Reconciliation All Australians respect and recognise Aboriginal  and Torres Strait Islander people and cultures as an  important part of our society, and St John Ambulance  Australia, as a national organisation, plays a significant  role in reconciliation and healing.  Our Commitment We strive toward reconciliation through understanding  and acknowledging Australia’s history and the  past injustices against Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander people. We will take actions that contribute  to a more equitable and harmonious Australia. Our  tangible commitment areas include: Pride; Sharing;  Respect; and Growth.

The group is co- chaired by Senator Andrew McLachlan CSC CStJ  (an active member of the Order of St John), and  Senator the Hon Carol Brown.   The Parliamentary Friends group was officially  launched at Parliament House in Canberra on 9  August 2023, and the group then came together  in November 2023 and May 2024 to engage in  various advocacy topics.    This Parliamentary Friends group has been  established to strengthen the profile and  understanding of St John Ambulance in Australia  with Government stakeholders. The Group  provides a forum for members of parliament  to meet and interact with St John’s leaders,  members, volunteers and other representatives on  initiatives including: making first aid accessible for  everyone; improving public access to defibrillators;  progressing systemic changes, such as the  implementation of first aid for learner drivers;  enhancing St John’s role in Australia’s disaster  response and resilience; and improving our  engagement on health and wellbeing in the Asia  Pacific Region.

This celebration recognised  the immense dedication and achievements of our  volunteers, who collectively form one of the nation’s  largest and most committed volunteer workforces.  Each year, St John’s volunteers generously contribute  hundreds-of-thousands of hours in service to their  communities - embodying the spirit of compassion  and community strength.  Events were organised across each State and  Territory, showcasing the diverse ways in which St  John volunteers make a difference, and the network  came together in a shared message – “Thank You!”    Every single volunteer of St John Ambulance in  Australia was acknowledged – their written names  appearing on banners, thank you letters, flyers,  print ads, cakes, screens, websites, videos and  social media, and later a thank you card signed  by Parliamentarians at Parliament House. This  widespread acknowledgment celebrated both  individual achievements and collective impact.   The enduring importance of volunteers transcends  cause weeks and campaigns, and St John continues  to value the contributions of all volunteers, across all  locations and vocations, every day.   23    St John Ambulance Australia  Annual Report 2023-2024  ===== PAGE 24 ===== Save a Life Awards On December 29, 2020, during a family holiday  in Tuross Heads, NSW, Superintendent Richard  Breiner’s quick thinking, brave action, and first aid  training saved a life. While enjoying time off with  his family, Richard, a senior off-duty police officer  with ACT Policing, noticed a commotion next door.  Within seconds Richard was jumping the fence  to get to the scene. There he found a man in his  fifties suffering from an apparent Sudden Cardiac  Arrest. Understanding that CPR was needed, and  an ambulance might take some time to reach them,  Richard immediately began administering CPR. He  was aided by his wife Esther Breiner who quickly leapt  into action, and had previously received basic first  aid training through her work in the airline industry.  The two worked quickly and confidently as a team,  rotating to perform compressions.  Soon after, Senior Constable David Quick arrived on  the scene. While he was the first emergency personnel  The St John Save a Life Awards celebrate the actions of those who have used First Aid to save or sustain  the life of another person. All recipients are nominated by their peers or a member of the community  for demonstrating how First Aid skills can be the difference between life and death in an emergency  situation. 2023 recipients included: Mrs Esther Breiner, Superintendent Richard Breiner, ACT Policing and  Senior Constable David Quick, New South Wales Police Force.  Story of Award Recipient Superintendent Richard Breiner  “ member to arrive, his vehicle was not fitted with a  defibrillator. The trio worked tirelessly, alternating  compressions as they waited for the ambulance. The  wait was lengthy, but their unwavering commitment to  providing this CPR proved crucial.  Upon their arrival, NSW Ambulance were able to  administer emergency medical aid on scene and find  a heart rhythm. Soon the patient was breathing and  he was taken to hospital. The outcome was positive,  and the man survived. Both medical professionals and  the man’s family attributed his survival directly to the  actions of Richard, Esther and David.  On Friday 10 November, at Government House,  Superintendent Richard Breiner, Mrs Esther Breiner  and Constable David Quick, were each formally  honoured with a St John’s Ambulance Save a Life  Award, presented by their Excellencies the Hon.  General David Hurley AC DSC KStJ (Retd) and Mrs  Linda Hurley CStJ. Their actions exemplify the life- saving potential of early intervention and reinforce the  vital importance of First Aid training. This experience  has not only impacted the Breiner family’s life but has  also inspired Esther to pursue a career in a support  role within the ACT Ambulance Service, and Richard  to advocate for AEDs in local police vehicles, so to  ensure community preparedness.  My advice to others is to just do  something. You have to have the  willingness to have a go if you want  to give that person a chance to live.

Alongside this, various innovations in training  and community education are taking place. This  contributes to our national strategic priorities -  equipping more people with First Aid knowledge,  skills and confidence in homes, workplaces, school  and communities.  A major highlight of the year was the renewal of the  Registered Training Organisation (RTO) registration,  which was achieved in March, with renewal being  granted for another seven years, extending through to  March 2031.   Another notable accomplishment was the introduction  of the TAE40122 Certificate IV in Training and  Assessment. In February the team launched corporate  classes, followed in April by the initiation of two pilot  programs, which saw 80 students enrol from January  to June. This new qualification enhances St John’s  capability in delivering top-tier training, and aligns with  our commitment to professional development.  May 2024 saw a successful National Training Group  meeting, which featured guest speakers, offering  valuable professional development for St John’s State  and Territory Training Managers. Additionally, a new  Quality Management System was rolled out across  the RTO, allowing for significant improvement in  document control and compliance monitoring.  Working in collaboration with the Digital  Transformation and Communications teams, an  enhanced version of the free Learner Driver First  Aid (LDFA) course was launched in June 2024. This  initiative has provided over 5,300 young Australians  with vital First Aid training. The LDFA e-learning  course was honoured with the ‘Workplace Road  Safety Award’ at the 13th Australian Road Safety  Foundation Awards in Canberra, in recognition of its  quality and impact.   This year, also saw the launch of the St John  Engage platform, designed to provide trainers with  professional development opportunities. The platform  regularly hosts industry experts, who provide insights  into courses, ensuring St John’s trainers stay up to  date with best practices. The platform saw over 800  participants engage across all sessions during the  reporting period.  Beyond this, we also introduced an online Continuous  Improvement Form, designed to facilitate real- time feedback from our internal stakeholders. This  tool enables the RTO to promptly gather insights,  ensuring that any feedback received is systematically  reviewed and integrated into our processes. The  implementation of this form has streamlined the  Training and Development Team’s ability to respond  to and act upon valuable suggestions, enhancing our  overall operational efficiency.  5,200 286,368 accredited training  courses across all  states and territories First Aid  certificates of  attainment issued 25    St John Ambulance Australia  Annual Report 2023-2024  ===== PAGE 26 ===== Major Achievements Re-registered  as a  Registered  Training  Organisation  until 2031 Workplace  Road Safety  Award  Winner   286, 368  Accredited  First Aid  certificates  issued  nationally  through 5,439  courses   800+  Trainers  engaged in  professional  development  to maintain our  excellence   6,000+  Drivers  Reached  through  Learner  Driver and  Truckie First  Aid 80  New students  in the  pilot phase  of a new  Certificate IV  in TAE course   Annual Report 2023-2024  St John Ambulance Australia    26  ===== PAGE 27 ===== National Product Sourcing Unit  Year in Review The National Product Sourcing Unit (NPSU) continues  to support St John States and Territories in achieving  both our mission and commercial goals in keeping  Australian communities safe by: providing high-quality  First Aid products; managing a national online sales  channel; providing centralised billing for national  clients; and maintaining the highest standards of  Ethical Social Governance.  It was a highly successful year with the design  and supply of innovative First Aid kits, safety and  emergency products, as well as life-saving St John  branded defibrillators. In 2023/2024, 45 new products  were developed with an emphasis on supporting  continued relationships with large retail chains such  as Aldi, Costco, Officeworks, Coles and Woolworths  – making First Aid kits and supplies more consumer  accessible.     The Sydney-based NPSU team continued to manage  supply chain operations and to offer a high level of  customer service to our end customers, St John State  and Territory organisations, and St John in Papua  New Guinea. This extends our reach and support in  Australia and the Asia Pacific.   Ethical Social Governance (ESG) remains a primary  focus across our 40 suppliers in Australia and  overseas, with factory audits conducted focussing on  compliance, quality assurance, social responsibility/ anti-slavery and performance reviews. The NPSU  is working with our suppliers on Global Recycling  Standards (GRS) and Forest Stewardship Council  (FSC) certification. The NPSU maintains current  Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and the  Department of Health registrations.     The National Online Shop managed by the NPSU,  experienced growth of 28% from the previous year -  well above the industry standard, and was recognised  as a finalist for ‘Best End-to-End Customer service’ at  the prestigious Online Retail Industry Awards (ORIAS).  The National Online shop had sales of $1 Million in  May and June 2024 alone.

As a key strategic  business unit, the DTT functions as the organisation’s  digital agency, supported by a shared services  model. The team works to enhance St John’s digital  capabilities.   Over the last financial year, the DTT have made  significant contributions to St John’s digital landscape  through the stewardship, support, and operational  management of a Business Enterprise System (BES).  This system includes a suite of integrated Software  as a Service (SaaS) platforms, designed to enable  St John to achieve its commercial goals, while also  supporting its charitable mission, and ensuring  compliance obligations.   In addition to the management of day-to-day IT  functions, the DTT is uniquely positioned to promote  the sharing of best practice with delivery teams  Australia wide. This was pertinent throughout the  nation-wide rollout of St John’s market leading  classroom training delivery platform SJX. As well  as managing the technical implementation of SJX  “ We find ourselves at a dynamic and exciting time in St John’s history.  The organisation is in a persistent state of change as we adapt to meet  the growing needs of our customers and community to whom we so  proudly serve. Our technology is more than ever a fundamental enabler of  the integrated mission of St John’s State and Territory frontline operations– to make First Aid a part of everybody’s life. Shay McAuley, National IT Program Manager into BES, the DTT worked with state and territory  counterparts to inform their onboarding activities.  The Digital Transformation Team also includes an  eLearning authoring capability. This enables the  creation of a diverse suite of courseware for target  audiences, and supports operations and services  including: training and development; volunteer Event  Health Services; and patient transport.   This year, the eLearning team were recognised with  a second industry award for their Learner Driver First  Aid eLearning course. Another key achievement for  the DTT was the successful rollout of new feature-rich  websites to support First Aid Training, Event Health  Services, Product Sales, and Volunteers in three of our  State and Territory jurisdictions.  Finally, significant work is underway to strengthen  St John’s cyber security posture and provide uplift  against the Australian Signals Directorate Essential  8 maturity model. All areas of the business are under  review to ensure St John’s digital footprint is well  positioned and protected, to face the challenges of  an evolving threat landscape.  29    St John Ambulance Australia  Annual Report 2023-2024  ===== PAGE 30 ===== Major Achievements Delivered new  websites for  St John ACT, SA,  and TAS  Produced First Aid  eLearning packages  for St John PNG to  offer their community  Delivered new end- to-end TAE solution  to support accredited  training students   New Asthma and  Anaphylaxis eLearning  packages to support  classroom attendees   97.7% 94% St John Helpdesk  Satisfaction rating Global Benchmark  vs  Annual Report 2023-2024  St John Ambulance Australia    30  ===== PAGE 31 ===== Brand and Communications  Year in Review Australia-wide there is a wealth of experience and  skills within this space - staff promoting St John as  one of Australia’s most trusted charities, and as a  leader in First Aid Training, and Health and Medical  Services. The focus continues to be on promoting  the excellence of our people, services and products,  whilst educating the Australian public on life-saving  interventions.   In 2023/2024 the National Brand and Communications  function continued to build its foundations as a  relatively new offering within the Australian Office.

There has also been work  on our foundations and processes - commencing  audits and improvements for digital, social media,  collateral, media management, intellectual property,  and stakeholder newsletters. These improvements  will continue to be incrementally rolled out, but we are  already seeing the benefits.  It was a year of some great campaign style activations  to engage our communities. This included a  continuation of 140 Year Anniversary Celebrations,  promotion of our Driver First Aid Programs, a national  Thank You to our volunteers, and various media  activities around World First Aid Day, Restart a Heart  Day, and St John’s Day - keeping our people and work  top of mind.  31    St John Ambulance Australia  Annual Report 2023-2024  ===== PAGE 32 ===== Major Achievements Top 4  Most Trusted Charity  in Australia (RepTrak 2023)  6 Communications Community of  Practice Meetings held - virtual and  Face-to-Face (All States & Territories)   2,168,000 Australians reached with positive  messages through Australian Office  channels $60k Grant funded improvements and digital  awareness for Learner Driver First Aid      Queensland University of Technology  trial and evaluation of  Learner Driver First Aid  demonstrating positive efficacy  5 Submissions to Australian Government  Ministers, Departments and the Senate  to raise our advocacy profile       11 Unique events, campaigns, and media  activations were supported.     Annual Report 2023-2024  St John Ambulance Australia    32  ===== PAGE 33 ===== Partnerships  Year in Review One of the most significant achievements was the  formalisation of our strategic partnership with CSL  Seqirus, the world’s sole producer of antivenoms  for Australia’s most venomous creatures.  This  collaboration is undertaking the shared goal of  boosting the general public’s awareness and  understanding of first aid for bites and stings. By  combining our expertise and resources, CSL Seqirus  and St John Ambulance Australia have united to  strengthen public awareness around the critical  message of the importance of first aid, particularly  among younger generations, through our First  Aid in Schools program, focusing on bites and  stings. Through CSL Seqirus’ support, more young  Australians can be aware of the dangers and learn life  saving skills in first aid.    In September 2023, we expanded our strategic  initiatives by establishing a partnership with the  National Road Transport Association (NATROAD).  Through this partnership, we launched Truckies  First Aid (TFA), a free online First Aid training course  designed to equip truck drivers with essential  emergency response skills. Beyond this, we have  also released a specialised First Aid kit, which is  now available to all truck drivers further aiding in  their ability to deliver important care on the road.  Both the course and kit have been born from the  need to ensure Truck Drivers are equipped on the  roads, recognising that they are often the First  Responders at the scene of a crash or other roadside  medical emergency. This partnership brings St John  further along our mission of preserving life, and also  highlights our shared commitment with NATROAD  in supporting truck drivers nationwide to be better  prepared to handle emergency situations.  The National Brand Partnerships Group (NBPG),  established in the previous financial year (2022/2023),  has continued to foster collaborative efforts to  maximise the benefits of our national partnerships.  This group remains dedicated to ensuring that St John  Ambulance Australia leverages and benefits from each  partnership effectively, driving growth and impact on a  national scale.  This financial year has been marked by noteworthy progress for the  Partnerships team with efforts to build a strong pipeline of partnership  discussions, setting the stage for future national brand collaborations.  We have made substantial strides in key strategic partnerships, which are  paving the way for impactful initiatives and enhanced public engagement.  33    St John Ambulance Australia  Annual Report 2023-2024  ===== PAGE 34 ===== Major Achievements 5  Meetings held by National  Brand Partnerships Group 900+  Participants in Truck Drivers First Aid 390+  Truck Drivers First Aid kits sold 14,000  School students in NSW reached  through St John First Aid in Schools  program by partnering with CSL Seqirus Annual Report 2023-2024  St John Ambulance Australia    34  ===== PAGE 35 ===== Strategic Programs: Youth  Year in Review In March 2024, St John Tasmania  introduced its rejuvenated youth program,  that features an updated approach,  enhancing its local impact.  The National Youth Group (NYG), consisting  of Youth Managers and Leaders from  across the country, continues to collaborate  effectively to ensure best practices  and maintain consistency across youth  programs nationwide. The team also  continues to support States and Territories  in curriculum development, and other  nationally agreed projects.   Another major development this financial  year was the successful implementation  of ‘Phase One’ of the comprehensive  review of the national Youth Proficiency  Badge program, which was initiated in  2022. This review has led a streamlining of  the program, incorporating feedback that  highlighted the need for greater flexibility  and an emphasis on youth enjoyment.  Outdated badges have been replaced with  newly designed, more relevant badges that  better align with current objectives. These  new badges, designed by St John youth  members and cadets, will be introduced  nationwide as each phase of the rollout  progresses through 2024 and 2025.  Additionally, the 2023/2024 year saw the  launch of initiatives to enhance youth  engagement, including an Impact Study  on our St John Youth Program. The  findings from this study are expected to  provide valuable evidence to the program’s  impact, which will be instrumental in  securing improved funding opportunities,  and fostering partnerships. This evidence  will also support the retention of current  members by allowing them to celebrate  the program’s successes, and will aid  in recruiting new ones by effectively  communicating the positive impact of our  youth program. The outcomes of this study  are expected to be released in the 2024- 2025 financial year.    Furthermore, The Norma Bell Youth  Leadership Fund enabled two of our youth  leaders to travel to Singapore for the Asia  Pacific Youth Competitions in July 2023.  These leaders observed the international  competitions and shared their learnings for  future events.  Overall, the St John Youth Program  continues to expand in its reach and  impact, while adapting to suit the evolving  needs of its youth participants.  The St John Youth Program, designed for young people aged  8-18, focuses on First Aid, Leadership, and Community Service.  During the 2023/2024 financial year, the program has  continued to expand, and is now actively engaging youth  across five States and Territories, reflecting its growing  impact and reach across Australia.   35    St John Ambulance Australia  Annual Report 2023-2024  ===== PAGE 36 ===== 8  Refreshed proficiency  badges released as  part of a complete  review of the curriculum  8  National Youth Group  meetings held – virtual  and face-to-face  meetings Released brand  new first aid resources  for all youth and Junior  members Major Achievements Annual Report 2023-2024  St John Ambulance Australia    36  ===== PAGE 37 ===== Strategic Programs: Ophthalmic  Year in Review St John Ambulance Australia proudly hosted a  webinar on First Aid for eye injuries, to commemorate  the occasion of World Sight Day 2023.

Their invaluable contribution in sharing their expertise  and time, have empowered our volunteers and paid  staff with specialised knowledge, which will further  enhance their ability to provide effective care in eye  injury situations.  The 2023/2024 financial year reflected our ongoing dedication to  advancing eye care and ophthalmic first aid, ensuring that both our resources  and expertise contribute effectively to improving vision health across the  varying communities that the St John ophthalmic programs support.   Furthermore, in 2023, a comprehensive recruitment  process was undertaken to appoint a new Australian  Priory Hospitaller. This process provided an  opportunity to review and refine the key objectives of  the Ophthalmic program, ensuring alignment with the  broader organisational strategic direction. By doing  so, we have ensured that resources are optimally  allocated for maximum impact. Our commitment to  supporting the work being done by the St John Eye  Hospital Group (SJEHG) remains unwavering.   In December 2023, we conducted a successful  emergency donation appeal, raising $10,000 in direct  support for the hospital. During challenging times, we  continue to communicate with our colleagues in the  SJEHG and provide support where possible.  37    St John Ambulance Australia  Annual Report 2023-2024  ===== PAGE 38 ===== Appointment of Priory Hospitaller   Daniel Ciccosillo has been appointed as the  new Hospitaller of the Priory in Australia.  He has an extensive history with St John,  joining as a cadet in 1996, and has been  a highly active volunteer ever since.   Daniel has a profound knowledge of the  Order of St John, is a leader in ceremonial  events, and is heavily engaged with our youth  programs, community programs and mentoring.  With a strong background in health services  management, and a proven track record of  leadership within the St John organisation,  Daniel is well-prepared to build on the  exceptional work of our previous Hospitaller,  Professor Nitin Verma. Daniel’s diverse skills  and knowledge will ensure the Order’s  Ophthalmic tradition is advanced and  celebrated in line with the strategic goals  of the Priory.

We have made considerable  strides in reinforcing collaboration, refining  our safeguarding network, and enhancing  our training frameworks.  Our efforts to strengthen national  collaboration have been evident  through updated terms of reference  and membership for the National Child  Safeguarding Group, which align closely  with the evolving landscape of child  safeguarding. We facilitated six meetings  over the last financial year, in line with the  National Board dates, ensuring a cohesive  approach across all States and Territories.  Additionally, we implemented a reporting  mechanism for the National Child  Safeguarding Group to keep the Board  informed, addressing areas identified in  the Child Wise mid-accreditation review.  The Child Wise mid-accreditation review  affirmed that we have maintained our  Child Safe status, while also identifying  areas for growth. We have refocused  our workplan to better align with our  organisational function and risk profile.  Furthering this work will involve ensuring  a common vision and strategy for  strengthening safeguarding policies and  processes in governance and practice.  In terms of training, we undertook a  comprehensive review and update of  our e-learning resources. The revision  included a significant update to the  scripting, placing greater emphasis on  institutional child abuse, and grooming— particularly the wider grooming by adults  within organisations.   The organisation of our National Child  Protection Week Challenge was a highlight  of this reporting period, reaching over  2,500 St John Ambulance (SJA) members,  across six States and Territories, including  Queensland, ACT, Tasmania, Northern  Territory, South Australia, and the National  Office. Notably, 54% of those reached  were volunteers or Order Members,  while 43% were staff. This widespread  engagement highlights our collective  dedication to spreading vital child  safeguarding messages, and commitment  to keeping our youth safe.  We also began developing an advanced  training module, (CHCPRT001), “Identify  and Respond to Children and Young  People at Risk”, for those who have  greater interactions with children and  youth.  Through consultations with the  National Child Safety Advisory Group and  the National Youth Group, we identified  a need for interactive, discussion-based  training, with case studies, which could  be rolled out both in person and digitally.  This led to the development of trainings  covering 17 topics, categorised into six  themes: culture, engagement, compliance,  reporting, investigations, and safety.  To date, half of these topics have been  developed into training modules and are  now being delivered.   This year’s progress highlights the positive  growth in child safeguarding. We continue  to build on these achievements, working  towards a safer and well-informed future  for all.  39    St John Ambulance Australia  Annual Report 2023-2024  ===== PAGE 40 ===== Major Achievements 6  Meetings over the last financial year  ensuring a cohesive approach across all  States and Territories  2,500   Participants in the  National Child Protection  Week Challenge   New e-Learning module  development and  enhancements progress Development of trainings covering 17  topics, categorised into six themes: culture,  engagement, compliance, reporting,  investigations, and safety Annual Report 2023-2024  St John Ambulance Australia    40  ===== PAGE 41 ===== Inaugural Chancellor’s Dinner  Celebrating 140 years of impact  and embracing kindness  On Saturday 11 November 2023, the inaugural  Chancellor’s Dinner event took place at the Museum  of Australian Democracy at Old Parliament House in  Canberra. The dinner was hosted by Cameron Oxley  GCStJ, Chancellor of the Australian Priory of the  Order of St John, with the support of the Australian  Office Team.   This event was an opportunity to celebrate the  significant milestone of 140 Years of St John  Ambulance services and volunteering in Australia.  It recognised our tremendous history and efforts of  all St John’s dedicated volunteers, members, staff  and supporters – past and present. It echoed the  sentiments of our 140 Year messages - that help  never grows old and kindness is always relevant,  and that while times have changed across the  decades, our commitment to core vision and values  is unwavering.    Speakers on the night included Chancellor, Cameron  Oxley with his warm welcome address, Lord Prior,  Professor Mark Compton GCStJ, with a moving  keynote address, and guest speaker, Kath Koschel  of the Kindness Factory, who touched on the theme  of kindness – facilitated by St John Ambulance  Australia CEO, Brendan Maher who undertook the  role of MC.     Various videos, photos and historic memorabilia  were displayed throughout the night to convey  a story of national and global impact. Notable  international guests included Deputy Chancellor  of St John Hato Hone, Brendan Wood, and Chief  Executive of St John Ambulance Papua New  Guinea, Matthew Cannon. We were delighted to also  be joined by St John CEOs, Chairs, Staff, Volunteers  and Members from across all States and Territories.   It was inspiring to hear positive video messages  of anniversary congratulations shared from the St  John family around the world, including, St John  International, St John Cymru (Wales), St John South  Africa, St John Ambulance Saint-Jean in Canada,  St John Ambulance Papua New Guinea, and the  Museum of the Order of St John in England. A  special gift signifying friendship and collaboration  between Australia and New Zealand, was gifted by  St John Hato Hone.  Thank you to event sponsors Full Care, and event  supporters AON, Shadforth, and T&S Sign Craft.  This event was well received and has been  announced for a second year, with the intent to  make it an annual recognition of achievement and  commitment across our network.  41    St John Ambulance Australia  Annual Report 2023-2024  ===== PAGE 42 ===== Annual Report 2023-2024  St John Ambulance Australia    42  ===== PAGE 43 ===== Clinical Governance Committee  Clinical Governance Committee Report 2023-2024  The National Clinical Governance Committee (CGC)  continues to serve as a vital source of guidance and  direction for St John’s first aid protocols, which are  implemented in both accredited and non-accredited  training. The committee remains instrumental in  shaping and updating the Clinical Practice Guidelines,  which define the scope of practice for St John  volunteers across Australia.  The CGC was impacted by adjustments to staffing this  past year. Of significance was the passing of Emeritus  Professor Peter Leggat AM KStJ. Emeritus Professor  Leggat was the previous chair of the CGC and  current chair of the St John Human Research Ethics  Committee. He provided his knowledge, expertise,  grace, and good humour to the CGC and its previous  iterations as the Medical Advisory Panel for more than  10 years. We acknowledge his passing with great  sadness and express our thanks for his extraordinary  service to St John.   The National Training Manager (Mark Molloy) and the  National Publications Manager (Gabrielle Lhuede)  also departed the organisation. The CGC members  past and present have been effusive in their praise of  Gabrielle Lhuede for playing such a significant role  as the quiet backbone of the CGC for many years,  and for her dedication to St John. We wish these staff  every success for the future.   To mitigate these impacts the CGC managed  most activity ‘out of session’ so as to be as timely  as possible. The CGC received requests from  jurisdictions for: materials related to Australian and  New Zealand Standards; guidance around specific  products for use by both Event Health Services (EHS)  and for potential inclusion in the stock list at the  National Product Sourcing Unit (NPSU); and support  for handling of external complaints / queries related  first aid or clinical care.  Externally the CGC maintained its commitment to the  Australian Resuscitation Council (ARC) with Jason  Belcher (WA) beginning as the St John representative  on the national council. St John values its position  on the ARC as a foundation member. The CGC  also provided input into the Australian Council on  Healthcare Standards (ACHS) – Clinical Indicators  for Ambulance Health Services, and the Australian  Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care –  National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards  Guide for Ambulance Health Services.

The Chair position  remained vacant as at 30 June 2024. 43    St John Ambulance Australia  Annual Report 2023-2024  ===== PAGE 44 ===== Historical Society    In 2023, we celebrated the 140th anniversary of the  establishment of St John Ambulance in Australia. This  milestone stimulated widespread interest in local,  national and worldwide St John history among our  members. The multi-faceted history of our Order has  something to interest everyone – whether it be an  interest in medieval times, the development of first aid  and medical practices, or in the stories of individuals  who have devoted their lives to supporting the mission  of the Order – Pro Utilitate, Pro Hominum.   The Historical Society of the Australian Priory, its  State and Territory museums and groups, worked  behind the scenes during this reporting period to  maintain collections, conduct research, and welcome  members and visitors to various historical events. Our  AGM was held on 27 July 2023, and we welcomed  a large audience due to the online format. All States  and Territories were represented, and discussions  were held about modernising our constitution. Lynne  Dansie was welcomed as the incoming Chair of the  South Australian historical group, as well as the Order  Librarian Todd Skilton (St John New Zealand), who  spoke highly of our archival work and publications.   The Society also conducted its 25th consecutive  annual History Seminar in November (both face-to- face and recorded). This seminar was conducted  at the Hotel Realm in the ACT, and we thank the  Australian Office for their interest and support. The  event included a keynote address by Matt Anderson,  Director of the Australian War Memorial; and a  presentation by Dr Neil Conn, our patron. The  2024 seminar will again be held in Canberra, and  we look forward to the 2025 seminar during the  centenary year of Cadets in Australia.  Four issues of Pro Utilitate were published  by Dr Elizabeth Ellis, Editor and Secretary,  who we thank for her time and contribution of  engrossing historical facts. One St John, Vol.  8 was published on the St John International  website. It is pleasing to report the imminent  publication of both the official history of St John  in New South Wales (by Dr Matthew Glozier,  Priory Librarian), and the centenary history of St  John in Western Australia (“Order from Chaos”).  These will both be valued scholarly additions to  the recorded history of the work of the Order in  Australia.   The Australian Historical Society continues  to grow from strength-to-strength thanks to  volunteers who humbly work behind the scenes  to capture and progress our story. Sincere  thanks to all State and Territory history groups  and Officers, and the Australian Office for  support of our work. In our 140th anniversary  year, we can celebrate and be proud of our  history, as we look to building an even stronger  future.  President, Historical Society   Dr David Fahey AM CStJ Annual Report 2023-2024  St John Ambulance Australia    44  ===== PAGE 45 ===== Chancellor’s promotion  to Bailiff Grand Cross Cameron Oxley is highly respected and completely  devoted to the Order, in particular in his role as  Chancellor. With more than 16 years of service to The  Order and those it serves, Cameron draws on the  extensive connections he has built domestically and  internationally to further the mission and vision of St  John in Australia, and across the world.  Cameron first joined St John as a Board Member with  St John Ambulance Victoria in 2008 (later becoming  Chair). In 2011, he became a member of the Australian  Priory Board, and a Priory Officer in 2017, and then  was appointed Chancellor of the Australian Priory in  2019. Cameron’s business acumen has contributed  to establishing sound governance practices, and he  proactively leads a skills-based membership on the  Australian Priory Board.   He has represented the Australian Priory at Grand  Council since 2019, expanding positive relationships  across the global network. He has also fulfilled  past roles as a member of the Trustees Executive  Committee (TEC), and the Order Honours Awards  Committee (OHAC). Cameron continues his  commitment to international growth and stability of  the Order through his work as chair of the Asia-Pacific  Regional Group and has achieved significant and  successful outcomes using the new regional approach  across the Asia-Pacific – most recently in St John in  Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.  Cameron promotes inclusion – recognising and  celebrating the inherent cultural, socio-economic,  faith, and gender diversity amongst the people  and communities of St John. He has furthered the  organisation’s direction with reconciliation and has  encouraged equitable gender representation on the  Australian Priory Board.  His proactive and inclusive leadership style has been  evident during his entire service. Especially in recent  tumultuous years, as communities responded to  significant events including, the global COVID-19  pandemic, natural disasters, economic uncertainties,  and other community crises. During this time Cameron  contributed significantly to growth across St John  Ambulance Australia – generating a positive impact in  areas of increasing service to those in need, improving  strategic direction, stakeholder engagement,  organisational sustainability, and service innovation.  Following the sanction by His Majesty King Charles III on 31st January 2024,  Cameron Oxley, Chancellor of the Australian Priory, was promoted to Bailiff  Grand Cross. This is the most senior grade within the Order, awarded to those  who have demonstrated the utmost integrity, loyalty and devotion to the Order  of St John.   “ Congratulations to Cameron  Oxley on this prestigious and  well-deserved promotion, in  recognition of great commitment,  leadership, and passion for the  work of St John both in Australia  and internationally. Brendan Maher,   CEO St John Ambulance Australia 45    St John Ambulance Australia  Annual Report 2023-2024  ===== PAGE 46 ===== Dean of the Priory Report  Over the past year, my role as a Priory Officer has  changed from Sub Prelate, a title used since 1941, to  Dean of the Priory. During this time, in collaboration  with the Principal Chaplains, Deans across our  States and Territories, and International Priories and  Associations, we have been focusing on the crucial  issue of inclusive membership within our Order,  keeping in mind the societal changes happening in  many countries, including Australia.  The College of Deans meets annually at Grand  Council to discuss various important topics.  This year, the main issues have been:  •	 How to honour our Christian roots while  welcoming those of other faiths and no faith. •	 How to develop effective pastoral chaplaincy and  spiritual support for staff and volunteers.  •	 How to navigate the challenges and opportunities  of interfaith relations in different parts of the world.  •	 How to contribute meaningfully to our Order’s  Strategic Plan and uphold our St John values. In some regions, the Christian Church exists as a  minority faith alongside others like Judaism, Islam,  Hinduism, and Buddhism. In diverse, multiethnic  societies, this is similar to the situation in ‘post- Christian’ societies. Christian hospitality can serve as  a guiding principle for how the Order relates to other  faiths, especially in times of ideological conflict when  misunderstandings between religions can arise. As  the Venerable Order of St John continues to grow as a  multi-ethnic international organisation, it must remain  welcoming to other faiths while staying true to its  Christian origins.  The Order remains committed to the dignity and  well-being of all people, providing medical aid  and community support to thousands through its  volunteers and professionals, under the banner of the  Cross and the motto, “For the Faith and the Service of  Humanity.”  Bishop Richard Hurford, OAM KStJ Annual Report 2023-2024  St John Ambulance Australia    46  ===== PAGE 47 ===== The Australian Priory  As the Priory Office for St John in Australia, we take this opportunity to recognise all our members and the great  work they and their families do to uphold the mottos of our international organisation.

Material accounting policy information New or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations adopted The Company has adopted all of the new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the  Australian Accounting Standards Board (‘AASB’) that are mandatory for the current reporting period. Any new or amended Accounting Standards or Interpretations that are not yet mandatory have not been early  adopted Basis of preparation These general purpose financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Australian Accounting  Standards - Simplified Disclosures issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (‘AASB’), the Australian  Charities and Not-forprofits Commission Act 2012, Charitable Fundraising Act 1991 (NSW), Charitable Collections  Act 2003 (ACT) and associated regulations. During the current reporting period, the company adopted AASB 2021-6 Amendments to Australian Accounting  Standards - Disclosure of Accounting Policies: Tier 2 and Other Australian Accounting Standards. The application  of these amendments did not have a material impact on the company’s financial statements but has changed the  disclosure of accounting policy information in the financial statements.  The adoption of these Accounting Standards and Interpretations did not have any significant impact on the financial  performance or position of the company.  Any new or amended of these Accounting Standards or Interpretations that are not yet mandatory have not been  early adopted. The accounting policies that are material to the Company are set out below. The accounting policies adopted are  consistent with those of the previous financial year, unless otherwise stated. Historical cost convention The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for, where applicable, the  revaluation of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Critical accounting estimates The preparation of the financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires  management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies. The areas  involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to  the financial statements, are disclosed in note 2. Foreign currency translation The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is the Company’s functional and presentation  currency. For the year ended 30 June 2024 67    St John Ambulance Australia  Annual Report 2023-2024  ===== PAGE 68 ===== Note 1. Material accounting policy information (continuted) Revenue recognition Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the goods,  which is generally at the time of delivery. State and Territory contributions  The directors approve the contributions budget in advance of each financial year. Contribution income receivable  is recorded when the likelihood of the member remaining is probable. As the contribution entitles States and  Territories to services and benefits during the covered period, this contribution income is recognised as unearned  income. This unearned income is then recognised on a straight-line basis so that over the duration of the  membership, it reflects the timing, nature and value of the benefits provided.  Training courses and events  Revenue from training courses and events is recognised at the point in time when the training course/event has  occurred.  Rendering of services Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised over time as the services are rendered based on either a  fixed price or an hourly rate. Dividend and other investment revenue  Dividends and other investment revenue are recognised when the right to receive payment is established. Donations and fundraising events  The timing of the recognition of donations, grants and fundraising depends upon the point in time at which  control of these monies is obtained. Control would normally occur upon the earlier of the receipt of the monies or  notification that the monies have been secured.  Grants  Grant revenue is recognised in profit or loss on receipt unless there are specific performance obligations in line  with the funding agreement and the grant is enforceable. The grant will be recognised in the statement of financial  position as a liability until those conditions are satisfied. Licence fee revenue  Licence fee revenue is recognised straight line over the period of the licence. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions, other short- term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known  amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value and bank overdrafts.  Trade and other receivables The Company applies the simplified approach permitted by AASB 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be  recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.

Material accounting policy information (continued) Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value represents the estimated  selling price for inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale. Property, plant and equipment The depreciable amount of all fixed assets, including buildings and capitalised lease assets, but excluding freehold  land, is depreciated on a straight line basis over the asset’s useful life to the company commencing from the time  the asset is available for use. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of either the unexpired period of the lease or the  estimated useful lives of the improvements.  Buildings	 	 	 	 	 	         2.5% Plant and equipment	 	 	 	 	        10% to 40% Right-of-use assets Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated  useful life of the asset, whichever is the shorter.  The estimated useful life used for each class of right-of-use assets is:  Leases of buildings - 6 years Financial instruments Initial recognition and measurement Classification  As per AASB 9, the Company classified its financial assets in the following measurement categories: •	 those to be measured subsequently at fair value through profit or loss (“FVPL”), and •	 those to be measured at amortised cost. Recognition and derecognition  Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade-date, the date on which the Company  commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from  the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all the  risks and rewards of ownership. Measurement  At initial recognition, the Company measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset  not at FVPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset.  The Company subsequently measures all investments that do not qualify for measurement at amortised cost and all  equity investments at fair value through profit or loss.

Material accounting policy information (continuted) Employee benefits Short-term employee benefits Liabilities for wages and salaries and annual leave represent present obligations resulting from employees’ services  provided up to the reporting date and are calculated at undiscounted amounts based on remuneration, wage  and salary rates that the Company expects to pay as at the reporting date including related on-costs such as  superannuation and worker’s compensation.  Long service leave  The liability for long service leave expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date is measured in  accordance with the note above.  The liability for long service leave expected to be settled more than 12 months from reporting date is recognised  as liabilities but is measured based on remuneration rates current as at reporting date for all employees with five or  more years of service. Forward foreign exchange hedging contracts (Derivative financial instruments) The company uses forward foreign currency hedging contracts to hedge the risks associated with foreign currency  fluctuations. Forward foreign exchange hedging contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date the  hedging contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each reporting date.  The fair value of forward exchange hedging contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates  for contracts with similar maturity profiles.  Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of forward foreign exchange hedging contracts are included in  profit or loss and are classified as current or non-current depending on the expected period of realisation.

Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2024 Annual Report 2023-2024  St John Ambulance Australia    70  ===== PAGE 71 ===== Note 2. Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and  assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. Management continually evaluates its  judgements and estimates in relation to assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenue and expenses.  Management bases its judgements, estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on other various  factors, including expectations of future events, management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.  There are no critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions that are likely to affect the current or  future financial years. The Directors evaluate estimates and judgments incorporated into the financial statements based on historical  knowledge and best available current information. Estimates assume a reasonable expectation of future events and  are based on current trends and economic data, obtained both externally and within the Company. Impairment - general  The Company assesses impairment at the end of each reporting period by evaluation of conditions and events  specific to the Company that may be indicative of impairment triggers. Estimation of useful lives of assets  The estimation of the useful lives of assets has been based on historical experience. In addition, the condition  of the assets is assessed at least once per year and considered against the remaining useful life. Adjustments to  useful lives are made when considered necessary.  Lease term   The lease term is a significant component in the measurement of both the right-of-use asset and lease liability.  Judgement is exercised in determining whether there is reasonable certainty that an option to extend the lease or  purchase the underlying asset will be exercised, or an option to terminate the lease will not be exercised, when  ascertaining the periods to be included in the lease term. In determining the lease term, all facts and circumstances  that create an economical incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option, are  considered at the lease commencement date. Factors considered may include the importance of the asset to the  Company’s operations; comparison of terms and conditions to prevailing market rates; incurrence of significant  penalties; existence of significant leasehold improvements; and the costs and disruption to replace the asset. The  Company reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination  option, if there is a significant event or significant change in circumstances.

On behalf of the Board of St John WA Group, welcome to the Board Communique, this is the first edition, for  2024.The St John WA Group Board Communique is released eight times per year: after each of the four  quarterly and four mid-quarter Board meetings. This Communique represents a summary of a quarterly  meeting. The Board positions itself with high levels of honesty and transparency. The St John WA Board  provides governance to the organisation to enable it to better deliver on its charitable purpose:    ‘To serve humanity and build resilient communities, through the relief  of sickness, distress, suffering and danger.’       Role of the St John WA Board    The Group Board’s role is in keeping with St John WA’s need to pursue its charitable purpose effectively and  meet its obligations under the law, and has four roles aligned to Australian Institute of Company Directors  (AICD) parameters, being:      Role 1. Group CEO oversight and resourcing  Role 2. Group performance and accountability  Role 3. Group compliance and risk  Role 4. Group strategic direction    St John WA Board Directors govern the organisation sustainably, and create value (such as social,  economic, data, human capital) completely aligned to the St John WA purpose. In performing its duties, the  Board follows the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), St John WA Constitution, the 10 AICD Governance  Principles, the six Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission’s Governance Standards and the  appropriate ASX Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations. All St John WA Board members  are to be AICD, or equivalently, qualified. The Board Chair is not superior to the GCEO – the Board and the  GCEO have two different Charters.  St John WA organisation-wide values are:   Lead with Heart     Think Team   Make it Better   Walk the Talk      Highlights of the February Quarterly Board Meeting  The Board of St John WA would like to commence this Communique with recognition of St John WA team  members who are committed to looking after Western Australians through the Christmas and New Year  season.  The organisation is certainly advancing, and we are grateful to each and every team member for  the value they are bringing to this ‘next generation’ of the organisation.   Acknowledgements  An Acknowledgement of Country: New Board member Matt Mueller paid respect to the Traditional lands and  language groups across Western Australia, as the Traditional Custodians of Country, and recognised First  Nations peoples deep connection to the land, especially during the current Noongar season of Bunuru, a  time marked by the flowering Marri and hot, dry weather. In this year, with the Board’s theme being  'Environment', we draw inspiration from the First Nations understanding of seasons, encouraging us to reflect   ===== PAGE 2 =====   February 2024 – St John WA Group Board Communique    February 2024  Page 2 of 4  on our responsibility towards environmental stewardship as we support the wellbeing and health of  communities across WA, especially during the hottest time of the year.    As an Acknowledgement of St John, myself and Jeffrey Williams called for celebration of St John Australia’s  Chair and Chancellor, Cam Oxley who was awarded the highest honour of Bailiff Grand Cross, of the Order  of St John. His award is for years of unwavering dedication, service, and contribution both nationally and  internationally, demonstrating exceptional leadership qualities, strategic vision and a strong commitment  through St John Australia.  This Board meeting marked the first official Board meeting for new members Matt Mueller and Monish Paul,  although they were working hard through induction processes, and Committee engagement since January  2024, in preparation of their formal appointment with effect from 1 February 2024. We are grateful of the  calibre, and character, of such additions at Board level.   Group CEO reporting  The Group CEO led three hours of Quarterly Operational Reporting and Quarterly Strategic Reporting, a new  reporting method in 2024, to enable the Board to complete its roles one to three, oversight and resourcing of  the Group CEO, Group performance and accounting, and Group risk and compliance. The quarterly  highlights across the full 17 external-facing services, and internal corporate services of the Group are:   •  St John WA Group:   o  Stronger Safety and Health reporting including Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate focus  across the full 17 services1, with measure of 42.30 in December 2022 now decreased to  29.95 (December 2023) – further focus on decreasing the LTIFR.  o  Operating revenue under budget by 1% as at December 31, with low surplus figures due to  increased investment in all forms of transformation.  o  The inaugural quarterly culture survey revealed a Group Net Promoter Score (eNPS) of 17,  with the volunteer segment recording a score of 40. The NPS is measured on a scale of - 100 to +100  and the results set a solid baseline for the new culture survey platform  o  An inaugural customer satisfaction survey resulted in a NPS of 31, it was the first time this  was measured and indicated an 86% customer satisfaction rate.   o  The quarterly strategic report showed there were 271,000 customer connection points in Q2  (313,000 in Q1).  o  Both paid and volunteer team member numbers are increasing to meet demand.  •  Service Stream 1: Preventative (services of First Aid and Mental Health First Aid Training,  Defibrillator Network, First Responder Network and App, St John Safe and First Aid Focus)  o  The Board noted a successful First Aid Training tender with WA Police, that the organisation  had reached 10,000 defibrillators registered by St John WA, a revised First Aid for Mental  Health course launched and 12 First Aid for Me courses were introduced.    o  The Board also heard of the progress of the new St John WA Cadet program currently in  creation..   •  Service Stream 2: Community (services of GP, Dental, Urgent Care Centres, Event Health Services,  and Industry Medical Services)  o  Advancing door-to-initial-assessment rates in the St John WA Urgent Care Centres, were  noted by the Board, as well as Community Stream’s introduction a new App for the hearing- impaired, an investigation on dental services for vulnerable people, and health care for  homeless people.  o  The Board noted improved culture scores across most of this Stream, and action plans in  place to target priority areas.     1 Services include: Service Stream 1, Preventative – First Aid training, Mental Health First Aid Training, First Aid Focus, First Aid  Products, State Defibrillator Network, First Responder, St John Safe. Service Stream 2, Community – Urgent Care, General Practice,  Dental, Event Health Services, Industry Medical Services. Service Stream 3, Emergency – Ambulance, State Operations Centre,  Special Services, Patient Transport Services, Community Transport Services.     ===== PAGE 3 =====   February 2024 – St John WA Group Board Communique    February 2024  Page 3 of 4  •  Service Stream 3: Emergency (services of Ambulance, State Operations Centre, Special Emergency  Services, Patient and Community Transport)  o  The Board noted attrition had decreased by about one third in the first six months of FY24  when compared to the average of FY23, and a growing incident reporting culture was  evident.  o  It noted that the metropolitan ambulance response times were the best since the same  quarter in 2020 with 86.6 per cent of Priority 1 cases attended within 15 minutes, compared  to 85.8 per cent during the same quarter in 2020. Crews transported 4.2 per cent more  patients to ED in Q4 2023 compared to the same period in 2020.  o  Regarding the Patient Transport Service, the Board noted that case volume had increased  over the last quarter.     •  St John WA Corporate Streams  o  People, Culture and Development: the Board heard of positive impact of new ‘values’  project, a review of Wellbeing Safety and Injury Management department, a focus on  stakeholder engagement mapping and work unfolding in the Volunteer Passport Program.   The Board noted recruitment facilitated an overall increase of almost 3000 to the SJWA  team, with an additional 1068 headcount joining the paid workforce and 1916 volunteers  joining the team compared to the previous calendar year.   o  Enterprise Performance: the Board heard of work on long-term built form planning,  procurement governance, uniform procurement, budget process within the new clear and  transparent Group Model, and long-term St John WA Group financial forecasting.   •  Strategic Plan: The Board rehearsed and noted data from the Quarterly Strategic Report scorecard  aligned to the St John WA June 2026 Strategic Plan to support the longer-term June 2030 strategic  direction. This report included tracking measurements of customer touch point numbers, delivery of  deeper wellbeing and health services, volunteering satisfaction, and culture and workplace  advancements. (Role 2 and 3)  General business  The Boad noted or approved an array of governance needs such as:   •  Committee reports: The Board’s Committee Chairs reported progress of the last 90 days and sought  approval or support from items below:   o  Audit and Investment Committee:   ▪  Built form: A further investment, outside of Group CEO Delegations of Authority, was  approved by the Board for the St John WA Albany Ambulance Depot. The additional  investment was agreed to cater for a greater scope of works, reinforcing St John WA  future needs in the area, respecting the volunteer workforce of the region, and  listening to the frontline teams on what their working environment could encompass.   ▪  Digital Transformation: The Board was provided with detailed information on the  five-year, large-scale digital transformation called Project Lighthouse, initiated to  enable the team to best provide leading customer service and standards (including  clinical standards in 10 of the 17 services with a clinical base), provide for security  and privacy assurance, and assist in forming an enjoyable place to work. Due to the  importance of Project Lighthouse, and commitment to it, at the February meeting,  the Board decided to join forces with senior executive to form a ‘Project Lighthouse  Project Team’ effective March. Members of the Board committed to this project team  are Craig Heatley, Chair of Audit and Investment, and new Board members Matt  Mueller and Monish Paul, both members of the Risk, Compliance and ESG  Committee. This Project Lighthouse Project Team enables greater agility in  decision-making, provides risk assurance for the Board, and adds external  stewardship throughout the early stages of the transformation journey.   o  Health, Safety and Culture Committee:   ▪  Workplace Gender Equity Act: The Board discussed that on 30 March 2023,  Parliament passed the Workplace Gender Equality Amendment (Closing the Gender  Pay Gap) Bill 2023, progressing the  Workplace Gender Equality Amendment  (Closing the Gender Pay Gap) Bill 2023 making amendments to the Workplace  Gender Equality Act 2012 (WGE Act). The Board therefore noted the St John WA   ===== PAGE 4 =====   February 2024 – St John WA Group Board Communique    February 2024  Page 4 of 4  WGEA Executive Summary and Industry Benchmark Report plus ways in which the  organisation was working towards improvements in scores.    ▪  Vulnerable Persons Definition and Framework: The Board noted a new positioning  recommended by the Board’s Health, Safety and Culture Committee pertaining to St  John WA’s positioning on ‘vulnerable persons’. This position firms up St John WA’s  purposeful commitment to both vulnerable people working and volunteering within St  John WA, plus its commitment to outward-facing services supportive of helping  vulnerable community members.    o  Risk, Compliance and ESG Committee  ▪  Internal Audit Plan: The Board supported a three-year internal audit plan – a key  component of St John WA’s commitment to leading-practice governance, and led by  new Internal Audit lead Ash Kumar.   o  Nominations and Remunerations Committee  ▪  Group CEO Accountability Framework: The Board worked through the advice from  external remuneration advisor to assess and progress this Framework  ▪  Board Composition Matrix: The Board approved a new 2024 Board Composition  Matrix, which has subsequently been uploaded on the St John WA Governance  page.  Next meeting  •  The March Board meeting is a yellow, or organic, Strategic Board meeting. Reporting from 16 annual  Committee meetings, and now Project Lighthouse Project Team, is included in full Board meeting  Communiques. The Board will do a deep dive on St John WA’s Urgent Care Centres as well as the  balance across all 17 services.  Closing remarks  •  Over the last 12 months, the Board, Group CEO and Chiefs have held a sharp focus on ‘making it  better’ through ‘safety’. The Board initiated a Health, Safety and Culture Committee at the start of  2023, and is increasing its meeting cadence of this Committee in 2024, through Chair, Elisa Fear.    •  The Board and Executive, having set the tone of high governance levels in 2023, is releasing the  company’s first environmental impact measures. It is calling 2024 the ‘Year of E’, after the ‘Year of  G’ of 2023, within a three-year journey on driving ESG within the organisation.

This plan has been co-designed with volunteers, staff and other stakeholders, and reflects the collective  ambitions of our organisation.  St John Ambulance was established in South Australia in 1885, and from humble beginnings grew to become  the state-wide ambulance service – a role that was undertaken with great pride. We have now evolved  into a modern organisation, providing lifesaving first aid training, health services at community events and  major emergencies, and support to older members of our community. The organisation has come a long  way in the past 135 years, and our future is bright as we move towards an even more contemporary St John  Ambulance SA.  As part of the development of Strategy 2025, we revisited our organisational values, which underpin our  new plan – Teamwork, Integrity, High Quality Services, Diversity and Respect. These values reflect both who  we are and remain aspirational as we continue to evolve.  Our strategic pillars provide us security as we continue what we do best, and challenge us to emerge into  new markets and opportunities to continue to make a difference in the community. We will continue to  educate South Australians using modern technologies, and respond at community and emergency events as  part of the fabric of the South Australian emergency services sector.  The Community Care program will support even more older members of the community, and we will invest  wisely to support this work. Our most important asset, our people, will be engaged to help meet our bold  strategic aims in the coming years.  Thank you to each and every one of our  members and stakeholders for your support,  and we look forward to seeing how you help  shape St John Ambulance SA over the next five  years and beyond. Karen Limb, Chair of the Board  Mark Groote, Chief Executive Officer   ===== PAGE 4 ===== 6 COMMUNITY IMPACT The work that we do and our strategy that  underpins it is all focused on providing benefit  to the South Australian community.
