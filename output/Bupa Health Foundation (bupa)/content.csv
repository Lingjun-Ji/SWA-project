Roger Davis Chairman On behalf of the Board, I present the  2024 Annual Report and Accounts to our  stakeholders and highlight the key themes: 2024 Progress and performance The Board has been very pleased with  Bupa’s strategic progress and financial  performance in 2024. Bupa has delivered  a strong set of financial results and our  businesses are all delivering on our  strategy. Iñaki Ereño’s Group CEO review  on pages 6 to 7, and James Lenton’s  Group CFO review on pages 17 to 19,  cover this in detail. During 2024, Niva Bupa became a  subsidiary of the Group, following our  acquisition of the controlling interest  in January, and in November 2024 I was  proud to attend its listing on the Indian  Stock Exchanges following completion  of its IPO. More detail on this can be  found on page 53. Our Customer Focus Bupa continues to aspire to be the  world’s most customer-centric healthcare  company and good progress has been  made on our three customer-centric  ambitions in 2024. In 2024 there was  improvement across all three strategic  ambitions and strong progress in all six  strategic and enabling pillars. Through the  Bupa Customer System, we seek feedback  following customer care touchpoints in  order to identify where we can do even  better, and this mindset, supported by so  many of our customers taking the time to  do this, helps us to deliver this progress.  Details of our customer centricity can be  found on pages 12 to 13. Our People and Culture The Board values the huge contribution  and commitment our people give to Bupa.  Our high standards of service and quality  of care could not be provided without  them.  The Board was incredibly pleased to  see that our employees feel the same  way about Bupa through our global  engagement scores from the biannual  Pulse surveys. Our scores increased  again in 2024, putting Bupa amongst  the top 10% of most engaged companies  worldwide in the Glint benchmark.  Bupa’s continued focus on diversity  and inclusion and health and wellbeing  in the workforce was recognised in the  engagement surveys, recording their  highest scores to date. Employees felt  they could be themselves at Bupa and  that diverse perspectives were valued.  They also felt well supported to look  after their health and wellbeing. You  can read more in People and Culture  on pages 28 to 32. Sustainability and ESG The Board were pleased with the  progress on delivering our sustainability  strategy in 2024, working to reduce   emissions and increase the use of  renewable energy. Bupa also launched  a 'Single-use Switch' initiative aimed at  reducing waste to landfill or incinerators  and reviewed its sustainable investment  approach.  As in prior years, the annual Bupa  Healthy Cities challenge took place  in 2024 with the highest global  participation so far and we ran another  successful eco-Disruptive programme.  We increased the number of  partnerships with national Paralympic  organisations in Paris ahead of the  2024 Paralympics. You can read about all of these, and  more, in ‘Delivering Sustainability and  ESG’ on pages 34 to 44.  Our Strategy 2024 was the final year of our 3x6  Strategy and the Board was pleased  with the progress Bupa has made since  the strategy was launched, and the  particularly strong performance this  year. The Board took time to reflect on  how Bupa’s strategy should evolve, to  continue building on this success going  forwards. Details of progress on the 3x6  Strategy is covered on pages 8 to 11, and  an outline of the new Bupa strategy and  how it was developed is covered on  pages 15 to 16 and 52. The Board We continued to focus on ensuring the  Board has the right skills and experience  to oversee the strategy and that there is  well-managed refreshment of the Board  in line with our Board succession plans.  During the year Simon Blair and Clare  Bousfield joined the Board and Gunjan  Bhow stepped down. Simon took over  as Chair of the Board Risk Committee in  2024. A special committee of the Board  was created to oversee the selection  process for my successor, as Chair of the  Board. We were delighted to announce  that Don Robert CBE was selected and  he joined the Board in February 2025 as  Chair-elect, to take over as Board Chair  when I retire in May 2025. It has been  a great privilege to be the Chairman of  Bupa for the last six years, and I am very  proud of everything which Bupa and its  people have achieved over that time. 2025 Focus Looking to 2025, Bupa is focused on  continuing our journey. It will continue  under strong leadership to closely  monitor execution of our strategy  and the transformation of our business,  to provide the best experience to our  customers in the most sustainable way  and keep delivering on our purpose.

Everyone at Bupa should  be proud of the progress we’ve  made in 2024.  Iñaki Ereño  Group CEO I’m incredibly proud of the dedication  and hard work our Bupa colleagues have  shown in caring for our customers and  improving our performance. Their  commitment to delivering outstanding  care has made a real difference. Our strategy is centred on digital  transformation, enhancing the customer  experience and making Bupa an even  better place to work — all while growing  our business and doing what we can to  make the world a better place. We now  serve over 60 million customers globally  and almost 7.5 million people are using  Blua, our digital health solution1. In 2024, we made positive progress  in three priority areas – our financial  performance, our customer experience  and our colleague engagement.  ■We’ve driven strong financial performance with revenue and underlying profit continuing to increase which is enabling us to reinvest in line with our purpose. ■Listening to our customers and implementing improvements based on their feedback has enabled us to keep improving our customers’ experience. As a result, the majority (92%) of our Business Units (BU) have improved their Net Promoter Score (NPS) this year with four BUs exceeding our world-class ambition of 80 NPS across the Group. ■In our second colleague engagement survey of the year, our score was 84 (up 2 from last year), a result that is regard as world-class. More colleagues than ever took part, with over 70,000 employees completing the survey. Strategic progress Since 2021, we have been focused on  delivering our 3x6 Strategy - centred  around three bold ambitions, supported  by six strategic and enabling pillars.  We are proud of the significant progress  we have made, having delivered  demonstrable results against each  of our three ambitions.  Performance in 2024, the final year of  the 3x6 Strategy, was especially strong  as we were able to build on the positive  momentum generated over previous years. ■40% customer care touchpoints owned by Bupa: At the end of 2024, we owned 26% of our customer care touchpoints, having significantly expanded our digital health offerings (via Blua) and our physical provision network. ■60% active digital customers: We ended the year with 46% of our funding customers actively engaging with us through digital channels, having successfully increased customer awareness and adoption of Blua. ■80 NPS: By the end of the year, we achieved an average NPS score of 67, having focused on implementing customer experience improvements for the benefit of our customers. 1.

In the final year of the strategy, we also made  significant progress against our six strategic  and enabling pillars, including: ■Customer: Our ambition is to be the world's  most customer-centric healthcare company,  which means we are committed to listening  to our customers and acting on their  feedback. This year, we implemented over  10,500 improvements to enhance the  experience of our customers, patients and  residents. These improvements have led  to tangible benefits for our customers,  as shown by the growth in NPS across  the majority (92%) of our BUs. ■Growth: We continue to grow our business  through strong organic customer growth.  We have around 38m health insurance  customers, reflecting a 27% increase from  last year, and 23m provision customers,  representing a 12% growth compared to  2023. In Australia, we’ve achieved nine  consecutive quarters of maintaining or  growing market share. In January 2024,  we increased our investment to become  the controlling shareholder in our Indian  health insurance business, Niva Bupa.  Subsequently, in November, Niva Bupa  successfully listed a minority shareholding  via an Initial Public Offering (IPO) and raised  additional capital, marking an exciting step  in the growth of the business.   * A key driver of insurance growth has been Niva Bupa,  our health insurance business in India. ■Transformation: A key driver of our  customer growth is Blua, our digital health  solution, which is helping us attract and  retain customers who prefer to access  healthcare digitally. Currently, almost 7.5m  customers are using Blua globally (up by  36% from 2023), benefiting from a network  of more than 16,700 clinicians. In 2024,  we delivered more than 6.5m digital  consultations. ■Sustainability: In 2024, our Healthy Cities  programme took place across all Market  Units. This initiative aims to improve the  physical and mental health of 1 million  people by 2025, while also contributing to  the restoration and regeneration of local  environments. Last year, there were 63,000  active participants in Healthy Cities,  collectively taking 16 billion steps (a 68%  increase in steps from 2023) and unlocking  £3.5m in nature-related investments (a 75%  increase from 2023).  ■Agile culture: Building an agile culture  is central to our strategy, and customer  feedback plays a key role in that. Through  Bupa’s Customer System, we’ve listened  to more than 81,000 customer feedback  videos and calls, generated 39,000  improvement ideas via our internal  Customer Listening Programme and  made over 10,500 improvements to  the customer experience. ■Data: Data is transforming how  we support our customers, enabling  smarter, faster and more personalised care.  Over 16,000 Bupa employees are now using  data from our platforms to inform decision- making (a 33% increase from 2023).  In 2024, we also ran our B-Disruptive  Hackathon, an internal initiative designed to  upskill employees in technology and unlock  their innovative ideas to provide a better  experience for our customers. Over 750  employees from 16 countries took part,  generating ideas for integrating Artificial  Intelligence (AI) into Blua.  Other highlights: ■In October, we hosted our 2024 Bupa  Healthcare Symposium, themed ‘Unboxing  Digital Health’, with over 1,000 attendees  from around the world, both in person and  online. During the event, we unveiled Bupa’s  industry-leading genome sequencing  programme, My Genomic Health. This pilot  programme offers more than 14,000  customers across the UK and Spain access  to their genetic risk profiles for identifying  preventable conditions, including certain  types of cancer. This initiative is a key  milestone in our journey to becoming a  preventative healthcare partner for our  customers. ■In 2024, we became partners with three  new Paralympic associations, having signed  agreements with New Zealand, Hong Kong  and Ecuador ahead of the 2024 Summer  Paralympics in Paris, bringing our support  of Paralympic associations to nine in total.  These partnerships provide a valuable  opportunity to create a positive social  impact and strengthen our reputation.  They have already led to initiatives like the  Inclusive Games organised by the Sanitas  Foundation, which took place in October  and brought together para-athletes and  able-bodied athletes to compete in  14 different sports. ■In June, we became the official global  healthcare partner of the All Blacks, Teams  in Black, and the international healthcare  partner of the Black Ferns. This four-year  partnership will focus on exploring and  promoting the connections between health  and high performance across all teams. Outlook  While we have made significant progress, we  know there is still more we can achieve. That’s  why we have launched a new ‘3x100 Strategy’  for 2025-27 which is designed to be an  evolution and acceleration of the current  3x6 Strategy.  We must stay focused on the work we’ve  been doing over the past four years, while  maintaining our relentless dedication to  providing a world-class customer experience  and continuing to build our data and digital  capabilities.  And we want to do more: more to support  healthcare systems by making high quality  healthcare available to more people and using  our global influence for good; more to support  our people by creating even more ways for  them to enjoy working at Bupa; and more to  deliver healthcare sustainably, protecting our  planet and supporting the communities  we serve. The macro-economic, political and regulatory  outlook continues to be uncertain, but we  remain confident for the future. We are  well-placed to navigate challenges and take  opportunities because of our underlying  financial strength, resilience and diversified  business model. Our purpose, ambition and  values continue to guide everything we do  and every decision we make. Our vision for  the future is to do even more to help people  live longer, healthier, happier lives and make  a better world.

The strategy was centred  around three bold ambitions and six strategic and enabling pillars Four years on, we are proud of the significant progress we have  made, having delivered demonstrable results against each of  our three ambitions. We now own a greater proportion of our  customer care touchpoints, we leverage digital channels more  effectively to better engage with our customers, and we are  delivering market-leading customer experience. Looking forward, there is more we can do to deliver on our  three ambitions, and we are committed to accelerating our  progress across these key priorities in 2025 and beyond.

An overview of tangible  progress in 2024 against  our three ambitions is set  out on the following page.  ===== PAGE 11 ===== Our three ambitions Year-end position1 Overall progress in 2024 Additional commentary Spotlight 40% customer care  touchpoints  owned by Bupa Our ambition was to take care  of more of our customers’ health  needs and wants directly, by  expanding our own offerings  in health provision1.  25.9% By the end of the year, we owned  25.9% of our customer care  touchpoints, having significantly  expanded our digital health  offerings (via Blua) and our  physical provision network.  +3.7 ppts  We increased the percentage of  customer care touchpoints that  we own in the majority (92%) of  funding BUs. The average improvement was  +3.7 ppts per BU. Expansion of our digital  and physical footprint,  and integrated care  pathways have been  critical to increasing the  number of customer care  touchpoint we own. In Hong Kong Health Insurance we  increased activity in Bupa-owned  provision  by attracting higher customer volumes in  our diagnostic and imaging facilities, and  by enhancing app features within Blua. This resulted in an  increase of +6 ppts  since 2023.  60% active digital  customers Our ambition was to engage more  with our customers through digital  channels - enabling them to access  what they need, from anywhere1. 46.1% We ended the year with 46.1% of  our funding customers actively  engaging with us through digital  channels, having successfully  increased customer awareness  and adoption of Blua.  +5.8 ppts  We grew our active digital customer  base in every funding BU. The average improvement was  +5.8 ppts per BU. The global roll-out of  our new digital solution,  Blua, and our targeted  marketing and  communication campaigns, have been significant  drivers of digital adoption. In Care Plus (Brazil) we grew our active  digital customer base by increasing  customer adoption of Blua (e.g., via  marketing campaigns) and by improving    user experience (e.g., through new app  features). This resulted in an  increase of +18 ppts  since 2023.  80 Net Promoter  Score Our ambition was to improve NPS2  a across all businesses and to strive  s for world-class customer  o experience1.  i 67 NPS By the end of the year, we  chieved an average NPS  core of 67, having delivered  ver 10,500 customer experience  mprovements to key parts of the  customer journey.  +5 NPS  We improved NPS in the majority  (92%) of BUs. The average improvement was  +5 NPS points per BU. Embedding the ‘Bupa  Customer System’ –  listening to our  customers, developing  new ideas and  implementing  improvements across the  customer journey, has  been the key driver of  improvement in NPS. In UK Care Services we transformed the  customer experience based on feedback  from our residents. For example, by  enhancing catering facilities and  general activities. This resulted in an  increase of +16 ppts  since 2023. 1. To maximise impact, the 40 Ambition is focused on Bupa’s three largest insurance BUs (in Australia, the UK and Spain) and the year end position represents the true aggregate. The 60 Ambition is focused on Bupa’s funding BUs and the year  end percentage is based on a simple raw average. The 80 Ambition is relevant to all BUs and the year end score is based on a simple raw average. 2. NPS is derived from multiple transactional NPS Surveys.

Each Micromoment has an ‘owner’ who is responsible for reviewing the  customer feedback and implementing improvements. Everyone at Bupa has a role to play in the Customer System, whether that’s listening to our customers,  suggesting ideas for changes or implementing customer experience improvements. This year, we have  listened to over 81,000 customer feedback videos and calls. Importantly, this has helped lead to the  over 10,500 customer experience improvements that were implemented this year. CUSTOMER CASE STUDY Here are some  examples of the  improvements we’ve  made for customers: Spotlight: Customer centricity continued 13 Bupa Annual Report 2024 ■In our Optical business in Australia, we introduced  a non-invasive assessment as part of a normal eye  test, using AI to help identify early risk of heart  disease. This is called a Microvascular Health  Assessment (MHA) and it’s free for all Bupa  Health Insurance customers in Australia. This  improvement is part of our ongoing commitment  to providing holistic, preventative healthcare  that is affordable and accessible. In UK Health Clinics we identified and addressed  a significant pain-point for Bupa insurance  customers: the need to obtain authorisation prior  to having certain treatments. Now, clinicians at  Bupa clinics can pre-authorise a number of  treatments on the customer’s behalf, significantly  simplifying the process and saving time for the  customer. In our care homes business in Spain, Sanitas  Mayores, we improved the experience of our  residents by partnering with Amazon to implement  Alexa’s voice-activated technology. Residents are  now using Alexa to stay more informed,  entertained and connected. For example, through  simple voice commands, they can set reminders  for activities, have video calls with their families,  listen to music and the news. ■ ■  ===== PAGE 16 ===== Spotlight:  Blua Blua offers Bupa customers  convenient access to digital  health services through the  Bupa app. Fast.

James Lenton Group Chief Financial Officer 2024 has been another successful year  for the Group as we see the results of our  strategy in the financial performance of  the Group. I am proud of how all our  colleagues across the globe have  contributed towards supporting the  growth while maintaining a strong  financial position.  Overview Total customers of 60.5m (2023: 50.0m)  as we continue to deliver strong growth. Revenue1 of £16.9bn, up 16% (2023:  £14.6bn) at Constant Exchange Rates  (CER). Excluding Niva Bupa, which has  been consolidated from this year, and  the return of COVID-19 claims savings to  customers in Australia Health Insurance,  Group revenues increased by 10%. Underlying profit2 before taxation of  £914m, up 59% at CER (2023: £576m)  driven by strong revenue growth,  supported by higher investment returns. Statutory profit before taxation of  £972m, up 72% at Actual Exchange  Rates (AER) (2023: £564m). Solvency II capital coverage ratio  remains strong at 176%3 (2023: 175%). Leverage (excluding IFRS 16 lease  liabilities) of 16.0% (2023: 20.1%). In January 2024, we increased our  investment to become the controlling  shareholder in Niva Bupa, a leading  Indian health insurance company.  Subsequently, in November, Niva Bupa  successfully listed a minority  shareholding via IPO and raised  additional capital, marking an exciting  next step in the growth of the business. Revenue (CER) Group revenue increased 16% to £16.9bn  (2023: £14.6bn). Excluding Niva Bupa  revenues (2024: £461m) consolidated  from this year and the return of  COVID-19 claims savings to customers in  Australia Health Insurance (2024: £20m  and 2023: £302m), revenues increased  by 10%. The increase was driven by  strong customer growth across  insurance and provision whilst  occupancy rates continued to increase in  aged care. Pricing changes also drove  higher revenues as we balanced the  impacts of inflation, remaining  competitive for customers and  maintaining discipline in our  underwriting of insurance risk. Revenue in health insurance grew by  18%. Excluding Niva Bupa and the return  of COVID-19 claims savings in Australia  Health Insurance, insurance revenues  grew 11% supported by customer  growth of 7% period-on-period. Our health provision businesses saw  revenue growth of 10% driven by higher  levels of activity across all Market Units  as customers increased by 12%. In aged care, revenue was up 10% as  occupancy increased by 2ppts to 94%4,  combined with a revised government  funding model in Australia designed to  improve levels of care for residents and  address shortfalls within the sector. 1. Revenues from associate businesses are  excluded from reported figures. Customer  numbers include 100% of our associate figures.

Closing occupancy 17 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 20 ===== Underlying profit (CER) Group underlying profit increased 59% to  £914m (2023: £576m) driven by the strong  increase in revenue and higher investment  returns across all Market Units. Health insurance underlying profit increased  with growth in revenues and investment  returns across all Market Units. In our Bupa  Asia Pacific Market Unit, profits increased  due to actions taken to return our Hong Kong  Insurance business to profitability, whilst  the headline profit increase saw significant  fluctuation driven by the reduction in the  final return of COVID-19 claims savings to  customers in Australia Health Insurance  (2024: £20m and 2023: £302m) partially  offset by the claims savings arising from  COVID-19 disruption in 2023 not arising in  20241. In our Europe and Latin America Market  Unit, profits increased due to volume growth  and higher investment returns, partially offset  by losses in Chile, following cancellation of  the GES2 price increase and other adverse  governmental, regulatory and judicial  measures in Chile. Despite higher revenues  and investment returns, underlying profit in  our Bupa Global, India and UK Market Unit  reduced as Niva Bupa reported an increased  loss due to acquisition cost strain and the  absence of in-force profit earning through  in the period having recognised it at fair  value on acquisition.  Profits grew in health provision supported by  strong revenue growth while aged care profits  increased in the period driven by higher  occupancy rates and margin improvement. Investment into initiatives that improve our  capability globally, including ESG, and higher  staff costs resulted in central costs increasing  to £299m (2023: £264m). Statutory profit Statutory profit before taxation was £972m,  up 72% AER (2023: £564m), as the higher  underlying result was further increased by  a positive variance in non-underlying items  which totalled a £58m gain in 2024,  compared with a £(35)m cost in 2023. The key drivers of the movement in non- underlying items were the £309m gain on  remeasuring the value of our existing stake  in Niva Bupa to fair value, partially offset by  a financial liability of £187m for the payment  plan in Chile. For more information see  Note 19: Provisions for liabilities and charges.  Losses on disposals of businesses and  transaction costs on business combinations  totalled £26m (2023: £1m) mainly relating  to consolidation of dental and aged care  portfolios in the UK and Australia. Short-term fluctuations on investment returns  resulted in a loss of £9m (2023: £31m gain).  Overall, our return-seeking asset portfolio  delivered a positive return in 2024, driven by  higher interest income on bonds and floating  rate securities, supported by a tightening in  credit spreads. However, a higher movement  in long-term yields led to negative short-term  fluctuations compared to our expected return.  This compares to 2023 where we saw actual  returns higher than expected, driven by higher  interest income on floating rate assets and  tighter credit spreads, but with relatively  stable longer-term yields. We also reported  a gain on realised and unrealised foreign  exchange in the period of £10m (2023:  £2m gain). Also included was a £(13)m (2023: £(32)m) amortisation charge on intangible assets in Bupa  Villages and Aged Care Australia following the government announcement to deregulate bed  licences from 1 July 2025. Other non-underlying items totalling a loss of £(33)m (2023: £(13)m)  related to restructuring costs and fair value movements on the share purchase liability  recognised as part of the transaction to increase our shareholding in Niva Bupa, which  has since been derecognised following the successful IPO in November.

Under IFRS 17 accounting rules we were unable to hold the deferred claims liability and premium increase deferral  provisions in Australia Health Insurance related to the COVID-19 pandemic, that had previously been recognised  under IFRS 4. The absence of these provisions has led to significant fluctuations in our reported profits as the cost  of givebacks and rate deferrals (2024: £20m, 2023: £302m) do not directly align to the period in which the claim  savings were realised. 2. Garantías Explícitas en Salud price increase was originally approved by the Chilean regulator in October 2022,  subsequently overruled by the Supreme Court and cancelled from 1 January 2024.  ===== PAGE 21 ===== Insurance service result Under IFRS 17, we are required to report  an insurance service result which comprises:  insurance revenue, less insurance service  expenses. This result excludes financial  income and expenses. For 2024 the Group  insurance service result was £622m (2023:  £445m) driving a combined operating ratio  (COR)1 of 95% (2023: 96%). The increase in  the insurance service result was driven by  a significant increase in Australia Health  Insurance profit, due to the reduction in the  net cost of returning COVID-19 claims savings  to customers. This was partially offset by a  loss in Niva Bupa from acquisition cost strain  and the absence of in-force profit earning  through having recognised it at fair value  on acquisition of a controlling shareholding. Taxation The Group’s taxation expense for the year  of £212m, representing an effective tax rate  of 22% (2023: 25%), was lower than the UK  statutory corporation tax rate of 25%. This  was mainly due to a deferred tax credit on the  revaluation of the deferred tax liability relating  to the UK pension surplus following a change  in the tax rate applying to authorised  payments from defined benefit pension  schemes from 35% to 25% and the fair  value accounting gain on acquisition of the  additional stake in Niva Bupa, which is not  subject to tax, offset by the non-recognition  of deferred tax assets across the Group.  Excluding the impact of these items, the  effective tax rate would increase to 26%,  which is in line with the UK statutory  corporation tax rate. Cash flow  Net cash generated from operating activities  increased by £86m year-on-year to £1,268m  driven by the increase in profit (excluding  net financial income) and the consolidation  of Niva Bupa. This was partially offset by the  timing of collections on NHS contracts and  other timing differences. Net cash flow used  in investing activities increased by £(829)m  to £(983)m due to the acquisition of a  controlling interest in Niva Bupa and as  more of the cash generated from operating  activities has been invested into financial  assets versus 2023 contributing to the lower  cash and cash equivalent balances being  held at the year end. Cash used in financing  activities has increased in the period by  £(396)m to £(465)m, primarily due to the  issuance of €500m of senior unsecured  bonds in 2023.   Funding We manage our funding prudently to ensure a  strong platform for continued growth. Bupa’s  policy is to maintain investment grade access  to both the senior and subordinated bond  markets. In October 2024, Fitch upgraded  the Bupa Finance plc Issuer Default Rating to  A from A- with Stable outlook and upgraded  the related bond ratings. Moody’s reaffirmed  Bupa’s ratings in July 2024. We continue to hold a good level of Group  liquidity. At 31 December 2024, our £900m  Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) was undrawn  (2023: undrawn). We completed the Niva  Bupa acquisition in January and also repaid  a £300m senior bond in April. These were  funded through a combination of remaining  cash available from the €500m senior bond  issued in October 2023 and temporary  drawings under the RCF. Coverage of financial  covenants within the facility remains strong.  We focus on managing our leverage in  line with our credit rating objectives. The  reduction in leverage excluding IFRS 16 leases  to 16.0% (2023: 20.1%) was largely driven by  the repayment of the £300m senior bond in  April from surplus cash. Strong repatriations  in the second half of the year allowed the RCF,  which was drawn by £150m at half year 2024,  to be fully repaid by year end (2023:  undrawn). Solvency  Our solvency coverage ratio of 176%2 remains  strong and is above our target working range  of 140-170%. The Group holds capital to cover its Solvency  Capital Requirement (SCR), calculated on a  Standard Formula basis, considering all our  risks, including those related to non-insurance  businesses. As at 31 December 2024, the  estimated SCR of £3.1bn was £0.2bn higher  and Own Funds of £5.4bn was £0.4bn higher  when compared to 31 December 2023.  Our surplus capital was estimated to be  £2.3bn, compared to £2.1bn at 31 December  2023, representing a solvency coverage ratio  of 176% (2023: 175%). The net impact of the  acquisition of Niva in January 2024 and the  subsequent IPO in November 2024, led to a  5 percentage point reduction to the Group  solvency coverage ratio. Capital expenditure  and debt finance costs also reduced the  Group solvency coverage ratio. Both of these  reductions were offset by the generation of  capital in the year through our strong  underlying performance. We perform an analysis of the relative  sensitivity of our estimated solvency coverage  ratio to changes in market conditions and  underwriting performance. Each sensitivity  is an independent stress of a single risk and  before any management actions. The selected  sensitivities do not represent our expectations  for future market and business conditions. A  movement in values of properties that we own  continues to be the most sensitive item, with  a 10% decrease having a 10 percentage point  reduction to the solvency coverage ratio. Our capital position is resilient in the face of  the individual risks, illustrating the strength  of our balance sheet.

We  also implemented over 3000 customer  experience improvements across our  customer journey.  Revenues increased by 13% to £6.3bn.  The 2023 comparative year was  significantly impacted by the return of  COVID-19 claims savings. Excluding this  impact, revenue increased by 8% driven  by customer growth in Australia Health  Insurance, higher utilisation in health  provision businesses and an increase in  aged care occupancy, offsetting lower  revenue in New Zealand Aged Care  due to care home divestments. Asia Pacific underlying profit increased  year-on-year from growth in all Business  Units. However, the most material driver  of the year-on-year increase was a  significant reduction in the cost of  returning COVID-19 claims savings to  Australia Health Insurance customers  relative to 2023. The majority of the  remaining profit growth was attributable  to Health Services, Australia and New  Zealand Aged Care, and Hong Kong. In Australia Health Insurance, revenues  increased by 6% (when excluding the  impact of returning COVID-19 claims  savings) driven by new members. On a  reported basis, the Combined Operating  Ratio (COR) improved to 93% (2023:  98%) due to a significant reduction in  the cost of returning COVID-19 claims  savings to customers relative to 2023. Australia Health Insurance domestic  market share was 25.54% at  31 December 2024, marking nine  consecutive quarters of maintaining or  growing market share1. Health Insurance  has continued to deliver strong growth  across all service propositions, including  through our digital health platform,  Blua. The digital customer offering and  coverage continues to expand, including  Chemist Delivery and Virtual GP  consultations, with online doctor  appointment eligibility being expanded  in October to include additional  products, increasing domestic  coverage to 2.2m customers. Australia Health Services delivered  growth in both revenue and underlying  profit. Revenue growth was primarily  attributable to a sustained demand for  temporary visa assessments within our  Bupa Medical Visa Services business;  customer growth in our Australia  Defence Force contract; enhanced  procedure mix and customer growth  in Dental; and increased customers in  Optical. As part of our Connected Care  strategy, four additional healthcare  centres opened, offering Bupa  customers and the wider community  access to GPs and a range of healthcare  professionals. In Australia Villages and Aged Care,  revenue and underlying profit increased,  driven by higher occupancy, closing  at a six year high of 95% (2023: 91%),  improved operational performance  and changes in government funding  to support enhanced resident care.  In New Zealand Villages and Aged Care,  revenue decreased as a result of five site  divestments, while underlying profit  increased. In Care Homes, occupancy  closed at 94% (2023: 91%), in part  offsetting the impact of strategic care  home divestments on revenue. Despite  a subdued New Zealand property  market, Village revenue grew, remaining  strong from higher unit pricing on sales. Hong Kong revenue grew driven by  higher Health Services clinic utilisation  and the opening of seven new clinics.  The return to profitability within the  Health Insurance business in 2024,  was achieved through the effective  implementation of a revised pricing  and retention strategy.

We also  implemented around 4,800 customer  experience improvements across our  customer journey. Revenue in our Europe and Latin  America Market Unit grew by 13% to  £5.4bn as a result of strong customer  growth and pricing. Underlying profit  increased by 30% to £442m driven by  the increase in customers and higher  investment returns.  Sanitas Seguros, our health insurance  business in Spain, delivered higher  revenues due to organic customer  growth and the impact of the acquisition  of the Asefa health portfolio in June  2023. 2024 marked another important  milestone for Sanitas Seguros, with the  sale of more than 500,000 new policies  in a year. Underlying profits increased  driven by stable margins with a 90%  COR (2023: 89%) combined with higher  revenues and investment returns. We  also continued to expand digital services  and, in 2024, we reached an average of  77,000 video consultations per month  (compared to an average of 68,000  per month in 2023). Our dental business in Spain saw  a strong increase in revenue and  underlying profit, driven by higher  customer volumes and improved  margins. In the year, We also reached  our highest ever NPS score of 75. In our hospitals business in Spain,  revenue reduced as our public private  hospital partnership contract came to  the end of its term while underlying  profit increased. Excluding this contract,  both revenue and underlying profit  increased due to higher levels of activity.  During 2024, Sanitas Hospitales opened  3 new centres, 1 medical centre in Madrid  and 2 for advanced rehabilitation, in  Madrid and Barcelona. Work also  continued on the construction of a new  hospital in Madrid, in Valdebebas, which  is expected to open in 2025. We also  announced plans to open two new  hospitals in Barcelona (Marina) and  Madrid (Arganzuela). Sanitas Mayores, our aged care division  in Spain, continues to perform well.  Occupancy remained high at 95% (2023:  96%) with the decrease resulting from  the opening of a new care home in  October, which will take time to reach  capacity.  In Chile, insurance revenue decreased  and the business reported an underlying  loss following the cancellation of the  GES price increase in the Isapre business  and other losses associated with adverse  government measures. As disclosed  previously, Bupa’s Isapre business in  Chile has been negatively impacted by  governmental, judicial and regulatory  action, including regarding the method  and implementation of statutory Risk  Factor Tables (used to adjust the price  of insurance contracts based on risk  factors such as age), for more  information see Note 19: Provisions  for liabilities and charges (page 190).  Chile provision profits remained stable  in 2024. In Poland, LUX MED revenue and  underlying profit increased as result  of strong customer growth in health  provision and the development of the  new InPMI product. In 2024, we acquired  a new hospital in Krakow, with advanced  orthopaedics provision with the potential  to add additional capabilities, alongside  opening 23 new centres, image  diagnostic clinics, medical centres and  mental health clinics. Throughout the  period, we have maintained our support  for Ukrainian refugees who have been  forced to flee the war. Bupa Türkiye has delivered substantial  revenue and underlying profit growth,  driven by pricing increases to keep  pace with higher rates of inflation and  increased investment returns in our  health insurance business, Bupa  Acıbadem Sigorta. The economy is  classified as being a hyperinflationary  environment, leading to the application  of IAS 29. A net monetary loss of £16m  (as of 31 December 2024) has been  recorded outside of underlying profit for  the period for Bupa Türkiye. In addition,  we completed the acquisition of  CompuGroup Medical Information  systems, Inc., a healthcare software  company and opened 3 new dental  clinics as we look to expand our  connected care footprint. Care Plus in Brazil delivered very strong  revenue and profit growth as result of  higher healthcare customer numbers  and higher investment returns. There  was also a positive contribution from  the dental and vaccination businesses  acquired in 2023 as we expand into  other lines of healthcare provision. After  the reporting date, in February 2025, we  completed the sale of a legacy portfolio  of individual health business, resulting  in a post tax profit of £14m. Bupa Mexico delivered strong revenue  and profit growth due to customer  growth in the insurance business where  we have launched new domestic and  corporate products. Bupa Global Latin America revenue and  underlying profit increased due to  improved margins and higher investment  returns. In 2024, its business in Bolivia  was sold for a consideration of £3m.

There were also over 2,600  customer experience improvements  implemented across our customer  journey.  Revenue in our Bupa Global, India  and UK Market Unit increased by 22%  to £5.2bn. Excluding the consolidation  of Niva Bupa, revenues increased by 11%  driven by increased customer numbers  in UK Insurance and Bupa Global, UK  Dental and Health Services. Occupancy  improved in UK Care Services and  portfolio growth in Health Services  also drove higher customer numbers.  Underlying profit reduced as revenue  growth was offset by the impact of fair  value adjustments recognised following  the increase in shareholding in Niva  Bupa during the year. This resulted in  an acquisition cost strain in the income  statement from the absence of in-force  profit being earned in the period. While  in UK Insurance, profits reduced due  to the timing impact of the return of  premium provision release in the prior  year, which offset the tail end of  deferred COVID-19 claims, some of  which arose in the first half of 2024. UK Insurance delivered strong growth  in revenue, adding over 485,0001 net  new customers across medical insurance,  health trusts, dental insurance,  subscriptions and cash plan in 2024.  Underlying profit reduced, driven by the  timing impact of the return of premium  provision release and commission  expense timing on strong gross written  premium growth. The launch of Bupa  Well+ health subscriptions to business  and consumer customers has provided  more people access to our digital health  and wellbeing support, including GP,  mental health and physio appointments.  We also introduced a new dental  allowance for all consumer health  insurance customers to be used for  an appointment and treatment at  Bupa Dental Care practices.   In Bupa Global, our IPMI business,  revenue and underlying profit increased  driven by growth in customer numbers,  strong management of operating costs  and higher investment returns. Our focus  remains on responding to the distinct  needs of our customers and people  across global locations, while maximising  the efficiency of our operating model,  improving systems and providing  more digital support for our customers.  The combined operating ratio for  Bupa Insurance Limited, the UK based  insurance entity that underwrites both  domestic and international insurance  was 96% (2023: 95%). In January we increased our  shareholding in Niva Bupa, a leading  Indian health insurer, to reach more  customers with their healthcare needs.  Bupa is now the controlling shareholder  of Niva Bupa and its results are fully  consolidated from this year. Alongside  this we have transferred Niva Bupa  from Other businesses for segmental  reporting into Bupa Global and UK,  in line with the management reporting  structure. In November 2024, Niva Bupa  successfully completed an Initial Public  Offering on the National Stock Exchange  of India and the Bombay Stock  Exchange, which will enable ongoing  sustainable growth and provide  continued investment to support future  business ambitions. At Full Year 2024  Niva Bupa contributed £461m in  revenues and a £51m underlying loss.  The underlying loss was impacted by  acquisition cost strain on new business  and renewals which arose because of fair  value adjustments following our increase  in shareholding. Profit associated with  the value of in-force business was  recognised at fair value on acquisition  of a controlling shareholding, of which  £55m would normally have earned  through 2024. UK Dental returned to profitability in  2024 as it continued to deliver on its  turnaround strategy. Bupa Dental Care  is striving to be the workplace of choice  for dental professionals, supported by  a market-leading health benefits  proposition for frontline colleagues. UK Care Services, our aged care  business, delivered good growth in  revenue. Underlying profit increased  due to growing occupancy, strong cost  management, which included reducing  our reliance on agency staff, focusing on  employee retention and lower energy  costs. Closing occupancy was 91%  (2023: 90%). Health Services delivered growth in  revenue and returned to profitability  in 2024, driven by higher customer  numbers in Clinics and Cromwell  Hospital, new Blua digital services and an  expanded network of health centres. The  portfolio has grown to 79 Bupa health  centres through the acquisition of  Blackberry Clinics, London Medical and  The Dermatology Partnership. Through  this expanded footprint and the launch  of GP subscriptions, we continue to  deliver our long-term strategy to provide  more services directly to customers.  Cromwell Hospital expansion continues  with the addition of a new theatre which  opened in June.  Carlos Jaureguizar CEO, Bupa Global, India and UK 1.

Over 50,000 healthcare  professionals deliver extraordinary care,  drive innovation, and improve health  outcomes. In 2024, we launched a groundbreaking  new initiative My Genomic Health, a pilot  programme offering 14,000 customers  whole genome sequencing. We are the  first private healthcare provider in Spain  and the UK, to offer whole genome  sequencing with integrated follow-up  care pathways, underpinning our  commitment to improving customers’  health. Genomics, the study of genes in our  DNA, their function and influence on  the body, is transforming healthcare by  enabling early detection and prevention.  We offer access to genetic risk profiles  across 36 conditions, as well as  pharmacogenomic data - which provide  insights into how a person’s genes  influence their response to medicines. These insights enable us to identify  individuals at high risk and support them  with highly personalised health  plans.Tailored drug recommendations  further empower people in making  informed decisions about their health.  This marks a transformative moment  in healthcare, shifting the focus from  reactive care to proactive prevention. Transformation is also evident in our  expanding digital footprint, seamlessly  connecting clinicians and patients. Over  7.5m customers in 180 countries access  Blua, digital health by Bupa, and our  unique ability to integrate digital and  physical services means our customers  can receive their care wherever is  comfortable and convenient for them. Mental health is essential to a healthy  life yet, according to the World Health  Organisation, one in eight people  globally live with a mental disorder.  At Bupa, we are committed to helping  customers who need support, access  mental health services where and when  they need them. In Poland, we have six  mental health clinics already open, with  more planned both in Poland and  elsewhere. Customers are able to move  between in-person and remote care, with  51% of consultations in Poland having  been delivered remotely. In Australia,  cognitive behavioural therapy courses  are delivered via THIS WAY UP, a  clinically-proven digital health  programme. Over the last 12 months,  8,000 customers have received  treatment, with 73% of customers  reporting an improvement in their  symptoms. Mustafa’s story In Türkiye, the Blua chronic  disease tracking programme  allows customers with Type 2  diabetes to digitally track their  blood glucose levels and share  with their doctor. One of our customers, Mustafa, has  been using the digital service and  Blua health information for two  years. The programme supports  him and his clinician in monitoring  his condition at home, and work,  sending alerts if the readings are  high or low. Mustafa noted:  “Thanks to the programme,  my condition is better  controlled, and I feel fitter,  healthier and happier.” Watch Mustafa’s story here  www.bupa.com/blua 25 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 28 ===== Serving over 60 million customers worldwide 60 million customers worldwide 50,000 dedicated healthcare professionals who deliver extraordinary care and drive innovation across our global network 50,000 dedicated healthcare professiona ls who deliver extraordinary care and  drive innovation across our global networkVisiting Quality HealthCare Clinic, Hong Kong We have increased our footprint  worldwide, opening a new hospital,  over 40 clinics, 15 dental centres, new  laboratories, specialist diagnostic  facilities and a vaccination centre.   The culture of clinical governance across  our organisation is strong. With robust  defined oversight of the quality and  safety of our owned provision  businesses, clinical governance controls  over Third Party Providers (TPP),  integrated risk management systems,  and global forums, we empower our  teams to uphold the highest standard  of care, while delivering innovation and  operational efficiency. At Full Year 2024,  all BUs have been assessed as being  inside risk appetite. Additionally, a  review of clinical regulatory and  accreditation maturity across all MUs will  continue to ensure clinical governance  remains robust as we move into 2025  and beyond. We are supporting our clinicians by  investing in technologies that allow them  to focus more of their time on being with  their patients. AI interpretation of MRI  scans quickly delivers expert level  diagnoses, which are reviewed and  confirmed by the doctor, prior to  communicating with their patient. This  saves the doctor time and the patient  receives their results faster. In addition, we are putting AI directly  into the hands of our customers,  streamlining care and helping them  to achieve better outcomes. The Bupa  Sanitas symptom checker allows  customers to evaluate their symptoms  and receive recommendations on next  steps. This technology has supported  over 100,000 customers across Spain,  directing them to appropriate care. If a  consultation is needed, an integrated  appointment system helps the customer  navigate which specialist is most  appropriate for them and arranges an  appointment. Looking further ahead, we will continue  to support our people and harness new  technologies, building a stronger, more  resilient healthcare community.  Together, we are shaping a future where  health care is more personalised, more  accessible and more effective than ever  before. Investing in our  clinical workforce We are committed to empowering  our people and advancing  education and innovation to  help address global healthcare  workforce challenges and build  a stronger, more sustainable  healthcare system for all. In partnership with Spain’s  Universidad Europea, we have  established two Bachelor’s degree  courses, one in Nursing, and the  other in Occupational Therapy,  as well as a Master’s degree in  Physiotherapy. Delivered with the  support of Bupa clinicians, these  degree programmes have already  attracted 75 students in their  first year. In addition, the first cohort of  Assistant Nurses have graduated  from the Sanitas Campus in  Madrid.  Enrolment has increased  ten times across nursing and care  home assistants, as well as in  dental care and diagnostic  imaging. With a second campus  opening in Barcelona in 2025,  we are strengthening our  commitment to healthcare  education and workforce  development.

This year the  theme was digital health, with an agenda  structured around the three pillars of Blua  – virtual consultations, remote care and  health programmes. We were proud to have Michael Johnson, 12-time Olympic  and World Champion opening the Symposium, sharing his  personal health story as a stroke survivor and how new  digital technologies supported his recovery. Panel sessions explored the future of digital health and how it  is evolving to support patients and healthcare providers alike. Daniel Kraft MD, shared his visionary outlook on healthcare  innovation and our high-tech exhibition showcased cutting- edge advancements in diagnostics, delivery and patient  engagement. 27 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 30 ===== Our people and culture We are committed to  building the best, most  diverse workforce and a  great, inclusive place to  work for our people. A place where all our people feel supported and  valued, and they can grow and develop. Where  everyone feels inspired to perform at their best  and provide our customers with the best possible  experience. 28 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 31 ===== “This score puts us within the 10%  most engaged companies and is  seen as ‘world-class engagement’  by our survey partner, Glint, who  work with some of the biggest  companies across the world.” – Iñaki Ereño, Group CEO, on our global engagement score 2024 global engagement result 84 In 2024, we again achieved a ‘world-class’ engagement score, this year being our highest ever. 84 In 2024, we again achieved a ‘world-clas s’ engagement score, this year being our highest ever. Employee Experience Enhancing employee engagement,  embracing diversity and inclusion, and  investing in the health and wellbeing of  our people creates a great place to work.  It also contributes to our ambition to  become the world’s most  customer- centric healthcare company. Engagement We measure employee engagement  twice a year through our global People  Pulse survey for all employees and, in  2024, we continued to see  improvements. Our people continue to  tell us how much they love working here  and, over the past year, our employee  engagement results continued to rise.  In November, we saw the highest ever  participation rate since we launched our  current approach to employee listening  six years ago, with over 70,000  employees completing the survey.  We also saw the highest ever global  engagement score of 84. That score was  up two points on 2023 and exceeds the  high performing (top 10%) external  benchmark, measured by our  engagement partner, Glint, by four  points. We’re incredibly proud of that continued  improvement and remain committed to  listening and acting on our people’s  feedback so we can continually improve  their experience of working at Bupa. We continued to actively engage our  people with our strategy through a  series of creative global campaigns  across the year. These included marking  the Year of Blua, our digital health  solution, by encouraging colleagues to  share their ‘Picture of Health’ in the run- up to the Paris Paralympic Games. We  also celebrated the end of Bupa’s 3x6  Strategy with films, quizzes, infographics  and sharing inspiring people stories from  around the globe.  In 2024, 78% of our people used  Workvivo, our global internal  communications and employee  engagement platform, creating 56,000  posts, 121,000 comments and over  640,000 likes. Viva  We want our people to feel healthier  and happier because they work at Bupa,  which is why we launched Viva, our  global employee health and wellbeing  programme, in 2023. As of 2024, all  Bupa employees worldwide have access  to medical benefits, health insurance and  wellbeing offerings through Viva. Our  November 2024 People Pulse survey  showed that our people feel more  supported to look after their health and  wellbeing than ever before. Our highest  ever score of 83 for Wellbeing, was two  points above the external benchmark. We continued to expand our Personal  Energy programme, helping leaders and  their teams manage wellbeing practices  and behaviours at work and at home.  The programme is now available  globally, Group-wide, translated into  13 different languages. It is accessible  in care homes, call centres, clinical  locations, retail stores, for back-office  teams and corporate clients. Nine out of  ten participants sharing that attending a  Personal Energy session helped them  feel more connected to their team. Health and Safety During 2024, our priority has been  exploring how we support our people’s  psychological health and safety, and  the root causes that affect that. This  included looking at any unintended  consequences from the shift to hybrid  working.  Two of our key measures when looking  at health and safety are through lost  time injury and burnout and both of  these measures improved during 2024.  Over the past 12 months, we’ve also  been recognised externally across our  markets. We achieved six awards in  the UK from the Royal Society for the  Prevention of Accidents, the Suicide  Prevention Australia’s LiFE award for  ‘Best Practice in Workplace’ for our  Suicide Prevention Strategy and  accreditation as a Top Wellbeing  Company in Spain.

Inclusion & Diversity We are committed to providing an  environment that enables our people to  bring their true selves to work and is  inherently more inclusive. Our Group- wide inclusion framework supports the  Group-wide inclusion priorities our Chief  Executive Committee committed to for  2023 and 2024. Inclusive Culture  Our Be You at Bupa campaign continues  to have a tangible impact on how our  people are feeling, achieving the highest  levels of engagement on our internal  social channels this year. Our People Pulse survey also reflected  that our employees continue to report  feeling valued and free to challenge the  status quo. This surpasses the top 10%  global benchmark and indicates that  people feel able to be their true selves  at work with an increase in “Diverse  perspectives are valued at Bupa”  of two points in 2024. Understanding our workforce diversity  remains an important focus. During  2024, we increased the quality of our  diversity data, completing a Bupa-wide  data privacy exercise and setting the  foundation for further development in  2025. Inclusive Leadership All of our markets have continued to  develop inclusive behaviours within  leadership teams, which is reflected in  the continued positive trend across our  pulse inclusion index scores. There has  been a focus on improving gender  balance in leadership teams and  developing future leaders. This work  will continue, along with supporting the  growth of under-represented groups,  including people with disabilities.  Having undertaken an extensive review  to understand any barriers to  progression for female leaders, this year  we delivered our first ‘General Manager -  Insight to Action’ programme. This  programme provides talent assessment,  coaching and career development to  support more women to move into  senior General Manager roles across  the business. Our Dora Livock global female  leadership network also continues to  provide a supportive space for senior  women to connect and to strengthen the  pipeline of future women leaders. This  year, the network has nearly doubled  to over 300 global members, with  executive sponsors across each Market  Unit as well as from our Chief Executive  Committee.  We voluntarily report data to a number  of important initiatives, including the  FTSE Women Leaders Review and the  HM Treasury Women in Finance Charter.  This year, our progress has been  recognised with our inclusion in the  2024 Financial Times Diversity Leaders  rankings. Inclusive Practices In a year when the global spotlight shone  on the Paralympic Games in Paris, our  focus was firmly on continuing to drive  action on disability inclusion and  accessibility across Bupa. Following accessibility reviews in each  of our three Market Units, we set up  working groups to target the areas  where we could have the most impact.  These included workplace adjustments;  recruitment and onboarding; and  training and awareness. The launch of the Be You at Bupa  accessibility commitments in July  reinforced our work to remove barriers  and create inclusive and accessible  experiences for our employees and  our customers. Our people and culture continued 30 Bupa Annual Report 2024 In October, Sanitas hosted the 2nd Inclusive Games in Madrid which brought  together over 300 international athletes with and without disabilities and  showcased the importance of inclusive sports for all. Inclusive Culture A culture where everyone feels a  sense of belonging and our people  feel able to bring their true selves  to work and be their very best. Inclusive  Leadership Our leaders visibly role model  Inclusive leadership, building  diverse teams and creating safe  environments where our people  can develop and grow. Inclusive  Practices Our policies and practices are fair,  remove bias and allow us to attract,  retain and promote to increase  diversity, reflecting the customers  and communities we serve.  ===== PAGE 33 ===== The overwhelmingly positive response to our  people’s stories, shared through the global  launch campaign, demonstrated the  importance of the subject to our people  around the world.   Building on the strength of the existing  disability advocacy groups within our Market  Units, we held our first Bupa-wide employee  advocacy forum, to ensure that the  experiences of our people with disabilities  are central to our plans and progress.  Leadership and Workforce As we navigate an increasingly complex and dynamic global landscape, the need for  future-ready skills and capabilities has neve been more critical. Our commitment to  building a resilient and adaptable workforce underpins our strategic vision, ensuring we  remain at the forefront of innovation and  excellence.  Through targeted initiatives and  comprehensive development programmes, we  are equipping our people with the tools they  need to thrive in their roles and drive our  organisation towards sustained success.  By fostering a culture of continuous learning  and professional growth, we are not only  enhancing individual careers but also  strengthening our competitive edge. Leadership Development We continue to build leadership capability  globally by empowering our leaders to create  an environment where all of our people can  thrive, innovate and contribute to our  collective success. Bupa Advance, our global senior leadership  development programme, is designed to  build the mindset and capabilities we need  to deliver our strategy, and to create a  collaborative leadership community. During  2024, a further 25 leaders representing  11 countries completed the programme. In our APAC Market Unit, 186 leaders  completed the newly launched ‘Lead at the  Heart’ programme, which focuses on leading  great customer experiences, self-development  and supporting people through change.    r    The programme was recognised with a  Platinum Award in Leadership Development  at LearnX 2024: an award for outstanding  leadership training which drives and supports  talent and development. It has been  nominated as a finalist in the Australian HR  Institute’s Best Leadership Development  Strategy award. In BGIUK, we launched ‘Evolve’, to accelerate  the development of leaders with growth  potential. The first 68 leaders have started the  programme, which focuses on leading with  purpose, impact, agility and inclusion. Global Mobility Creating opportunities for career mobility  across Bupa is essential for our business  success, driving collaboration and global  problem solving, and our people’s personal  growth, as the demand for global talent in  healthcare increases. Through our ‘Move On’ mobility programme  launched in our ELA Market Unit in 2024, 16  employees gained international experience  undertaking three-to-six-month projects in  different countries, gaining invaluable  development opportunities with a global  perspective.  We initiated an Aged Care Study Tour for  aged care managers, from Australia and the  UK, to collaborate and explore ways to  improve our dementia care offering – an  experience designed to accelerate their  personal growth, build global networks and  enhance the care we give to our customers  around the world. Future Skills and Future Capabilities At Bupa, we recognise the importance of  preparing our people to deliver for our  customers and transform for the future, by  equipping them with the necessary skills and  capabilities to meet emerging challenges and  opportunities.  Our commitment to future skills development  is evident in our comprehensive approach to  continuous learning and innovative training  programmes. Our strategic approach to  workforce development includes a focus  on early careers, clinical and future skills. Future Skills For the fourth year, we ran our global B- Disruptive programme, which is open to  everyone at Bupa. Following training on  generative artificial intelligence, 750 people  participated in the challenge, designing  potential AI-driven solutions within Blua to  predict and prevent illness.  There were two winning teams: one providing  AI-enhanced hormone health insights and the  other creating an AI-powered assistant to help  customers follow their healthcare consultation  advice.

Clinical Workforce Following the successful launch of Sanitas  Campus FP in 2023 (our clinical vocational  training initiative in ELA), we have increased  our intake from 35 students in 2023 to over  350 students enrolling in the 2024/25 cohort.  We have also introduced new certifications,  including learning for diagnostic  radiographers and care home assistants.  We continue to invest in our future clinical  workforce and have already started to  replicate this initiative through building new  facilities in Barcelona and in Staines-upon- Thames, near London. eco-Disruptive In 2024, we ran the fourth edition of eco- Disruptive where learners work with the start- up community to solve challenges linked to  our sustainability agenda. This year's focus  was Healthy Societies, and the challenge areas  included inclusive health, supporting disability,  and illness prevention. 125 of our people  participated with an impressive 1,079 start- ups, gaining invaluable skills and challenging  themselves and the way we work to deliver  better outcomes for our colleagues,  customers and wider society.  The teams developed 18 Minimum Viable  Products (MVPs) and our winning start-up,  Moodmon, have developed a medical  application that uses an AI algorithm. It  analyses behavioural markers such as speech,  activity and sleep quality parameters to  evaluate a patient's mental state. They will  receive a prize of £200,000 to further fund  product development, as well as the  opportunity to present at Plug and Play’s  Summit in Silicon Valley, whose mission is to  drive innovation by connecting entrepreneurs,  corporations, and investors worldwide. Inclusive Health Creating solutions for people with limited  access or support for their healthcare needs. Supporting Disability Creating solutions that consider the  challenges of those living with a disability. Illness Prevention Creating solutions aimed at preventing  illness and reducing the need for  unnecessary medical interventions. Executive Leadership Development We supported 24 of our executive level  leaders to gain insight from a variety of  external perspectives and innovation during  2024, including the Singularity Executive  Programme.

Sustainability  and ESG continued 36 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 39 ===== 37crc Mission  Zero We’re committed  to being a net zero  business by 2040,  with our efforts underpinned  by near-term targets validated  by the Science Based Targets  initiative (SBTi).  Transforming to a net zero  business We are in the process of developing a  climate transition plan for our business  based on the recommendations and  guidance provided by the Transition Plan  Taskforce (TPT) Disclosure Framework.  Reducing our direct emissions We continue to make good progress in  decarbonising our scope 1 and 2 GHG  emissions achieving a reduction of 58%  from our 2019 baseline. This reduction  currently exceeds our 2025 interim  target of a 40% reduction, as well as our  2030 science-based target of 46.2%.  During 2024, we maintained our  commitment to securing renewable  electricity, moving from 91% in 2023 to  94% in 2024, and remaining at 100% in  our APAC Market Unit. In 2024, Spain,  Türkiye and Mexico continued to secure  100% renewable energy. For further information on our 2024 carbon  performance see pages 38 and 39. Reducing our indirect emissions Responsible Investment  Our sustainability strategy and climate  targets are reflected in our approach to  responsible investment. During 2024, we  updated our Sustainable Investing  Framework. This aligns our approach to  sustainable investing with our growing  emphasis on sustainability at Bupa. The  aim of the new framework is to continue  management of ESG risk by  incorporating sustainability factors in  investment decisions, while improving  the positive impact of our portfolios on  society and the environment. We will  prioritise impact investments focused  on climate, health and nature, creating  quantifiable positive outcomes while  balancing the need to maintain  diversification and optimise return on  capital. We will publish our progress  against our targets in due course.  For more information, see our Responsible  Investment Statement www.bupa.com/ financials/responsible-investment Sustainable Procurement  During 2024, we continued to expand  our sustainable procurement  programme, increasing the number of  suppliers that we are targeting for  change, and expanding our efforts to  reduce the climate emissions from the  supply chain across our Market Units.    One of our global initiatives is to work  with our top technology suppliers (by  spend) to ensure that they also share our  net zero ambitions. After exceeding our  60% target in 2023, we increased our  target to an ambitious 75% of  technology spend globally with suppliers  aligned to our sustainability goals. At the  end of 2024, we reached 73%, an  increase of 7% in 12 months. We also  have targets for our top global suppliers  to increase the percentage of our top  100 suppliers (globally, by spend)  aligned with our SBTs and net zero  ambition.    Our targets help us work with suppliers  who are aligned with our climate goals.  In 2025, we will focus on deeper  engagement with both suppliers and  internal business owners to help  everyone understand the importance  of climate action.  Sustainable Healthcare  Our sustainable healthcare approach  focuses on practical solutions to reduce  the environmental impact of healthcare  and supporting others to do the same.  In 2024, we launched the 'Single-use  Switch' initiative to replace single-use  items across our provision businesses  with more sustainable  alternatives,  aiming to save millions of items from  landfills or incinerators. We also released three sustainable  healthcare educational films aimed at  healthcare professionals, highlighting the  relationship between people and planet  health and showcasing actionable  solutions to reduce healthcare’s  environmental impact.

We publish the Group’s 2024 energy  consumption and GHG emissions  compared with full year 2023, and 2019,  our base year, to show progress against  our interim scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions  reduction target of 40% by 2025. We will  publish our detailed full year 2024 GHG  emissions report1 later in 2025 on  bupa.com following external limited  assurance2. We adopt the operational control  approach, meaning we account for 100%  of emissions from business locations  over which we have control. Under this  approach, control is considered where  we have the authority to introduce and  implement operational policies. In  accordance with the GHG Protocol’s  guidance on dual reporting, we report  scope 2 GHG emissions using both the  location- and market-based approach.  In 2024, we increased our shareholding  in Niva Bupa, our Indian health insurance  business, becoming the controlling  shareholder. As a result, our 2024 GHG  emissions footprint includes the energy  usage and associated GHG emissions  from Niva Bupa. In accordance with the  Group’s GHG emissions recalculation  policy, our full year 2023 and 2019  baseline has not been restated as the  impact of the Niva Bupa transaction  on the Group’s footprint is below the  materiality thresholds set out in our  GHG emissions recalculation policy. Our GHG emissions reporting criteria can  be found at bupa.com/sustainability/ sustainability-documents and sets out  the basis of preparation1. Market-based GHG emissions  performance  Group In 2024, we continued to achieve a  reduction in our scope 1 and 2 (market- based) GHG emissions in line with our  2030 SBT. Scope 1 and 2 (market-based)  GHG emissions of 50,989 tCO2e  decreased by 13,728 tCO2e or 21%  compared with last year (2023: 64,717  tCO2e). Scope 1 emissions were lower by 6,709  tCO2e or 15% compared with 2023. This  is mainly due to lower refrigerant losses  in Chile and Australia as well as lower  natural gas consumption reflecting a  number of decarbonisation initiatives.  We also reduced anaesthetic gas  emissions through the reduction in the  use of nitrous oxide together with the  implementation of a new anaesthetic  distribution system in Chile. Scope 2 (market-based) emissions were  lower year on year by 7,019 tCO2e or  37% due to switching additional sites  onto renewable electricity in Poland and  Chile. This has resulted in the increased  proportion of renewable electricity  consumption compared with last year by  3 percentage points to 94% (2023: 91%). Total selected scope 3 emissions  (category 3 and 6) increased by 4,862  tCO2e or 11% this year to 47,416 tCO2e  (2023: 42,554 tCO2e) mainly as a result  of increased business travel  predominantly due to the consolidation  of Niva Bupa into the Group’s 2024  footprint. UK operations Our 2024 scope 1 and 2 (market-based)  GHG emissions were lower by 1,516  tCO2e or 9% to 15,408 tCO2e (2023:  16,924 tCO2e). Scope 1 emissions decreased by 1,807  tCO2e or 11% mainly reflecting lower gas  consumption, primarily due to the  electrification of kitchen and laundry  facilities across the majority of our UK  care homes and retirement villages and  the replacement of air handling units at  the Cromwell Hospital. Scope 2 (market-based) emissions  increased by 291 tCO2e to 787 tCO2e  (2023: 496 tCO2e) mainly reflecting the  acquisition of Blackberry clinics in  January 2024. As a result, the proportion  of renewable electricity consumption in  the UK decreased by 2 percentage  points to 96% (2023: 98%). Total selected scope 3 emissions  decreased by 324 tCO2e to 11,953 tCO2e  (2023: 12,277 tCO2e). Business travel  emissions are marginally lower by 83  tCO2e or 1% compared with 2023 and  remained lower than 2019 by 18%. Additional GHG emissions reduction  and energy management activities We continued to work on  decarbonisation initiatives associated  with procurement and third-party  healthcare providers. These efforts,  alongside Bupa’s programme for  sustainable digital transformation, are  intended to reduce emissions associated  with patient claims and travel.

We believe Bupa’s commitment to being  a net zero business by 2040 is the right  thing to do for our customers, partners  and the environment. It is also good for  our business in the long run. Our climate risks, opportunities and  impacts can be found in our Climate- related Financial Disclosure.  ESG Reporting Landscape Bupa undertake regular horizon scanning  of the ESG reporting landscape to  ensure we are tracking any changes to  existing reporting requirements, future  and emerging legislation and monitoring  shifts in voluntary reporting trends and  market expectations. Parts of our global  business are already impacted by the  EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting  Directive (CSRD) reporting  requirements, in particular, Sanitas in  Spain, Bupa Global in Ireland and LUX  MED in Poland. During 2024, we focused  on readiness for meeting our CSRD  obligations within our Market Units and  at Group Level. In our APAC Market Unit  we are preparing to meet local reporting  standards aligned to International  Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB)  requirements. We are also monitoring  emerging ISSB-related reporting  requirements in other parts of our  business, including Türkiye, Chile and the  UK. In 2024, we submitted a voluntary  CDP (formally the Carbon Disclosure  Project) response, which is available at  www.cdp.net. Governance – Oversight of  sustainability and ESG The Board sets the sustainability  strategy for the Group and closely  monitors progress through its Board  Sustainability Committee. Details of how  the Board has considered sustainability  is set out in the Section 172(1) and  Engagement Statement and throughout  the Governance section.  The Group Chief Sustainability and  People Officer chairs the Sustainability  Steering Committee (SSC), which  oversees Bupa’s global sustainability  agenda and reports to the Chief  Executive Committee (CEC) as  necessary.

ELA In a Market Unit deeply affected by geographical and  geopolitical crisis during 2024, we have invested £1m to  support the health of people affected by natural disasters  or refugee displacement. In Poland, this meant ongoing  support for Ukrainian refugees, for a third consecutive year,  while Sanitas Dental’s professionals continued to offer  complex surgeries to people in refugee reception centres in  Spain. Bupa Türkiye helped to regenerate areas affected by  the previous year’s earthquake while local teams supported  those affected by 2024 floods in Brazil, Poland and Spain as  well as wildfires in Chile.  8,500 students BGLA’s collaboration with ANIA  saw the evolution of its ‘Seeds of  Change’ (Huellas de Cambio)  project extend to schools in  Ecuador, Peru and the Dominican  Republic. Alongside the delivery  of ‘One Health’ workshops, in  Chilean and Spanish schools a  total of over 8,500 students were  reached. In 2024, the Sanitas Foundation invested £1.9m in three key  areas of work: ■Inclusive Sport: Promoting health and inclusion through  sport. Our focus on disability took on a whole new  international dimension in 2024, when the Foundation  staged the celebration of the world’s second Inclusive  Games, with 300 Olympic and Paralympic athletes  competing in Madrid. ■Supporting Excellence through Medical & Nursing  awards: the longest award of its kind in Spain that  recognises the best in class among final year Residents. ■Solidarity in action: Over 100 Sanitas doctors and  dentists volunteered pro bono in collaborations with  UNICEF, Red Cross, the Spanish Commission for Refugee  Aid and the Down Syndrome Association of Spain.  Together they supported more than 28.000 people in  2024 across Spain, Peru and Cameroon.  APAC £4.6m  invested in our communities, an uplift of £1.9m from  £2.7m in 2023.  £1.2m  invested for nature regeneration and biodiversity  programmes, in collaboration with partners across  Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong.  In Hong Kong, we continued our partnership with  The Green Earth and supported the Run Our City  Streetathon, which attracted 16,500 participants for  Hong Kong’s first city-centred full marathon for  charity.  The Bupa Foundation invested £1.7m across  Australia and New Zealand in partnerships and  initiatives aligned with our focus areas of ‘Healthy  Minds’, fostering mentally healthy and resilient  communities, and ‘Healthy People, Healthy Planet’,  addressing the link between human health and  environmental sustainability. We supported over  150,000 young people to access free mental health  support through our partnerships with Kids  Helpline,  The Black Dog Institute, and the Australian  Kookaburra Kids Foundation. Our commitment to  First Nations health was demonstrated through a  new flagship partnership with the National  Aboriginal Community Controlled Health  Organisation (NACCHO) to establish a diabetes  care training program for Aboriginal healthcare  workers, a First Nations optical range that raised  £58,000 for myopia management, and £57,000 in  Dr Evelyn Scott Scholarships to support interns  improving First Nations health outcomes.  Additionally, the Bupa Foundation’s Community  Grants Programme awarded £270,000 to 54  community organisations across Australia and  New Zealand.

Paralympians show what it means to keep pushing forward,  inspiring not just those with disabilities but everyone.  Through each national partnership, we help to keep the  Paralympic teams and their families healthy and strong so  that they can perform at their best and continue to inspire.   45 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 48 ===== Playing our part  in preventing  modern slavery Preventing modern slavery  At Bupa, we recognise our responsibility  to help protect, preserve, and promote  human rights and are guided by  fundamental principles of human rights,  such as those in the United Nations  Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  For more information, see our Human Rights  Statement: www.bupa.com/important- notices/human-rights-statement In accordance with section 54 of the  UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the  Australian Commonwealth Modern  Slavery Act 2018, we publish annually  statements setting out the steps taken  to prevent modern slavery and human  trafficking in our operations and supply  chain. We have a suite of enterprise- wide policies that define our minimum  requirements and expectations to ensure  compliance with all applicable laws and  regulations as well as effective risk  management. These include enterprise  policies on People, Suppliers and Speak  Up. The Bupa Code gives us a simple  decision-making framework to help us  do the right thing by our people,  customers, residents and patients. Our  Responsible Supply Chain statement  specifically references our expectations  that suppliers respect all internationally  proclaimed human rights, including the  prevention of modern slavery, forced  labour, human trafficking and child  labour.  For more information about the Bupa Code  and Responsible Supply Chain statement, see  Business Ethics and Conduct on page 47 Across the Group, our whistleblowing  service, Speak Up, makes it easy to  report any concerns in confidence and  can be used by anyone who has a  concern about Bupa, our suppliers or  our partners. In 2024, no reports were  received through Speak Up relating to  modern slavery. We track closely modern slavery related  risks and external developments relevant  to our operations and/or supply chain.  Through this external monitoring, we  identified escalating cases of modern  slavery among migrant workers in the  UK care sector. We responded  proactively, developing and  implementing an international inclusion  programme to support international visa  sponsored workers and their managers  in our UK care homes and retirement  villages. We also stepped-up our training  and awareness raising on the issue,  including launching dedicated modern  slavery online learning modules. In our  procurement processes, we enhanced  the modern slavery questions we ask at  due diligence and during supplier audits  and launched guidance for suppliers, to  help educate them about modern slavery  risk and inform them about our  expectations.  Our Australian business uses a supplier  assessment framework (SAF) tool  administered through APAC’s Third  Party Management Framework, launched  in April 2024, which is designed to  identify and help mitigate modern  slavery risks associated with the  appointment of new (or the continuation  of existing) suppliers.  The SAF draws on internationally  recognised datasets, with risk indicators  including geographic location, sector  and procurement category and triggers  escalation, due diligence and monitoring  for high and medium risk rated suppliers. To support the development and  progression of our anti-slavery agenda,  we continued to work with the UK  modern slavery charity, Unseen. We ran  internal communications campaigns to  coincide with Anti-Slavery Day and  delivered targeted training. In Australia,  we hosted a webinar with Anti-Slavery  Australia and rolled out an online  modern slavery training module for our  people, launched at the end of 2023,  which is focused on capacity building  and practical ways to understand and  address modern slavery risk in their  business area (including training to  support the adoption of the SAF). This  module is now required learning for all  senior leaders.

The Bupa  Code is the moral compass that embodies our  culture and values, to guide everyone that  works at Bupa and empower them to stand up  for what’s right for our customers, residents,  patients, and for each other. It is integrated in  the business through local policies, mandatory  training, and people processes, including  inductions, performance and reward.  The Bupa Code is underpinned by our  performance management, risk management  and systems, governance and controls, and  audit processes. Mandatory training is  required to be undertaken by all our people  and contractors, and covers ethics issues such  as Anti-Bribery and Corruption, Information  Security, Health and Safety and Risk  Management. For more information, see our Bupa Code:  www.bupa.com/important-notices/bupa- code Preventing financial crime  We take active steps to ensure that our  business, people, and customers are not  victims of financial crime, and strive to limit  the impact of fraud, whether committed  against Bupa, our customers, or the wider  communities we serve. The Bupa Code is  directly relevant to financial crime risk  management, making clear that bribery is  prohibited, and our people are required to  act in compliance with all applicable laws  and regulations.  Bupa’s Enterprise Policy on Financial Crime  Risk is applicable across the Group and  articulates our approach and standards to  preventing breaches of economic sanctions,  bribery and corruption, fraud, money  laundering and tax evasion offences -  including all applicable corporate offences,  such as the UK’s new failure to prevent fraud  offence, coming into effect in Q3 2025. This Policy is supplemented by key controls  including regular risk assessments, risk-based  third-party due diligence and training  initiatives, with oversight and guidance  provided by subject matter experts. Ongoing  horizon risk scanning ensures Bupa responds  appropriately to financial crime risks emerging  through legislative changes and geopolitical  developments. The Bupa Enterprise Risk  Committee oversees the management of all  risk types across Bupa, including financial  crime risk and other risks relating to business  ethics. For more information, see our Prevention of  financial crime statement: www.bupa.com/ impact/responsible-business/business- ethics/prevention-of-financial-crime Speak Up  Speak Up is Bupa’s whistleblowing service and  can be used by anyone who has a concern  either about Bupa or individuals/organisations  providing goods or services to Bupa. It  ensures people can raise genuine concerns  about wrongdoing, misconduct, or risk of  harm, in confidence and anonymously, if  preferred. We take concerns seriously and the  people who raise them can be confident that  they’ll be heard, protected from retaliation,  and supported. For more information on Bupa Speak Up:  www.bupa.com/important-notices/bupa- speak-up Responsible supply chain  We conduct ESG due diligence when  onboarding our suppliers and during the  procurement life cycle in accordance with our  framework and governance. We expect our  suppliers to abide by Bupa policies, fully  comply with all applicable laws and  regulations and conduct themselves in line  with the highest ethical standards. Our  Responsible Supply Chain Statement outlines  the minimum standards we expect from our  suppliers across a range of ESG areas. For more information, see our Responsible  Supply Chain Statement: www.bupa.com/ impact/responsible-business/business- ethics/responsible-supply-chain-statement   Approach to tax  Bupa is committed to complying with tax laws  responsibly, ensuring that tax is paid in the  jurisdictions in which the Group operates  based upon applicable laws and practices. For more information, see Bupa's Approach  to tax statement: www.bupa.com/impact/ responsible-business/business-ethics/bupas- approach-to-tax Protecting data and using it  responsibly  Our customers and people are at the centre  of everything we do at Bupa. Maintaining their  trust by ensuring personal data is handled  responsibly and securely not only sets the  foundation for Bupa’s digital ambitions, it is  the right thing to do. Information security,  technology and privacy risks continue to be  high on the agenda of the Bupa Board Risk  Committee and Bupa is committed to  protecting data, using it responsibly and  ensuring compliance with law and regulation.  In 2024, we launched Bupa’s Responsible AI  Principles - transparent, accountable, fair, and  safe – which guide our decision making on our  journey to using AI tools for great customer  outcomes. Cybersecurity threats are growing globally,  and threat actors use ever more sophisticated  means of targeting organisations and  individuals. In 2024, we continued to further  enhance our cybersecurity threat response  globally, strengthening capabilities across key  control areas from vulnerability management  to zero trust and security testing. We  continued to build our security culture and  develop a group-wide cybersecurity strategy  and target operating model to ensure our  collective defences continue to be effective.  We enhanced our ability to respond in a crisis,  by exercising our response plans through  regular crisis management team exercises at  Market Unit and Group level, penetration  testing of critical systems, red team testing  and automated breach and attack simulations.  In parallel, each of our Market Units continue  to enhance key controls to meet global  standards for effectiveness, from Multi-Factor  Authentication and Privileged Access  Management. The effectiveness of our  controls were subject to second line oversight  and audited by Internal Audit during the year. 47 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 50 ===== Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures  Compliance with Non-Financial and Sustainability Information Statement The following table sets out where the Company’s disclosures in relation to the  recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Disclosures (TCFD), which are now  incorporated into regulation in the FCA’s Listing Rules and the Companies Act 2006, can be  found in this Annual Report and Accounts.

It draws upon  information contained earlier in the Strategic Report, which has been signposted and  not repeated. Section 172(1) During the year, the work of the Board supported Bupa’s purpose to help people live longer,  healthier, happier lives and make a better world by promoting Bupa's long-term success and  sustainability. The Directors are guided in the performance of their broader Section 172  duties and decision-making by Bupa’s values and strong governance arrangements, detailed  in the Governance section starting on page 64. The Board requested and received regular  reports from executive management on the matters set out in Section 172(1) and had regard  to business performance, people, strategy, and sustainability when making decisions on  financial, operational, and strategic matters, and allocation of resources. They considered the  views of Association Members (who perform the governance and certain of the oversight  activities usually performed by shareholders) on relevant issues and were focused on  maintaining the Group’s reputation and high standards of business conduct, given the social  context Bupa operates in, its global presence, and how they underpin Bupa’s culture and  business model detailed earlier in this Strategic Report. Stakeholders and engagement The Board considers the Company’s stakeholder groups, aligned with Section 172(1), to  be customers, people, suppliers and partners, communities and environment, regulators,  its Association Members and, with its oversight role for the Group, Bupa Finance  plc’s bondholders. As the Company is a private UK company limited by guarantee,  it has Association Members instead of shareholders. It has engaged directly and indirectly with each of these groups during the year to ensure  that the Directors are informed on the interests and views of all its stakeholders, particularly  given that the stakeholder groups have different perspectives which may not align with each  other. This holistic view enables the Directors to navigate differences and make complex  decisions that deliver, on balance, the best outcome for Bupa’s long-term sustainability and  success. The Board also encourages all levels of the business to engage with relevant Bupa  stakeholders in order to broaden their awareness and understanding of the impact that their  business decisions could, and do, have. The relevance and importance of each stakeholder group and how the Directors have  engaged, or been informed, during 2024 as a Board, Board committees, individual Directors,  or via management, is set out below. Stakeholder Stakeholder engagement and consideration Further detail Our customers Customers are fundamental to Bupa, so we  need to understand as much as we  can about them and their needs and  interests to provide the best customer  service and experience. ■The Board was kept informed on the progress and performance of initiatives to achieve the 3x6 Strategy Ambitions, all of which are  customer-focused, via reports regularly provided to Board meetings. This was beneficial when developing the new 3x100 Strategy  effective from 2025. ■The Board received detailed reports on the emblematic projects related to the strategy which are designed to drive customer experience  improvements. ■In developing Bupa’s new 3x100 Strategy, the Board considered the changing needs and expectations of our actual and potential  customers, driven by technology and the demand for more integrated, personalised care. ■The Board received in depth business updates from the three Market Units during the year, which covered customer matters  in each Market Unit.

So it is fundamental we listen to our  people and consider their interests to  ensure we attract and retain the best  people and they feel Bupa is a great place  to work, are engaged and empowered to  deliver great outcomes for our customers,  and they lead healthier and happier lives. ■The Group Chief Sustainability and People Officer provides regular reports to the Board, covering our people strategy, addressing people- related risks, retaining and developing talent, supporting leadership, and broader training and development.This included updates on the  investments being made in the future clinical workforce described on page 32. ■The Board reviewed the Global People Framework and considered the global priorities for our people. ■It also received and considered a report on the utilisation of Speak Up, Bupa’s whistleblowing service across the Group (detailed on page  47). ■The Board reviewed the results and analysis of the responses to the biannual People Pulse employee engagement surveys. ■It also received updates on senior talent and succession from each of the Market Units, as well as on inclusion and wellbeing, and health  and safety matters. ■The three Non-Executive Directors (NEDs), appointed as designated workforce engagement NEDs for Bupa’s three largest markets (UK,  Spain and Australia), participated in a series of site visits, listening groups, town halls and smaller team meetings and reported the  outcomes back to the full Board. ■Several NEDs engaged with our people on visits to our healthcare facilities and offices in the UK, Australia, Poland and Türkiye. Our People and  culture, pages 29  to 32. Association Members As a company limited by guarantee, Bupa  appoints Association Members to conduct  the governance and certain of the  oversight activities that are usually  performed by shareholders. It is important  that Bupa engages with them regularly  from an external governance and  challenge perspective. ■The Board arranged half year and full year results briefing calls with Association Members, which were followed by a question-and-answer  session. Regular updates were also provided on the progress of the 3x6 Strategy. ■All Association Members were invited to the Healthcare Symposium on unboxing digital health, as described on page 27, to gain deeper  insight into Bupa, its business initiatives and digital health technology. ■Association Members engaged with the Chairman, Senior Independent Director, Group CEO and Group CFO at informal lunch meetings. ■The Group CEO, Chairman, Senior Independent Director, and Group Company Secretary made themselves available to Association  Members throughout the year. ■The Nomination and Governance Committee regularly reviewed the register of Association Members to ensure the membership remains  sufficiently engaged and diverse and recruited additional members during the year. Corporate  Governance  Report, page 69.  Our Suppliers and partners Bupa’s suppliers and partners support our  business needs and help the Group to  deliver high-quality service to our  customers, from information systems to  equipping our healthcare settings. So it is  important that we have strong working  relationships and operate ethically. ■Bupa sets minimum standards of business conduct expected of our suppliers and our commitments to them, which can be found in Bupa’s  Responsible Supply Chain Statement (available at www.bupa.com/important-notices/responsible-supply-chain-statement).

Regulators and governments Bupa’s business activities are highly  regulated and subject to financial services  regulatory regimes in our insurance  businesses and care quality regulators in our  provision and aged care businesses.  Depending on where we operate, our  regulators can be independent bodies or  national or local governments. Their role is  to ensure we have the resources,  understanding, and capabilities, to protect  our customers and other stakeholders, so it  is important we understand their  expectations and have strong working  relationships with them. ■The Board received updates on the programme of regular interactions with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Group’s lead  insurance regulator, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), and engaged with them on key Board decisions.  ■The Chairman, chairs of the Board’s standing committees, the Group CEO, Group CFO, and certain other senior executives, had regular  meetings with the PRA during the year. ■The Board and its standing committees received routine updates on issues, activities, and interactions with other regulators from Market  Unit and Business Unit management teams and subsidiary board directors. ■The PRA attended a Board meeting and presented its annual Periodic Summary Meeting (PSM) Letter, which was considered by the  Board. ■The Board engaged with the FCA and PRA on Board changes and succession plans. ■The Board considered regulatory risk to our operations regularly throughout the year, informed by the Board’s Risk Committee, and  reviewed and approved the Group’s Regulatory Compliance and Conduct Risk Policy to ensure high standards of compliance with  regulatory requirements in all the markets Bupa operates in.  Bondholders Bupa has a series of publicly traded debt  securities issued by its subsidiary, Bupa  Finance plc. As the ultimate parent company  of the Group, Bupa considers the  bondholders to be a key stakeholder and  seeks to engage with them regarding their  investment and support and understand  their views. ■Bondholders were invited to attend briefing calls on the full-year and half-year results of the Company and Bupa Finance plc and had the  opportunity to question management on performance and strategy. ■Roadshows were held for current and prospective bondholders during the year. ■Significant matters related to the debt securities were reviewed by certain Directors before being communicated externally via regulatory  announcements, press releases, and published on our website, www.bupa.com/news. ■During the year, the Board was briefed by the Group CFO on the outcome of bondholder engagements and their views on the Group’s  financial performance and strength, and our sustainability and wider ESG activities. Section 172(1) and Engagement statement continued 51 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 54 ===== Key strategic decisions and their impact on stakeholders Throughout 2024, consideration of Bupa’s ambition and purpose, values and culture, and  stakeholders featured in some way in all Board papers and discussions. The Directors applied  their knowledge and experience, and insights from stakeholder engagement during  discussions and were cognisant of the possibilities, impact, and consequences for relevant  stakeholders. The table below sets out some key strategic Board deliberations and decisions  during the year, aligned with matters highlighted in the Strategic Report, to illustrate how  they had regard to Bupa’s stakeholders. Where further information on the matter can be  found, this is indicated. Decision Considerations, actions and decisions Further information Development of 3x100 Strategy Stakeholders impacted Our customers, people, suppliers and  partners, communities and environment,  regulators and governments, Association  Members and Bondholders ■With the 3x6 Strategy in its final year, the Board spent considerable time in 2024 reflecting on the current strategy and looking forward to the next  stage of Bupa’s development. Together with the CEC, it oversaw the development of, and the objectives for, Bupa’s strategy for the next three-year  period, the 3x100 Strategy, to start from 2025. The strategy was developed in an iterative process with senior management, reflecting inputs from  the Strategic Development Forum (the 75 most senior executives across the Group).  ■Through the development of the 3x100 Strategy, the Board was mindful of the importance and impact to the Company’s stakeholders, and the  different interests and perspectives of each were considered:  ▪ Customers - The Board continues to believe Bupa should aspire to be the world’s most customer-centric company and therefore the new strategy   should be built around its customers. The Board, informed by management, customer feedback, and external subject matter experts, oversaw the  I development of the new strategy to ensure it captured and addressed the current and future needs of current and future customers and helped  people ‘live longer, healthier, happier lives’. It considered the strategic components and aspirations to understand how each could be delivered  and would benefit Bupa’s customers.  ▪ People - Central to the new strategy and ongoing success of Bupa is its people. The Board continued to consider the roles of its people in the new  strategy and services to be delivered. In particular, what new skills and opportunities this might present and how people would be supported,  developed and retained, cognisant that Bupa’s people are also customers via their participation in healthcare benefits and offerings. Ensuring  Bupa’s new strategy would resonate with and be well understood by Bupa’s people would also strengthen Bupa’s culture and values ▪ Suppliers and partners – The role of, and relationship with, suppliers and partners, and engaging those with the same values and high standards of  conduct, was considered key to elements of the strategy and to the growth of the business. The Board considered what support from partners  and suppliers would be needed under the new strategy and how this could develop over time. ▪ Association Members and Bondholders – The Board considered expectations for governing and delivering the strategy and managing the business  sustainably and profitably, aligned with its culture and values and mindful of its societal responsibility. It was cognisant of the members’ and  bondholders’ interests in ensuring that Bupa’s strategy balances the ambition to generate value with preservation of financial stability, and that  profits are appropriately reinvested to deliver Bupa’s purpose. ▪ Communities and environment – The Board remained mindful of Bupa’s social impact and its focus on sustainability. When considering the  strategy and how this would serve stakeholder interests and be conducted sustainably, the Board had regard to how management would align the  business model and new strategy with Bupa’s sustainability agenda and aspirations. The Board decided to separate out the future sustainability  strategy to sit alongside and be complementary to the new strategy , and the new sustainability strategy will be launched later this year.  ▪ Regulators and governments – Through development of the strategy, the Board considered the expectations of its UK and local regulators, and  regulatory requirements and developments relevant to healthcare insurance, clinical services, and global organisations of its size. Alignment with  these in the new strategy was important as these set the parameters for what and how the business can operate, and that Bupa retains its  financial strength and perform its obligations to required standards. ■These considerations informed the Board’s views on the strategic components proposed for the new 3x100 Strategy, to build on the progress and  success of the 3x6 Strategy and embrace new developments and innovation, in order to ensure Bupa’s long-term sustainability and success. ■The Board being satisfied that all relevant stakeholders had been considered when designing the 3x100 Strategy, it approved the new 3x100  Strategy to come into effect in 2025.

The Group CEO and CFO reported to the Board on its  performance and integration into the Group, including the establishment of the expanded BGIUK Market Unit, the Audit Committee considered the  acquisition accounting, its inclusion in the Group’s financial and non-financial reporting and external assurance, and the Risk Committee considered  its risk profile.  Niva Bupa’s strategy was also considered as part of the Board’s annual deep dive into the BGIUK Market Unit. ■Bupa committed to an IPO of Niva Bupa as part of the agreement to acquire control reached in 2023. The work to prepare for an IPO commenced in  April, and the Board was kept appraised of the IPO process, the macro-economic environment and market conditions, and considered the relevant  stakeholders that would be impacted, to determine whether, and when, to proceed.    ▪ Customers – The new capital raised in the IPO would be reinvested in the business for the benefit of customers through services and initiatives. ▪ People – Niva Bupa employees had an existing share option scheme in place allowing the senior management team to participate in the ownership  of Niva Bupa to share in its success and act as a retention tool.  The current and future employees participating in the share option scheme would  benefit from the IPO, and there was also the potential to broaden the opportunity to own shares in Niva Bupa to the wider workforce. The new  capital raised would provide new career opportunities as Niva Bupa grows and evolves, which should help to attract and retain talent. ▪ Regulators – Undertaking an IPO on Indian stock exchanges aligns with local regulatory requirements and expectations, and facilitates more local  and foreign investors holding shares in the company, whilst complying with the Indian restrictions on the maximum permitted level of foreign  ownership. ▪ Association Members and Bondholders – The IPO of Niva Bupa maintains Bupa’s controlling interest, thereby enabling Niva Bupa to benefit from  the skills and experience of the rest of the Group, whilst strengthening Niva Bupa’s capital flexibility and financial stability, enabling greater future  investment in the business and accelerating its growth and value generation. ■With the market environment and conditions considered favourable, and having considered the benefits to, and interests of, the stakeholders and  the Company, the Board endorsed proceeding with the IPO in November 2024. The Niva Bupa board approved and executed the IPO and the shares  opened to trading on the Indian Stock Exchanges on 14 November 2024. Group CEO’s  Review, page 7. Group CFO’s  Review, page 17.

It received regular updates from the Group CFO and from management of the ELA Market Unit in their reporting to the Board meetings in 2024.  ■When legislation giving clarity over the quantum and steps required for implementation of the retrospective liability relating to the risk factor table  came into force in May 2024, the Board considered the application of the retrospective liability and the period allowed for making payment to  eligible customers. It discussed matters related to the process for submitting a payment plan and premium increase proposal for regulatory approval,  and the longer-term impact for the business model of these matters. The Board created a sub-committee of the Board to review the key  developments and management’s proposed payments and adjustment plan, before its submission to the Chilean regulator (SIS). ■The Board sub-committee considered the proposed plan for submission to the SIS, taking account of the financial modelling and profit projections  for the Isapre, the timeline for making the payment to eligible customers, and the ability to increase premiums to ensure the future sustainability of  the Isapre. In doing so, it had regard to the following impacts on the following stakeholders: ▪ Customers – The impact on current and future customers of the payment and pricing proposals and the future sustainability of the Isapre. It  considered the appropriate level of the premium increases, the potential impact on lapse rates and on the longer-term future of the sector, and  how competitors might respond. ▪ People – In considering the projections and viability of the current and future business model and strategy as a result of these changes,  consideration was given to the continued level of employment and roles and career opportunities. ▪ Communities – How the Isapre sector, the Chilean public health system and local communities would be impacted in the short and longer term  was considered. ▪ Regulatory and government - The interests of the SIS and the Chilean government to ensure the stability and continuation of the Isapre sector and  the need for it to complement the public healthcare system was taken into account.  ▪ Association Members and Bondholders – The interests of these stakeholders in the short and medium term, and the financial and reputational  aspects of the proposals were considered. There was also regard paid to the key risks of the payments and adjustment plan, such as an impact on  the loss ratio, and on liquidity and capital including whether any Group funding would potentially be required to support the Isapre. ■The Directors, having reviewed and scrutinised management’s proposed payments and adjustment plan, endorsed the submission of the plan to SIS  by Isapre Cruz Blanca.  The SIS subsequently approved the plan. This resolved the uncertainty for the Group outlook which was referred to in the  Group’s longer-term viability statement in the 2023 Annual Report and Accounts.

This included Market Unit Updates on the roll-out of the model and the Board  considering certain specific transactions because of their size. ■During the year, there were a number of transactions that the Board had visibility of which were below the threshold that required Board approval.  The key decisions here relate to those where the value of the proposals were above the threshold set for the Market Units under delegated authority.  For these proposals, the Market Units sought permission from the Board to expand the Connected Care model through acquiring a network of 13  medical centres and 3 urgent care centres in three states in Australia, and redeveloping a building in Madrid as a hospital to serve the local  demographic and provide specialist services.    ■For each proposal, the Board considered the business case and alignment with Market Unit strategy and plans, the impact and interests of relevant  stakeholders, potential risks, and the financial and infrastructure considerations. ■Customers – The expansion of Connected Care through organic and select inorganic growth is part of both the 3x6 Strategy and the new 3x100  Strategy, and accelerates the expansion of an integrated customer health propositions and experience. Specifically in relation to the new Madrid  hospital, the hospital is located in a district with limited private healthcare infrastructure. ■People – Expansion of Connected Care and acquisitions of more Bupa-owned facilities would provide increased direct employment (with  associated benefits) and career and development opportunities for existing and prospective employees, and help to make Bupa the employer of  choice.  ■Suppliers and partners – The impact on non-employed GPs and the integration of the business model and range of services would provide  increased opportunities for suppliers and partners, both locally and for those able to support a network, and would provide mutual benefits from  cost and operational efficiency. ■Communities and the environment – The Board satisfied itself of the benefits to the local communities via having more locations to access Bupa  services, as well as providing opportunities to create local employment and other positive impacts. For sustainability, having Bupa-owned facilities  creates more control over energy supply and consumption and how the facilities are developed for their intended use.  ■Association members and Bondholders – Increasing the level of Bupa-owned facilities reduces costs and improves operational efficiency, and  provides greater long-term sustainability and stability for the business model. The Board is cognisant of property risks and the potential impact on  liquidity and capital, but this risk is well understood and mitigated. ■After careful appraisal and scrutiny at its meetings, and via specifically created sub-committees, the Board supported management proceeding with  its proposals for the Market Unit acquisitions in line with the parameters specified in their papers to the Board. Our Market Units,  pages 21 to 24. Section 172(1) and Engagement statement continued 55 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 58 ===== Risk Review Bupa’s strong risk management culture and system  support delivery of our strategy and business  performance. Risk is an inevitable part of operating a business. Some risks are avoidable while others are  inherent in our business model so Bupa must have an effective internal control and risk  management system to mitigate these risks.  Bupa’s culture and values enables its people to respond to the fast-changing environments  and markets it operates in and the evolving regulations that apply to our business. This helps  Bupa identify potential risks that could affect its customers and business, in order to mitigate  them and adapt if necessary. Together with Bupa’s system of risk management and internal  controls, its strong risk culture is the foundation of Bupa’s business model to serve its  customers well, deliver its strategy and meet all of its stakeholders’ expectations.  Risk Governance Bupa’s governance framework is set out in the Governance section on page 68, at the start  of the Corporate Governance Report. The Bupa Board ultimately sets the system of risk  management and internal control for the Group, and delegates oversight duties to its Board  Risk Committee. The Board Risk Committee receives reports from management and in  particular the Group Chief Risk Officer, Chief Medical Officer, the Group Legal Officer and  subsidiary board risk committees. The Group’s business and the Group Chief Risk Officer are  supported by the Group-wide Risk Function and an executive forum, the Bupa Enterprise  Risk Committee, which comprises members of the Bupa executive management team. This  forum monitors and oversees risk in the businesses and functions across the Group, ensuring  the system of risk management and internal controls is fit for purpose and operating  effectively, for example, routinely reviewing policies and processes and undertaking  assurance. If it feels changes are necessary, it makes recommendations to the Board Risk  Committee, and ultimately the Board. More details on this governance and the Risk Function  are set out on pages 69 and 73. Bupa’s system of risk management Bupa operates within a three-lines approach to  risk management: first-line accountability  is the Market Units and functions; second-line is Risk assurance; and the third-line is Internal  Audit assurance (see pages 73 and 74 for more detail on each of these). At an operational  level the system of risk management comprises the Bupa Risk Management Framework.  This sets out the principles behind the robust and continuous risk management system  in our first-line. It ensures that Bupa has:  ■reporting systems to identify current and emerging risks to the businesses and strategy  and the potential consequences.  clear and established risk appetites within which it should operate.  taken appropriate and effective steps to mitigate and manage identified risks. risk management information to help inform risk-based decisions across the business.  set clear ownership of, and accountability for, risk. ■ ■ ■ ■ The Risk Management Framework is underpinned by its risk taxonomy, risk appetite  statements, Enterprise Policies and Standards, well-established reporting systems, and an  annual internal control and risk management assessment (ICRMA). These, together with the  Risk Management Framework, are all reviewed by the Board Risk Committee, and approved  by the Board, annually. Bupa’s reporting systems ensure that major risks to the businesses are identified, escalated,  managed and mitigated. Detailed reviews and in-depth analyses on particular risks are  undertaken where required, and Bupa has a stress and scenario testing programme for key  risks. These risk management processes include explicit consideration of how future risks to  Bupa’s strategy might emerge or evolve and what actions should be taken now to mitigate  these risks or to benefit from the opportunities they provide. This includes:  ■consideration of how technology may evolve  ■the future of health and healthcare and the impact of emerging and increasingly prevalent  medical conditions  ■Bupa’s appetite for risk ■how society may evolve including the impacts of ageing populations and geopolitical and  economic considerations. 56 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 59 ===== Bupa’s risk appetite statements set out the degree of risk it is prepared to accept to deliver  Bupa’s strategy. The core risk appetite statements are focused on: ■the treatment of customers and employees ■management of our financial strength ■operational risk, including information security; privacy and clinical risks. Bupa’s Enterprise Policies and Standards define how Bupa should conduct business in a way  consistent with its culture, values and purpose and which appropriately mitigates risk. The  policies are reviewed annually and cover all key areas of risk for our health insurance,  provision and aged care businesses. These are implemented by the Market Units and in  Group functions and are overseen by relevant Group functions to ensure compliance with  the requirements in each Market and Business Unit. Each policy has a designated owner with  defined roles and responsibilities at both Enterprise and local levels.  The ICRMA tests how effectively Bupa’s Risk Management Framework operates in practice.  It assesses how well internal control and risk management practices and policy compliance  are embedded across Bupa. This is a self-assessment conducted by the first-line, and then  reviewed and challenged by the second- and third-lines. The results are presented to a joint  meeting of the Board Audit and Risk Committee each year. The conclusions of this years  review are set out in the Report of the Directors on page 114. Risk Culture This comprehensive risk management programme and Bupa’s culture and values set the  expectations for risk management and reinforces its importance. It sets appropriate risk  behaviours that are well understood by everyone working at, or for, Bupa including its  people, suppliers and partners. The importance of risk management is reinforced by its  inclusion in executive remuneration and performance considerations, with defined  outcomes set for all Market Units. Appropriate risk behaviours are encouraged and  rewarded, inappropriate risk behaviours are challenged with appropriate consequences,  and risk events are communicated quickly without fear of blame. The tools that underpin Bupa’s culture and its strong risk management include the Bupa  Code, Bupa’s Speak Up service, and mandatory training. These are all covered in detail in  Business Ethics and Conduct on page 47. Risk Management in 2024 During 2024, Bupa has continued to raise its standards and expectations in order to ensure  the right outcomes for our customers, markets and business. Its businesses have continued  to be exposed to a wide range of political, regulatory, legal, operational and economic risks.  These varied by business type and jurisdiction, given the health insurance, provision and  aged care activities have different risk profiles including clinical risks.  Bupa managed its risks, including emerging and strategic risks, by analysing the factors  behind the risk relative to each business and to Bupa’s balance sheet and liquidity, and  assessed how they interact. It continued to strengthen its risk management approach and capability within its businesses  to remain aligned with the business model and strategy set out earlier in the Strategic  Report, to support performance and address relevant risks that have evolved globally.  Risk management governance and activities during 2024 included reviews of Bupa’s: ■strategic and emerging risk profiles, particularly in relation to potential challenges in the  geopolitical environment, for example stress testing of liquidity. climate change risk profile, risks associated with the Bupa sustainability strategy.  investment risk appetite. progress on embedding Bupa’s integrated management system for key processes (IMS). risks associated with the judicial and regulatory changes impacting Isapre Cruz Blanca SA  in Chile. people risks relating to resilience as well as strategic risks associated with workforce  availability. progress on improvements to information security to respond to the increased and  evolving threats in the external environment, and to privacy controls through data  retention reviews. enhancement and strengthening of operational resilience capability and controls.

This reflects the nature of our operations and the level of risk associated with them. There  are other significant risks to Bupa that cannot be effectively mitigated through holding  capital alone. Many of these are operational risks and although we do hold significant  capital for operational risks, this is not the only or most effective mitigant for these risks.  Bupa’s Market Unit executive risk committees regularly review residual risks and the  mitigating actions taken to reduce them. The committees inform the BERC about key areas  of specific concern. This provides management with a view of the priority areas to focus its  resources. The following table sets out the principal risks to the Group. The defined principal risks are  those risks that could result in events or circumstances that might threaten Bupa’s business  model, future performance, solvency or liquidity, or result in significant value erosion. Risk Description Comment and outlook Mitigating actions Risks related to managing the financial strength of the Group Property valuation  risk The risk of the volatility in values or the  devaluation of properties held for own use  (including owned care provision properties), or  for investment purposes, resulting in adverse  impacts. This includes capital associated with leased  properties. ■We generally own rather than rent property. This could leave  us exposed to falls in property values. ■Care home valuations are based on their trading potential  based on discounted cash flow techniques. ■The properties are subject to external valuations at least  triennially and management valuations in intervening years. ■By maintaining a geographic spread of businesses across a  number of countries, we are able to diversify exposure to national  or regional property markets and trading conditions. ■The properties are primarily owned by companies that are not  regulated insurance entities and therefore any reduction in value  does not materially impact the solvency position of regulated  insurance entities. Insurance risk Risks relating to our insurance businesses. Risk  of inadequate pricing and/or underwriting of  insurance policies, of claims experience being  materially adversely different expectations and  that provisions made for claims prove to be  insufficient in light of later events and claims  experience. ■Health insurance is short-tailed, with lower outstanding claims  as a percentage of revenue than most general insurers. ■Insurance risk exposure will grow in step with planned growth  in premium income of the insurance businesses. ■Medical inflation continues to impact the costs of treatments  and the overall affordability of healthcare. ■The relatively short-tailed nature of Bupa’s products allows us to  respond to market changes quickly, although this can be limited  by government-set pricing controls in some markets.  ■There is a relatively low exposure to reserving risk compared to  underwriting and pricing risk due to the very short-term nature of  our claims development patterns. ■We have robust control mechanisms in place, including holding an  appropriate risk margin, to  mitigate against the risk of higher- than-expected claims costs. ■The geographical diversity of Bupa offers further mitigation  against insurance risk. Liquidity risk The risk that we hold insufficient financial  resources to enable us to meet our obligations  as they fall due or to take advantage of  potential opportunities, or of being able to  secure such resources only at excessive cost,  resulting in adverse impacts ■Liquidity risk is addressed not through capital but by holding  liquid assets and maintaining appropriate controls.  ■Policyholder liabilities are predominantly backed by liquid  assets held locally in our insurance businesses. ■This is mitigated by the Treasury Function actively managing  borrowings, for which the amount and timing of outflows are  known, and by maintaining a portion of the bank facility undrawn. ■We continue to monitor the markets to ensure that we  appropriately fund the Group and any obligations including  pension liabilities. ■Our stress-testing programme considers the liquidity impacts of  potential adverse scenarios. Risk Review continued 58 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 61 ===== Risk Description Comment and outlook Mitigating actions Operational risks Operational  (including conduct  risk and clinical risk) Risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed  internal processes, or from personnel, systems  or external events. This includes conduct risk  (the risk that our behaviours, actions or  controls result in detriment or unfair outcomes  for our customers), and clinical risk (the risk of  injury, loss or harm to customers in receipt of  healthcare). Information security risk is  specifically addressed below. ■We are committed to managing operational risks effectively.  This includes continued close attention to management of  regulatory risk and proactive engagement with regulators. ■Maintaining internal control processes and governance  frameworks, approving risk policies and assessing compliance help  to mitigate this risk. We have specific dedicated internal governance committees  focusing on specific areas of risk. These are sub-committees of the  BERC. We have a range of activities underway to develop our  operational resilience capabilities. ■ ■ Cyber and  Information security The risk of significant financial and reputational  impacts due to a failure to appropriately  secure information (including personal  information). ■Information security remains a critical challenge for all  businesses, particularly those in the healthcare sector. The threats to our businesses evolve constantly and therefore  our responses need to continue to do so as well. This risk will remain elevated given the challenging  macroeconomic and geopolitical environment and several  incidents targeting the healthcare sector. Management of this risk is a key focus of management and  the risk governance structure. ■ ■ ■ ■We are continuing to invest in a range of activities and actions to  enhance security as we further digitalise customer experiences. All staff are required to complete appropriate mandatory training. We have well-established and tested data breach incident  response plans in place across the Group. ■ ■ Strategic risks Government, legal  and regulatory  change and  compliance risk The risk of failure to anticipate or influence  changes in governmental and regulatory  environment which may impact our customers  and the viability or profitability of our business. ■Our health insurance, provision and aged care businesses are  subject to government and regulatory policy, including  insurance conduct rules, minimum wage requirements,  prudential requirements, changes to tax regimes and the  interpretation of existing tax practices, pricing controls in  some of our health insurance businesses and clinical care  requirements for our provision and aged care businesses. Bupa’s businesses operate within a wider health ecosystem  and generally complement the national health services.   Changes in funding and other health policies can have a  resultant impact on our businesses. ■ ■All our markets have defined key activities to make sure we can  continue to monitor and assess the strategic implications on our  businesses of any future changes in policy or regulation, and  advocate for appropriate change in these areas. Geopolitical  uncertainty  The risks associated with geopolitical  uncertainty and increasing nationalistic policies  globally including in many of the markets the  Group operates in. ■This has been an emerging and increasing trend for some  time and likely to continue for the foreseeable future. ■We have seen elections in multiple markets across the Group  this year, including in the UK and will see further elections  next year. This can increase uncertainty and may result in  changes to government funding decisions which impact our  businesses. ■We continue to focus on heightening our supplier monitoring,  management and communications to help minimise disruption. We actively monitor the geopolitical landscape and consider the  implications of potential changes such as the possibility of trade  tarrifs being introduced. ■ Risk Review continued 59 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 62 ===== Risk Description Comment and outlook Mitigating actions Data ownership, use  and governance The risks associated with the ownership, use  and governance of data which could impact on  the delivery of the Group Strategy. This  includes the risks associated with data privacy  and of failing to use the data we do have to  deliver the strategy. ■Data is fundamental to the delivery of the Group strategy and  will continue to remain a key area of focus for some time. ■We have a range of initiatives and programmes in place across the  Group focused on the ownership, use and governance of data. This included introducing Bupa’s Responsible AI Principles which  guide our decision making for using AI tools. We have also reviewed and enhanced our data retention  practices. ■ ■ Strategic workforce  risks  The strategic risks associated with a lack of  available workforce, particularly clinical staff. ■In many markets this has been an enduring risk for some time  but has been exacerbated by cost-of-living challenges.  An inability to recruit and retain the required skills may  impact our ability to deliver services to our customers and  delivery of the strategy. ■ ■Workforce availability remains a key area of focus for senior  management with a range of activities under way in each market  to address challenges. For more information, see People and  Culture on pages 29 to 32. Operational  resilience including  supply chain  disruption and third- party reliance The risks associated with failure to ensure our  businesses remain resilient to operational and  supply chain challenges including those  presented by third-party suppliers. This  includes the risks associated with complying  with the associated regulatory requirements. ■Operational resilience capabilities are key to being able to  maintain operations in the face of many challenges including  third-party and supply chain risks, workforce fatigue,  information security and other operational risks and the  challenges presented by business growth. As we grow, these challenges will continue to become more  pronounced, particularly where we increase our reliance on  third parties. ■ ■We continue to focus on heightening our supplier monitoring,  management and communications to help minimise future  disruption.  Our businesses have well-established and tested disaster recovery  plans. We have a range of activities underway to develop our  operational resilience capabilities and to ensure we comply with  relevant regulation. ■ ■ Other risk themes monitored  In addition to the principal risks set out above, a range of other risks related to the delivery  of our strategy are monitored. These are assessed to determine the potential impact the  risks may have on Bupa’s individual businesses and the Group and the appropriate actions  to take to mitigate these risks and monitor them. Strategic and Emerging risks Strategic and Emerging Risks that may affect Bupa are monitored through extensive reviews  of relevant external reference material and internal consultation with subject matter experts.  Through this process the themes set out below were  identified,  These themes are highly  interlinked and how they evolve will affect, and be affected by, each other. They will  also develop and evolve over different time frames, with some impacts already being  experienced to some degree, but overall, the challenges these themes present will  continue to increase the further out they are assessed. ■Customer and societal demands/expectations will inexorably increase; ■Geopolitical and economic uncertainty and deglobalisation focus will continue to rise; ■Workforce expectations are changing, alongside evolving requirements from the  workforce and workforce availability challenges will persist; ■Global standards of regulation will continue to increase; Overall medical treatment and technologies will continue to advance rapidly and often  at great cost;  Advances in technology will be a critical underpin and influence (with a particular focus  on Artificial Intelligence); Trust in healthcare, and particularly AI, systems and data, will be a key factor in the  adoption of new technologies; and Climate change and how the world response to this threat will have a significant and  rapidly growing strategic impact. ■ ■ ■ ■ Financial risks associated with climate change Climate risk management is integrated into our existing Group-wide Risk Management  Framework ('RMF'), which sets out how risks are identified, assessed, managed and reported  on. Bupa will continue to ensure that climate-related risks are considered appropriately  throughout our governance arrangements, including the policy framework and management  committees’ responsibilities. It will continue to reflect on changes in regulatory expectations  while embedding climate risk management through the RMF. Risk Review continued 60 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 63 ===== As a result, the financial risks from climate change do not appear separately in Bupa’s principal risks above, as they are already captured within these risks. The table below does show how different  risks are potentially impacted by different key climate risk drivers. Risk drivers Relevant risks and potential impact Mitigating actions Transition: Policy and legal Government, legal and regulatory change risk We must continue to prepare for, and then comply with, emerging regulations  (primarily driven through our insurance business but becoming increasingly relevant  for all businesses globally). As such, there is a risk of fines, penalties, and litigation in  the event of regulatory non-compliance, which could also result in reputational  damage. We are also exposed to potential non-regulatory litigation risk, including the risk of  class actions. Short, medium and long term.  ■Our horizon scanning process continues to identify relevant legislative and regulatory  changes across a broad spectrum of topics, including consideration of ESG-related  (including climate change) developments. Transition: Reputation Brand and Reputation Management Stakeholder expectations on all ESG-related areas, including climate change, are  increasing. As such, there is a risk of reputational damage and loss of trust in our  brand – across the Group – occurring as a result of not taking appropriate action to  meet those expectations, not meeting commitments, or by greenwashing. Short, medium and long term. ■The sustainability strategy focuses on building a healthier future for people and  planet. There are governance structures in place to oversee the delivery of the  sustainability strategy. Bupa engages in industry coalitions and partnerships to accelerate the delivery of net  zero, patient-centric health systems through collaboration and innovation.  Communication policies and procedures, and disclosure governance in place to  reduce likelihood of publishing misleading sustainability claims. ■ ■ Transition: Market Property valuation risk Changes in severity, frequency, and variability in weather patterns may result in  decreases in property valuations. This could be caused by reduced demand for  services in areas more prone to climate change, additional operating costs and  capital expenditure required to adapt properties to either meet or anticipate  increasing market demands and future regulation in response to changes in  weather-related events and decarbonisation agenda, and/or by the availability and  affordability of insurance.  Medium and long term.  Market risk Our investment portfolio is exposed to potential adverse valuation impacts driven  by both transition and physical risk exposures in the companies in which we invest. Medium and long term.  ■We continue to perform a range of climate-related stress testing to explore possible  impacts to property valuations (which are not currently believed to be material to our  business). Geographical spread of properties helps to diversify exposure. Merger and Acquisition decision-making process also incorporates climate risk  (physical) as a factor to consider. We concluded a facilities-related global scope 1 and 2 decarbonisation modelling  project which provided insights to enable the planning of our decarbonisation efforts  in order to meet our 2030 Science-based Target and Net Zero ambition. These  insights are now being adopted within business planning. Decarbonisation underway at appropriate selected sites.  We place exposure limits on the sectors and countries most at risk from climate  change. Our primary target for our investment portfolio, which has been validated by  the Science Based Targets Initiatives (SBTi), is to achieve Temperature Alignment of  1.5°C by 2040.We are taking action to reduce the GHG emissions of our investments,  while helping to finance the transition to a low-carbon economy. ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ Risk Review continued 61 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 64 =====   Risk drivers Relevant risks and potential impact Mitigating actions Physical: Acute and chronic Operational resilience including supply chain disruption and third-party reliance Climate change may increasingly cause operational disruption (directly or indirectly  through, for example, third parties and supply chain), which could compromise  Bupa’s ability to deliver products and services safely to customers, patients, and  residents; the health and safety of Bupa’s people could also be impacted. Short, medium and long term.  Insurance Shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns will affect the acute and chronic  healthcare needs of our customers and may lead to increased insurance claims via  changes to frequency or disease severity requiring shifts in the treatments required.  This impact could be more pronounced in markets with multi-year policy contracts  in place. Separately, decarbonization and other sustainability-related efforts by  third-party healthcare providers used by Bupa to service insurance claims may also  contribute to higher claims inflation. Medium and long term ■The Operational Resilience Framework considers broader customer disruption and  the same principles apply to extreme weather events. Business Continuity Plans are produced and updated in accordance with the  Enterprise Operational Resilience Policy and associated Standards. Guidance documents are in place for managing the potential impact of heatwaves  and flooding across our aged care facilities. Governance forums and communication channels are in place to enable the timely  reporting and escalation of any climate change related risks or incidents. We know that people will be more unwell in a world that experiences greater  weather variability due to climate change. The short-tailed nature of most of our  insurance products allows us to respond through pricing, although this can be limited  by pricing controls in some markets. The affordability impacts from price increases  would need to be carefully considered. Overall, the impact is likely to vary by type of  product and coverage (comprehensive; complementary/supplementary) and based  on the interactions between private medical insurance and the public health system. Bupa is currently deepening its understanding of the potential long-term impacts of  climate change on customers’ health and claims in some markets, and based on the  assessment will consider how best to respond and adapt its insurance product  offerings accordingly (e.g. product benefits, financial incentives, target market). ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ 1. Short term (1-3 years). Medium term (3-5 years). Long term (5+ years). Financial risks from climate change have been incorporated into Bupa’s wider stress-testing  programme. The results of the scenario analysis carried out to-date suggested that the  strategy is resilient to the financial risks of climate change. Bupa will continue to evolve  and mature its climate scenario analysis along with its disclosure approach, and scan for  developments and improvements in scenario methodology and data. The following sets out some of the key highlights from tests performed in 2024: The latest Stress and Scenario Testing programme helped Bupa better understand localised  climate change risks as well as a range of potential impacts which could be driven by climate  change (although not exclusively) over the planning period. Scenarios assessed included:  impacts of increased inflation on insurance claims and expenses across all businesses  (possibly a potential outcome of an energy price shock and/or carbon pricing); impacts of  strategic workforce risks (including workforce shortages, increased attrition, and higher staff  costs), supply chain disruption risk, and regulatory changes.  In 2024, a number of Business Units selected a climate-related narrative to guide their  annual local scenario and stress testing. The future health impact of climate change was  assessed in several markets, including the potential impacts on insurance claims, as well  as potential impacts for provision businesses (hospitals and clinics mostly) should these be  able to respond to the changing population health needs given physical risks from climate  change. Beyond extreme weather events, the impacts of air pollution and water shortages  were also considered though to a lesser extent. This work compliments results from scenario  analysis performed in prior years, including a ‘Late Action’: a ~2C global warming by 2100;  a disorderly transition scenario; and ‘No Additional Action’, a 4C global warming by 2100  scenario with high physical risk. The results of these remain relevant. Bupa will continue to focus on building and assessing its specific climate scenarios in 2025.

We have provided the direction,  support and challenge, as appropriate,  in accordance with our governance  arrangements and the expectations  of our Association Members and other  stakeholders. We have continued to  set the cultural tone to support Bupa’s  purpose and values, how we conduct  ourselves and our performance, and to  ensure our people and partners  understand and apply this in everything  we do. An overview of the main activities of the  Board during 2024 are set out on page  76 of the Corporate Governance report  and the key activities of each Board  committee during 2024 are set out in  their respective reports in this section. Board changes During 2024 there were a number of  Board changes and announcements.  Aligned with our succession plans and  activities, we were pleased to welcome  Simon Blair and Clare Bousfield to the  Board during January 2024,  strengthening the Board’s financial and   risk management skills and increasing  the level of healthcare and financial  services experience. Simon was appointed as a member of  the Board’s Audit, Remuneration and  Risk Committees following his  appointment and Clare was appointed  as a member of the Audit and Risk  Committees. Their full biographies can  be found in ‘Board of Directors’ that  follows (pages 65 to 67). Simon then took over the role of Risk  Committee Chair in April following  receipt of regulatory approval. We are  very grateful to Paul Evans for stepping  in as Interim Chair of the Risk Committee  from November 2023 to March 2024, at  what was a very busy time of Bupa’s  governance cycle. Gunjan Bhow retired from the Board in  April 2024 in order to focus on his other  business commitments. We thank him  for his contribution to the Board during  his time with us, particularly in relation to  the development of our digital strategy,   and we wish him well in his future  endeavours. Board focus for 2025 In 2025 the Board will spend  considerable time overseeing the  transition from our 3x6 Strategy to our  new 3x100 Strategy, explained in the  Strategic Report.  To support its oversight of  the  implementation and delivery of the new  3x100 Strategy, the Board will continue  to focus on digital technology  development, including artificial  intelligence and healthcare technology. We will also be focused on the refreshed  sustainability strategy for Bupa.  Sustainability was previously a strategic  pillar under the 3x6 Strategy, but from  2025 there will be a distinct but  complementary sustainability strategy  reflective of its importance to Bupa and  the Board. As you would expect, the Board will also   continue to keep succession planning as  a key area of focus in 2025. It is  important we ensure orderly, phased  transitions to maintain a strong Board  whilst also refreshing our skills and  experience to support Bupa’s strategy  and growth ambitions. Chair succession I was delighted that Bupa has appointed  Don Robert as my successor, following a  robust and thorough selection process  led by Cath Keers, our Senior  Independent Director (SID). The process  leading to Don’s appointment is covered  in detail on page 77. His outstanding  experience will provide the Board with  the leadership required to support the  continued transformation of the Group.  As you would expect, we have begun a  programme of induction activities, to  ensure a smooth handover to Don, who  will take over as Board Chair when I  retire in May. I have been honoured to serve as  Chairman of Bupa since 2019. I am proud  of the significant strategic progress  Bupa has made during my time as  Chairman, combined with improved  financial performance and a strong focus  on delivering the best experience for  our customers. I would like to thank  everyone at Bupa for their hard work,  care and commitment, which has  provided the strong foundations for  our success as an organisation. I am  confident that Bupa will go from  strength to strength.

It also has subsidiaries that are regulated under various financial services  regimes and have securities listed on the London Stock Exchange, National Stock Exchange  of India Ltd and Bombay Stock Exchange. Bupa has therefore chosen to apply the FRC’s  UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 (the Code) to the extent it is appropriate and relevant  given it is a company limited by guarantee without shareholders. The Code is publicly available  at www.frc.org.uk.  This Corporate Governance report explains Bupa’s corporate governance arrangements, how  it has applied the principles and provisions of the Code, and explains areas of the Code where  it has departed from them. These areas of departure relate to Code principles and provisions  that can only be applied in a relevant way by companies with shares and shareholders; because  the Company is a private company limited by guarantee without shareholders, it does not  comply with them. Our Governance structure Bupa’s governance structure is set by the Board and supports its systems of controls and  risk management for the Group to ensure the Group is operated and is managed in the  most effective and responsible way in accordance with our purpose and corporate values.

These Association Members perform a   governance and oversight role, undertaking  many of the  activities that would be  performed by shareholders as custodians of  the Company. These activities include voting  on resolutions at the Company’s Annual  General Meeting that shareholders of a UK  public listed company would typically be  asked to approve.  Bupa’s Association Members are eminent  individuals in their own field, coming  from a diverse range of sectors that include  international businesses  with an emphasis on  insurance and financial services, healthcare,  academia, Non-Government Organisations,  regulatory and public services.  A substantial majority of the Association  Members are independent of Bupa and have  been selected by the Board due to their  significant recent and relevant knowledge and  experience related to the markets in which  Bupa operates and their capacity to  contribute. They are appointed in accordance  with the Company’s Articles of Association  and normally serve for a term of ten years,  which can be extended for further terms of  five years. Board Leadership and company  purpose The Board The Board is collectively responsible for  promoting the long-term success and  sustainability of Bupa, generating and  preserving value for the benefit of all our  stakeholders, and making a positive  contribution to the societies we operate in. It  sets Bupa’s values, risk appetite and strategy,  which determine our corporate culture and  guide Bupa’s people and business in how we  operate. While the Board may appoint  Directors during the year, their appointment is  confirmed by Association Members, who elect  new Directors at the Company’s next Annual  General Meeting following their initial  appointment. In accordance with the Code,  they, together with all existing Directors,  are then subject to annual re-election by the  Association Members at every Annual General  Meeting.  There is a Schedule of Matters Reserved for  the Board that sets out the Board’s role and  responsibilities and those responsibilities  which it delegates. It covers setting Bupa’s  strategy and risk appetite, overseeing  management’s implementation of the  strategy, establishing, and monitoring its  systems of control and risk management,  ensuring Bupa’s culture aligns with its purpose  and values, management of its capital and  resources, approval of major transactions,  Group structure changes and significant  expenditure. The document is reviewed  annually and published on www.bupa.com/ about-us/governance. Through these  activities the Board has regard to its  stakeholders and engages within them  regularly. Details of its considerations and  engagement through 2024 are disclosed  on pages 49 to 55 in the Section 172 and  Engagement Statement. Board committees The Board has established five standing Board  Committees to which it has delegated certain  activities, to ensure that there is sufficient  time for oversight and challenge on the  matters within their respective remits and to  allow the Board to focus on key strategic  matters and decisions. Whilst it has delegated  certain activities, the Board remains  collectively responsible. The roles  and activities of its Audit Committee,  Nomination and Governance Committee, Risk  Committee, Remuneration Committee and  Sustainability Committee are set out in their  respective reports included later on pages 77  to 96.  The Board has also established a small  number of Board committees which would be  stood up to manage specific contingencies  effectively in the event of specific  circumstances arising. These are not currently  operational, nor were they at any time during  2024 and to the date of this report Executive governance The Board has delegated specific matters  and levels of authority to the Group Chief  Executive Officer (CEO) in order to undertake  the day-to-day leadership and running of the  Group. He has authority to sub-delegate  elements of this authority to the business and  Group functions and is supported in his role  by his executive management team and the  Chief Executive’s Committee (CEC). The  Chief Executive’s Committee drives the  performance of the business and delivery of  the strategy. It currently comprises the Group  CEO and the Group’s CFO, Chief Brand and  External Communications Officer, Chief New  Technologies Officer, Chief Legal Officer,  Chief Medical Officer, Chief Sustainability  and People Officer, Chief Risk Officer (Group  CRO), the Chief Audit Officer, the Group  Company Secretary and the three Market  Unit CEOs.  Three Lines Model The three lines model provides accountability,  monitoring and assurance over the operations  of the Group to manage its risk. Further  details, including on Group Internal Audit,  are set out in on pages 73 to 74. Conflicts of Interest Each Director is required to notify the  Company as soon as possible of any actual or  potential conflicts of interest, and all Directors  have complied with this requirement during  the year. The Nomination and Governance  Committee has delegated authority to review  actual or potential conflicts and the Group  Company Secretary carries out an annual  review of the Board’s conflicts register. In the  event of an authorised potential or actual  conflict, the Director is required to recuse  themselves from discussions and voting on  any matter they may be conflicted on.  Board composition and division  of responsibilities Board composition The Board currently comprises 13 directors,  consisting of a Non-Executive Chairman, two  Executive Directors and ten independent  NEDs (including the Chair-elect, Don Robert  CBE). Details of each Director are set out in  Board of Directors on pages 65 to 67. Division of responsibilities Certain specific roles have been allocated to  Directors on the Board and are described  below. Consistent with the Code, the roles of  the Chairman and Group CEO are separate  and distinct. For more information, see our  division of responsibilities: www.bupa.com/ company/about-us/governance Corporate Governance Report continued 69 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 72 ===== Chairman The Chairman is responsible for leading the  Board and ensuring its focus on strategic  matters, overseeing the Group’s business, and  setting high governance standards. He plays  a pivotal role in fostering the effectiveness of  the Board and individual Directors, inside and  outside the boardroom. He is also responsible  for ensuring effective communication with the  Association Members, acting as a sounding  board for the Group CEO and representing  the Group externally. With the support of the  Group Company Secretary, he ensures the  Board receives accurate, timely and clear  information. Roger Davis was appointed as Chairman from  1 January 2019, having been an independent  Non-Executive Director since July 2015. He  was reappointed by the Board for a further  three-year term as Chairman from 1 January  2022, and during 2024 his tenure was  extended  to May 2025. The Board was  satisfied he met the independence criteria in  the Code at the time of his appointment as  Chair, and following a reduction in external  appointments the Board was satisfied his  current external appointments do not hinder  him from providing sufficient time to  discharge his duties at Bupa. Details of his  other appointments are set out in his  biography on page 65.  In the 2023 Annual Report, the Board  indicated that it had begun a search for  Roger’s successor when he retires from the  Board. Therefore, whilst Roger remained as  Chair beyond the ninth anniversary of his first  appointment to the Board, at that time the  search for his successor was already  underway. Accordingly, the Board was  comfortable with the limited period Roger’s  tenure would exceed nine years on the Board  whilst the right candidate was found,  regulatory approval was obtained, and a  smooth handover took place. The Board  announced on 5 November 2024 that, subject  to regulatory approval, Don Robert CBE  would succeed Roger as Chair, with the  expectation he would take over the role in  May 2025. Don Robert was appointed to the  Board on 27 February 2025 as Chair-elect,  following receipt of regulatory approval to be  the next Chair of the Board. The Board was  satisfied that Mr Robert met the independence  criteria in the Code at the time of his  appointment as Chair-elect. The Board  was also satisfied his current external  appointments do not hinder him from  providing sufficient time to his expected  duties at Bupa. Details of his other  appointments are set out in his biography  on page 65. The details of the selection and  appointment process is set out on page 77. Group CEO As set out above, the Group CEO,  Iñaki Ereño,  is responsible for the day-to-day leadership  and management of the business, aligned with  Bupa’s purpose and values, and within the risk  appetite and strategy set by the Board. Iñaki  has been given specific delegated authorities  by the Board that are documented in the  ‘Matters Reserved to the Board’ and  Delegated Authority Framework. Senior Independent Director Cath Keers is the Senior Independent Director  (SID). She acts as a conduit for Directors and  Association Members who may have concerns  that have not been resolved through other  channels, acts as a sounding board for  the Chairman and Group CEO and leads the  annual performance review for the Chairman.  During the year she led the Chair Selection  Committee and the recruitment process for  the appointment of the new Chair. Non-Executive Directors The NEDs provide an independent  perspective, check and challenge to Bupa.  They hold management to account for  decisions, performance, and implementation  of strategy within the Group’s governance  structure and risk appetite. They are  appointed by the Board, upon the  recommendation of the Nomination and  Governance Committee, by way of a Letter  of Engagement for an initial three-year term,  which may be extended to a second three- year term, followed by up to three further  one-year terms to support a phased  succession plan and the regular refreshment  of the Board. Independence The Board comprises a majority of  independent directors. All current NEDs  were deemed independent upon appointment  and are reviewed annually against the  independence criteria in the Code by the  Nomination and Governance Committee  prior to recommending they are eligible for  appointment or reappointment at the  Company’s Annual General Meeting. Time commitment The Board sets out the expected time  commitment for NEDs to ensure they can  devote sufficient time to perform their role  effectively. The Nomination and Governance  Committee assesses NEDs on appointment  with particular regard to other appointments  and roles external to Bupa and undertakes an  annual review of their external commitments. Group Company Secretary The Group Company Secretary provides  governance advice and support to the Board,  ensuring adherence to Bupa’s governance  requirements and Articles of Association, and  that it has the information and resources to  function effectively and efficiently. He assists  with the performance review of the Board and  its Committees, NED succession planning and  appointment, NED inductions and training,  engagement with Association Members, and  the arrangements for the Annual General  Meeting. Corporate Governance Report continued 70 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 73 ===== Board Skills, Succession and Evaluation Board Skills and Experience The composition of the Board is kept under review to ensure it has the currently and foreseeably  required skills and expertise needed in relation to the delivery of Bupa’s purpose and strategy,  including experience of its businesses and operating markets, and that diversity of thought  and a range of different attributes and backgrounds are represented. The skills and expertise  required are captured in a skills matrix that is regularly reviewed and considered by the Board’s  Nomination and Governance Committee on its behalf. The current Board skills matrix for NEDs, including the Chair, at the end of 2024 is as follows: Board skills as at 31 December 2024 Proportion of the Board (%) Board and Committee oversight skills Leadership, Strategy & Development 100Leadership, Strategy & Development : 100 100 Audit & Financial Reporting 80 Audit & Financial Reporting : 80 80 Risk Management 90 Risk Management : 90 90 Operational Skills and Experience Financial Services Sector : 80 80 Healthcare Sector 60 Healthcare Sector : 60 60 Customer Centricity : 100 100 People, Talent Management & Remuneration : 60 60 International Commercial Experience : 90 90 Innovation and Emerging Technology : 40 40 Commercial and Business Acumen : 80 80 Sustainability : 80 60 Corporate Governance Report continued 71 Bupa Annual Report 2024 During 2024 the format of the skills matrix was redesigned, with greater clarity between Board  and Committee oversight skills required of the NEDS, and their areas of operational experience.   With the appointment of Simon Blair and Clare Bousfield we strengthened both the financial  reporting and financial services experience on the Board, as well as improved the healthcare  expertise.  A focus for 2025 will be to consider how best to enhance the skills of the Board in  relation to digital transformation. Board Diversity statement Bupa has a Board Diversity Policy which is available on www.bupa.com/about-us/governance.  The policy requires all Board appointments to be made on merit and objective criteria reflecting  the skills, knowledge and experience required for a balanced and effective board, but does not  contain targets. Bupa considers diversity includes race, social, educational and professional  background, disability, gender, sexual orientation, religion, belief and age, culture, personality,  work style, and cognitive and personal strengths.  Diversity of thought includes providing a different perspective, and the Board seeks candidates  that represent our customers and people and who can understand and relate to the societies and  markets we serve and Bupa’s businesses. When looking for  Board or senior executives, Bupa  uses search and selection agencies that are all signatories to the Voluntary Code of Conduct for  Executive Search Firms, to ensure candidates are sought from as wide a pool as possible. Bupa voluntarily discloses on a comply or explain basis against FCA Listing Rules targets of: 40%  of the board should be women, at least one board member in a senior board position should be  a woman, and there should be at least one board member from a non-White ethnic minority  background. The numerical data and disclosures for the Company’s Board and executive team  are collected from the information provided by the individuals upon appointment and are set out  and explained below. For details on diversity and inclusion in relation to our people, please refer  to ‘Our People and Culture’ on pages 29 to 32. Table 1: Reporting table on sex/gender representation as at 31 December 2024 Number  of Board  members Percentage of  Board Number of senior  positions on the  Board (Chair, CEO,  CFO and SID) Number in  executive  management Percentage of  executive  management Men 8  67%  3 9  64%  Women 4  33%  1 5  36%  Other –  –  –  –  –  Not specified/ prefer not to say –  –  –  –  –                      At the end of 2024 the Board comprised 12 members following the appointment during the  year of Clare Bousfield and Simon Blair and the retirement of Gunjan Bhow. These changes   marginally increased representation of women on the Board to 33% compared with 31 December   2023 (27%) but did not meet the Listing Rules target of 40%. The Company did meet the target  for at least one woman in a senior board position, through Cath Keers being Senior Independent  Director.  ===== PAGE 74 ===== Table 2: Reporting table on ethnicity representation as at 31 December 2024 Number of  Board  members Percentage of  Board Number of senior  positions on the  Board (Chair, CEO,  CFO and SID) Number in  executive  management Percentage of  executive  management White British or  other White 12   100%  4 13  93%  Mixed/Multiple  ethnic groups –  – – – – Asian/Asian  British –  - – – – Black/African/ Caribbean/Black  British –  – – 1  7%  Other –  – – – – Not specified/ prefer not to say –  – – – –             Following the retirement of Gunjan Bhow during 2024, the Board ceased to meet the ethnic  diversity target in the FCA’s Listing Rule 6.6.6R(9) that at least one member of the Board is from  a non-White minority ethic background, and this remained the case at 31 December 2024.  As detailed above, the Board Diversity Policy takes a broad view of diversity and, as such, the  Company continues to have a diverse, international Board representing the culture of Bupa’s  key geographic markets, with a majority of Directors from non-UK backgrounds. As stated above, the Board has not set diversity targets per se but is nevertheless is committed  to achieving greater gender and minority ethnic diversity representation on the Board.  It continues to seek opportunities to address this through succession planning and Board  refreshment activities and always encourages the broadest candidate pool with the requisite  skills and experience to apply. This commitment had been confirmed in the Board’s briefings  and specifications to search agencies. Board succession The Board maintains board succession plans  that consider length of service, skills and  experience of the current Directors, Board  roles and requirements, and any foreseeably  required future skills and experience. The  plans are regularly reviewed by the Board and  its Nomination and Governance Committee to  ensure there is a phased replacement of NEDs  who are reaching the end of their tenure. This  ensures there is continuity on the Board and  maintains the appropriate balance of skills and  experience on the Board and its Committees  during refreshment and any handovers  required. As the Board is refreshed, it seeks  to address any skill and experience gaps and  diversity targets. The Board also reviews the succession plans  for senior executives to ensure that Bupa  maintains a strong bench and pipeline of  diverse executive talent within the business  and its functions. Induction and training On appointment, all Directors are provided  with a comprehensive induction to the Group.  They are provided with all relevant Board and  corporate information, access to all the  Company’s minutes and past Board papers,  constitutional and performance documents and  meet with members of the Board, Group, and  relevant Market Unit executive teams to ensure  they have all the knowledge required and  establish key relationship early. Visits are also  arranged to Bupa’s sites in the UK and  overseas. All Directors are required to keep up to date  on matters and developments relevant to Bupa  and their role(s). Management and, where  appropriate, external advisers provide regular  briefings on developments in the Market Units,  and topical matters. During 2024, members of  the Board participated in briefings on each of  the Market Units, general artificial intelligence  developments, the use of data and artificial  intelligence within Bupa, and economic capital  modelling. Briefings on technical issues and  developments were also provided when  required to individual Directors to support  them in their roles. During the year NEDs also visited Bupa’s  business locations in the UK, Poland, Türkiye  and Australia with the executive directors or  members of the executive team. Board and Committee performance Progress on 2023 evaluation actions The Board is satisfied with the progress it  made on its actions identified for 2024,  including Board succession (in particular, the  Board Chair search and the appointment of  Simon Blair as Board Risk Committee Chair),  deep dives on business disruption risks and  strategic risks, reviewing the governance  cadence of Board and Committee meetings  and training in artificial intelligence, medical  technology and digital. During 2024, the Chair Selection Committee  established in 2023 oversaw the Board Chair  succession process, which was successfully  concluded in November 2024. A report from  the Committee is on page 77. The Board  received briefings on the requested risk and  training topics from both internal and external  experts. These assisted with the Board’s work  on the development of the new 3x100  Strategy.  Corporate Governance Report continued 72 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 75 ===== The Board and Committee meeting cadence  was reviewed and refined to ensure the  required oversight, business needs and  regulatory expectations were continued to be  addressed. The number of Board meetings in  2024 was reduced by one. 2024 performance review An internally-facilitated performance review  was undertaken for the Board and Board  committees in respect of 2024. In line with  the UK Corporate Governance Code, the  Board conducts an externally-facilitated  performance review every three years,  and the next one will be due in 2025. The Board evaluation and the evaluations of  each Board Committee were very strong and  indicated that they all were effective. For the  Board, positive feedback was received on the  process and engagement relating to the  development and approval of the Group’s new  3x100 Strategy, the level of confidence in the  strategy and the Group CEO’s ability to  execute it, the support and information  provided to the Board to perform its duties,  and the coverage of talent and culture,  including management succession planning.  The leadership of the Board continued to be  scored very highly. Comments were made on  ensuring the optimal balance between  financial performance and doing good for  customers and other stakeholders, in  pursuance of delivering the Company’s  purpose. Some Directors believed there was  further scope to refine the cadence of  governance meetings and optimise the use of  Board time, Committee time and pre-briefings.  The Board was comfortable overall with its  current composition, but the ongoing need  to provide effective oversight of the strategy  indicated that greater representation of  digital/technology, retail/consumer and  healthcare skills and expertise would all be  important factors in future Board recruitment.  Directors were also interested in receiving  more training and briefings in the areas of  healthcare technology, artificial intelligence  and sustainability. Lastly, the evaluation was  used as an additional means of gathering  suggestions and advice for the new Chair,  when he takes over in May, and the outputs  were shared with him by the Senior  Independent Director. Areas for focus in 2025 were identified for the  Board and each of its Committees and these  can be found at the end of this report for the  Board, and at the end of each respective  Committee report that follows. Audit, risk, and internal control Risk management system Bupa has a Risk Management Framework  that follows the ‘three lines’ approach to  risk, which is common in financial service  organisations. It is intended to ensure  appropriate governance is in place, risk  appetite is set for key areas of business and  risk, effective controls are in place to either  eliminate or mitigate risk, controls are  documented, and that there is adequate data  capture and reporting to monitor the risks,  risk management and controls and their  effectiveness throughout the Group. Details  on Bupa’s key risks, risk profile, and how the  risks are mitigated and managed are set out  earlier in the Risk section of the Strategic  Report on pages 56 to 62. Board oversight  and monitoring of the systems of internal  control and risk management has been  delegated to the Board’s Audit and Risk  Committees, respectively. Details of the  purpose, remit, and performance of each  of these Board Committees are included in  their reports in this Governance section. The Committees advise and make  recommendations to the Board where Board approvals and decisions are required. This  includes the annual review of the Group’s  systems of internal control and risk  management that covers the Group’s materia controls including financial, operational and  compliance.   l  Three Lines Model First-line accountability All of our people have first-line accountability  to have awareness of the risks relevant to  their role and work, and to manage them in  accordance with our policies, the Bupa Code  and relevant laws and regulations. This keeps  us all safe, including our customers. The  programme to develop a Group-wide  Integrated Management System (IMS) to map  and document Bupa’s risks and processes  continued through 2024 and is designed to  enhance first-line accountability. The IMS is  now embedded at different levels of maturity  across the Group and work is continuing to  enhance its coverage and completeness in  all areas. All Bupa’s people also receive  mandatory training on key topics and role- specific training to ensure they have  appropriate knowledge and awareness. Second-line assurance – Risk Second-line assurance is performed by the  Risk Function, led by the Group CRO. The  function operates across the Group and  each Market Unit has its own chief risk officer.  The Risk Function monitors risks and the  application of the Risk Management  Framework, operation of controls and  adherence to the risk appetites in the first-line.  It reports to an executive forum, the Bupa  Enterprise Risk Committee (BERC), comprised  of the Chief Executive’s Committee (CEC)  members. The BERC also supports the Group CRO to  perform his Group oversight role in respect of  Bupa’s UK regulated subsidiaries, required by  the Senior Managers and Certification Regime  (SMCR).  The Risk Function provide reports to the  Board Risk Committee to enable its  independent monitoring and oversight of  risk management and risk management  effectiveness, on behalf of the Board.  These include a second-line view on the  effectiveness of internal controls and the  management of risks within appetite. The Clinical Governance (CG) Function, led by  the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) is responsible  for establishing and overseeing Bupa’s Clinical  Governance framework. The CG Function  works closely with the Risk Function to ensure  that clinical risks are effectively reported, with  the CMO also providing risk reporting to the  Risk Committee and the Board. The CMO  reports directly to the Group CEO. Third-line assurance – Internal Audit The third-line assurance is performed by the  Group Internal Audit Function which operates  globally and undertakes independent  assurance on behalf of the Board and the  Board Audit Committee. The Function is  headed by the Group Chief Audit Officer, who  is appointed by the Board Audit Committee.  Group Internal Audit operates in line with: the  Global Institute of Internal Auditors’ (IIA)  International Professional Practices  Framework (IPPF) (including all mandatory  elements of the Global Internal Audit  Standards, Topical Requirements, and Global  Guidance); the UK Chartered IIA Internal Audit  Code of Practice; other applicable legal and  regulatory requirements; and the Function’s  policies and procedures. Its role, authority and  independence are set out in the Group’s  Internal Audit Charter that is reviewed and  approved annually by the Board Audit  Committee. Corporate Governance Report continued 73 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 76 ===== Each year Group Internal Audit develops a  risk-based assurance plan, taking account  of the Group’s key risks, business plans,  regulatory requirements, and other relevant  information. The plan contains both fixed and  flexible assurance work. It is reviewed and  approved by the Board Audit Committee and  relevant subsidiary audit committees and is  updated periodically as required. The internal  audits are globally coordinated and/or  typically performed by Market Unit or  Business Unit internal audit teams, which are  supported by global operations and analytics  teams. Internal audits typically provide an assessment  of the effectiveness of risk management and  internal control, including evaluation and  testing of the design and effectiveness of key  governance, management, and operational  controls as appropriate.  Group Internal Audit reports findings from its  work to management and agrees actions to  address weaknesses or make improvements,  which are management’s responsibility to  implement.  The Board Audit Committee and subsidiary  audit and risk committees receive summary  reports from the Group or Market Unit Chief  Audit Officer on all of Group Internal Audit’s  work, including summary observations relating  to the effectiveness of the Group’s risk  management and internal control framework. Oversight and an annual review of the Group  CAO and the Group Internal Audit Function’s  performance is performed by the Board Audit  Committee. An external quality assessment  is undertaken every five years in accordance  with IIA International Standards, with the  next external quality assessment due in 2027. Details of the role of the Board Audit  Committee, and its activities during 2024,  can be found on pages 81 to 85. External Auditor The Company has appointed  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) as its  External Auditor, to provide independent  external assurance on the audited financial  information in the Group’s Annual Report  Accounts as well as other review and limited  assurance activities. The process for PwC’s  appointment (including the tender),  reappointment, and removal has been  delegated to the Board’s Audit Committee. It also approves the scope, terms, and fee for  the External Auditor’s work, and ensures PwC  has the requisite internal procedures and  controls, and resources, to perform effectively,  independently, objectively and in accordance  with the FRC’s Revised Ethical Standard.  From time to time it may be appropriate for  PwC to undertake work outside of the scope  of the external audit. In order to ensure that  PwC’s objectivity and independence is  preserved, the Group has a Non-Audit  Services Policy that sets out the  circumstances under which PwC can be  engaged for non-audit services, employment  restrictions and the applicable controls.  Details of non-audit services and fees are  monitored, and where required approved, by  the Board Audit Committee during the year.  The fees paid to PwC in 2024, are set out in  Note 2.3.2 to the Financial Statements on  page 151. The Group last tendered the audit in 2019 and  PwC was selected and appointed with effect  from 1 January 2021. Each year the external  audit process, and the External Auditor, are  assessed by the Board Audit Committee  taking into account applicable UK professional  and regulatory requirements.  It then makes a recommendation to the Board  to consider whether PwC should be proposed  for reappointment as the Group’s External  Auditor to the Association Members at the  Annual General Meeting, and seeks authority  from the Association Members for the Board  to agree the External Auditor’s remuneration.  Details of its review and conclusions for 2024  can be found in the Board Audit Committee  report on page 84. Remuneration and Risk The Board has responsibility for setting and  reviewing remuneration of all the Directors,  and the remuneration policies and practices  for executives and the wider employee  population, to ensure these support the  purpose, values and strategy of Bupa and  its long-term sustainability and success.  No Director is involved in deciding their own  remuneration outcome and the Board seeks to  ensure that remuneration does not incentivise  inappropriate risk-taking and is commensurate  with roles and responsibilities.  The Board has delegated the activities of  monitoring and overseeing remuneration  arrangements, policies, practices, procedures  and outcomes to its Board Remuneration  Committee. Comprehensive reporting  in accordance with the Code, legal and  regulatory requirements and best practice  on remuneration governance, on Bupa’s  arrangements, remuneration outcomes  and the Board Remuneration Committee’s  activities during 2024, is set out in the  Directors’ Remuneration Report on  pages 90 to 113.

Corporate Governance Report continued 75 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 78 ===== Key activities in 2024   Strategy Oversight and  Development Detailed on pages 6 to 16. The Board continued to oversee management’s progress on implementation and delivery of Bupa’s 3x6 Strategy throughout  2024 and detailed updates on different pillars of the strategy were considered at each scheduled Board meeting. These  covered progress on the key elements of the current strategy, including development of Blua and the Group’s data and  analytics capabilities, the execution of the sustainability strategy, the development of Connected Care in the UK and Australia  (including potential acquisitions), progress on Cloud transformation and migration, and growth and development  opportunities across the Market Units.  In addition, together with the CEC, the Board developed the Group’s strategy for 2025 onwards, the 3x100 Strategy. The  Board considered the elements of the strategy at the majority of its meetings in 2024 and at its dedicated annual off-site  strategy day.

Board focus for 2025 ■Oversight of the implementation  of the 3x100 Strategy Successful transition to the new Board  Chair, and the ongoing refreshment  of the Board Ensuring the optimal balance between  financial and other objectives in the  delivery of the Company’s purpose  and strategy Deep dives and briefings focused  on healthcare technology, artificial  intelligence and sustainability  connected to the 3x100 Strategy  and the new sustainability strategy Maintain the effectiveness and  efficiency of the Board by optimising  use of Board and Committee time and  pre-briefings ■ ■ ■ ■ Corporate Governance Report continued 76 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 79 ===== Chair Selection  Committee Cath Keers Chair Selection  Committee Chair Committee purpose The Committee was established by a  resolution of the Board in September 2023  and met regularly until its recommendation  to appoint Don Robert was approved by the  Board in September 2024.  In line with best practice, although Roger  Davis has been consulted at various points in  the search and selection process, he has not  played an active part in the search for his  replacement. Committee membership The Chair of the Committee was Cath Keers,  the SID, and the members were Iñaki Ereño,  Mike Hawker, Pia Heidenmark Cook and  Matias Rodriguez Inciarte. Committee operation The Committee routinely invited the Group  Sustainability and People Officer and the  Group Company Secretary, and consultants  from Russell Reynolds Associates, to attend  and report at all or part of its meetings.  Selection Process The candidate profile was agreed by the  Committee at its meeting in December 2023,  following a consultation process run by the  Committee Chair that included input from all  members of the Board on the key attributes  needed for the next Chair. Three independent external search firms were  invited to pitch for the Chair search. Following  a competitive process, Russell Reynolds  Associates was selected in January 2024.  The firm has no connections to the Company  or the Directors. During February and March 2024, Russell  Reynolds Associates met with all members of  the Board individually to gain insight on the  qualities needed. Informed by the candidate profile agreed with  the Committee and meetings between Russell  Reynolds Associates and Board members,  Russell Reynolds Associates resented a long  list of about 20 potential candidates to the  Committee. Following Committee feedback a  revised list was prepared and considered. This  meeting resulted in a shortlist of candidates  for interview being identified. Short-listed candidates were interviewed in  May, June and early July. Additional  interviews, and meetings with the Group CEO,  then took place with the most promising  short-listed candidates, for the purpose of  selecting the final round of candidates and  ensuring there could be a strong working  relationship between the potential Chair and  the Group CEO. Final round interviews were  scheduled with the rest of the Board through  August and September. The Committee met in September after  completion of the final round of interviews  and receipt of personal references. The  Committee was satisfied that a robust process  had been undertaken and concluded that,  following consideration of the feedback of all  Board members, it did not need to consider  further candidates, and recommended Mr  Robert to the Board for approval.  The Board approved Mr Robert’s appointment  to the Board, subject to, and effective from  the date of receipt of, his regulatory approval  to perform the Board Chair role. The intention  was that Mr Robert would be appointed  initially as an ordinary NED while handover  activities took place. Mr Robert would then  assume the Chair role when Roger Davis  retires in May 2025. Considerations of the Committee Skills and experience Mr Robert is currently chair of London Stock  Exchange Group plc. He has also served on  the Court of Directors of the Bank of England  and on the board of Compass Group plc. He  previously served as CEO and then Chair of  Experian plc. Before Experian, he worked in a  number of financial services roles in the US.  In addition to his strong experience, the  Committee concluded Mr Robert possessed  the other skills which the Committee was  seeking in the next Chair. Independence and conflicts of interest Mr Robert was considered to meet the  independence criteria set out in the UK  Corporate Governance Code 2018 and no  actual or potential conflicts were identified  during the interview process, which was  confirmed during the screening and  regulatory application process. Mr Robert satisfied the Committee he would  have sufficient time for the role, and indicated  that he would be stepping down from one of  his other directorships: his role as Chair of  Keywords Studios plc, from which he resigned  in October 2024. Timing of appointment to the Board Mr Robert was appointed to the Board as a  NED and Chair-elect on 27 February 2025,  following receipt of the regulatory approvals.

This was undertaken by a committee specially  created for this purpose, the Chair Selection  Committee, to recuse the Chair from leading  his own succession and to enable the Group  CEO to be involved, given the importance of a  good working relationship between the Group  CEO and new Chair. A report on the process  and the activities of that committee are set  out before this report on 77. Committee membership The Committee currently comprises six  members, the Board Chair and five  independent NEDs, all of whom have the  relevant skills and experience for the work  of the Committee. All members served  throughout the year and to the date of this  report, except Don Robert who joined the  Committee on 27 February 2025,. The Board  ensures there is cross-membership between  the Committee and its other Board  committees. This is important to ensure an  integrated approach on governance and  reporting. Details of each of the Committee  members can be found in their biographies  in the Board of Directors on pages 65 to 67. Committee operation During 2024 the Committee met four times  and discharged all of the duties delegated  to it by the Board. Details of members’  attendance at these meetings can be found on  page 75 in the Corporate Governance Report.  The Committee routinely invited the Group  CEO and Group Chief Sustainability and  People Officer to attend and report at all  or part of its meetings.  Key activities in 2024 The Committee’s key activities and considerations in 2024 and to the date of this Annual Report were: Activities Committee considerations Board composition and skills  Review of the composition,  diversity, and skills of the Board. Pages 69 to 71 in the Corporate  Governance report. The Committee has reviewed the memberships of the Board and its  Committees to ensure they remained appropriate and that each  Committee had members with the relevant skills and experience. This was  aligned with the annual Board and Committee performance reviews.  As part of the composition and skills review, the Committee considered  Board diversity and the skills and experience in the Board’s skills matrix.  This enabled the Committee to evaluate the current and future skills and  experience needed, and identify any gaps to address when a Director retired from the Board. It also enabled the Committee to keep  under review the optimum size and composition of the Board overall. Aligned to the setting of the new 3x100 Strategy, during the year the  Committee refreshed the Board Skills matrix, reviewing and updating the  skills and experience required, and the NEDs assessed themselves against  the new metrics and criteria to ensure the Board had the required  knowledge and attributes to oversee the execution of the 3x100 Strategy  from 2025 onwards.  Succession Planning Ensure plans are in place for orderly  succession of the Board. Page 72 in the Corporate  Governance report. The Committee continued to spend time in 2024 focused on the Board’s  succession plan, in order to phase appointments and retirements  and maintain stability and continuity. It considered this a priority for focus,  given the number of NEDs nearing the end of their second term of office,  and in particular, the tenure of the key roles of Board Chairman and  Committee chairs.  A change in the tenure policy for NEDs in 2023 was made to permit up to  three one-year terms after completion of the second three-year terms.    This will support phasing of the four NEDs whose second three-year terms  expire between November 2024 and April 2025, to preserve Board  stability and continuity. Accordingly, the Committee considered the  succession and phasing of these NEDs during 2024 and up to the date of  this report. It recommended the first of the three potential one-year  extensions for Paul Evans and Matias Rodriguez Inciarte. Following the search in 2023, the Committee recommended, and the  Board approved, the appointment of Clare Bousfield and Simon Blair as  Directors in January 2024. 78 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 81 ===== Key activities in 2024 continued Activities Committee considerations Board searches, selection and  nominations To identify and nominate candidates to fill  board vacancies and execute  succession  planning, including specific role  appointments, and make recommendations  to the Board. The Committee appointed the independent external search firm, Russell  Reynolds Associates, that has no connections to the Company or  Directors, to search for potential Risk Committee Chair candidates in  2023. Through this search it also identified Clare Bousfield as a candidate  whose skills and experience would be beneficial to the Board, and she was  appointed to the Board in January 2024. Simon Blair received regulatory  approval to become Board Risk Committee Chair in Q1 2024. Simon  undertook a thorough induction programme and regulatory handover and  assumed the role of Risk Committee Chair from Paul Evans (Interim Risk  Committee Chair) at the start of April 2024.  The Board established a separate Chairman Selection Committee chaired  by the SID, Cath Keers. That committee oversaw the search, reviewed the  candidate specification and requested Russell Reynolds Associates pay  close attention to diversity in accordance with the Board Diversity Policy. The Committee continued to receive process and progress updates on the  Board Chair search during the year. Board performance reviews Upon appointment, and annually, review the  time required from NEDs, and their  independence, and performance, and make  recommendations to the Board regarding  their continued appointment. During 2024, the Committee routinely reviewed Board training and  development, and the Conflicts of Interests register and policy.  It also assessed whether NEDs had sufficient time and capacity to fulfil  their roles on the Board and that they had avoided any risk of over- boarding. It considered whether they remained independent in light of  their external interests, any conflicts of interest and their tenure on the  Board for the years-ended 31 December 2023 and 2024. In doing so it  took into account reports compiled by the Group Company Secretarial  team on the above, the outcome of any fit and proper reviews, biannual  NED confirmations and the individual performance reviews undertaken by  the Chairman. Following its reviews, the Committee recommended to the Board that all  Directors were suitable for re-election and election, to the Board in 2024,  which the Board agreed. All re-elections and elections were approved by  the Association Members  at the 2024 Annual General Meeting. The  Committee also concluded its reviews and recommended to the Board  that all Directors are eligible for re-election, and Don Robert for election,  for proposal at the Annual General Meeting in May 2025, which the Board  has agreed. Association Members Identify and nominate Association Members and  oversee orderly succession. Throughout 2024 the Committee has paid considerable focus to   Association Member activities.  It has reviewed the contribution, skills, tenure and experience of the  existing Association Members, and considered the management of  retirements, as well as the range of engagement activities with the  members.  During the year the Committee successfully expanded the membership,  recruiting 10 new members who were predominantly recommended by  existing members, who are independent of the Company. This included  candidates from a more diverse range of backgrounds and with  knowledge and experience of the Group's key markets. The Committee is  grateful for the support of the existing members in recruiting new  members. Governance developments and standards Monitor corporate governance developments  and the Company’s arrangements and  compliance with the Code. The Committee received updates on Code compliance, narrative reporting  on governance in the Annual Report (including this report), and other  corporate governance issues for the 2023 and 2024 Annual Report and  Accounts in 2024 and up to the date of this report. Alongside the Audit Committee, the Committee has had briefings on the   FRC’s UK Corporate Governance Code 2024 and considered the changes  effective in the 2025 and 2026 financial years and their respective  impacts, and how Bupa will address these. It also monitored the. broader  UK corporate governance and audit reforms until they were put on hold  ahead of the UK general election in May 2024. Nomination & Governance Report continued 79 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 82 ===== Subsidiary oversight and engagement The Committee has oversight responsibility  for subsidiary governance arrangements and  the Group’s Subsidiary Governance Policy,  which is reviewed biennially. During the year  it received a report on governance from the  CEO of the APAC Market Unit and the Chair  of the Bupa ANZ board, the subsidiary board  which oversees the Group’s activities in  Australia and New Zealand. It also reviewed  subsidiaries’ NED tenure and succession  plans, and the board evaluations of the major  insurance subsidiaries in the UK, Australia,  and Spain. Liaison with other Board Committees As covered above in its activities during 2024  and to-date, the Committee has continued to  work closely with other Board committees,  leveraging the benefit of members’ cross- Committee memberships to assist with  succession planning, the appointment of the  Risk Committee Chair, and the monitoring  and consideration of the 2024 UK Corporate  Governance Code published in January 2024,  as detailed above. Committee effectiveness review The Committee undertook an internally- facilitated review of its effectiveness at the  end of 2024. The results confirmed that the  Committee continued to perform strongly and  operate effectively, with strong results across  its role and operations, composition,  leadership, and  processes and procedures.  The Committee considered how it could  further improve its effectiveness in 2025.  It also reviewed its Terms of Reference to  ensure they remained appropriate and up-to- date for 2025, including the relevant changes  arising from the 2024 Code, and confirmed  that it had fully discharged its duties in 2024. The Committee reviewed progress on its focus  areas for 2024 identified through its 2023  internally-facilitated Committee performance   review. It was satisfied with the state of the  Board’s succession planning, given the  prospective appointment of the new Chair and   the operation of the updated policy on NED  tenure to enable orderly succession. The  revised Board skills matrix was approved and  reflected the skills, knowledge and experience  needed on the Board for the future.  Focus for 2025  The priorities and continued areas of focus  for the Committee in 2025, including those  identified from the 2024 internal effectiveness  review process, are: ■Board and Committee Composition and  Succession - the NED pipeline and  succession. ■NED search and selection process – make  enhancements from recent searches to  make future processes more efficient. ■NED skills and capacity – ensure the range  of skills on the Board remains reflective of  the skills required of the Board for the next  stage of the Group’s strategy. ■Chair Onboarding – support the induction  and onboarding of Don Robert as he joins  the Board and becomes Board Chair.

Without the Group CRO present, it considered the independence and  performance of the Group CRO and the scorecard and objectives for  the following year. Subsidiary oversight and engagement In 2024 subsidiary risk committees submitted  reports and minutes of their meetings to the  Committee, and the chair of each subsidiary  risk committee and the respective subsidiary  chief risk officer attended one of the  Committee’s meetings. Paul Evans (whilst he  was performing the role) and Simon Blair  (once he took on the role) attended meetings  of each subsidiary risk committee and  reported back to Committee members at the  following meeting. The Committee valued  these interactions and considered them  effective for keeping up-to-date with current  and emerging risks and topical issues around  the Group. Liaison with other Board Committees The Committee continued to work closely  with the Board Audit Committee on risk- related matters and disclosures in the Annual  Report. In respect of the Board Remuneration  Committee, it met privately with the  Performance and Reward Director and Group  CRO to receive an update on risk and reward,  and the Committee, via its Chair, provided  input to ensure risk is considered in  performance objectives and weightings that  promote ethical behaviour aligned with risk  appetite and conduct expectations and on  2024 risk performance to be considered in  the remuneration decisions and awards. Committee effectiveness review The Committee undertook an internally- facilitated review of its effectiveness for 2024.  The results confirmed the Committee had  continued to perform strongly and is effective.  It was noted the Committee had sufficiently  focused on its priority areas in 2024 in  its meetings throughout the year.  The Committee discussed areas that could  drive further improvement, including feedback  to management on ways to enhance the  reporting to the Committee, and balance the  agenda to facilitate the key risk areas for  focus in 2025. Focus for 2025  The areas of focus for 2025, including those  identified from the 2024 internal review  process, are: ■Maintaining focus on key risks including  cyber and information security risk,  operational resilience (including third party  risk) and clinical governance culture. ■Keep abreast of emerging risks to the  Group. ■Evaluate risks related to the new 3x100  Strategy, including the expansion of  Connected Care across the Market Units.

The Committee reviewed the Enterprise Sustainability Policy and  recommended it to the Board for approval. Alongside the Board  Audit Committee, the Committee considered the disclosures on  sustainability, climate and ESG disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts, as well as  the Group’s greenhouse gas emissions report for  the year ended 31 December 2023, including the limited assurance  over that report provided by the External Auditor, PwC.  Developments and trends Consider relevant emerging issues  and external developments and their impact  on Bupa and make any recommendations to  the Board The Committee was kept abreast on topical issues and emerging  developments by management, including receiving a briefing on COP29  and on management’s participation in New York Climate Week 2024.  It also reviewed and update on scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions  and considered the footprint for 2022 and updates to Bupa’s scope 3  methodology. It received updates on the EU Directive, CSRD that would  apply to Bupa’s EU-incorporated subsidiaries from the 2024 financial  year onwards, and the Group as a whole from 2028, to understand its  impact and monitor progress of preparations and assessments. It also  considered the ISSB’s sustainability standards that would apply to ANZ.  It liaised with the Audit Committee on both CSRD and ISSB. Subsidiary oversight and engagement The Committee made progress on its  oversight and engagement with the boards of  its subsidiaries on sustainability and ESG.  NEDs from the Group’s operations in the UK,  Australia and Spain have participated in one  of the Committee’s meetings over the last 12  months, along with the members of the local  management teams with responsibility for  sustainability. They each shared insights on  the areas of focus within their Market Unit.  The Committee now has an established  programme of inviting a NED from each of its  Market Units to its meetings once a year. Liaison with other Board Committees The Committee worked with other Board  committees and leveraged the benefit of its  members’ cross-memberships. It liaised with  the Board Audit Committee on external  reporting and disclosures, as disclosed above.  It also liaised with the Board Remuneration  Committee on sustainability and ESG matters,   in the context of the remuneration policy and  remuneration outcomes. The Committee Chair  also attended a meeting of the Audit  Committee during the year to understand  better management's process for collating  and reporting information for CSRD in the EU. Committee effectiveness review The Committee undertook an internally- facilitated review of its effectiveness for 2024.  It scored highly in all areas of its role and  operations, composition, leadership,  i and processes and procedures. It was  concluded the Committee continued to  perform well and effectively.  It reviewed progress against the focus  areas for 2024 identified through the 2023  internally-facilitated Committee effectiveness  review: evolution of the sustainability Strategy  to remain relevant to the business and  business model; enhance the quality of the  emissions reduction data and other MI  presented to the Committee; and undertaken  knowledge-development sessions on the  sustainability landscape and ESG  developments. The Committee was  comfortable it had sufficiently covered  these areas during 2024.  Focus for 2025  The areas of focus for 2025, including those  dentified from the 2024 internal review  process, are: ■The refreshment of the new Group  sustainability strategy and its  implementation during 2025, ensuring that  the strategy is sufficiently ambitious and  that the targets are measurable and  achievable. ■Monitor the external landscape and  developments and expectations relating to  sustainability, participating in additional  knowledge-development sessions as  appropriate. ■Given the increasing scale and importance  of external reporting on sustainability  issues, enhancing its work with the Audit  Committee to ensure the Committee's work  on sustainability strategy, and the Audit  Committee's focus on reporting and  assurance, are fully aligned to the fast- changing landscape.         Professor Melvin Samsom Board Sustainability Committee Chair Board Sustainability Committee Report continued 89 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 92 ===== Directors’ Remuneration Report Part 1: Committee Chair’s letter Cath Keers Remuneration Committee Chair Dear Association Members Dear Association Members, on behalf of the Board and the Remuneration Committee,  I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the 2024 financial year.  Following the Chair’s Letter,  you will find Remuneration At a Glance, the Annual Report  on Remuneration and the Directors’ Remuneration Policy. Committee purpose The purpose of the Committee is to determine  the remuneration policy for the Executive  Directors, set the remuneration for the Bupa  Board Chair, its Executives and Designated  Individuals (DIs), review workforce  remuneration and related policies, and review  the alignment of incentives and rewards with  culture. The Committee’s full Terms of  Reference are available on bupa.com. Committee membership The Committee currently comprises five  members: the Senior Independent Director  (Committee Chair) and four independent  NEDs, all of whom have the relevant skills and  experience for the work of the Committee. All  members served throughout the year and to  the date of this report, with the exception of  Simon Blair who was appointed on 5 February  2024. As noted in other Committee reports,  the Board ensures there is cross-membership  between the Committee and its other Board  committees. This is important to ensure an  integrated approach to risk and reward,  inputs into and analysis of metrics, and the  performance and reporting of remuneration  outcomes. Details of the members of the  Committee can be found on pages 65 - 67. Committee operation During 2024, the Committee met seven times  and discharged all of the duties delegated to  it by the Board. Members’ attendance at  meetings can be found on page 75 in the  Corporate Governance Report. The  Committee routinely invited the Group CEO,  Group CFO, Group Chief Sustainability and  People Officer and the Performance and  Reward Director to attend and report at all  or part of its meetings. The Chair of the Risk  Committee is already a member of the  Remuneration Committee, in addition,  the Chairs of the Audit Committee and  Sustainability Committee are invited to  attend annually to provide input on incentive  outcomes. It also invited its independent  remuneration adviser, Deloitte, to attend  relevant meetings and provide advice and  briefings on corporate governance matters. 90 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 93 ===== Key activities in 2024 The Committee’s key activities and considerations during 2024 and to the date of signing this Annual Report were: Activities Committee considerations Incentive outcomes To monitor and determine if performance  targets have been satisfied and approve  the total annual payments under incentive  schemes and plans and to exercise the  discretion specified in the rules of the  incentives and oversee incentive  administration. See pages 98 to 101 of the Directors’  Remuneration Report for the incentive  outcomes. Management Bonus Scheme (MBS) The Management Bonus Scheme is the Group’s annual bonus plan for  leaders and managers across Bupa.  The Committee reviewed and approved the 2024 MBS results: ■Group profit was ahead of the stretch target due to strong  underlying performance and higher investment returns across  Market Units (MUs) and Bupa Arabia. ■Revenue was above target performance, driven by higher volumes  and pricing.  ■All MUs continued to make good progress on customer  performance metrics, an outcome of Bupa’s customer-centric  strategy.  Alongside the measures that make up the MBS scorecard, the MBS  outcome is subject to an overall adjustment relating to risk  management behaviours. Assisted by advice from the Risk  Committee and the Risk Review Panel, the Committee determined  that no business-wide risk adjustments would apply.  Based on strong performance against profit, revenue and customer  metrics, the Business Performance Multiplier (BPM) for the Group  CEO and CFO was 136.4%. The Individual Performance Multiplier  (IPM) for the Group CEO and CFO, based on their performance  during the year, was 140%. As a result, the Committee approved  bonuses of 95.5% of maximum opportunity for the Group CEO and  CFO.  For Executive Directors 50% of the bonus payout is deferred  for three years. 2022-2024 Strategic Performance Plan (SPP) The 2022-24 SPP scheme was designed during 2021 and  implemented in 2022 to support the 3x6 Strategy. The SPP has been  successful in incentivising the behaviours we needed to support the  strategy. The four measures are entirely aligned with the 3x6  Strategy and as a result of the significant focus that has been placed  on them since 2022, the 2022-24 SPP vested at 193.8%. ■SPP ROCE has outperformed the stretch target as a result of over  achievement against target across all years which is consistent  with the trading outperformance after adjusting for tax, adding  back interest costs and excluding certain unrealised and non-cash- like items. Return outperformance was slightly offset by higher  average capital employed across the three-year period. ■There has been significant focus placed on increasing the  proportion of customer healthcare touchpoints owned by Bupa,  and as a result of the connected care strategies in the Markets  Units (MUs), the main three insurance Business Units (BUs) have  all significantly increased the proportion of Bupa-owned customer  healthcare touchpoints during the 3x6 period.  ■Growth in customer numbers since 2022 has been very strong,  across both the insurance and provision parts of our business. As a  result of this strong performance, Bupa has outperformed the 3- year average stretch target by 9.1m customers. ■The inclusion of a CO2 reduction measure in the SPP has driven  even greater focus across all BUs than was seen before. As a result  of the focus on CO2, we have outperformed our 40% stretch  target reduction in CO2 emissions, mainly driven by management’s  drive to increase the use of renewable electricity.  As with the MBS, the Committee also reviewed risk management  behaviours across Bupa and determined that no adjustment was  required1. 1. SPP ROCE is ROCE excluding surplus capital as defined by the SPP and based on actual FX (subject to +/- 0.1% cap / collar) (see page 99 for details) Directors’ Remuneration Report Part 1: Committee Chair’s letter continued 91 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 94 ===== Activities Committee considerations Annual Pay Awards To approve the total individual  remuneration of executives and  Designated Individuals. The Committee approved base salary recommendations in 2024 of  6% for the Group CEO and 10.2% for the Group CFO, to reflect  continued strong performance in role and their role in Bupa’s  transformation. This increase is seen as appropriate in the context of  market competitiveness and will ensure continued focus on financial  strength and stability of the Group.  It also considered and approved the base salary recommendations  for the CEC and Group DIs. All pay awards, including those for the  Executive Directors, were considered with regard to their alignment  with the wider employee pay and remuneration arrangements and  considered market and economic conditions, stakeholder interests  and input from its independent adviser, Deloitte. Incentive Targets To review and approve the design of, and  performance targets of, the incentive  plans and policy for making of awards. See part 2 for the incentive targets. At the start of 2024, the Committee considered the 2024 MBS non- financial targets and the 2024-26 SPP targets, and the maximum  payout levels for both.  It carefully considered the amendments to the SPP for the 2024-26  award in respect of the SPP ROCE weighting, customer number  target and weighting for sustainability, to reflect that the award  would span the last year of the 3x6 Strategy (2022-24) and two  years of the new 3x100 Strategy (2025-27), and the refresh of Bupa’s  sustainability strategy.  These changes were reflected in the version  of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy which was approved by the  Association Members at the 2024 AGM. Workforce remuneration and  remuneration To review the remuneration policy and  workforce remuneration and related  policies. See part 2 for the incentive outcomes. Throughout the year, the Committee received updates from  management on wider workforce remuneration and benefits.  The Committee took these inputs into account when considering  executive pay in accordance with Provision 33 of the Code. Directors’ Remuneration Report Part 1: Committee Chair’s letter continued 92 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 95 ===== Activities Committee considerations Design of the 2025 long-term incentive  plan award To review the design of, and approve any  amendments to, incentive plans. As a key initiative for 2024 and as disclosed in the 2023 Directors’  remuneration report, the Company committed to undertake a review  of the SPP, to ensure it remained aligned to Bupa’s strategy as it  evolves.  Through the course of the year the Committee met to discuss and  design the new incentive. There were four key design principles: ■A strong link to the new 3x100 Strategy, supporting the key  elements of the strategy through an updated balanced scorecard ■A scorecard multiplier to incentivise leaders to meet the stretch  level of ambition in the new strategy ■Alignment with the incentive structures of UK listed companies to  recognise the principle of a “growth” element, which an executive  would receive in a listed company ■Increased maximum opportunity from 200% of target to 400% of  target but only when the multiplier is activated for exceptional  outperformance. The Committee considered how execution of the strategy is  measured through the scorecard and that will be the primary  determinant of any payout. The multiplier would only come into  effect when the level of outperformance is sufficiently high and has  met the stretching targets set by the Remuneration Committee.  The Committee is satisfied that SPP applies to Bupa’s senior leaders  and Executive Directors, and will work as follows: ■An individual will be invited to join the scheme at the beginning of  the three-year performance period, subject to individual  performance. ■To meet the targets at the end of the three-year performance  period, the Committee will assess Bupa’s performance using a  balanced scorecard capturing financial and non-financial measures  and a scorecard multiplier based on a SPP ROCE measure and  payout will be confirmed to participants. Key SPP design features  Balanced scorecard As the business evolves with its new strategy, the Committee  considered that the SPP is necessary to the optimal delivery of our  strategy and purpose, success and our ambition to be the world’s  most customer-centric healthcare company. The Committee  considered that the SPP remains necessary to not only support the  key elements of the strategy, but also incentivise participants to  deliver the increased level of ambition.  The Committee has reviewed proposed measures and targets for the  balanced scorecard and have agreed the split of financial (40%) and  non-financial (60%) measures to ensure the plan incentivises the  behaviours required for the successful delivery of the 3x100 Strategy.  Details of the measures will be communicated to AMs ahead of the  AGM in May 2025. Targets are not disclosed at this time due to  commercial sensitivity and will be made available following the end  of the plan period. Scorecard multiplier 3-year average annual SPP ROCE The Committee continues to hold the view that SPP ROCE is a good  measure of Bupa’s performance as it ensures that we use our capital  efficiently. We have a wide range of businesses in our portfolio and  are focused on ensuring we operate these efficiently and profitably  to enable us to create a strong and sustainable business. SPP ROCE  is an existing metric in our current SPP that is well tracked and  monitored. Accordingly, it is a well understood measure and a key  element of the current and future strategy. Directors’ Remuneration Report Part 1: Committee Chair’s letter continued 93 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 96 ===== Activities Committee considerations Design of the 2025 long-term incentive  plan award (continued) Risk  Risk continues to be an overall adjustment, and the Committee will  consider whether a risk adjustment is required at the time it  determines the payout. The performance measures are open to review each year, and in line  with best practice, will evolve where necessary. Award level The Committee reviewed alignment of the new SPP with the  ambitious three-year goals and delivery of the 3x100 Strategy. There  will be no change to the Executive Director target award levels  (Group CEO 150% of salary and Group CFO 137.5% of salary) or the  maximum available under the scorecard (this remains at 200% of  target for Group CEO and CFO).  However, only in the event of  exceptional financial performance, there is the opportunity for a  scorecard multiplier of between 1x to 2x to apply to increase the  overall maximum to 400% of target.  Therefore, the maximum award  level for exceptional performance will be 600% of salary (target  150%) for the Group CEO and 550% of salary (target 137.5%) for the  Group CFO. Achieving a maximum payout would require significant effort and a  material increase in Company performance. Summary of design outcomes of the new SPP ■An increase in overall maximum payout opportunity from 200% to  400% of target award, noting that this would only apply with both  maximum financial and non-financial performance under the  scorecard when the multiplier is activated for exceptional  performance. ■Remains straightforward, with all participants aligned to the new  strategy and with a clear line of sight on the Group’s performance. ■Based on three-year performance, promoting long-term  sustainable performance. Directors’ Remuneration Policy To determine Bupa’s remuneration policy  and practice, set the remuneration to  support strategy, promote long-term  sustainable success of Bupa, align to  Bupa’s purpose and values and link to its  strategy. To design and invoke safeguards, including  malus and clawback provisions to protect  against reward for failure. See Part 3 for the Policy details. When reviewing the Remuneration Policy during the year, the  Committee assessed general workforce metrics and factored in the  remuneration of the broader employee population, related policies,  and the alignment of incentives and rewards with culture. It was also  mindful to ensure that the Policy complied with the provisions of the  Code), so far as they are applicable to a company without shares or  shareholders, in particular Provisions 33 and 37 to 40, in order to  retain talent and align the Company’s and Executive Directors’  interests.  It also considered the 2024 Remuneration Policy Statement as  required under the UK’s Solvency II requirements. Directors’ Remuneration Report Part 1: Committee Chair’s letter continued 94 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 97 ===== Activities Committee considerations Remuneration approvals To approve the total individual  remuneration of executives and Designated  Individuals, Board Chair fees, subsidiary  NED fees, and NED expenses policy; and  consider and recommend policy and  application of termination payments and  compensation for Executive Directors and  Designated Individuals. See Part 2  for the remuneration of the  Executive Directors, Board Chair and NEDs. During the year the Committee considered and approved remuneration  proposals for certain executives, endorsed approvals previously made  by the Committee Chair under delegated authority, and approved  remuneration parameters and packages for certain incoming and  outgoing individuals in accordance with its responsibilities under its  terms of reference. The Committee also considered and approved certain non-executive  fees, including the fees for the current and incoming Board Chair, and  the Chair and NED fees for the Group’s subsidiaries. Compliance, controls and reporting To review policies and compliance with all  applicable laws and regulations and  published guidelines for jurisdictions in  which the Group operates, including Code  compliance. See the Corporate Governance Report for  more details. As the Committee undertook its work on the design, determination  and communication of remuneration and remuneration policy, it had  regard to complying with the provisions and principles of the Code. In  particular, it paid close attention to the six principles of Provision 40  of the Code: clarity, proportionality, simplicity, risk, predictability and  alignment with culture. To aid understanding of these, it sought to  ensure: communications were clear, simple and transparent; the  structure of rewards were kept simple; there was clear alignment of  pay awards and incentive targets with strategy, company  performance, and individual performance and behaviours (to support  culture); that it was clear and understood that undue risk taking was  unacceptable, any risk events would be reflected in remuneration  outcomes, and remuneration could be further adjusted for malus and  clawback. The Committee was satisfied that Bupa’s Remuneration Framework is  well-aligned with Provision 40 of the Code.  Throughout the year the Committee also undertook its routine  responsibilities to review and approve the Global Reward Standard  that supports the Enterprise People Policy. It reviewed, advised and  recommended external reporting and disclosures to other Committees  and the Board for approval, such as those set out in the Annual Report  and Accounts for 2023 and 2024. It also considered Bupa’s external  gender pay gap reporting. Directors’ Remuneration Report Part 1: Committee Chair’s letter continued 95 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 98 ===== Subsidiary oversight and engagement The Committee works with the boards of  subsidiaries (including subsidiary board  committees) to ensure the remuneration  policy is applied appropriately in the  subsidiaries, and approves exceptions to the  policy where required to comply with local  legislation or be competitive with local market  practice. During the year it received reports  on governance from the remuneration  committees of the UK and Australian  regulated entities and it also reviewed  subsidiary Chair and NED fees and approvals  required under the Group’s Subsidiary  Governance Policy. Liaison with other Board Committees As covered in its key activities during 2024  and to the date of the Annual Report, the  Committee has continued to work closely  with other Board committees, leveraging  the benefit of members’ cross-Committee  memberships to assist with remuneration  considerations, approvals and reporting,  as detailed above. Committee effectiveness review The Committee undertook an internally- facilitated review of its effectiveness.  The results confirmed that the Committee  continued to perform strongly and operate  effectively, with strong results across its role  and operations, composition, leadership, and  processes and procedures. The Committee  considered how it could further improve its  effectiveness during 2025. It also reviewed its  Terms of Reference to ensure they remained  appropriate, up-to-date and that its duties  were fully discharged in 2024. The Committee reviewed progress against the  focus areas for 2024 identified through the  2023 internally-facilitated review of its  effectiveness. It was satisfied the Committee  had given sufficient focus to the areas it set  for 2024, which included: remuneration design  should be aligned with the new strategy;  target setting should be sufficiently stretching,  rewarding true out-performance; minimal  adjustments should be made to financial  performance targets; Committee members  should continue to have the skills and  experience to challenge performance and  proposed changes to remuneration structures  and arrangements; and wider remuneration  issues should be considered including  consideration of the focus areas in the  wider context of remuneration Focus for 2025 The areas of focus for 2025, including those  identified from its 2024 review of its  effectiveness, are: ■Incentive design – consider broader Group  regulatory reporting requirements during  incentive design and ensure incentives   align with the 3x100 Strategy; ■Implementing the new 2025-27 SPP -  ensuring incentives generate the right  behaviours and actions, have robust metrics  and targets and continue to align definitions  and measures with best practice; ■Remuneration policy - ensure front line  remuneration remains competitive and  that Bupa people on lower incomes are  supported. Voting on remuneration In accordance with the Code, resolutions  proposing (i) the Director’s Remuneration  Report (excluding the Directors’  Remuneration Policy) and (ii) the Directors’  Remuneration Policy will be proposed to  the AMs at the 2025 AGM. Although both  resolutions are for an advisory vote of the  AMs, Bupa intends to be bound by the result  of the vote on the Directors’ Remuneration  Policy.

James Lenton’s benefit figure includes private medical insurance and a car allowance. 2024 MBS measures and performance (Audited) For 2024, the Group CEO’s target MBS opportunity was 100% of salary, with a maximum of 200% of salary. The Group CFO’s target MBS opportunity was 75% of salary, with a maximum of 150%  of salary. For 2024, the Committee agreed to change the MBS scorecard by removing cost efficiency and adding its 10% weighting to the profit measure, aiming to simplify the scorecard and further  incentivise the delivery of the plan. The performance measures used to determine the 2024 MBS for our Executive Directors were as follows: ■Group profit (65% of award)1 – is based on the externally reported result with the same adjustments as revenue and also excludes pension net interest returns. Group revenue  (10% of award) – externally reported result adjusted to exclude Bupa Chile and include Bupa’s proportionate share of revenue from associates and joint ventures, UK Insurance  non-insurance revenue, outward reinsurance premiums ceded and intra-group revenues which are not included within the consolidated view of revenue. An adjustment is also made to use the  local accounting policy rather than the IFRS Service Concession Arrangement accounting basis for a contract in our Spanish hospital business, to eliminate the volatility associated with inflationary  movements. Customer objectives (6.25% of award) – this measure includes targets to increase the number of customer experience improvements.  Customer NPS (18.75% of award) – this is a measure to drive improvement of our Net Promoter Score. ■ ■ ■ 1. Performance measured on plan target exchange rates. Alongside the measures that make up the MBS scorecard, the MBS outcome is subject to an overall adjustment relating to risk management across Bupa as determined by the Committee, assisted  by input from the Risk Committee and the Risk Review Panel. The overall result generates a Business Performance Multiplier (BPM) that is applied along with the Individual Performance Multiplier  (IPM) to target bonus generating the annual MBS payout for each individual.  As detailed in the table on the below, the Group CEO and CFO achieved BPMs of 136.4% on the back of strong financial performance with respect to group profit and revenue as well as strong  performance against customer metrics. 98 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 101 ===== The Group CEO received an IPM of 140% in recognition of an outstanding year, demonstrating exceptional leadership, delivering strong underlying financial performance, and driving transformation  in line with our 3x6 Strategy. The Group CFO received an IPM of 140% in recognition of a strong year, and continued high performance, supporting significant strategic progress towards our 3x6 Strategy and delivering strong  financial performance.

The cash- based plan covers the three-year performance period to 31 December 2024.  The 2022-24 SPP vesting was based on SPP ROCE (55%), Customer Healthcare touchpoints (15%), Customer numbers  (15%) and CO2 reduction (15%). In 2022 we did not disclose the targets for reasons of commercial sensitivity, and these are now disclosed in the table below following the end of the plan period. ■Aligned with the strong performance of the business over the last three years, the performance of the 2022-24 SPP has reflected the success of the 3x6 Strategy with each element of the  scorecard exceeding target, and with the exception of customer healthcare touchpoints, also exceeding the stretch performance target. The Remuneration Committee was satisfied with the  overall formulaic outcome of the scheme and did not exercise discretion in relation to the payout of SPP. ■SPP ROCE has performed above stretch across all three years of the SPP, consistent with strong trading outperformance. The formulaic outcome of 9.9% is based on the SPP ROCE methodology  agreed with the Remuneration Committee, which included using the actual FX rate with a cap and collar where FX has a positive or negative impact on the 3-year average SPP ROCE of greater  than 0.1%. The Remuneration Committee noted that on an Actual Exchange Rate basis (without the FX cap/collar) average annual SPP ROCE over the three-year performance period is 9.1%. Directors’ remuneration report Part 2: Annual Report on Remuneration continued 99 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 102 ===== ■There has been strong focus placed on increasing the proportion of customer healthcare touchpoints owned by Bupa, and as a result of the successful delivery of the connected care strategies  in the MUs, our three main insurance businesses have all increased their customer healthcare touchpoints during the 3x6 Strategy period. Sanitas Seguros delivered incremental KPI growth,  whilst both UK Insurance (UKI) and Australia Health Insurance (AHI) delivered growth from increased owned provision and uptake of our Blua digital health offering. Growth in customer numbers since 2022 has been very strong across the insurance and provision parts of our business. Notable drivers of the growth have been LuxMed, Australia Health  Insurance, Sanitas Seguros, Bupa Dental UK, UK Health Services, Sanitas New Services & Hospitals and Niva Bupa. As a result of this strong performance, the Group outperformed the 3-year  average stretch target by 9.1m customers. The inclusion of a CO2 reduction measure in the scorecard has created a significant focus across all BUs than was seen before and the 2022-24 SPP.  This has been delivered through (1)  decarbonising our scope 1 emissions, (2) securing 100% renewable electricity across a number of businesses including Australia and Hong Kong, and (3) increasing our use of renewables across  LUXMED and Chile.  ■ ■ As with the MBS, the Committee also reviewed risk management behaviours across Bupa using contributions from the Risk Committee and Risk Review Panel and determined that no business  wide adjustment was required this year. Overall financial and non-financial performance led to a calculated payout of 96.9% of the maximum award.

We have a wide range of businesses  in our portfolio and need to focus on ensuring we operate these efficiently and profitably to create a strong and sustainable business. We can do this by  increasing the performance of all of our businesses as well as actively managing our portfolio. Customer healthcare  touchpoints 15% This measure directly links to one of our 3x6 ambitions. In order to become the world’s most customer-centric healthcare company we need to ensure we  support customers with their health and wellbeing and truly understand their needs. Owning more customer healthcare touchpoints will provide us with  more data/insight on our customers, support our move towards becoming more digitally enabled and ultimately lead us to tailoring our support to each  customer’s needs to provide better outcomes. Customer numbers 20% One of the key outcomes of being a more customer-centric company is having more customers. We want to retain our existing customers while finding new  customers, and to do that we need to be continually implementing improvements based on feedback. Focusing on this measure ensures that we continue to  have a strong and sustainable business. Sustainability 10% Our purpose demonstrates the role we have to play in the health of the planet. We have committed to science based targets and will be a net zero business  across all emission scopes by 2040. We strongly believe that business and sustainability go hand in hand and believe it is important to incentivise our senior  leaders on this basis. 5% 10% of the weighting is related to overall scope 1 and 2 CO2 reduction from the 2019 baseline. 5% of the weighting is related to the percentage of our Top  100 suppliers aligned with our carbon reduction commitments.   Targets for SPP measures are not disclosed at this time due to commercial sensitivity and will be made available following the end of the plan period. Directors’ remuneration report Part 2: Annual Report on Remuneration continued 101 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 104 ===== CEO pay ratio  The table below compares the single total figure of remuneration for the CEO since 2019 with that of the UK employees who are paid at the 25th percentile (lower quartile), 50th percentile (median)  and 75th percentile (upper quartile) of its employee population.   Year Method Ratio with the 25th  percentile employee Ratio with the 50th  percentile employee Ratio with the 75th  percentile employee 2024 Option B Total pay and benefits 238:1 197:1 132:1 Salary only 43:1 37:1 25:1 2023 Option B Total pay and benefits 130:1 115:1 73:1 Salary only 41:1 40:1 25:1 2022 Option B Total pay and benefits 123:1 122:1 68:1 Salary only 41:1 40:1 24:1 2021 Option B Total pay and benefits 206:1 215:11 123:1 Salary only 41:1 44:11 27:1 2020 Option B Total pay and benefits 226:1 225:1 126:1 Salary only 44:1 42:1 26:1 2019 Option B Total pay and benefits 197:1 143:1 116:1 Salary only 43:1 37:1 29:1 1. The 2021 50th percentile salary shown in the table above is lower than the lower quartile salary as a result of the Gender Pay Gap data methodology. The Gender Pay Gap data is a snapshot of hourly pay as at 5 April and it is this snapshot that  is used to identify the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile employees for this table in line with the CEO Pay Ratio regulations. The table above details actual pay earned through the year for those employees identified at the 25th, 50th and 75th  percentile.  Of the three options available for calculating the pay ratio we have chosen Option B, which uses the most recent gender pay gap information (April 2024) to identify and select employees at the  25th, 50th and 75th percentile. This method has been chosen as it makes use of our gender pay data which provides a readily available and robust dataset. This is made up of all UK employees  from Bupa’s insurance, corporate functions and health provision businesses. To ensure that the results are representative of the employee population’s pay and benefits at those quartiles, Bupa has  chosen to use a median value of the pay and benefits for the 15 employees above and below, and including, the individual at the given quartile. This approach was taken to allow for any leavers  through the year, given Bupa’s large and diverse workforce. The annual remuneration figures are taken across the full year ending 31 December 2024. Changes to the CEO pay ratio in 2022 and 2023 compared to 2024 (and previous years) with regards to total pay and benefits is in part a result of the reduced single total figure for the Group  CEO in 2022 and 2023 due to changes in the vesting schedule of Bupa’s long-term incentive schemes as outlined in previous reports. In reviewing the employee pay data, the Committee is comfortable that the overall picture presented by the ratios is consistent with our pay, reward and progression policies for UK employees. In the table above, the Committee has chosen to provide information relating to salary in addition to the total remuneration calculations. As incentive pay can significantly vary year on year,  the Committee determined that the salary ratio provides helpful context beyond that of the single figure.

Committee Governance Cath Keers has chaired the Remuneration Committee since 1 January 2020. The Committee presented the 2023 Directors’ remuneration report and Directors’  remuneration policy at the AGM in May 2024 and it was approved by AMs. Deloitte was appointed by the Remuneration Committee as its independent adviser from  1 May 2021, following a selection process involving a number of advisory firms. The  appointment is reviewed regularly. The Committee is of the view that Deloitte provides  independent remuneration advice and does not have any connections with Bupa that may  impair its independence. Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group and  voluntarily operates under this Group’s code of conduct when providing advice on executive  remuneration in the UK. Deloitte’s fees for services to the Committee in 2024 were £90,900  on a time and materials basis. During the year, Deloitte advised on market practice,  corporate governance and regulations, remuneration benchmarking and other matters that  the Committee was considering. Other teams within Deloitte provided unrelated tax and  consulting services to Bupa during the year. The Terms of Reference of the Committee were reviewed by the Committee and adopted  by the Board in December 2024. A full description of the Committee’s role is set out in its  Terms of Reference here on bupa.com. Directors’ remuneration report Part 2: Annual Report on Remuneration continued 107 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 110 ===== The Remuneration Committee seeks to align the Company’s Directors’ Remuneration Policy  (the ‘Policy’) with the Group’s business strategy, workforce arrangements, market practice,  views expressed by the AMs, the economic environment and underlying financial  performance of the Group throughout the year. The Policy is intended to promote Bupa’s  long-term success and motivate management to deliver strong, sustainable business  performance aligned with Bupa’s purpose, culture and values. The Policy allows Bupa to  offer competitive remuneration compared to companies of a similar scale and complexity.  The proposed Policy is subject to an advisory vote by AMs at the 2025 AGM and, if  approved, will apply immediately, for up to three years. The Directors’ Remuneration Policy  is available on Bupa's website under the ‘Financials’ heading in the Directors’ Remuneration  Report of the Annual Report and Accounts. The key changes between the Directors’ Remuneration Policy approved 15 May 2024 and  the Policy proposed for 2025, are detailed below: ■Increase in maximum long term incentive opportunity from 300% to 600% of salary. This  is to facilitate the potential use of the scorecard multiplier.  As noted in the Committee  Chair’s letter, there will be no change to the Executive Director target award levels (Group  CEO 150% of salary and Group CFO 137.5% of salary) or the maximum available under the  scorecard (this remains at 200% of target for Group CEO and CFO).  An increase in overall  maximum payout opportunity from 200% to 400% of target award, noting that this  would only apply with both maximum financial and non-financial performance under  the scorecard combined with exceptional Strategic Performance Plan (SPP) ROCE  performance under the multiplier.  Therefore, the overall maximum award level for  exceptional performance will be 600% of salary (target 150%) for the Group CEO and  550% of salary (target 137.5%) for the Group CFO. ■The minimum weighting of financial measures in the SPP is reduced from 55% to 40%. Remuneration Policy table – Executive Directors Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum Opportunity Performance metrics Base Salary Core element of remuneration set to  attract and retain Executive  Directors, reflecting their role and  contribution. Salary levels are reviewed annually with any  changes becoming effective in April. Factors  considered include: ■Level of skill, experience and scope of  responsibilities. ■Overall business performance, scarcity of  talent, economic climate and market  conditions. ■General increases across Bupa. ■External market data. Salary increases are normally in line with  those of the Bupa employee population.  Larger increases may be given in certain  circumstances, such as a new  appointment to rebase the remuneration  with market rate. There is no specific maximum salary level. None Management  bonus scheme  (MBS) To drive behaviour and to promote  focus on the business priorities for  the year. To motivate and incentivise delivery  of performance over the annual  operating plan. Bonus award levels and their measures and  weightings are reviewed annually to align with  the business strategy. Performance is assessed against stretching  financial and non-financial performance targets  set at the start of the financial year. Typically, 50% of any bonus awarded will be  deferred for up to three years, with the  remaining 50% paid immediately in cash. The maximum bonus opportunity will not  exceed 200% of base salary. There is no payout for threshold  performance. MBS payments are based on the  achievement of challenging financial and  non-financial objectives. No less than 60%  of the annual bonus will be subject to the  achievement of financial measures  aligned with the strategic priorities of the  business. Directors’ remuneration report Part 3: Directors’ Remuneration Policy 108 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 111 ===== Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum Opportunity Performance metrics Long-term incentive  plan To motivate and incentivise delivery  of strong sustained performance  over the long term aligned with  Bupa’s strategic objectives. As Bupa cannot provide equity-based  incentives, it provides a deferred cash Long  Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) through the  Strategic Performance Plan (SPP), that is  broadly aligned to equity plans in comparative  companies. Awards are usually made on an  annual basis and relate to performance over a  three-year period. Vesting depends on  meeting performance targets, set and assessed  by the Committee.  Any payments will be made following the end  of the performance period. The maximum award will not exceed  600% of base salary.  Note that this  maximum would only apply in the event  of both maximum financial and non- financial performance under the  scorecard combined with maximum  performance under the multiplier and is  therefore dependent on exceptional  performance. Vesting of awards is based on  performance against financial and non- financial measures. No less than 40% of  the SPP will be based on financial  measures, with the remainder linked to  key strategic priorities  Threshold performance results in payout  of 30% of salary. Pension To provide an income after  retirement. The Company operates a defined contribution  pension scheme. Executive Directors have the option to take  any employer contribution as a cash allowance  or a combination of pension contribution and  cash allowance. Executive Directors receive employer  contributions in line with the rest of the  workforce. None. Benefits Other benefits are provided to: ■attract and retain Executive  Directors, health and wellbeing  benefits are provided to them  and their families. ■facilitate talent mobility to ensure  execution of strategy across the  Group. Executive Directors are entitled to benefits  such as private health cover for themselves  and their family, an annual health assessment  for themselves and their partner, life insurance,  income protection, car allowance (or  alternately for the Group CEO, the use of a  company car and driver) and 30 days’ annual  holiday. The benefits offered may differ from  time to time to reflect changing circumstances.  Authorised travel expenses are reimbursed  along with the additional tax and NIC incurred  where these are treated as taxable income. Where, in exceptional circumstances, spouses  or partners are required to travel for business  purposes, their travel and subsistence  expenses are reimbursed along with the  additional tax and NIC. Executive Directors who are relocated or  reassigned in the Group, receive relevant  benefits to assist them and their dependants to  move home and settle in the new location. There is no specific maximum benefit  spend. None.   Directors’ remuneration report Part 3: Policy continued 109 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 112 ===== Remuneration Policy on recruitment of an Executive Director  The Policy approach regarding remuneration upon recruitment, is to pay at an appropriate  level to attract the right talent to the role. The Directors’ Remuneration Policy set out on pages 108 and 109 outlines the components  of an Executive Director package. New appointments typically follow the existing Policy for  Executive Directors with salaries reflecting skills and experience of the individual, and may  be set at a level to allow future salary progression to reflect performance in the role. To facilitate recruitment, the Committee may offer compensatory payments for forfeited  remuneration from a previous employer, aiming to match its value, time horizon and  performance conditions. Additional arrangements may include relocation expenses and  international assignment allowances. For internal promotions, existing commitments may  be honoured unless an alternative approach, more closely aligned with the prevailing policy,  is agreed by the Committee. Any special joining arrangements may include malus and/or clawback; for example, tied to  leaving within a predefined period. The structure and quantum of the variable pay elements are expected to align with the  Policy set out in the table opposite. Remuneration Policy on loss of office of Executive Directors The Committee has the authority to approve any remuneration payments or payments for  loss of office where the terms of the payment were agreed: (i) before the Remuneration  Policy came into effect, or (ii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of  the Company, and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration  for the individual becoming a Director of the Company. The table summarises the key elements of our policy on payment for loss of office in  compliance with the relevant plan rules and local employment legislation.  Any payments made due to loss of office may take into account malus or clawback  provisions as set out on page 112. Policy  Committee response Notice period and  compensation for loss  of office in service  contracts 12 months’ notice from the Company to the Executive  Director. ■ ■Up to 12 months’ base salary (in line with the notice period).  Notice period payments will either be made as normal (if the  Executive Director continues to work during the notice  period or is on ‘gardening leave’) or at the termination date  for any unexpired notice period. Treatment of MBS  on loss of office under  plan rules  ■The Committee may make an MBS payment for the year of  cessation depending on the reason for leaving. Typically, the  Committee will take into consideration the period served  during the year and the individual’s performance up to  cessation.  Any such payment is at the discretion of the Committee. Any  MBS will be paid at the normal time following the end of the  performance year. Treatment of SPP  on loss of office under  plan rules  An Executive Director’s award will vest in accordance with  the terms of the plan and satisfaction of performance  conditions measured at the normal completion of the  performance period if the reason for leaving is redundancy,  pre-agreed retirement, early retirement on the grounds of ill  health, death or any other special circumstance agreed by  the Committee. In these cases, final awards may be pro-rated  based on completed months of service. The period of active  employment excludes any period of ‘gardening leave’ or  other such period when the Executive Director was legally  employed but not required to actively carry out their duties.  For any other reason, they will not be eligible for an SPP  payment. Any SPP payment will be paid at the normal time, e.g.  following the end of the performance period, or two years  later for any deferral. ■ ■ ■ Directors’ remuneration report Part 3: Policy continued 110 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 113 ===== Illustrations of the application of the Remuneration Policy Bupa aims to provide a balance of fixed and variable compensation that provides stability  and incentivises outstanding business performance, whilst not encouraging undue risk  taking. At target, over 50% of the Executive Directors’ remuneration is based on individual  and Company performance. This graph illustrates the potential remuneration outcomes for different levels of  performance using the respective Director’s bonus-able salary in 2025 to calculate the  MBS values and 1 March 2025 to calculate the SPP values. Remuneration at various levels of performance (£000) Iñaki Ereño, Group CEO £1,463 £1,463 £1,463 £1,071 £2,142 £1,559 £6,234 Fixed pay On target Maximum James Lenton, Group CFO £835 £835 £835 £541 £1,082 £963 £3,850 Fixed pay On target Maximum Differences between the remuneration policies for Executive Directors and  other employees  The Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors is designed to be broadly similar to the  policy applicable to Bupa employees to ensure that they are both aligned with delivering  sustainable business performance. While opportunities vary, the underlying principles of  salary review, MBS and SPP are consistent for senior executives. A small number of senior executives across Bupa participate in the SPP, with award levels  calculated as a percentage of salary and based on their level of seniority and accountability.  Vesting of the awards is dependent on performance against specific financial and non- financial measures over a three-year performance period. Fixed Management Bonus Scheme Strategic Performance Plan Directors’ remuneration report Part 3: Policy continued 111 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 114 ===== Performance measures and target setting Measures and targets for the MBS are aligned with delivery of Bupa’s Annual Operating Plan  and may include personal objectives that change from year to year. Measures and targets for the SPP are set by the Committee, taking into account internal and  external reference points that include historic Bupa performance, internal forecasts and  broader market trends. Targets are set for vesting at threshold, target and maximum  performance levels. Committee discretion The Committee has ultimate discretion over all incentive plans relating to the Executive  Directors and other individuals within its remit. This includes but is not limited to: ■Determining the size of the award/payment. Determining whether minimum levels of performance have been met or underlying  performance is satisfactory before determining the vesting of any awards. Determining whether the management of risk has been acceptable, or whether any  downward adjustments are required. Selecting or adjusting performance measures within the Remuneration Policy and the plan  rules. Determining whether individuals are ‘good leavers’ for incentive plan purposes, based on  plan rules. Making one-off adjustments in exceptional circumstances. ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ Malus and clawback The Committee may apply malus and clawback provisions to awards granted under the MBS,  GPP and SPP . Malus enable awards to be reduced, cancelled or made subject to additional  conditions before payment. Clawback requires repayment of cash awards for up to three  years after payment. Circumstances in which the operation of these provisions may be considered include: ■Misstatement of results. An error in assessing any relevant performance metric or in the information or  assumptions on which the MBS or SPP is determined. Serious reputational damage to Bupa or a relevant Business Unit. A scenario in which significant risk has been taken which is outside of Bupa’s or a relevant  Business Unit’s risk appetite. ■ ■ ■ ■An employee enters into any hedging transaction or transactions that might undermine  the intended performance and/or risk alignment of any awards under the Plan, including  any deferred amount. An act or omission which justifies, or in the opinion of the Board would have justified,  summary dismissal or service of notice of termination of employment on the grounds  of misconduct on the part of an employee. Gross misconduct or material breach of employment contract. New information presenting itself, highlighting that performance (Company or eligible  employee) was incorrectly assessed. Any other circumstance which the Committee in its discretion considers to be similar  in nature or effect to the above. ■ ■ ■ ■ The clawback period of three years from payment was chosen as being fair and  proportionate, aligns with the deferral period for MBS and GPP and the performance period  for SPP, and ensures consistency in all Bupa incentives. If an investigation into the conduct  or actions of the participant or any Group Company has started before, but has not been  completed on or before, the payment of the award and/or the end of the clawback time  period: the Committee may in its absolute discretion determine that the payment date and/ or the end of the clawback time period be such later date as  it may reasonably determine,  to allow for the investigation to be completed and allow the Committee a reasonable  opportunity to consider the outcome(s) of the investigation. Service contracts for Executive Directors Executive Directors have a 12-month rolling employment contract. The notice requirement is  12 months from both the Company and the individual, which may be payable in lieu. These  contracts also include specific post-termination restrictions. Executive Directors are usually  permitted, subject to the Board’s approval, to have one external NED role and to accept and  retain the fee for this appointment. This is on the condition that any external appointment  does not give rise to a conflict of interest.

Copies of the terms of engagement are available here on bupa.com. The table describes the Remuneration Policy as it applies to the Chairman and NEDs. Element  Purpose and link to strategy  Operation Fees  To attract and provide stability,  reflecting the complexity of the role  and time commitment required The Chairman receives an all-inclusive fee. NEDs receive a fixed basic fee. Additional fees are paid for chairing or membership of Board  Committees and for the Senior Independent Director role. Fees for additional work in relation to subsidiaries are paid for by the relevant  subsidiary. Fees are reviewed annually by the Board. Key factors considered include: ■Overall business performance. Scope and responsibility of the role. Appropriate market data. That NEDs are not eligible for any form of variable pay. ■ ■ ■ Benefits  To provide health and wellbeing  benefits aligned with Bupa’s purpose During their time in office, NEDs are entitled to private health cover for themselves and their family and an annual health assessment for  themselves and their partner. These benefits are taxable. Authorised travel expenses are reimbursed along with the additional tax and NIC  incurred where these are treated as taxable income and, in exceptional circumstances. Where spouses or partners are required to travel for  business purposes, travel and subsistence expenses are reimbursed along with the additional tax and NIC.

These cover all losses arising out of, or in connection with, the execution of their powers,  duties and responsibilities, as Directors of the Company or of any of its subsidiaries. They  have been in place throughout 2024 and to the date of this Annual Report. There are no  other qualifying third-party indemnity provisions or pension indemnity provisions in place. Political donations Bupa’s policy is to not make donations to political parties or to independent election  candidates and we will not do so without specific endorsement from our Association  Members. We have not made any political donations, nor incurred any political expenditure  within the definition in section 364 of the Act during 2024.  As the broad definitions used in the Act make it possible for the normal business activities  of the Company, which might not be thought of as political expenditure or donations to  political organisations in the usual sense, to be caught, we will continue to propose a  resolution at our 2025 Annual General Meeting to authorise the Group to make political  donations, given the wide definition in section 364 of the Act regarding what constitutes  a political donation. This is in accordance with best practice for listed companies. Bupa has  no intention of making use of this resolution. Branches  The Company has an inactive branch in Cyprus.  Articles of Association  The Company is limited by guarantee and has no share capital nor any traded securities.  Each of the Association Members has one vote on business at general meetings. The  Company’s Articles of Association require all Directors to be Association Members. The  Directors have the authority to exercise all the powers of the Company. A Director may  be appointed by ordinary resolution of the Association Members or by a decision of the Directors. All Directors must offer themselves for election or re-election  at each Annual General Meeting.  A Director’s appointment ceases upon: resignation, prohibition from being a director by  law, bankruptcy, ceasing to be an Association Member, incapacity or being removed from  a medical register if a qualified medical practitioner, a written request from at least three- quarters of the other Directors, by Board resolution if the Director has missed four  consecutive meetings, or by ordinary resolution given on special notice. Effectiveness of the internal control and risk management system The Directors completed their annual review of the Company’s risk management and internal  controls systems in 2024 covering all material codes, that included financial, operational  and compliance controls, in accordance with provision 29 of the Code. They took into  consideration the work of its Audit and Risk Committees and reports provided to the  Committees from the first, second and third-lines. They also considered an integrated  assurance report that set out the overall assessment of the Group’s systems of risk  management and internal control in 2024. Following this review, the Board concluded that  the Company has maintained overall sound risk management and internal control systems  during 2024, underpinned by the established three-lines model, with some weaknesses that  are being addressed by management and will be monitored by the Board’s Audit and Risk  Committees. 114 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 117 ===== Going concern The Directors confirm that they are satisfied that the Company and the Group have  adequate resources to continue in operation for the next 12 months. Accordingly, they  continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. The going  concern assessment in Note 1.4 on page 138 includes information on the Directors’ detailed  assessment of the Group’s status as a going concern.  Longer-term viability The Directors have examined the outlook for the Company and the Group, as required by  provision 31 of the Code, and assessed our ability to operate and meet our liabilities as they  fall due over a three-year period. Bupa’s new 3x100 Strategy is the driving force behind our planning process. A three-year  assessment period was chosen for the longer-term viability assessment because it ties in  with our internal planning process. Bupa’s planning considers all important financial and  regulatory measures over the period and stresses the key risks facing individual Business  Units, as well as global risks that could affect Bupa as a whole.  As part of the assessment of viability, the Directors looked at the financial performance,  capital management, cash flow, solvency, and future outlook. Bupa is well capitalised and is  expected to remain so over the plan period. The liquidity position of the Group is expected  to remain strong across the three-year period.  A number of reasonably plausible severe scenarios were considered as well as contingent  liabilities. A scenario in which worsening geopolitical conflicts and the potential knock-on  impacts on global growth and economic conditions that would lead to a global economic  recession in 2025 was considered. A variety of local scenarios developed by each Business  Unit were separately considered with the majority focusing on climate change, stroke of  pen and/or affordability pressures. Under the most severe reasonably possible scenarios  considered, the forecast liquidity position reduces but would remain within the Group’s  liquidity appetite over the three-year planning period without the need for management  actions. Management actions include reducing expenditure, obtaining additional funding  or divesting investments or businesses. ‘Reverse stress testing’ is also conducted at the Group level, aimed at identifying  hypothetical circumstances that might result in our business model failing and helps the  Directors to better understand the Group’s risks. The Group remains most exposed to failure  through a lack of liquidity at the Group centre, although multiple improbable events would  need to occur in order to induce failure (prior to the taking of management actions) in the  timeframe considered. The most recent Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA), that brings together the  outcomes of risk management and financial management processes, considers the level of  regulatory capital we require to remain financially stable over the planning period given the  nature of the risks we currently face, our strategy and our risk appetite. It takes into account  the quantification of the Group’s current risks as defined by the Solvency II Directive and  considers the impact of potential stressed scenarios that are aligned to Bupa’s risk profile.  It also sets out the management actions, identified as part of the Group’s Recovery Plan,  that are available to address challenges to the Group’s liquidity or solvency position. This  assessment concluded that we expect to have sufficient capital assets to continue to meet  regulatory requirements over a three-year period. Although Bupa pays interest on its borrowings, it has no shareholders and therefore does  not pay dividends. Instead, Bupa can invest in growing organically and through acquisition.  This expenditure is largely discretionary and can be reduced if required. Following a review of the key risks and uncertainties set out in the Risk Review on pages 56  to 62, the Directors are satisfied that there are appropriate risk management and  governance procedures in place to manage and mitigate these risks over the three-year  period. Emerging risks are identified and reported on to ensure that they are properly  understood and are considered in future strategic decisions. While continuing uncertainty exists as a result of the challenging macroeconomic and  geopolitical environment, the Group’s diversified business model continues to support the  viability of the Group over the period considered. Based on this analysis and regular risk and capital reporting processes, the Directors have a  reasonable expectation that Bupa will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities  as they fall due throughout the three-year planning period up to 31 December 2027. Report of the Directors continued 115 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 118 ===== Statement of Directors’ responsibilities  The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts and the Group  and Parent Company financial statements, in accordance with applicable law and  regulations. UK company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent Company  financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they have elected to prepare the  Group and the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted  international accounting standards in conformity with the Act.  Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are  satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent  Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and  Parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:  ■Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently  Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant, and reliable  State whether they have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international  accounting standards  Assess the Group and Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern  Use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group  or the Parent Company or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so. ■ ■ ■ ■ The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to  show and explain the Parent Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy  at any time the financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure that its  financial statements comply with the Act. They are responsible for such internal control as  they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free  from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have general responsibility  for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group  and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. The Directors consider that the Annual Report and financial statements taken as a whole are  fair, balanced and understandable, and provide the information necessary for AMs to assess  the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy.  The Directors have decided to prepare, voluntarily, a Directors’ remuneration report in  accordance with Schedule 8 to The Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups  (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 made under the Act, as if those requirements  were to apply to the Company.  The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and  financial information included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the  preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other  jurisdictions. Each of the current Directors, whose names and positions are set out on pages 65 to 67,  confirm that to the best of their knowledge: ■The financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting  standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or  loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole. ■The Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the  business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the  consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and  uncertainties that they face. Disclosure of information to the External Auditor  The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this Directors’ Report confirm that,  so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the External  Auditor is unaware, and each Director has taken all the steps which they ought to have taken  as a Director to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information, and to establish  that the External Auditor is aware of that information.  External Auditor reappointment  A resolution to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as External Auditor will be put to the  Company’s Annual General Meeting in May 2025. By order of the Board.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report, which comprise:  the Consolidated and Company Statements of Financial Position as at 31 December 2024; the  Consolidated Income Statement; the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income; the  Consolidated and Company Statements of Cash Flows; and the Consolidated and Company  Statements of Changes in Equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial  statements, comprising material accounting policy information and other explanatory  information. Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee. Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs  (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the  Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We  believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a  basis for our opinion. Independence We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are  relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical  Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these  requirements. Our audit approach Context Bupa is an international healthcare group, providing health insurance, health provision and aged  care services. The Group operates from a significant number of locations globally and has four  reportable segments: Bupa Asia Pacific; Europe and Latin America; Bupa Global, India and UK;  and Other businesses, which includes investments in associates. In planning for our audit we met  with the Audit Committee and members of management across the Group to discuss and  understand the businesses and any significant changes during the year, and to understand their  perspectives on associated business risks. We used this insight, in addition to our understanding  of the previous year's audit, when forming our own views regarding the audit risks and as part of  developing our planned audit approach to address those risks.  Given the activities of the Group, we have teams with the relevant industry experience at Group  and in all significant locations in which the Group operates. We meet with component teams at  key stages through the audit, in person and using remote technologies as appropriate, to  understand the businesses and related risk areas and to direct and oversee the work performed  by component teams. In addition, we perform in-person site visits with a number of our  component teams and local management on a rotational basis to fulfil our ISA (UK) 600  (Revised) responsibilities. We have also considered the sustainability commitments made by the Directors and considered  the potential impact of climate change related factors in our audit, including challenging  management on their assessment of how climate change related risks and opportunities impact  the financial statements. Overview Audit scope ■The Group has four reportable segments, in addition to the Group Functions’ activities. Each  reportable segment includes a number of reporting components across different locations and  service lines. We conducted audit testing over 31 components. These were selected based on our  assessment of inherent risk and their financial significance to the consolidated financial results. We selected 24 components to be in scope as they were significant due to size or risk. We determined to perform additional procedures on certain balances and transactions in a  further 7 non-significant components. Our audit scope provided coverage of 82% of IFRS Profit before taxation expense. ■ ■ ■ ■ 118 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 121 ===== Key audit matters ■Acquisition of Niva Bupa (Group) Valuation of the estimates of the present value of future cash flows within the liability for  incurred claims (Insurance contract liabilities) (Group) Valuation of freehold property and investment property (Group) Impairment of goodwill or reversal of previous impairments to other intangible and tangible  assets (Group) Classification, valuation and disclosure of certain liabilities relating to Isapre Cruz Blanca (Bupa  Chile) (Group) Valuation of defined benefit pension obligation (Company) ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ Materiality ■Overall Group materiality: £42.5 million (FY23: £40.3 million) based on 5% of Profit before  taxation expense adjusted for certain non-recurring items.

Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most  significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most  significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by  the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the  allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These  matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed  in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion  thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. The acquisition of Niva Bupa is a new key audit matter this year. In addition, the focus of the key  audit matter in relation to liabilities relating to Isapre Cruz Blanca (“Bupa Chile”) has been  amended to reflect the updated circumstances. The implementation of IFRS 17, which was a key  audit matter last year, is no longer included because of the reduction in risk following the  implementation of IFRS 17 for the first time in the prior year. Otherwise, the key audit matters  below are consistent with last year. Independent auditors’ report to the members of The British United Provident Association Limited continued 119 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 122 ===== Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Acquisition of  Niva Bupa  (Group) Refer to Audit  Committee  Report and  Note 23 (for  accounting policy  and financial  disclosures) On 8 January 2024 the Group acquired additional shares in Niva Bupa resulting in it  holding a controlling interest. From that date the entity has been fully consolidated in  the financial statements. Previously, the investment was equity accounted under IAS  28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. Given the significance of the transaction which resulted in goodwill of £536m being  recognised, the accounting for the acquisition has been an area of focus for the audit  this year.  The acquisition accounting, in accordance with IAS 28 and IFRS 3, Business  Combinations, required a number of accounting judgements and estimates, including:  ■ ■ the £321m gain arising on the revaluation of the existing shareholding on obtaining  control; the estimates used in the determination of the fair value adjustments made  to the acquired insurance contract liabilities and reinsurance assets; and  the judgements to identify and estimates to value the intangible assets recognised  through the purchase price allocation.  As a result of the acquisition there has also been an alignment of accounting policies  with the Group, including those related to insurance and reinsurance contracts  accounted for under IFRS 17, Insurance contracts. This has included Premium  Allocation Approach (“PAA”) eligibility. As Niva Bupa writes policies with a coverage  period greater than 12 months, judgement is required to determine whether there  would be a material difference in applying the PAA or the General measurement model  (“GMM”).  We performed the following procedures related to the acquisition accounting: ■Understood and evaluated the processes and controls in place to determine the  judgements and estimates used in the acquisition accounting;  Assessed the appropriateness of management’s determination of control in  accordance with IFRS 10, Consolidated financial statements;  Tested the fair value of the previously held equity interest (used to calculate the  gain of £321m arising from the revaluation of the existing shareholding on obtaining  control) and the mathematical accuracy of the gain calculation. We also assessed  whether the gain calculation was accounted for in accordance with the requirements  of IAS 28;   For the fair value adjustments in respect of acquired insurance contract liabilities  and reinsurance assets, we considered whether they had been measured in  accordance with IFRS 17, assessed the appropriateness of the estimates used to  determine them by comparing them to past experience, and tested their  mathematical accuracy; Assessed the completeness of the intangible assets recognised on acquisition  through the purchase price allocation, which included evaluating the work  performed by management’s experts; Assessed the completeness of the accounting policy differences identified by  management and tested the calculation of those differences; and Evaluated the appropriateness of management’s PAA eligibility analysis and  conclusions for the Niva Bupa business, including the consideration of contract  durations, testing the completeness and accuracy of supporting data, evaluating  the reasonableness of expected scenarios and testing the accuracy of the models. ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ Based on the work performed and the evidence obtained, we consider the  acquisition accounting of Niva Bupa to be appropriate. Independent auditors’ report to the members of The British United Provident Association Limited continued 120 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 123 ===== Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Valuation of the  estimates of the  present value  of future cash  flows within the  liability for  incurred claims  (Insurance  contract  liabilities)  (Group) Refer to Audit  Committee  Report, and Note  12 (for accounting  policy and  financial  disclosures) Insurance contract liabilities comprise the liability for remaining coverage (“LFRC”) and  the liability for incurred claims (“LFIC”), which comprises the estimates of the present  value of future cash flows and the risk adjustment.  We have determined the estimates  of the present value of future cash flows to be an area of focus given its magnitude  and the judgement required in estimating the cash flows, in particular for incurred  claims. Estimates of the present value of future cash flows within the liability for incurred  claims £1,335m (2023: £1,313m) The estimates of the present value of future cash flows are based on certain key  assumptions relating to the frequency, severity and settlement patterns of insurance  claims.  Established actuarial techniques including the chain ladder, Bornhuetter-Ferguson and  pure risk cost methods are used to produce a best estimate of the present value of  future cash flows. Consideration is made for the claims inflation assumptions and  expected trends in medical costs and treatments. The frequency and severity of health insurance claims are typically highly predictable  with claims settled within a few months of a medical event that has led to a claim. Given the short-tailed nature of the settlement patterns, the key source of estimation  uncertainty is in relation to estimating the incurred claims for the most recent months  before 31 December 2024. The work performed to address the valuation of the estimates of future cash flows for  insurance contracts included the following procedures:  ■Understood and evaluated the processes and controls in place to determine the  estimates of future cash flows;  Tested the design and implementation of controls in place over the estimates of  future cash flows, including those covering the approval of assumptions, and the  completeness and accuracy of data used;  Using our actuarial specialist team members, we: Applied our industry knowledge and experience and compared the methodology,  models and assumptions used against recognised actuarial practices; Evaluated the key assumptions used in the estimates of future cash flows for  reasonableness compared to historic experience, including the impact of claims  inflation; Performed independent estimate calculations for 47% of the estimates of future  cash flows, comparing our estimates to those booked by management, and  investigated differences above a set threshold;  Evaluated the methodology and assumptions applied by management for a  further 30% of the estimates of future cash flows, including reperforming  management’s calculations and performing sensitivities to determine if the  assumptions used were reasonable; and  Performed key indicator testing for the remaining estimates to identify and  investigate any anomalies.  ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ Based on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, we consider the  valuation of the estimates of the present value of future cash flows within the liability  for incurred claims to be appropriate. Independent auditors’ report to the members of The British United Provident Association Limited continued 121 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 124 ===== Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Valuation of  freehold  property and  investment  property (Group) Refer to Audit  Committee  Report and Notes  4 and 5 (for  accounting policy  and financial  disclosures) The Group holds significant freehold property (see Note 4 Property, plant and  equipment) and investment property (see Note 5 Investment property). We consider  the valuation of freehold property and investment property as key areas of audit focus  given the magnitude and inherent uncertainty involved in these estimates.  Freehold properties Freehold properties of £2,085m (2023: £2,073m) comprise care homes, care villages,  clinics, hospitals and offices across a number of locations. The properties are held under the revaluation model and are subject to periodic, and at  least triennial, valuations performed by external independent valuation experts  performed in accordance with relevant industry guidelines. ■ The valuations are judgemental and involve estimation uncertainty. The significant  assumptions include occupancy levels, estimated net earnings on a normalised basis  and capitalisation rates. There is also judgement in the allocation of the fair value of the facility between its constituent parts, including the property.  Where an external valuation has not been obtained in the year, a Directors’ valuation  is conducted to determine if the carrying amount of the property remains appropriate  and does not differ materially from the fair value at the end of the year. At 31  December 2024 management obtained external valuations for £1,029m (2023: £55m)  of the total freehold property valuation, with the remaining balance being valued by  the Directors. Investment properties Investment properties of £756m (2023: £776m) relate predominantly to retirement  villages in New Zealand. The properties are leased to third parties to generate rental  income. The properties are held at fair value and subject to an independent external valuation  annually. The valuation is based on discounted cash flow projections and uses  subjective assumptions including the discount rate, capital growth rate and expected  rental yields.   For the valuation of freehold property and investment property, we performed the  following procedures:  ■Assessed the appropriateness of the valuation methodology applied and whether  this is in accordance with the requirements of the relevant standards;  Obtained the most recent external valuation reports and critically assessed the  qualifications and experience of the external valuers to determine whether they  have the knowledge required to perform the valuations;  For both external and Directors’ valuations of freehold property, we challenged the  key assumptions relating to estimated net earnings on a normalised basis, such as  occupancy rates, as well as capitalisation rates. For investment property, we  challenged the key assumptions relating to discounted cash flow projections, such  as discount rate, capital growth rate and expected rental yields. In critically  assessing the key assumptions, we utilised our own valuation experts and  considered external benchmarks; and  For Directors’ valuations, using internal valuation experts, we challenged  management’s inputs to the valuation models, with reference to the most recent  external valuation. ■ ■ Based on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, we consider the  valuation of freehold property and investment property to be appropriate. Independent auditors’ report to the members of The British United Provident Association Limited continued 122 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 125 ===== Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Impairment  of goodwill  or reversal  of previous  impairments to  other intangible  and tangible  assets (Group) Refer to Audit  Committee  Report and Note  3 (for accounting  policy and  financial  disclosures) Individual assets and Cash Generating Units (“CGU”) that have an indication of  impairment and all Goodwill amounts are tested annually for impairment. An  impairment review of a CGU covers all of its tangible assets, intangible assets and  attributable goodwill. Where the recoverable amount of an individual asset or CGU is  lower than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognised. Where there is any  indication that a previous impairment loss for an asset other than goodwill either no  longer exists or has decreased, the recoverable amount should be estimated and an  assessment performed of whether there should be a reversal of an impairment loss.  Estimating and discounting the cash flow projections used in the impairment  assessments requires significant judgement. The key assumptions include the discount  rate and the forecast cash flows, including the terminal growth rate.  We identified one CGU as having a higher risk of impairment (or impairment reversal),  namely Bupa Dental Care UK, and the valuation of the goodwill and intangible assets in  this CGU was an area of audit focus. As disclosed in Note 3 of the financial statements,  the carrying value of the goodwill relating to this CGU is £193m (2023: £191m) with  headroom in the goodwill impairment assessment of £56m (2023: £72m).  We performed the following procedures over management’s impairment assessment of  the Bupa Dental Care UK CGU:  Discount rates ■Used our valuation experts to assess the appropriateness of management’s  methodology for computing the Weighted Average Cost of Capital used for  discounting projected cash flows in the Value in Use calculation.  ■Used our valuation experts to independently determine a reasonable range for the  CGU discount rate, using external comparable market information where possible.  Assessed how the rate used by management compared to that range and the  sensitivity of rate changes to the overall impairment assessment.  Model integrity  ■Assessed the discounted cash flow models, including validating the numerical  accuracy of the models and the application of the discount rates. Cash flows  Agreed cash flow forecasts to internal supporting documentation, including  approved Business Plans.  Compared cash flow forecasts used in the review to historical performance and  challenged management where forecasts indicated performance that deviated  significantly from historical performance.  Challenged key assumptions in the cash flow projections, including available  clinician hours and the terminal growth rates applied, and obtained supporting  internal or external information.  Performed sensitivity analyses on the key assumptions.  ■ ■ ■ ■ Impairment reversal assessment ■Assessed whether the headroom identified represented an increase in the estimated  service potential of an asset indicating a reversal of a previous impairment loss. Disclosure  ■Assessed the appropriateness of the relevant disclosures to confirm compliance  with the applicable financial reporting standards.  Based on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, we consider that the  carrying value of goodwill in the Dental Care UK CGUs is reasonable, and there was not  sufficient evidence to support the reversal of the previously recorded impairment to  other intangible and tangible assets. Independent auditors’ report to the members of The British United Provident Association Limited continued 123 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 126 ===== Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Classification,  valuation and  disclosure of  certain liabilities  relating to Isapre  Cruz Blanca  (Bupa Chile)  (Group) Refer to the  Audit Committee  Report and  Notes 19 and 20  (for accounting  policy and  financial  disclosures) In 2022, the Supreme Court in Chile issued a ruling that required Isapres to use a  specific table of risk factors to determine insurance premiums, including  retrospectively. This ruling's impact on Bupa Chile depended on the approval of new  legislation and detailed application guidelines from the Chilean Superintendent of  Health (“SIS”). As a result of the uncertainty, in 2022 and 2023, management was  unable to form a reliable estimate, and a contingent liability was disclosed.  In May 2024 legislation was enacted, followed by implementation guidelines from the  SIS, which allowed a reliable estimate of the liability to be determined. A provision of  £215m was recognised based on the proposed repayment plan submitted to the  regulator. This estimate was based on expected payments over a 13-year period,  discounted at a Chilean risk-free rate.  On 8 October 2024, the SIS approved the Isapre’s proposed repayment plan. This  removed the uncertainty in relation to the amounts to be paid and therefore the  provision was released and a financial liability was recognised within Trade and other  payables. As at 31 December 2024, the financial liability is £181m, reflecting the  payments in the approved repayment plan, discounted at a market rate of 4.245%.  Given this matter involved a significant level of judgment in the prior year, and the  resulting liability is material to both the financial statements and management’s  explanation of the result for the year, the classification and valuation of the liability and  its disclosure were an area of focus for our audit. To address the classification, valuation and disclosure of the liability we performed the  following procedures:  Classification and valuation of the initial provision ■Reviewed the legislation enacted by the Chilean government and the regulatory  announcements from the SIS to assess whether a reliable estimate could be formed  and a provision subsequently recognised. Assessed the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the calculation of the  provision, comparing it to the terms of the original submitted payment plan and  underlying books and records. Using internal valuation experts, we evaluated the appropriateness of the discount  rate used to discount the expected cash flows by comparing it to our expected risk- free rate for Chile. ■ ■ Subsequent classification and valuation of the financial liability ■Assessed the appropriateness of the reclassification of the provision to a financial  liability following the approval of the payment plan. Assessed the data used in the calculation of the financial liability, comparing it to the  terms of the approved payment plan and underlying books and records. Using internal valuation experts, evaluated the appropriateness of the discount rate  used to discount the financial liability. Independently determined a reasonable range  for the discount rate, using external comparable market information where possible,  and assessed how the rate used by management compared to that range. ■ ■ Disclosures ■Assessed the appropriateness of the relevant disclosures within the notes to the  financial statements to confirm compliance with the applicable financial reporting  standards. Based on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, we consider the  classification, valuation and disclosure of the matter to be appropriate. Valuation of  defined benefit  pension  obligation  (Company) Refer to Audit  Committee  Report and Note  7 and Note D (for  accounting policy  and financial  disclosures). The Company operates several defined benefit funded pension schemes. The present  value of the funded obligations is £1,032m (2023: £1,125m) with net assets recognised  of £331m (2023: £381m). The most significant scheme is The Bupa Pension Scheme which closed to future  accrual as of 31 December 2020. The estimate of the defined benefit pension  obligations is inherently uncertain and requires expert judgement. External expert actuarial advice has been used in setting the key assumptions for the  IAS 19 valuation, including the mortality, rates of inflation, salary increases and discount rate assumptions. Small changes in these assumptions can have a significant impact on  the defined benefit pension obligations and the Company’s net pension surplus.   For the valuation of defined benefit pension obligations, we performed the  following procedures:  ■Assessed the qualifications and experience of the external actuary to determine if  they have the knowledge and experience required to perform the valuation of the  defined benefit pension schemes; and ■Challenged the key assumptions, including mortality, rates of inflation, salary  increases and discount rates. In critically assessing the key assumptions, we have  utilised our own pension valuation experts and considered benchmarking against  available market data. Based on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, we consider the  valuation of the defined benefit pension obligations to be appropriate. Independent auditors’ report to the members of The British United Provident Association Limited continued 124 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 127 ===== How we tailored the audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give  an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group  and the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they  operate. For the Group audit we defined a component as being a single reporting pack, or collection of  subledgers, within the Group's consolidation process. We brought components into scope based  on the output of our risk assessment and our understanding of the Group to identify those  components that are significant due to size or risk and other non-significant components with  large balances to obtain sufficient coverage to reduce the risk of material misstatement to an  appropriate level. We selected 24 components to be in scope as they were significant due to size or risk. We determined to perform additional procedures on certain balances and transactions in a  further 7 non-significant components to provide sufficient and appropriate audit coverage over  individual financial statement line items. The components where we performed audit procedures included some operating in each of the  Group's Market Units and covered 81% of Group Revenue, 82% of Group profit before taxation  expense and 70% of Group Total assets. We also performed audit procedures over the Group Centre functions, including the  consolidation process and certain payroll processes. We performed targeted risk assessment procedures over the remaining components. As the Group audit team, we determined the level of involvement required at those components  to be able to conclude whether sufficient and appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a  basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole. In our role as Group  Auditors our oversight of the work performed by auditors of the components included  performing the following procedures: ■Issued group instructions outlining areas requiring additional audit focus, including the key  audit matters included above; Maintained an active dialogue with reporting component audit teams throughout the year,  including in-person site visits with a number of teams; Reviewed reporting requested from component teams, including on areas determined to be of  heightened audit risk; and Reviewed component team detailed working papers, where relevant. We have performed a  detailed review of key audit working papers at all in-scope components through a mixture of  remote working and site visits. ■ ■ ■ For the company audit, the output of our risk assessment identified one component of relative  financial significance being the holding company operations. The impact of climate risk on our audit As part of our audit we made enquiries of management to understand the process management  adopted to assess the extent of the potential impact of climate risk on the Group's financial  statements. In addition to enquiries with management, we also understood the governance  processes in place to assess climate risk, read internal management reporting on climate risks  and read additional external reporting by the entity on climate, including sustainability  publications. We have also made enquiries to understand, and performed a risk assessment in respect of, the  commitments made by the Group and how these may affect the financial statements and the  audit procedures that we perform. We have assessed the risks of material misstatement to the  financial statements as a result of climate change and concluded that for the year ended 31  December 2024, the main audit risks are related to consistency of disclosures included within the  Annual Report and 'other information' including the Task Force on Climate-related Financial  disclosure (“TCFD”) report, as well as the Delivering Sustainability and ESG, Risk and Board  Sustainability Committee reports. Our procedures did not identify any material impact in the context of our audit of the financial  statements as a whole, or our key audit matters for the year ended 31 December 2024. Independent auditors’ report to the members of The British United Provident Association Limited continued 125 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 128 ===== Materiality The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain  quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us  to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on  the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of  misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a  whole as follows: Financial statements - Group Financial statements - Company Overall  materiality £42.5 million (FY23: £40.3 million). £9.3 million  (FY23: £9.3 million). How we  determined it 5% of Profit before taxation  expense adjusted for certain non- recurring items 1% of Total Assets Rationale for  benchmark  applied In determining our materiality, we have  considered the financial metrics which we  believed to be relevant, and concluded that  Group Profit before taxation expense adjusted  for certain non-recurring items, notably the  impact of the recognition of the liability relating  to Bupa Chile and the fair value gain on  acquisition of Niva Bupa, was the most  appropriate benchmark. This is because the  Group is profit-orientated, but the non-recurring  items have significantly distorted the result of  the Group. We consider that the resulting  materiality level is appropriate for the size and  complexity of the Group and relevant to the  users of the financial statements. We have  substantively tested the non-recurring items  excluded to a lower materiality level. In determining our  materiality, we considered  the financial metrics which  we believed to be relevant  and concluded that Total  assets was the most  appropriate benchmark.  The primary purpose of  the Company is as a  holding company. For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than  our overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was £4.0  million to £24.0 million. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality  that was also less than our overall group materiality. We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the  aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality.  Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature  and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for  example in determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% (FY23: 75%) of  overall materiality, amounting to £31.9 million (FY23: £30.2 million) for the Group financial  statements and £7.0 million (FY23: £7.0 million) for the Company financial statements. In determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors - the history of  misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls - and  concluded that an amount in the middle of our normal range was appropriate. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified  during our audit above £1.5 million (Group audit) (FY23: £1.2 million) and £0.5 million (Company  audit) (FY23: £0.5 million) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view,  warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. Conclusions relating to going concern Our evaluation of the Directors’ assessment of the Group's and the Company’s ability to continue  to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included: ■Obtaining the Directors' going concern assessment and challenging the rationale for downside  scenarios adopted and material assumptions made using our knowledge of the Group's  business performance, review of regulatory correspondence and obtaining further  corroborating evidence; Considering management's assessment of the Group's regulatory solvency coverage and  liquidity position in the forward-looking scenarios considered; Assessing the impact of severe, but plausible downside scenarios; Assessing the liquidity of the Group and Company, including the Group's ability to pay  customers, suppliers and creditors as amounts fall due; Assessing the ability of the Group to comply with covenants; Enquiring and understanding the actions taken by management to mitigate any significant  risks facing the business, including attendance at Group Audit Committee and Group Risk  Committee meetings; and Reviewing the disclosures included in the financial statements in relation to going concern,  including the Basis of Preparation. ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ Independent auditors’ report to the members of The British United Provident Association Limited continued 126 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 129 ===== Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating  to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the  Group's and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve  months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue. In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going  concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a  guarantee as to the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. In relation to the Directors’ reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance  Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors’  statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to  adopt the going concern basis of accounting. Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect to going concern are  described in the relevant sections of this report. Reporting on other information The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the  financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other  information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and,  accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly  stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other  information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent  with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be  materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement,  we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement  of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the  work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other  information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these  responsibilities. With respect to the Strategic Report and Report of the Directors, we also considered whether  the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included. Based on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 requires us  also to report certain opinions and matters as described below. Strategic Report and Report of the Directors      In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in  the Strategic Report and Report of the Directors for the year ended 31 December 2024 is  consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable  legal requirements. In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment  obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the  Strategic Report and Report of the Directors. Corporate governance statement ISAs (UK) require us to review the Directors’ statements in relation to going concern, longer- term viability and that part of the corporate governance statement relating to the company’s  compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, which the Company has  voluntarily adopted as though it was subject to the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct  Authority. Our additional responsibilities with respect to the corporate governance statement as  other information are described in the Reporting on other information section of this report. Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following  elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent with the financial  statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit, and we have nothing material to add  or draw attention to in relation to: ■The Directors’ confirmation that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging  and principal risks; The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those principal risks, what procedures are  in place to identify emerging risks and an explanation of how these are being managed or  mitigated; The Directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it  appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their  identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue to  do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial  statements; The Directors’ explanation as to their assessment of the Group's and Company’s prospects, the  period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate; and The Directors’ statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Company  will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of  its assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary  qualifications or assumptions. ■ ■ ■ ■ Independent auditors’ report to the members of The British United Provident Association Limited continued 127 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 130 ===== Our review of the Directors’ statement regarding the longer-term viability of the Group and  Company was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries  and considering the Directors’ process supporting their statement; checking that the statement  is in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code; and  considering whether the statement is consistent with the financial statements and our  knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the  course of the audit. In addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of  the following elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent with the  financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit: ■The Directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair,  balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to  assess the Group’s and Company's position, performance, business model and strategy; The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk  management and internal control systems; and The section of the Annual Report describing the work of the audit committee. ■ ■ We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when the Directors’  statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a  departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified under the Listing Rules for review by  the auditors. Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors' responsibilities, the Directors are  responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable  framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The Directors are also  responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation  of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and  the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related  to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either  intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic  alternative but to do so. Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a  whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an  auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but  is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a  material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are  considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to  influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We  design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material  misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures  are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below. Based on our understanding of the Group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of  non-compliance with laws and regulations related to certain Group activities where non- compliance with the related laws and regulations could result in fines or litigation, or loss of the  Group's licence to operate. We consider the areas most likely to have such an effect would be in  relation to financial conduct regulation, healthcare provision conduct regulation and regulatory  capital and liquidity requirements. In addition, risks arise from the Group's required compliance  with related taxation legislation (including VAT and payroll taxes) and pension legislation, and  we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial  statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the  financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006. We evaluated management’s incentives  and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of  override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to management bias in  accounting estimates and judgemental areas of the financial statements, including those shown  in our Key Audit Matters, and the override of controls including the posting of inappropriate  journal entries. The group engagement team shared this risk assessment with the component  auditors so that they could include appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in  their work. Audit procedures performed by the group engagement team and/or component  auditors included: ■Discussions with the Board, management, Internal Audit, senior management involved in the  Risk and Compliance functions and the Group and Company's legal function, including  consideration of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulation  and fraud; Evaluation and testing of the operating effectiveness of management's controls designed to  prevent and detect irregularities; ■ Independent auditors’ report to the members of The British United Provident Association Limited continued 128 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 131 ===== ■Assessment of matters reported on the Group and Company's whistleblowing helpline and  fraud register and the results of management's investigation of such matters; Reviewing relevant meeting minutes including those of the Board of Directors, Remuneration  and Disclosure Committees and attending Audit Committee and Risk Committee meetings; Identifying and testing journal entries based on risk criteria; Designing audit procedures to incorporate unpredictability around the nature, timing or extent  of our testing; Testing transactions entered into outside of the normal course of the Group and Company's  business; and Reviewing the Group's register of litigation and claims, Internal Audit reports, and Group Chief  Risk Officer's Reports in so far as they related to non-compliance with laws and regulations  and fraud. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to  become aware of instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely  related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not  detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one  resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or  intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ Our audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and  balances, possibly using data auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a  limited number of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will often seek  to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk characteristics. In other cases, we  will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the  sample is selected. A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on  the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our  auditors’ report. Use of this report This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members  as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other  purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other  purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come  save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. Other required reporting Companies Act 2006 exception reporting Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: ■we have not obtained all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our  audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or the Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and  returns. ■ ■ ■ We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. Other voluntary reporting Directors’ remuneration The Company voluntarily prepares a Directors' Remuneration Report in accordance with the  provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The Directors requested that we audit the part of the  Directors' Remuneration Report specified by the Companies Act 2006 to be audited as if the  company were a quoted company. In our opinion, the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly  prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

1-27 form part of these consolidated financial statements. Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity continued for the year ended 31 December 2024 135 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 138 ===== Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended 31 December 2024 Note 1: Basis of preparation Basis of preparation in brief This section describes the significant accounting policies and accounting estimates  and judgements that relate to the financial statements and notes as a whole. Where  accounting policies relate to a specific note, the applicable accounting policies and  estimates are contained within the note. 1.1   Basis of preparation  The British United Provident Association Limited (‘Bupa’ or the ‘Company’), a company  limited by guarantee and incorporated in England and Wales and domiciled in the United  Kingdom, together with its subsidiaries (collectively the ‘Group’) is an international  healthcare business, providing health insurance, treatment in clinics, dental centres and  hospitals, and operating care homes. The Company is the ultimate parent entity of the  Group. Both the Company Financial Statements and the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements  have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards,  in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 5 March 2025. The  Group’s accounting policies have been applied consistently to all the years presented, and  updated for the application of new and amended accounting standards as set out in Note 1.5. The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost  convention, modified by the revaluation of property, investment property, and financial  investments at fair value, and the application of IAS 29 to balances in hyperinflationary  economies. The presentation of line items within the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is  broadly in order of liquidity. Current assets and liabilities disclosed in the notes to the  Consolidated Financial Statements are those expected to be recovered or settled in less  than one year. 1.2   Basis of consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 comprise  those of the Company and its subsidiaries, and the share of results of equity-accounted  investments. Subsidiaries are those entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an  entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the  entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The  Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances when determining whether control  exists and makes a reassessment whenever those facts and circumstances change. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial  Statements from the date that control commences to the date that control ceases.  Accounting policies of subsidiaries are aligned on acquisition to ensure consistency with  Group policies. Intra-group transactions and outstanding balances are eliminated in the  preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Group applies the purchase method in accounting for business combinations. The Group  recognises identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at fair value, and any  non-controlling interests in the acquiree. Non-controlling interests in the net assets of  subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity. Non-controlling interests  consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original acquisition and the  non-controlling shareholders’ share of changes in equity since this date.  Functional currencies are identified at a statutory entity level. These vary across the Group  and include sterling, Australian dollar, euro, Indian rupee, New Zealand dollar and US dollar.  Each Group entity translates its results and financial position into the Group’s presentational  currency, sterling. Unless otherwise noted, the amounts shown in the Consolidated Financial  Statements are in millions of pounds sterling (£m). 136 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 139 ===== 1.3   Accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported assets, liabilities, income and expenses. It also requires  management to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or where estimates are significant to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are set out below. Changes in these estimates could  lead to a material adjustment to the carrying value of the assets and liabilities in the next financial year. Further detail is in the related notes. Area Details Note Goodwill and  intangible  assets Goodwill and intangible assets are recognised on acquired businesses based on fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment  on an annual basis, or more frequently when there are indicators of impairment. Other intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indicators of impairment. Sources of estimation uncertainty Impairment tests include a number of sources of estimation uncertainty as the key assumptions used when modelling the recoverable amount require estimating the discount rate, terminal growth  rate and the forecast cash flows. Estimation uncertainties within these cash flows vary by cash-generating unit (CGU). For provision business these include number of customers, available clinician  hours, fee rates and operating expenses; and for insurance business, future insurance premium rises, claims volatility and claims inflation.  Accounting judgements Judgement has been applied to determine whether there are indications of impairment to definite life intangible assets or an indication that impairment should be reversed for intangible assets. In  making this judgement, the Group has considered current trading and future plans associated with each of the assets, along with external market factors, in order to assess whether a full  impairment assessment is required for impairments or reversal of impairments. 3 Property  valuations The Group has a significant portfolio of care home, hospital and office properties. These are subject to periodic and at least triennial valuations performed by external independent valuers, with  directors’ valuations performed in intervening years. In addition, the Group has a significant portfolio of investment properties, primarily retirement villages in New Zealand. These properties are  revalued annually. Sources of estimation uncertainty Key assumptions for freehold property are normalised earnings, average occupancy and capitalisation rates, whereas for investment property key assumptions are discount and capital growth  rates.  Accounting judgements In valuing care home property, a judgement is made on the highest and best use of the property. In the majority of cases this leads to the property being valued as part of a group of assets making  up a going concern business using market-based assumptions. The business is valued on a fair maintainable trade basis with the fair value thus calculated being allocated to plant and equipment  and bed licences where applicable at net book value (as a proxy for fair value), with the residual value being allocated to property. 4,5 Defined  benefit  pension  obligations The Group’s principal defined benefit scheme is in the UK, The Bupa Pension Scheme. The scheme closed to future accrual as at 31 December 2020, although members retain any ongoing salary  link, with future benefits payable dependent upon member salary at the date of leaving or retirement.  Sources of estimation uncertainty External actuarial advice has been taken in setting the key assumptions used in the valuation of the defined benefit pension obligations, which are the discount rate, rates of inflation, salary  increases and mortality. As defined benefit schemes are long-term in nature these assumptions can be subject to uncertainty. In particular, inflation assumptions are term dependent and, due to  the high inflationary environment, will reflect higher inflation expectations in the near term followed by an assumed fall back to more average rates over the longer term. 7 Insurance  contracts Accounting judgements Premium allocation approach (PAA) The Group exercises judgement in determining whether the PAA eligibility criteria are met at initial recognition. For a small number of insurance contracts, which have a coverage period that is  greater than 12 months, the Group elects to apply the PAA, if at the inception of the contract the Group reasonably expects that it will provide a liability for remaining coverage (LFRC) that would  not differ materially from the General Measurement Model (GMM). Sources of estimation uncertainty Best estimate of claims provisioning Estimates included in the insurance contract liabilities include expected claims payments and expenses required to settle existing insurance contract obligations. The key assumptions used in the  calculation of the liability for incurred claims (LFIC) include claims development, claims costs inflation, medical trends and seasonality. Uncertainty exists particularly in relation to estimating the frequency and severity of incurred claims for the most recent months prior to the year end. 12 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 137 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 140 ===== Area Details Note Niva Bupa  acquisition The Group has acquired a controlling interest in Niva Bupa on 8 January 2024. The transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method where identifiable assets and liabilities  acquired have been measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. Accounting judgements The identification and valuation of intangible assets arising on business combinations is subject to a degree of judgement. We have engaged an independent third party to assist with the  identification and valuation process. A customer relationship intangible has been recognised and valued based on the present value of the marginal profit from renewals of existing customers. This  will be amortised over 12 years. 23 Provisions  and  contingent  liabilities The Group has circumstances arising in the ordinary course of business, including losses which might arise from litigation, disputes, and interpretation of tax law or local regulations. Judgement is  exercised in determining whether the circumstances should give rise to the recognition of provisions or contingent liabilities. In the case of material contingent liabilities further judgement is  required in arriving at appropriate disclosure of such matters.  Accounting judgements In 2023, significant judgement was applied in assessing whether a contingent liability or provision existed as a result of the ruling issued by the Supreme Court in Chile that obliges Isapres to make  use of a specific table of risk factors. This uncertainty has resolved in 2024. 19 1.4   Going concern Following a detailed assessment of the Group’s going concern status based on its current  position and forecast results, along with scenario-based stress testing and reverse stress  testing, the Directors have concluded that the Group has adequate resources to operate for  at least the next 12 months from the approval of these financial statements. This assessment  considered forecast and reasonably possible adverse changes to the Group’s liquidity,  regulatory solvency, access to funding and trading profitability over the next 12 months. The assessment identified the risks and uncertainties most likely to impact the Group and  considered the impact to the Group’s businesses under a number of reasonably plausible  severe scenarios as well as consideration of contingent liabilities.  Our most severe reasonably possible scenarios considered worsening geopolitical conflicts  and the potential knock-on impacts on global growth and economic conditions leading to  a global economic recession in 2025, and a variety of local scenarios developed by each  business unit, with the majority focusing on climate change, stroke of pen and/or  affordability pressures. Under these scenarios, although significant short-term reductions in  profitability arise, the Group would continue to operate over the next 12 months and would  remain within its risk appetites for liquidity and regulatory solvency. Management actions  would allow downside impacts to be mitigated, and risk appetites controlled, by reducing  expenditure, obtaining additional funding or divesting investments or businesses. Within its  liquidity resources, the Group makes use of a £900m revolving credit facility (‘RCF’) as  described in Note 17(c). The Group expects to remain compliant with the RCF’s covenants  under stressed scenarios and may further draw down on the RCF in order to meet liquidity  needs. Details of the Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future  development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1-62.  The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities  are described in the Group CFO’s Review on pages 17-19. The Directors’ assessment of the  Group’s longer-term viability over a three-year period is described on page 115. 1.5   Restatements and changes in accounting policies Except where noted in (a)-(b) below, the Group has consistently applied its accounting  policies to all periods presented in these Consolidated Financial Statements. (a) Non-current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to IAS 1) The Group has adopted Non-current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to IAS 1) from  1 January 2024. The amendments clarify that the need to comply with covenants beyond the  reporting date does not prevent a liability from being classified as non-current. Entities must  disclose any such liability balances along with the presence and nature of relevant covenants  and additionally disclose if the covenants are likely to be breached within the following  twelve months. As a result of adopting these amendments the Group would reclassify  drawings on its revolving credit facility from current liabilities to non-current liabilities.  However as the revolving credit facility was undrawn at 31 December 2023 no restatement  has been made. Additional disclosures required by these amendments have been included  in Note 17(c) in respect of the revolving credit facility. (b) Other A number of other amended standards and interpretations became applicable for the  current reporting period. The Group did not have to change its accounting policies or  make retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these amendments. 1.6   Forthcoming financial reporting requirements A number of financial reporting standards, amendments and interpretations have been  issued but are not effective for the year ended 31 December 2024 and have not been early  adopted by the Group. These include: (a) IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements In April 2024 the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued IFRS 18  Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements. IFRS 18 will supersede IAS 1  Presentation of Financial Statements, providing general presentation requirements for  financial statements prepared in line with IFRS accounting standards. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 138 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 141 ===== The standard requires new subtotals in the income statement, including operating profit.  Entities must provide disclosures about management-defined performance measures. The  standard also provides additional guidance on the aggregation and disaggregation of data  in financial statements. IFRS 18 is effective for the Group from 1 January 2027, subject to endorsement in the UK,  which has not yet taken place. The application of this standard is currently being evaluated  by the Group. The standard is expected to impact presentation and disclosure, but have no  impact on recognition and measurement. (b) IFRS 19 Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures In May 2024 the IASB issued IFRS 19 Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures.  IFRS 19 will be available to subsidiary entities applying IFRS that are not publicly  accountable and whose parent prepares publicly-available consolidated financial statements  that comply with IFRS.  IFRS 19 provides reduced disclosure requirements, replacing the disclosure requirements  of other IFRS accounting standards, but does not change recognition and measurement  requirements.  Eligible UK entities may apply IFRS 19 from 1 January 2027, subject to endorsement in the  UK, which has not yet taken place. As the Group is not an eligible subsidiary, it will not apply  IFRS 19, and the standard will have no impact. (c) Amendments to the Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments— Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 In May 2024 the IASB issued Amendments to the Classification and Measurement of  Financial Instruments—Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7. The amendments clarify the date on which a financial asset or financial liability settled  through an electronic payment system is derecognised. An accounting policy option is  available to derecognise a financial liability before cash is delivered on the settlement date  if specified criteria are met. The amendments also provide clarifications on the classification  for certain financial assets, such as those with environmental, social and corporate  governance and similar features, and amend certain disclosure requirements. The amendments are effective for the Group from 1 January 2026, subject to endorsement  in the UK, which has not yet taken place. The application of these amendments is currently  being evaluated by the Group. (d) Contracts Referencing Nature-dependent Electricity—Amendments to IFRS 9  and IFRS 7 In December 2024 the IASB issued Contracts Referencing Nature-dependent Electricity— Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7. These amendments provide requirements for contracts such as power purchase agreements  (‘PPAs’) that expose an entity to variability arising from natural conditions, such as weather,  that impact the generation of electricity. For such contracts, the amendments clarify the  application of the IFRS 9 ‘own use’ scope exemption, allow a variable portion to be  designated as part of a hedging relationship, and add additional disclosure requirements.  The amendments are effective for the Group from 1 January 2026, subject to endorsement  in the UK, which has not yet taken place. The application of these amendments is currently  being evaluated by the Group. (e) Other A number of other amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued and are  not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2024. None of these are expected to have  a material impact on the Group.  1.7   IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies Türkiye is a hyperinflationary economy and IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary  Economies has been applied from June 2022 onwards. As a consequence, the results and  balances for the Group's Turkish operations have been adjusted for changes in the general  purchasing power of the Turkish lira. In order to make this adjustment the Group refers to  the CPI index published by the Turkish Statistical Institute. The value of CPI at 31 December  2024 was 2,684.47 (2023: 1,859.40) and the movement in CPI for the year ended  31 December 2024 was 825 (2023: 731), an increase of 44.4% (2023: 64.8%). A loss of £16m (2023: £18m) arising from the devaluation of net monetary assets has been  recognised within net financial expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. This includes  the impact of indexing amounts in the Consolidated Income Statement for the application of  IAS 29, with the net impact reducing profit before tax by £12m (2023: £10m) for the year.  All Turkish lira amounts are translated to the Group's presentation currency of sterling, using  the closing exchange rate in effect on 31 December 2024 of 44.26 (2023: 37.66). The impact  of this adjustment is recorded within other foreign exchange translation differences in the  Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and within the foreign exchange  translation reserve in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The Group  recognises the remaining exchange difference arising on consolidation within other foreign  exchange translation differences through other comprehensive income in the foreign  exchange translation reserve. 1.8   Events occurring after the reporting period The sale of the legacy portfolio of individual health contracts in Brazil, which was held for  sale at 31 December 2024 (see Note 15), completed in February 2025. This resulted in the  recognition of a post-taxation profit of £14m. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 139 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 142 ===== Note 2: Operating segments Operating segments in brief The organisational structure of the Group is managed through three Market Units based  on geographic locations and customers: Bupa Asia Pacific; Europe and Latin America;  and Bupa Global, India and UK.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 140 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 143 ===== A key performance measure of operating segments utilised by the Group is underlying  profit. Underlying profit is used to distinguish business performance from other constituents  of the IFRS reported profit before taxation not directly related to the trading performance  of the business. Underlying profit The following items are excluded from underlying profit: ■Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill arising on business combinations – these  impairments are considered to be one-off and not reflective of the in-year trading  performance of the business. Short-term fluctuations on investment return – underlying profit is based on an expected  long-term investment return over the period for return-seeking financial assets. Any  variance between the total investment return (including realised and unrealised gains) and  the expected return over the period is disclosed separately outside underlying profit, in  short-term fluctuations. These fluctuations are not considered to be directly related to  underlying trading performance. Net gains/losses on disposal of businesses and transaction costs on business combinations  – gains/losses on disposal of businesses that are material and one-off in nature to the  reportable segment are not considered part of the continuing business. Transaction costs  that relate to material acquisitions or disposals are not related to the ongoing trading  performance of the business. Net property revaluation gains/losses – short-term fluctuations which do not reflect  underlying trading performance. This includes deficit on the revaluation of freehold  properties and property impairment losses. ■ ■ ■ ■Realised and unrealised foreign exchange gains/losses – fluctuations outside of  management control, which do not reflect underlying trading performance. This includes  the net impact of applying hyperinflationary accounting. Amortisation of bed licences – following the Australian Government's announcement of  the deregulation of bed licences from 1 July 2024, their amortisation term was reviewed  and updated from having an indefinite useful life to amortising over the period to 1 July  2024. In May 2024, the Australian Government announced that the deregulation would be  delayed until 1 July 2025. In November 2024, the remaining bed license were impaired as  part of external care home valuation process. The impact of the amortisation of bed  licences is not considered reflective of the trading performance of the business.

This  includes insurance revenues, offset by directly attributable insurance service expenses. Insurance revenue The Group recognises insurance revenue based on the passage of time over the coverage  period of the group of contracts. Insurance service expenses   Insurance service expenses comprise expenses directly attributable to fulfilling a group of  insurance contracts. Judgement is exercised in determining which expenses are directly  attributable to insurance contracts, and therefore included within insurance service  expenses. The Group classifies the majority of expenses incurred by insurance entities within  insurance service expenses, except for those not directly attributable to insurance contracts. Insurance claims are amounts payable under insurance contracts arising from the occurrence  of an insured claims episode. A claims episode is an insured medical service that the Group  has an obligation to fund, which could be consultation fees, diagnostic investigations,  hospitalisation or treatment costs. Incurred claims comprise insurance claims paid during the year together with related claims  handling costs, the movement in the gross provision for claims in the period and the Risk  Equalisation Special Account levy for the Australia Health Insurance business. Private health  insurers in Australia provide private health insurance cover through a community rated  scheme. To avoid adverse selection and ensure that the Australian private health insurance  scheme is sustainable, a risk equalisation mechanism operates to subsidise insurers with  higher risk policyholders. See Note 12 for details of the LFIC. Insurance acquisition cash flows arise from the costs of selling, underwriting and starting  a group of insurance contracts that are directly attributable to the portfolio of insurance  contracts to which the group belongs. The Group’s policy is to expense acquisition costs as  they are incurred where the coverage period of each contract in the group is no more than  one year. For the remaining contracts with a longer coverage period, insurance acquisition  costs are allocated to the relevant group of insurance contracts and are amortised  consistently with the pattern of insurance revenue recognition.  Changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk are presented in the insurance service  result and not disaggregated into an insurance service component and an insurance finance  component.

Revenue stream Recognition policy Care, health and  other customer  contract revenue The Group generates income from the operation of its care homes, hospitals, dental centres and other healthcare and wellbeing centres. In instances where Bupa is acting as an  agent and another party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the contract, revenue is recognised on a net basis. When considering whether the Group is acting as an agent or as  a principal, factors such as which party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the obligation, bears the inventory and credit risk and has discretion in establishing prices are  considered.  These revenue streams typically relate to short-term services that have fixed, rather than variable, transaction prices and there are no significant judgements required when  considering the time pattern of revenue recognition. Payment terms vary from on completion of the service, to payments made monthly in advance. Bupa has the right to bill  and receive payment for services rendered to date. Contracts for these revenue streams do not transfer significant insurance risk. The Sanitas Hospitales and New Services revenue stream includes one public hospital in Spain that is operated under a separate service concession arrangement granted by the  local government (the grantor). This concession arrangement ended during 2024. Revenue is recognised from the construction of infrastructure and from the operation of the  hospital. Construction revenues are recognised in line with the stage of completion of the work performed. Operational revenues are recognised in the period in which the  services are provided, based on the average operating margin for the life of the contract. As revenue is based on an expected margin, with some potential variability, revenue is  only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable a significant reversal will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Significant changes in margin result in a  retrospective margin recalculation. The impact of this on prior years is recognised as a margin catch up in the year the recalculation is performed.  Other customer contract revenue includes contracts entered into by the Group’s insurance entities that do not result in the transfer of significant insurance risk to the Group and  are accounted for as service contracts. These contracts mainly relate to the administration of claims funds on behalf of corporate customers. Revenues from service contracts  are recognised as the services are provided. Some of these contracts contain financial liabilities representing deposits repayable to the customer. These are measured at  amortised cost. Other revenue Other revenue comprises: Rental income and amenities fees from occupational right agreements, which are recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the arrangement. Imputed interest on interest-free refundable accommodation deposits (RADs) in respect of payments for aged care units in Bupa Villages and Aged Care Australia. Revenue  is recognised for the imputed interest on RADs, reflecting the Group's position as lessor. Use of the Maximum Permissible Interest Rate (MPIR) is considered most  appropriate to determine the imputed revenue and interest amounts. The MPIR is a rate set by the Australian Government and is used to calculate the Daily Accommodation  Payment to applicable residents.  Government funding received in response to COVID-19, most notably in Bupa Villages and Aged Care Australia. Such funding is recognised when it is considered reasonably  certain that the funding will be received and all necessary conditions have been complied with. ■ ■ ■ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 148 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 151 ===== Revenue for the year has been analysed at Business Unit level, reflecting the nature of services provided by geography that is reported internally to management.

Financial income Interest income is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, using the effective  interest method. Changes in the value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are recognised  within financial income as unrealised gains or losses while the assets are held. Upon  derecognition of an asset, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss is reversed and a realised  gain or loss is recognised. Changes in the value of debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income  are recognised in other comprehensive income as an unrealised gain or loss. The cumulative  gain or loss recognised in the income and expenditure reserve is reclassified to realised gain  or loss in the Consolidated Income Statement when the financial asset is derecognised. 2024  £m  2023  £m  Interest income: Investments at fair value through profit or loss 79  48  Investments at fair value through other comprehensive income 69  20  Investments at amortised cost 325  225  Net realised gain/(loss): Net realised gain on investments at fair value through profit or  loss 3  16  Net realised loss on financial investments at fair value through  other comprehensive income (3)  (4)  Net movement in fair value: Changes in share purchase liability¹ (15)  –  Investments at fair value through profit or loss 19  44  Net foreign exchange translation gain 32  14  Total financial income 509  363                                      1.

Discounting of insurance contracts is only applied by exception.  The net financial expense from insurance contracts issued includes £86m of interest expense  and £16m of interest income (2023: £25m interest expense and £nil interest income). There is an option to disaggregate any insurance financial income or expense between other  comprehensive income and the income statement. Bupa has elected to recognise all  insurance financial expense within the Consolidated Income Statement.  Note 2.6: Taxation expense   Taxation expense in brief Taxation expense comprises current and deferred taxation. It considers foreign taxation  and double taxation relief and includes adjustments in respect of prior periods. Income taxation is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement except to the extent  that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income, in which case it is  recognised directly in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. The Group has  determined that any global minimum top-up tax – which it is required to pay under Pillar  Two legislation – is an income tax within the scope of IAS 12. (i)   Recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement Current taxation is the expected taxation payable on the taxable profit for the year, using  taxation rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustments  to taxation payable in respect of previous years. The Group is subject to taxation audits in the territories in which it operates and considers  each issue on its merits when deciding whether to hold a provision against the potential tax  liability that may arise. However, the amount that is ultimately paid could differ from the  amount initially recorded and this difference is recognised in the period in which such a  determination is made. 2024  £m  2023  £m  Current taxation expense UK taxation on income for the year 18  12  UK taxation adjustments in respect of prior periods 11  5  Total UK current taxation expense 29  17  Double taxation relief (15)  (10)  Foreign taxation on income for the year 273  153  Foreign taxation adjustments in respect of prior years (4)  (6)  Total foreign current taxation expense 269  147  Total current taxation expense 283  154  Deferred taxation (income)/expense Origination and reversal of temporary differences (77)  (6)  Adjustments in respect of prior periods 6  (8)  Total deferred taxation income (71)  (14)  Taxation expense 212  140                                                  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 153 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 156 ===== (ii)   Reconciliation of effective taxation rate 2024  £m  2023  £m  Profit before taxation expense 972  564  UK corporation taxation rate 25% 23.5% Tax at the UK corporation taxation rate 243  133  Effects of recurring taxation reconciliation items: Different taxation rates in foreign jurisdictions (15)  5  Deductions not allowable for taxation purposes 40  24  Income not taxable or taxable at concessionary rates (36)  (25)  Property revaluation not included as a temporary difference  (8)  (8)  Results of associates (23)  (20)  Movement in deferred taxation asset not recognised¹ 58  31  16  7  Effects of non-recurring taxation reconciliation items: Taxation adjustments in respect of prior periods 13  (9)  Loss on disposal of business 6  2  Non-deductible IAS 29 adjustments² 11  7  Fair value gain on acquisition of Niva Bupa³ (52)  –  Pension surplus deferred taxation liability revaluation⁴ (47)  –  Non-residential buildings tax depreciation removal⁵ 22  –  (47)  –  Taxation expense at the effective rate of 22% (2023: 25%) 212  140                                                                        1. £50m of the unrecognised deferred taxation asset movement relates to taxable losses arising from the  recognition of a financial liability for a policyholder payment plan in Chile.

(iv)   Global minimum top-up tax The Group operates in the UK where new tax legislation to implement a global minimum  top-up tax was enacted in July 2023 and became effective from 1 January 2024. This new  legislation seeks to establish a 15% global minimum tax rate for multinational enterprises.    In accordance with IAS 12, the Group has applied a mandatory temporary relief from  deferred tax accounting for the impacts of the top-up tax, and instead accounts for it as a  current tax when it is incurred. The current tax charge with respect to the top-up tax for the  period was £nil (2023: £nil). The Group is continuing to monitor the development of Pillar  Two rules and guidance from tax authorities. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 154 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 157 ===== Note 3: Goodwill and intangible assets   Goodwill and intangible assets in brief Goodwill and intangible assets are non-physical assets used by the Group to generate  revenues. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the fair value of  the Group’s share of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired  subsidiary at the date of the business combination. The carrying value of goodwill may be  adjusted up to 12 months from the accounting date of acquisition, as the allocation of the  purchase price to identifiable intangible assets is finalised within that period. Goodwill arising  on business combinations is capitalised and presented within goodwill and intangible assets  in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Where the fair value of net assets  acquired is greater than the consideration paid, the excess is recognised as a gain  immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. Goodwill is held at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment reviews are  performed annually or more frequently if there is an indication that the carrying value  may be impaired. Impairment reviews are performed at the level of the relevant CGU.  In identifying CGUs, the Group considers the smallest identifiable group of assets that  generates independent cash inflows, how managers monitor operations and the level  at which strategic decisions are made. Other intangible assets Intangible assets, other than goodwill, that are acquired as part of a business combination  are recognised at fair value which represents cost at acquisition and are subsequently held  at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. Intangible assets acquired separately  are held at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. Costs relating to the development of intangible assets, including computer software,  are capitalised once all development phase recognition criteria are met. Amortisation is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis as  follows, excluding any intangible assets to which an indefinite useful life has been attributed: ■Computer software 2-10 years Brands/trademarks  3 years-indefinite Customer relationships  3-20 years Distribution networks  10-18 years Licences to operate care homes  Term of licence Bed licences in Australia  From 1 October 2021 to 1 July 2025 ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ Intangible assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment if  circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment  loss is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement to reduce the carrying amount  to the recoverable amount. This impairment may be reversed in future periods if there is  indication that there will be a significant long-term improvement in the value of the CGU. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, or not yet available for use, are subject to  annual impairment reviews and are assessed more frequently if there is an indication that  the carrying value may be impaired. Intangible assets, other than goodwill, with an indefinite  useful life include brands within the Bupa Chile CGU which have a total carrying value of  £59m (2023: £66m). These are well known brands within the market, and it is considered  that an average market participant would maintain the use of the brand for an indefinite  period, which supports the assessment of an indefinite useful life. Following the Australian Government's announcement of the deregulation of bed licences  from 1 July 2024, the amortisation term of bed licences was reviewed and updated from  having an indefinite useful life to amortising over the period to 1 July 2024. In May 2024, the  Australian Government announced that the deregulation would be delayed until 1 July 2025,  and the amortisation term of bed licences was updated from amortising over the period to  1 July 2024 to amortising over the period to 1 July 2025. In November 2024, the remaining  bed license were impaired as part of external care home valuation process (See Note 4).

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 156 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 159 ===== Goodwill and intangible assets of £3,178m (2023: £2,705m) include £325m (2023: £353m)  attributable to other intangible assets arising on business combinations included within  brands/trademarks, customer relationships and other in the above table.  Computer software assets with a net book value of £406m (2023: £391m) include £285m  (2023: £279m) attributable to capitalised internal development costs. The cost attributable  to these assets is £708m (2023: £663m). £119m of costs (2023: £102m) were capitalised in  the year. Impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested at least annually for  impairment by either comparing the net carrying value with the recoverable amount, using  value in use calculations or the asset’s fair value less costs of disposal. In arriving at the value in use for a CGU, key assumptions have been made regarding future  projected cash ﬂows, discount rates and terminal growth rates. The key business drivers of  the cash flow forecasts vary by CGU. For aged care, key drivers are occupancy rates, fee  rates, staff and agency costs and operating expenses. For provision business, the cash  flows are driven by number of customers, available clinician hours, fee rates and operating  expenses. For insurance business, key drivers are assumed business volumes, future  insurance premium rate rises, claims volatility and claims inflation. Cash ﬂow projections  have been calculated from underlying proﬁt projections for a five-year period. These are  based on the three-year plan which has been approved by the Board, with further  projections added for years four and five. Cash inflows or outflows relating to financing  activities have been excluded from the estimated future cash flows.  Cash ﬂow projections beyond the forecast periods have been extrapolated by applying  a terminal growth rate between 2.0% and 6.2% (2023: 2.0% and 6.7%) for all CGUs. The  terminal growth rates represent an estimate of the long-term growth rate for each CGU,  taking into account the future and past growth rates and external sources of data, such  as forecast GDP growth rates, inflation and long-term consumer price index rates. The  values assigned to the key assumptions are based on past experience of the CGUs and  assessment of future trends in the relevant industry. Taxation has been applied to the pre-taxation underlying proﬁt based on the statutory  taxation rates in the country of operation. Forecast future post-taxation cash ﬂows have been discounted at post-taxation discount  rates. Discount rates have been derived using a Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)  methodology, representing the minimum return a business must earn on its asset base to  satisfy providers of capital. Discount rates used for the value in use calculations for each of  the Group’s CGUs are based on considerations of the systemic risks associated with each  CGU, as well as external factors such as inflation and local market leverage. These include a  market assessment of the time value of money and the risks inherent in the relevant country  where the cash ﬂows are generated. The following table summarises the pre-taxation discount rates used for impairment testing  for the main CGUs, which were determined through grossing up the post-tax discount rates  by the applicable corporate taxation rates: 2024  %  2023  %  Bupa Australia Health Insurance  9.5   10.0  Bupa Health Services Australia  12.2   12.4  Hong Kong  11.4   11.5  LUX MED  10.1   10.4  Sanitas Seguros  9.1   9.6  Sanitas Mayores  8.6   9.2  Bupa Acıbadem Sigorta  39.8   26.1  Care Plus  16.7   16.2  Bupa Mexico  17.1   –  Bupa Dental Care UK  12.2   11.5  Bupa Global  11.7   12.7  Bupa Health Services   10.9   –  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 157 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 160 ===== The following table summarises goodwill by CGU as at 31 December 2024: 2024  £m  2023  £m  Bupa Asia Pacific Bupa Australia Health Insurance 753  817  Bupa Health Services Australia 257  282  Hong Kong 125  122  Europe and Latin America LUX MED 282  287  Sanitas Seguros 73  62  Sanitas Mayores 20  21  Bupa Acıbadem Sigorta 64  52  Care Plus 33  41  Bupa Mexico 9  11  Bupa Global, India and UK Niva Bupa 527  –  Bupa Dental Care UK 193  191  Bupa Global 68  68  Bupa Health Services 24  7  Total 2,428  1,961                                                          Goodwill of £536m has been recognised in the year as a result of the additional shares  acquired in Niva Bupa (see Note 23) both from the write-up of the previously held  investment (£321m) and the newly acquired shares (£215m). This goodwill represents the  future profit growth that is expected to be achieved through accessing the growing Indian  health insurance sector. It has been assessed for impairment based on the fair value of the  business. In November 2024, Niva Bupa successfully completed an IPO and the estimated  fair value of the business has been calculated based on the listed share price, adjusted by  the Group’s control premium. During the year, no impairment losses were recognised in relation to goodwill (2023: £nil). Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions  As part of the annual impairment test, management considers the sensitivity of the tests to  changes in key assumptions including changes in the discount rate, terminal growth rate  and cash flows. Management believes that there are no reasonably possible changes to key  assumptions that would cause the carrying value of any goodwill or intangible asset with an  indefinite useful life to exceed its recoverable amount. Management continues to closely monitor the headroom on Bupa Dental Care UK, following  the impairments recognised in 2022, to ascertain whether any further impairments to  goodwill or reversals to impairment of intangible assets or property, plant and equipment  should be recognised. Headroom at 31 December 2024 is £56m (2023: £72m) with the  decrease in the year largely driven by an increase in discount rate. As there is not a notable  improvement in the underlying forecast cash flows of the business, which are most sensitive  to available clinician hours and operating expenses, no impairment reversal has been  recognised.   Headroom £m Discount rate % Terminal  growth rate % Reduction in  headroom from  1% increase in  discount rate £m Reduction in  headroom from  0.5% reduction  in terminal  growth rate £m Reduction in  headroom from  10% reduction  in cash flows £m Bupa Dental  Care UK  56   12.2   2.1  (32)   (12)   (30)         Impairment of other intangible assets As at 31 December 2024, other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives were tested for  impairment with £nil impairment being recognised (2023: £1m impairment of brand  intangibles). A review of intangible assets that are subject to amortisation resulted in impairments of £11m  (2023: £16m), of which £9m relates to computer software (2023: £16m) and £2m relates to  bed licences in Australia.

These properties are subject to periodic and at least  triennial valuations performed by external independent valuers. Borrowing costs relating to  the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised as part of the cost of that  asset. Equipment Equipment (including leasehold improvements) is held at historical cost less subsequent  depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation Freehold land and assets under construction, included within freehold properties, are not  depreciated. Depreciation on other items of property, plant and equipment is calculated  using the straight-line method to allocate cost or revalued amount less residual value over  estimated useful lives, as follows: ■Freehold property  50 years Right-of-use property  Lease term Leasehold improvements  Shorter of useful life or lease term Owned equipment  3-10 years Right-of-use equipment  Lease term ■ ■ ■ ■ Impairment Impairment reviews are undertaken where there are indications that the carrying value of  an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss on an asset carried at amortised cost  is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement within other operating expenses to  reduce the carrying value to the recoverable amount. An impairment loss on an asset carried  at revalued amount is recognised in the property revaluation reserve, except where an  asset is revalued below historical cost, in which case the loss below the historical cost is  recognised within other income and charges in the Consolidated Income Statement  (see Note 2.4). For information regarding leased (right-of-use) assets, see Note 18.

To ensure that the carrying  value does not differ significantly from fair value at the reporting date, in years where a full  external valuation is not completed, a directors’ valuation is conducted, based on updated  cash flows and other market variables with support from external valuers where necessary.  Consideration is also given to whether there are any factors which indicate a full out-of-cycle  external revaluation is required. In 2024, the external triennial revaluation of properties in Spain have been independently  performed by Alia Tasaciones S.A.. In addition, full out-of-cycle revaluations have been  performed in Australia by Ernst & Young. Directors’ property valuations have been  performed across all other geographies. In valuing care home property, a judgement is made on the highest and best use of the  property. In the majority of cases this leads to the property being valued as part of a group  of assets making up a going concern business, using market valuations. This approach is in  line with market practice. The business is valued on a fair maintainable trade basis with the  fair value thus calculated being allocated to plant and equipment applicable at net book  value (as a proxy for fair value), with the residual value being allocated to property.  The valuations of care homes across the Group (and hospitals in Spain and Poland) are  therefore determined based on a capitalisation of earnings approach. Each facility’s  normalised earnings are calculated based on what a reasonably efficient operator could be  expected to achieve. This is divided by an appropriate capitalisation rate to determine a  value in use. The capitalisation rate is the average rate of return for each facility and is based  on qualitative and quantitative indicators of the facility’s current and future performance. The valuations of hospitals and clinics in Chile are determined based on discounted future  cash flow projections. The discount rate is determined according to the time value of money,  the level of risk of the industry and the corresponding premium risk. Unobservable inputs include the capitalisation or discount rate and, for all properties except  those in Poland and Chile, the average occupancy. All other properties are valued based on observable market values of similar properties.  Due to the level of judgement and adjustments required to the observable inputs used  in the valuation methodologies, a Level 3 classification, under the fair value hierarchy in  accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, is considered appropriate for all properties  in the Group. At each revaluation date, accumulated depreciation is eliminated against the gross carrying  amount of the asset. Sensitivity analysis The significant assumptions used in the calculation of the fair values of the material Level 3  freehold properties in the Group are shown in the table below. Average occupancy rate and  average capitalisation rates or discount rates are inputs to the valuation of care home  property, hospitals and clinics. Average price per square metre and average yield are  primarily assumptions used in valuing offices or other commercial property.

An increase/decrease  of 0.5% in occupancy rates would increase/decrease the total carrying value of freehold  properties by £7m/£(9)m (2023: £7m/£(8)m).  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 161 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 164 ===== The table below shows the date at which freehold properties held as at 31 December 2024  were last subject to external valuation. 2024 £m Valuation – 31 December 2024 1,029  Valuation – 31 December 2023 15  Valuation – 31 December 2022 1,007  Assets held at cost¹ 76  Cost or valuation 2,127            1.

When a revaluation reverses losses recognised in the  Consolidated Income Statement in prior years, the credit is recognised in the Consolidated  Income Statement. In the current year, a £123m net revaluation gain (2023: £15m deficit) has been recognised in  the property revaluation reserve, with a revaluation gain of £9m (2023: £21m loss) charged  to the Consolidated Income Statement within other income and charges (see Note 2.4). Recognised in the carrying amount of freehold property is £47m (2023: £52m) in relation to  freehold property in the course of construction.

Note 5: Investment property   Investment property in brief Investment properties are physical assets that are not occupied by the Group and are  leased to third parties to generate rental income. The majority of investment properties  held by the Group are part of a portfolio of retirement villages in New Zealand. Investment properties are initially measured at cost and subsequently at fair value,  determined individually, on a basis appropriate to the purpose for which the property is  intended. Investment properties are revalued at least annually, with any gain or loss arising  from a change in fair value recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement within financial  income and expense. In Australia and New Zealand, the retirement village market is fragmented as each village is  unique due to building configuration and location. As there are no directly comparable sales  from which values can be derived, the fair value of investment property is determined using  unobservable inputs. Therefore, the Group has categorised investment property as Level 3  under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with the IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.  These properties are valued using discounted cash flow projections. In an active market, the portfolio is valued annually by an independent valuer, holding a  recognised and relevant professional qualification, and with recent experience in the location  and category of investment property being valued. 2024 £m 2023 £m At beginning of year 776  750  Additions 30  38  Transfer to assets held for sale –  (2)  Increase in fair value 27  32  Foreign exchange  (77)  (42)  At end of year 756  776                           In the current year, a revaluation surplus of £27m (2023: £31m) was credited to the  Consolidated Income Statement. This is net of £nil (2023: £1m) attributable to occupational  right agreement liability holders which is paid upon their exit of the retirement village. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 162 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 165 ===== The carrying value of investment properties primarily consists of the Group's portfolio of  retirement villages in New Zealand of £687m (2023: £703m) and Australia of £49m (2023:  £53m). These were valued by management using internally prepared discounted cash flow  projections, supported by the terms of any existing lease and other contracts. Discount rates  are used to reflect current market assessments of the uncertainty in the amount or timing of  the cash flows. During the year, an independent valuation of the New Zealand portfolio was  performed by Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), and this valuation, also based on a discounted cash  flow model, was in line with management’s valuation. The historical cost of investment properties is £460m (2023: £495m).  Significant assumptions used in the valuation include: Australia and New Zealand 2024 2023 Discount rate 14.0% 14.0% Capital growth rate 3.3% - 3.5% 3.3% - 3.5% The sensitivity analysis below considers the impact on the year-end valuation of Level 3  investment properties and is based on a change in one assumption while holding all other  assumptions constant.

Total direct operating expenses of these retirement villages amounted to £22m (2023:  £21m). Note 6: Equity-accounted investments   Equity-accounted investments in brief Equity-accounted investments comprise associates and joint ventures in which the  Group has significant influence, but not control.  Associates include those entities over which the Group has significant influence, but has no  right to direct the activities which determine the variable returns it receives from the entity. Associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost.  The cost of the investment includes transaction costs. The carrying value of the investment  is adjusted for the Group’s share of any post-acquisition profits or losses of the associated  entity. If the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investment, the  carrying amount of that interest (including any long-term debt interests that, in substance,  form part of the Group’s net investment), is reduced to £nil. In addition, the recognition of  further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation to make  payments on behalf of the equity-accounted investment. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Group’s share of income and expenses,  and other comprehensive income, from the date that significant influence commences until  the date that significant influence ceases. Adjustments are made to align the accounting  policies with those of the Group where materially different. The carrying amount of equity-accounted investments is £1,016m (2023: £1,056m). All  equity-accounted investments are included based on coterminous accounting periods. On 8 January 2024, the Group acquired an additional 21.57% of the ordinary share capital of  Niva Bupa for consideration of £263m, strengthening the Group’s presence in the growing  Indian health insurance sector, where Niva principally operates and is incorporated. The  additional shareholding acquired has resulted in Bupa holding a controlling interest in Niva  Bupa of 62.98%, leading to the full consolidation of the company as a subsidiary.  Immediately prior to the acquisition on 8 January 2024, the Group’s existing stake in Niva  Bupa was remeasured by £321m to a fair value of £417m, resulting in the Group recording a  net £309m gain through other income and charges in the Consolidated Income Statement  after the release of associated foreign exchange translation reserves. This is disclosed further  in Note 23.

(ii) Individually immaterial equity-accounted investments In addition to the interests in associates disclosed above, the Group also has interests in a  number of individually immaterial associates and a joint venture that are accounted for using  the equity method. The aggregate carrying amount of the associates is £7m (2023: £6m).  The carrying amount of the joint venture is £26m (2023: £28m). The Group’s share of results  recognised during the year for these is a loss of £7m (2023: profit of £1m), which is  attributable to the investment in the joint venture. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 164 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 167 ===== Note 7: Post-employment benefits   Post-employment benefits in brief The Group operates several funded defined benefit and defined contribution pension  schemes for the benefit of employees and Directors, in addition to an unfunded  scheme and a post-retirement medical benefit scheme.  Defined contribution pension schemes The defined contribution pension schemes provide employees with a retirement fund  accumulated through investment of contributions made by Bupa and the employees.  Members of the scheme use their funds to secure benefits at retirement. Benefits are  not known in advance and the investment and longevity risks are assumed solely by the  members of the scheme. Contributions payable by the relevant sponsoring employers are  defined in the scheme rules or plan specifications and these contributions are recognised  as an expense in the Consolidated Income Statement as incurred. Defined benefit post-employment schemes The defined benefit pension schemes provide benefits based on final pensionable salary.  The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pensions is calculated separately for  each scheme and represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair  value of scheme assets. The discount rate used is the yield at the reporting date on high- quality corporate bonds denominated in the currency in which the benefit will be paid and  taking account of the maturities of the defined benefit obligations. When the calculation  results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of any  future refunds from the scheme or reductions in future contributions to the scheme. The charge to the Consolidated Income Statement for defined benefit schemes represents  the net interest cost and administrative expenses.  All remeasurements are recognised in full in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive  Income in the period in which they occur.

The Group automatically enrols any eligible non-pensioned employees  into the National Employment Savings Trust (NEST). Defined benefit post-employment schemes The principal deﬁned beneﬁt scheme in the UK is The Bupa Pension Scheme which has been  closed to new entrants since 1 October 2002 and closed to future accrual since 31 December  2020. Contributions by employees and by Group companies were paid into separate funds  administered by a corporate trustee. Following the closure of this scheme to future accrual,  existing members retain any ongoing salary link, with future benefits payable dependent  upon member salary at the date of leaving or retirement. Existing current employees who  were members of The Bupa Pension Scheme were automatically enrolled into the defined  contribution pension scheme, the My Bupa LifeSight Plan from 1 January 2021. The recognised surplus in relation to The Bupa Pension Scheme is limited to the present  value of any future refunds from the scheme in the event of a wind up. There are no  minimum funding requirements in place and the Trustees do not have the unilateral power  to trigger a wind up of the scheme. Once all members have left the scheme, the Group can  wind up the scheme and is entitled to any remaining surplus.  Contributions by Group companies to this scheme have been made in accordance with the  recommendations of the independent scheme actuary. The independent scheme actuary for The Bupa Pension Scheme performs detailed triennial  valuations together with annual interim reviews. Both triennial and interim valuations use the  attained age method, recognising the closure of the scheme to new entrants. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 165 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 168 ===== The latest triennial valuation, dated 1 July 2023, showed that The Bupa Pension Scheme  was in surplus on its technical provisions basis. The scheme was also in surplus on the more  prudent actuarial basis which the Trustees use to set their long-term funding target. As a  result, no deficit reduction contributions are currently due. This position could change as  a result of future valuations.  There are several other smaller deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes operated by UK and  overseas subsidiaries. The deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes are assessed by independent  scheme actuaries in accordance with UK or local practice and under IAS 19 as at  31 December 2024 for the purposes of inclusion in the Group’s Consolidated Financial  Statements. Trustees are appointed for each scheme as determined by its respective trust  documentation and Trustees are required to act in the best interests of the schemes’  beneficiaries. The long-term investment objectives of the Trustees and the employers are  to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long term,  and to maximise returns consistent with an acceptable level of risk. The smaller defined benefit pension schemes are not individually material to the Group on  a net surplus/deficit basis, but details have been disclosed within the subsidiary financial  statements of the relevant sponsoring employer of each scheme. In June 2023, the High Court handed down a decision in the Virgin Media Ltd versus NTL  Pension Trustees II Ltd, which considered the implications of section 37 of the Pension  Schemes Act 1993, which required that the rules of a salary-related contracted-out pension  scheme cannot be altered, in relation to post April 1997 service, unless the actuary confirmed  that the scheme would continue to satisfy the statutory standards. The High Court found  that, where the required actuarial confirmation was not supplied, the effect of section 37 was  to render the relevant amendment to any contracted-out right automatically void. It also  held that references in the legislation included both past and future service rights and that  the requirement for actuarial confirmation applied to all amendments to the rules of a  contracted-out scheme. This decision was appealed to the Court of Appeal and, in July  2024, the Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the High Court.  The Group is awaiting the assessments of the Trustees of the defined benefit pension  schemes which is yet to begin because the Trustees, acting on advice, are awaiting more  clarity as to whether any subsequent actions or amendments to liabilities are required and  will continue to monitor developments. The Group has considered information available to it  and has concluded not to make any allowance for the possible impact of the ruling in its IAS  19 liabilities as it is currently unclear whether any additional liabilities might arise, and if they  were to arise, how they would be reliably measured.  Unfunded schemes  Unfunded defined benefit pension arrangements exist for certain former employees to  provide benefits in addition to the funded pension arrangements provided by the Group.  There are no separate funds or assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position  to support the unfunded schemes; however, cash deposits included in the Consolidated  Statement of Financial Position in respect of these liabilities and assets are ring-fenced  to support these liabilities (see Note 9).  The latest valuation of these arrangements was performed as at 31 December 2024 under  IAS 19 by the Group’s independent actuary. The charge to the Consolidated Income  Statement in respect of these arrangements and the assessment of the related pension  liability as at 31 December 2024 have been made in accordance with this latest valuation,  which used the same principal assumptions as adopted as at 31 December 2024 under  IAS 19 for The Bupa Pension Scheme.  Post-retirement medical benefit scheme  The Group also provides unfunded post-retirement medical benefits for certain former  employees. These benefits were granted under an agreement which closed to new entrants  in 1992. The latest valuation of this scheme was performed on 31 December 2024 by an  actuary employed by the Group using the same principal assumptions as adopted as at  31 December 2024 under IAS 19 for The Bupa Pension Scheme.

The main return-seeking asset class in the scheme, including the underlying assets  of the pooled investment funds, is credit; there is minimal remaining market risk from  equities or property. The scheme’s liabilities will fluctuate in line with interest rates and  inflation. However, The Bupa Pension Scheme’s investment strategy aims to hedge against  interest and inflation risk as measured on a long-term funding basis, via a liability-driven  investment strategy that utilises a combination of high-quality gilts and swaps. This means  that on a funding valuation basis, assets will move broadly in the same direction as the  liabilities, although this can differ under the IAS 19 valuation.  Given the scheme’s asset holdings, the key remaining risk in The Bupa Pension Scheme’s  investment strategy is credit risk. This is managed via limits on credit quality of  counterparties, collateral arrangements in the case of derivatives and repurchase  agreements and regular monitoring of investment managers. Holdings of corporate  instruments are highly diversified by issuer, economic sector and geography. The specific  risks associated with the derivatives used in the hedging programme are managed via limits  on leverage, stress testing of collateral requirements, and by maintaining a prudent buffer of  liquid assets to meet potential collateral calls. 7.2   Actuarial assumptions The responsibility for setting the assumptions underlying the IAS 19 valuations rests with  Bupa's Directors, having first taken advice from the Group’s independent actuary.  The key weighted average financial assumptions used when valuing the obligations of the  post-employment benefit schemes under IAS 19 for the schemes within the Group are as  follows: Funded schemes Unfunded schemes 2024 % 2023 % 2024 % 2023 % Inflation rate 3.2 3.2 3.2 3.2 Rate of increase in salaries 3.7 3.7 – – Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.9 3.0 3.9 3.9 Rate of increase of pensions in deferment 2.9 3.0 3.9 3.9 Discount rate for scheme assets and  obligations 5.6 4.8 5.6 4.8 Medical cost trend – – 6.1 5.5 (a) Actuarial assumptions underlying the valuation of obligations The inflation rate assumption is set by reference to the difference between the yield on long- term fixed interest gilts and the real yield on index-linked gilts, with a deduction of 0.2% to  reflect an inflation risk premium.  The rate of increase in salaries is equal to the long-term expected annual average salary pay  increase for the employees who are members of the respective schemes. This assumption is  set relative to the inflation rate assumption.  The rate of increase of pensions in payment is the same as the inflation rate, with the  exception of benefits which receive fixed increases in payment as defined under the  respective scheme rules. The rate of increase of pensions in deferment is set relative to the inflation rate assumption  and adjusted for any relevant caps or collars.  The discount rate used to value scheme liabilities is the yield at the reporting date on high- quality corporate bonds of appropriate term. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 168 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 171 ===== Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure scheme liabilities The sensitivity analysis provided below is based on a change in an assumption while holding  all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur and experience variations  for some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the  defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (projected  unit credit method) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised  within the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

Assumptions have been adopted  in line with this analysis for the purposes of IAS 19 valuation as at 31 December 2024.  The mortality tables adopted as at 31 December 2024 are the S3PA year of birth mortality  tables using the CMI 2023 projection model, with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.5%  p.a. adjusted by 104% (male non-pensioners); 95% (female non-pensioners); 97% (male  pensioners) and 94% (female pensioners) (2023: CMI 2022 projection model, with a long- term rate of improvement of 1.5% p.a. adjusted by 104% (male non-pensioners); 94%  (female non-pensioners); 97% (male pensioners) and 94% (female pensioners)). The average life expectancy on retirement at age 60 are as follows:  2024 2023 For members aged 60 on the valuation date:  Male 26.4 26.5 Female 28.9 28.9 For members aged 45 on the valuation date:  Male 27.2 27.3 Female 30.2 30.2 (c) Assumptions over duration of liabilities The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is approximately 13 years  (2023: approximately 14 years). Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 169 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 172 ===== Note 8: Deferred taxation assets and liabilities Deferred taxation assets and liabilities in brief Deferred taxation is an amount which recognises the differences between the carrying  amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and the amounts used for  taxation purposes. An example is the variance between the carrying value of  equipment due to depreciation being charged for financial reporting purposes and  written down allowances being applied for the relevant tax authorities. Deferred taxation is recognised in full using the balance sheet liability method, providing for  temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial  reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary  differences are not recognised: goodwill not deductible for taxation purposes and the initial  recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination which,  at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss  and does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The amount  of deferred taxation recognised is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement  of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using taxation rates enacted or substantively  enacted at the reporting date. A deferred taxation asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future  taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred taxation  assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation  authority and when the Group can settle its current taxation assets and liabilities on a net  basis. Recognised deferred taxation assets and liabilities Deferred taxation assets and liabilities are attributable to the following:   Assets Liabilities Net 2024 £m 2023 £m 2024 £m 2023 £m 2024 £m 2023 £m Accelerated capital  allowances 52  66  (116)  (56)  (64)  10  Post-employment benefits 3  2  (75)  (128)  (72)  (126)  Employee benefits (other  than post-employment) 84  84  –  (4)  84  80  Revaluation of properties to  fair value 3  1  (104)  (84)  101)  (83)  Provisions 104  112  –  –  04  112  Taxation value of losses  carried forward 149  84  –  –  149  84  Goodwill and intangible  assets 9  10  (117)  (116)  108)  (106)  Other 18  37  (12)  (43)  6  (6)  Deferred taxation (before  allowable netting) 422  396  (424)  (431)  (2)  (35)  Allowable netting of  deferred taxation (229)  (188)  229  188  –  –  Deferred taxation – net 193  208  (195)  (243)  (2)  (35)                                               (             1                         (                                                     The UK deferred tax liability relating to the pension surplus at 1 January 2024 was reduced  by £38m following a change in the UK tax rate applying to authorised payments from  defined benefit pension schemes from 35% to 25%. The UK deferred tax liability of £83m  (2023: £134m) relating to the Bupa Pension Scheme surplus has not been offset with other  UK deferred tax assets on the basis that an authorised surplus repayment charge may not be  reduced by the utilisation of tax losses arising in the UK group of entities. Unrecognised deferred taxation assets As at 31 December 2024, the Group had deductible temporary differences relating to trading  losses of £390m (2023: £223m), to capital losses of £154m (2023: £154m), and to other  temporary differences of £93m (2023: £35m) for which no deferred taxation asset was  recognised due to uncertainty of utilisation of those temporary differences.

Included in current restricted assets is £103m (2023: £85m) cash in respect of claims funds  held on behalf of corporate customers. Note 10: Financial investments   Financial investments in brief The Group generates cash from its underwriting, trading and financing activities and  invests the surplus cash in financial investments. These include government bonds,  corporate bonds, pooled investment funds and deposits with credit institutions. All financial investments are initially recognised at fair value, which includes transaction  costs for financial investments not classified at fair value through profit or loss. Financial  investments are recorded using trade date accounting at initial recognition. Financial investments are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the  financial investments have expired or where the Group has transferred substantially all risks  and rewards of ownership.  The Group has classified its financial investments into the following categories: at fair value  through proﬁt or loss, at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and at  amortised cost.  Classification Criteria and treatment under IFRS 9 Fair value  through profit  or loss Debt and equity instruments where performance is managed and  evaluated on a fair value basis and the objective is to realise cash flows  through the sale of the assets. The investments are carried at fair value,  with gains and losses arising from changes in this value recognised in  the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which they arise. Fair value  through other  comprehensive  income Non-derivative debt instruments where the contractual characteristics  of the financial assets represent solely payments of principal and  interest and the objective is to hold the instrument to collect cash flows  and sell, with a greater frequency and value of sales than instruments at  amortised cost. The investments are carried at fair value and fair value  changes are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of  Comprehensive Income, except for interest and foreign exchange gains  or losses and impairment gains and losses that are derived using the  same methodology that is applied to financial assets measured at  amortised cost, which are recognised in the Consolidated Income  Statement. The cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in other  comprehensive income is recognised in the Consolidated Income  Statement when a financial asset at FVOCI is derecognised. Amortised cost Non-derivative debt instruments where the contractual characteristics  of the financial assets represent solely payments of principal and  interest and the objective is to hold the instrument to collect cash flows  over its life. Any disposals are expected to be infrequent or insignificant.  The investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective  interest method, less any impairment losses. Any discount or premium  on purchase is amortised over the life of the investment in the  Consolidated Income Statement. Under IFRS 9, impairment provisions for expected credit losses (ECL) are recognised for  financial investments measured at amortised cost and FVOCI. An allowance for either a 12- month or lifetime ECL is required, depending on whether there has been a significant  increase in credit risk since initial recognition. For trade receivables lifetime ECL is always  applied. An assumption can be made that the credit risk on a financial instrument has not  increased significantly since initial recognition if the financial instrument is determined to  have low credit risk at the reporting date (e.g. it is investment grade). The Group applies a  12-month ECL allowance to all assets other than trade receivables, as no significant increases  in credit risk since initial recognition have been identified. The measurement of ECL should reflect a probability-weighted outcome, the time value of  money and the best available forward-looking information. An analysis of ECL provisions is  provided in Note 25.5.

The objective of a fair value measurement is to  estimate this price. The fair values of quoted investments in active markets are based on current bid prices. The  fair values of unlisted securities and quoted investments for which there is no active market  are established by using valuation techniques supported by market transactions and  observable market data provided by independent third parties. These may include reference  to the current fair value of other investments that are substantially the same and discounted  cash flow analysis. The fair values of financial investments are determined using different valuation inputs  categorised into a three-level hierarchy. The different levels are defined by reference to  the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement, as follows: ■Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for  the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data  (unobservable inputs). ■ ■ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 173 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 176 ===== An analysis of the financial investment fair values by hierarchy level is as follows:   Level 1 2024 £m Level 2 2024 £m Level 3 2024 £m Total 2024 £m Level 1 2023 £m Level 2 2023 £m Level 3 2023 £m Total 2023 £m Fair value through profit or loss Corporate debt securities and secured loans 21  365  –  386  18  293  1  312  Government debt securities 8  36  –  44  13  21  –  34  Pooled investment funds 64  340  25  429  93  407  24  524  Deposits with credit institutions 11  –  –  11  25  –  –  25  Equities 1  –  32  33  –  –  36  36  Fair value through other comprehensive income Corporate debt securities and secured loans 59  445  –  504  17  –  –  17  Government debt securities 303  13  –  316  37  –  –  37  Amortised cost Corporate debt securities and secured loans 360  937  1  1,298  443  618  –  1,061  Government debt securities 370  247  –  617  325  185  –  510  Deposits with credit institutions –  1,064  –  1,064  –  1,095  –  1,095  Total financial investments 1,197  3,447  58  4,702  971  2,619  61  3,651                                                                                                                                                                                  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 174 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 177 ===== Transfers between fair value hierarchy levels  The Group’s policy is to determine whether transfers have occurred between fair value  hierarchy levels at the end of a reporting period. Classification is reassessed based on  the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole. There were no transfers between fair value hierarchy levels in the year (2023: £nil). The Group currently holds Level 3 financial investments totalling £58m (2023: £61m). The  majority of Level 3 investments are unlisted equities and pooled investment funds valued at  recent subscription values and conversion prices, which are considered to be unobservable  inputs. Changes to the valuation assumptions by 5% could result in a change in fair value of  plus or minus £3m (2023: plus or minus £3m). The table below shows movement in the Level 3 assets measured at fair value. Level 3 2024 £m 2023 £m At beginning of year 61  63  Additions 3  1  Net decrease in fair value¹ (1)  (1)  Disposals (1)  –  Foreign exchange (4)  (2)  At end of year 58  61                          1. All gains and losses are recognised in financial income and financial expense in the Consolidated Income  Statement. The Group uses a market interest curve supported by third parties as at the reporting  date to discount financial assets, borrowings and derivatives, where the fair value cannot  otherwise be found from quoted market values. The interest rate used is based on the  duration of the financial asset/liability resulting in a range as follows:  2024 % 2023 % Sterling assets and liabilities 4.5 - 5.2 4.2 - 4.3 Australian dollar assets and liabilities 3.8 - 3.9 3.6 - 3.9 Euro assets and liabilities 2.0 - 2.3 2.3 - 3.1 US dollar assets and liabilities 4.1 - 4.6 3.9 - 4.7 Note 11: Derivatives Derivatives in brief A derivative is a financial instrument whose value is based on one or more underlying  variables. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to  foreign exchange and interest rate risk. Derivatives are not held for speculative reasons.   Derivative financial instruments are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss unless  hedge accounting requires another treatment. See Note 25 for details on how the Group  accounts for derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting. Derivatives that have been  purchased or issued as part of a hedge that subsequently do not qualify for hedge  accounting are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. Fair values are obtained from market observable pricing information including interest rate  yield curves. Fair values have been calculated for each type of derivative as follows: ■The fair value of currency contracts, including forwards, swaps and options is determined  using third-party sourced market data at the reporting date. The resulting value reflects  changes in spot exchange rates and interest differential between the currency pair  involved, over the life of the contract, discounted back to the present value. ■The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined as the present value of the estimated  future cash flows based on observable yield curves. Valuation inputs are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 2024 £m 2023 £m Derivative assets Non-current 16  17  Current 49  29  Total derivative assets 65  46  Derivative liabilities Non-current (30)  (42)  Current (10)  (21)  Total derivative liabilities (40)  (63)                           Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 175 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 178 ===== Note 12: Insurance and reinsurance contracts   Insurance and reinsurance contracts in brief Insurance contracts are contracts under which the Group accepts significant  insurance risk from a policyholder by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if a  specified uncertain future event adversely affects the policyholder. Unit of account A portfolio of insurance contracts is defined as insurance contracts subject to similar risks  and managed together. The Group defines portfolios as insurance Business Units at a  minimum, as the Group essentially sells one health insurance product line where cash  flows are generally expected to respond similarly in direction and timing to changes in  assumptions and as the Group manages the insurance business at geographical Business  Unit level. There may be further disaggregation if there are business lines which are  managed separately and have different risk profiles. Each portfolio is subsequently disaggregated into groups of contracts: ■that are onerous at initial recognition; that have no significant possibility of becoming onerous subsequently; and all remaining contracts. ■ ■ The Group assumes that no contracts are onerous at initial recognition unless facts and  circumstances indicate otherwise. An assessment is made whether contracts that are not  onerous at initial recognition have no significant possibility of subsequently becoming  onerous by assessing the likelihood of changes in applicable facts and circumstances. The  Group assesses the profitability of a set of contracts for which it has reasonable and  supportable information that the contracts will all be in the same group. Each set generally  contains contracts issued in a single half year period, which is a subset of one issuing year  of a portfolio. Insurance contracts remain within the same group from initial recognition until  they are derecognised. Portfolios of reinsurance contracts held are assessed for aggregation separately from  portfolios of insurance contracts issued. The Group’s policy is that for reinsurance contracts  held, each individual reinsurance contract is considered a group. Recognition and derecognition Groups of insurance and reinsurance contracts are initially recognised from the earliest of:  the beginning of the coverage period; the date when the first payment from a policyholder  in the group becomes due or when the first payment is received; and when the group of  contracts or the underlying insurance contract becomes onerous.  For proportional reinsurance, recognition is the later of the date that any underlying  insurance contract is initially recognised or the beginning of the coverage period of the  group of reinsurance contracts held. A group of insurance contracts or reinsurance contracts are derecognised when all rights  and obligations are extinguished or a contract modification occurs.  Contract boundary and fulfilment cash flows Cash flows are within the boundary of an insurance or reinsurance contract if they arise  from substantive rights and obligations that exist during the reporting period. For insurance  contracts, the Group has a substantive right when it can compel the policyholder to pay the  premiums or a substantive obligation when it is required to provide the policyholder with  insurance contract services.  For reinsurance contracts held, the substantive right is to receive reinsurance services and  the substantive obligation is to pay amounts to the reinsurer.  Cash flows within the contract boundary directly relate to the fulfilment of the contract and  include cash flows relating to the collection of premiums and payments for claims, benefits  and expenses.  Cash flows are outside of the contract boundary of an insurance contract when the Group's  substantive rights and obligations end. This mainly occurs when the Group has the practical  ability to reprice the risks of a particular policyholder or change the level of benefits so that  the price fully reflects those risks. Cash flows outside the contract boundary relate to future insurance contracts. These future  insurance contracts are recognised only when they meet the recognition criteria. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 176 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 179 ===== PAA eligibility The Group applies the PAA for the measurement of the majority of insurance contracts.  The majority of the Group’s contracts automatically qualify as the coverage period of each  contract in the group is one year or less. As a result, the Group has taken the available policy  choice to apply the PAA to these contracts. The Group also has a small number of policy  groups with a coverage period of greater than one year. For these groups of contracts, the  Group assesses whether the measurement of the LFRC under the PAA is expected to differ  materially from that under the GMM. This requires the use of GMM and materiality thresholds  determined by management for these policies, as well as the selection of reasonably  expected scenarios against which eligibility is assessed. As a result of this assessment, these  remaining contracts are also eligible to use the PAA measurement model with the exception  of one legacy portfolio of individual health contracts in Brazil. This portfolio of contracts has  a contract boundary of greater than one year where the contracts are onerous and a GMM  valuation has been used.  Measurement Liability for remaining coverage  On initial recognition of each group of insurance contracts, the carrying amount of the  LFRC is based on the premiums received less any directly attributable acquisition costs  not expensed as incurred. In subsequent periods, the LFRC is increased for any additional  premiums received and the release of any insurance acquisition cash flows and decreased  for the recognition of insurance revenue that is released on a straight-line basis over the  coverage period. The Group's default policy is not to adjust the LFRC to reflect the time  value of money and the effect of financial risk, as the Group expects on initial recognition of  each group of contracts that the time between providing each part of the services and the  related premium due date is typically no more than one year. However, discounting may be  applied in exceptional circumstances, as described below in the Discounting section.  Insurance acquisition cash flows Insurance acquisition cash flows are cash flows arising from the costs of selling, underwriting  and starting a group of insurance contracts (issued or expected to be issued) that are  directly attributable to the portfolio of insurance contracts to which the group belongs.  It includes external and internal costs and incremental direct and indirect costs.  The Group’s policy is to expense acquisition costs as they are incurred where the coverage  period of each contract in the group is no more than one year. For the remaining contracts  with a longer coverage period, insurance acquisition costs are allocated to the relevant  group of insurance contracts and reduce the LFRC. The allocated acquisition costs are  amortised consistently with the pattern of insurance revenue recognition. Onerous contracts If facts and circumstances indicate that a group of contracts is onerous, detailed testing is  performed by comparing the carrying amount of the LFRC to the estimated fulfilment cash  flows, which include an assessment of the risk adjustment using a confidence level approach.  If the carrying amount of the LFRC is less than the estimated fulfilment cash flows, a loss  component is recognised. The loss component increases the LFRC and is recognised as  an expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. Subsequently, the loss component is  reassessed, with any movements in the loss component adjusting the LFRC and being  recognised within the Consolidated Income Statement. Liability for incurred claims The LFIC represents the estimated liability arising from claims episodes in current and  preceding financial years which have not yet given rise to claims paid. A claims episode is an  insured medical service that the Group has an obligation to fund which could be consultation  fees, diagnostic investigations, hospitalisation or treatment costs. The liability includes an  allowance for claims management and handling expenses. The Group recognises the LFIC of a group of insurance contracts as the present value of the  expected cash flows required to settle the obligation with an adjustment for non-financial  risk. The Group does not adjust the future cash flows either for the time value of money or  for the effect of financial risk for portfolios in which incurred claims are expected to be paid  within one year of occurrence, except in exceptional circumstances, as described below in  the Discounting section. The LFIC across the Group is set in line with Bupa’s Claims Reserving standards, at a level to  achieve an appropriate probability of sufficiency and is estimated based on current  information. The ultimate liability may vary as a result of subsequent information and events.  Adjustments to claims estimates for prior years are included in the Consolidated Income  Statement in the financial year in which the change is made. The methods used and  estimates made for the LFIC are reviewed regularly. Risk adjustment The risk adjustment reflects the compensation the Group requires for bearing the  uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash flows from non-financial risk as the  Group fulfils insurance contracts. The Group has estimated the risk adjustment using a  confidence level approach at the 85th percentile (2023: 85th percentile) which is in line with  the Group’s risk appetite for claims reserving risk, and any movements in the risk adjustment  are recognised in full within the insurance service result. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 177 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 180 ===== Discounting Discounting is optional for the LFRC carrying amount if the time between providing each  part of the coverage and the related premium due date is one year or less and for the LFIC  if claims are expected to be paid in one year or less from the date the claims are incurred.  The Group does not apply discounting to the majority of policies. However, Bupa Acıbadem  Sigorta has applied discounting to the LFRC and LFIC due to the high interest rate and high  inflation environment in Türkiye. Bupa Global has also applied discounting to the LFIC for  certain groups of insurance contracts as a proportion of claims are settled over a period that  is greater than one year. In addition, the LFRC for the legacy individual health policies in  Brazil has been discounted due to the long-term nature of these contracts. Where  discounting is applied, the Group policy is to use either the PRA published discount rates  or European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) specified discount  rates. The exception to this is the discount rate applied to the legacy portfolio of individual  health contracts in Brazil, measured on a GMM basis, for which the rates are derived from the  yields of local Brazilian Government bonds with an adjustment applied to bring the applied  discount rate broadly in line with EIOPA’s published discount rates. Discount rates are  calculated based on a bottom-up approach. Reinsurance contracts held For reinsurance contracts held, the Group applies the PAA for the majority of reinsurance  contracts as the coverage period is one year or less. The Group assesses the remaining  contracts and applies the PAA as the resulting measurement would not differ materially  from the result of applying the requirements in the GMM for reinsurance contracts held.  The Group measures the asset for remaining coverage (AFRC) on initial recognition of a  group of reinsurance contracts held as the amount of ceded premiums paid. Subsequently  the remaining coverage is increased for ceded premiums paid and decreased for amounts of  ceded premiums recognised as reinsurance expenses for the services received in the period.  The Group releases ceded reinsurance premiums on a passage of time basis over the  coverage period. The Group does not adjust the AFRC for the time value of money or for  the effect of financial risk as the time between providing the coverage and the related  underlying premium is one year or less.  The carrying amount of a group of reinsurance contracts held also includes the asset for  incurred claims (AFIC) comprising the fulfilment cash flows related to the past service  allocated to the group. The Group does not adjust the AFIC for the time value of money or  effect of financial risk as recoveries are expected to be paid within one year of occurrence.  The estimates for future cash flows of a group of reinsurance contracts held should allow for  the risk of non-performance by reinsurers, which is the probability weighted expected value  of the effect of reinsurance counterparty failure to fulfil the contractual obligations. Bupa's  policy is to set the non-performance risk to zero as there are restrictions in place on the  credit quality and amount of reinsurance ceded to individual counterparties and Bupa  uses reinsurance only to a limited extent to mitigate insurance risks. Investment components An investment component is an element within an insurance contract that would require  Bupa to repay a policyholder in all circumstances, regardless of whether an insured event  occurs. The LFIC includes an insurance provision that is a non-distinct investment  component for cash payments to Australian Health Insurance customers under a COVID-19  customer support programme. The provision is recognised at the point the Group formally  announces the payment and insurance revenue recognised within the Consolidated Income  Statement is reduced accordingly. The insurance provision is subsequently utilised on  payment to the eligible customers or paid to an Australian State Revenue Office under the  unclaimed money process. As at 31 December 2024, the LFIC includes an insurance provision  of £16m (2023: £46m) relating to these cash giveback payments. The Group does not recognise any other material investment components or separate  components from insurance contracts.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 180 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 183 ===== Contracts measured on a GMM basis The Group has a legacy portfolio of individual health contracts in Brazil, measured on a  GMM basis, which is included within the loss component. This portfolio is onerous as, due  to regulatory restrictions on pricing, the insurance contracts continue to renew at premium  rates that do not reflect the current cost of claims. As at 31 December 2024, the Brazil portfolio has been classified as being held for sale and  the loss component balance of £44m has been transferred to liabilities associated with  assets held for sale within the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. As at 31 December 2023, the loss component was £49m. During the year, movement in  the loss component driven by a change in the discount rate and the impact of the unwind  of discounting applied to the fulfilment cash flows is £16m income (2023: £17m expense) and  is recognised as insurance financial income (2023: expense) within the Consolidated Income  Statement. As the portfolio is onerous, the contractual service margin is nil. A risk  adjustment of £6m (2023: £9m) is recognised to compensate the Group for the uncertainty  about the amount and timing of cash flows from non-financial risk as the Group fulfils these  contracts. 12.2   Reinsurance contracts roll forward  For year ended 31 December 2024 Asset for  remaining  coverage  £m Amount  recoverable  on incurred  claims £m Total  £m Reinsurance contract assets at beginning of year (16)  54  38  Allocation of reinsurance premiums (284)  –  (284)  Amounts recoverable from reinsurers for incurred claims: Amounts recoverable for incurred claims and other  expenses –  275  275  Changes to amounts recoverable for incurred claims  relating to past service –  (2) (2)  Net expense from reinsurance contracts held (284)  273  (11)  Foreign exchange (1)  (1) (2)  Other movements¹ 46  –  46  Cash flows Premiums paid 229  –  229  Recoveries from reinsurance –  (210) (210)  Total cash flows 229  (210) 19  Reinsurance contract assets at end of year (26) 116  90                                                                         1.

The principal assumptions in the estimation of the LFIC relate to the expected frequency,  average claim amount and settlement patterns of insurance claims, which are expected to  be consistent with recently observed experience and trends. The aim of claims reserving is  to select assumptions and reserving methods that will produce the best estimate of the  future cash outflows for the subject claims; it is an uncertain process which also requires  judgements to be made.  Claims development patterns are analysed during the claims reserving process in each of  the Group’s insurance Business Units. Various established actuarial reserving methods for  general insurance are considered, typically basic chain ladder, Bornhuetter-Ferguson and  pure risk cost methods. Additional consideration is given to the treatment of large claims,  claims seasonality, claims inflation and currency effects, for which appropriate adjustments  to assumptions and methods are made. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 181 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 184 ===== While there is some diversity in the development profile of health insurance claims across  the Group, such claims are generally predictable in both frequency and average amount, and  claims are settled relatively quickly following the medical event for which benefit is claimed.  Medical expense claims are, typically, substantially fully settled within just a few months. Estimation uncertainty exists in determining a loss component, where facts and  circumstances are identified that may indicate that a group of onerous contracts exists. As  described above, a loss component is measured by comparing the current estimates of the  fulfilment cash flows that relate to the remaining coverage to the carrying amount of the  LFRC. Uncertainty is driven by the future cash flows which are uncertain due to their timing,  size and, or probability. The underlying cash flows are determined by forecasting future  claims and any other expenses, based on internal and external historical claims and other  experience data and updated to reflect current expectations of future events and current  conditions at the reporting date. Estimation is also involved in deriving an appropriate  discount rate applied, where applicable, to the fulfilment cash flows, in particular, for the  legacy individual health policies in Brazil due to the long-term nature of these contracts.  Insurance provisions are inevitably estimates. Actual experience or losses incurred may  vary from that anticipated in the reserving estimates.  The following tables show the impact on profit before taxation of reasonably possible  variations in the key assumptions used to determine the best estimate of claims provisioning  and in estimating the fulfilment cash flows used in onerous contract testing. Changes to  these assumptions are made while holding all other assumptions constant, however in  practice, it is likely that variations in some of the assumptions may be correlated. The  sensitivity analysis reflects one-off impacts at the reporting date and should not be  interpreted as predictions.  The sensitivity analysis for 2024 excludes (2023: includes) the legacy portfolio of individual  health contracts in Brazil, measured on a GMM basis, as this has been reclassified to held for  sale (see Note 15) as at 31 December 2024. Any loss is reduced only to a limited extent by reinsurance provided by third-party  reinsurers. As the mitigation impact is not material for the Group, the impact of reinsurance  is not separately disclosed in the tables below. As the impact on equity will not be materially different from the profit before taxation  impact, this has not been separately disclosed.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 182 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 185 ===== Note 13: Inventories   Inventories in brief Inventories comprise drugs, prostheses, consumables and housing stock utilised in the  course of our care, health and dental operations. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using  the first-in first-out method, or methods that approximate this, and includes costs incurred  in acquiring the inventories and in bringing them to their current location and condition. As at 31 December 2024, inventories were £67m (2023: £76m). Inventory write-downs of  £nil were made during the year (2023: £4m). The Group consumed £221m (2023: £229m)  of inventories, which are recognised within other operating expenses in the Consolidated  Income Statement. Note 14: Trade and other receivables   Trade and other receivables in brief Trade and other receivables arise in the ordinary course of business.  Note 2024 £m 2023 £m Trade receivables (a) 435  414  Other receivables (a) 153  157  Service concession receivables (b) –  30  Prepayments 156  152  Contract costs 2  3  Accrued income 76  59  Total trade and other receivables 822  815  Non-current 27  23  Current 795  792                                       Trade and other receivables are carried at amortised cost, net of provisions for ECLs. Trade  receivables relate to consideration due from non-insurance customer contracts. All trade  receivables and service concession receivables are classified as receivables under IFRS 15, as  a receivable is an entity’s right to consideration that is unconditional, i.e. only the passage of  time is required before payment is due. Other receivables relate to consideration due from  non-insurance customer contracts that are outside the scope of IFRS 15, e.g. rental  receivables. Information regarding the ageing of trade and other receivables is shown in  Note 25.5. The carrying value of trade and other receivables is a reasonable approximation of fair value. (a) Impairment of financial assets Financial assets comprise trade and other receivables and financial investments. See Note 10  for financial investments. All receivables are measured net of lifetime ECL. Where appropriate, a provision matrix is  used to estimate ECL. Under a provision matrix, receivables are grouped into customer segments and further  divided into categories by age. Historical credit loss experience and any relevant forward- looking information are then used to establish the ECL provision for each category. An  analysis of ECL provisions for trade and other receivables is disclosed in Note 25.5. All  impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement within net  impairment on financial assets. Impairment losses on trade receivables of £16m have  been recognised in the year (2023: £19m).  (b) Service concession receivables The Group previously recognised service concession receivables in respect of a public– private partnership arrangement in Spain. The partnership ended in May 2024.

Classification as held for sale Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less  costs to sell. Subsequent to initial classification as held for sale, any impairment losses and  gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. On classification as held for sale, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are  no longer amortised or depreciated.

An impairment loss of £1m (2023: £8m) has been recognised within other income and  charges (see Note 2.4) in the Consolidated Income Statement resulting from write-downs  on the classification of assets as held for sale in the year.  Net assets held for sale as at 31 December 2023 predominantly comprised a number of care  homes within Bupa UK Care Services and Bupa Villages and Aged Care New Zealand, an  insurance business in ELA, as well as a number of dental practices within Bupa Dental Care  UK. Note 16: Cash and cash equivalents   Cash and cash equivalents in brief  Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, call deposits and other short-term  highly liquid investments (including money market funds) with original maturities of  three months or less and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. 2024 £m 2023 £m Cash at bank and in hand 1,095  1,075  Short-term deposits 897  1,203  Total cash and cash equivalents 1,992  2,278                 Bank overdrafts of £nil (2023: £1m) that are repayable on demand are reported within other interest-bearing liabilities (see Note 17) in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.  Demand deposits with restrictions on use set by a third party that fundamentally change  their nature are reported within restricted assets (see Note 9) in the Consolidated Statement  of Financial Position. Both of these are considered components of cash and cash equivalents  for the purpose of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 184 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 187 ===== Note 17: Borrowings Borrowings in brief  The Group has various sources of funding including subordinated bonds, senior  unsecured bonds and loans. Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.  Subsequently, they are held at amortised cost, with any difference between the initial  recognition value and redemption value being recognised in the Consolidated Income  Statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest method basis.  The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk on certain borrowings  under fair value hedges. Changes in the fair value of swaps designated and qualifying as fair  value hedge are recorded in the Consolidated Income Statement together with changes in  the fair value of the borrowings, due to the hedged risk. A gain or loss relating to any  ineffective portion is directly recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.

On 8 January 2024, the Group acquired an additional 21.57% of the ordinary share capital  of Niva Bupa. This has resulted in Bupa holding a controlling interest of 62.98%, leading  to the full consolidation of Niva Bupa as a subsidiary (see Note 23). Niva Bupa has two  subordinated debt instruments, issued on 15 November 2021 and 15 March 2022 of  INR1,500m and INR1,000m, which have a carrying value of £24m at 31 December 2024.  These are due to mature on 15 November 2031 and 15 March 2032. Interest is payable on the  bonds at 10.70% per annum. The total fair value of these bonds, including accrued interest,  is £24m. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 185 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 188 ===== On 25 June 2020, Bupa Finance plc issued £350m of subordinated unguaranteed bonds,  which mature on 14 June 2035. Interest is payable on the bonds at 4.125% per annum. In the  event of the winding up of Bupa Finance plc, the claims of the bondholders are subordinated  to the claims of other creditors of that company. On 8 December 2016, Bupa Finance plc issued £400m of subordinated unguaranteed bonds,  which mature on 8 December 2026. Interest is payable on the bonds at 5.000% per annum.  In the event of the winding up of Bupa Finance plc, the claims of the bondholders are  subordinated to the claims of other creditors of that company. On 25 April 2023, Bupa Finance plc redeemed the outstanding maturing £250m of the  £500m 5.000% fixed rate subordinated bond. (b) Senior unsecured bonds On 5 April 2024, Bupa Finance plc redeemed the maturing £300m of senior unsecured  bonds, issued in April 2017. On 12 October 2023, Bupa Finance plc issued €500m of senior unsecured bonds, guaranteed  by the Company, which mature on 12 October 2030. The bonds bear interest on their  outstanding principal amount at a fixed rate of 5.00% per annum. The total hedged fair value  of these bonds, including accrued interest, capitalised issue costs and discounts, is £426m  (2023: £447m). The change in value arising from interest rate risk is matched, subject to any  hedge ineffectiveness, by the fair value of swap contracts in place to hedge this risk. On 25 June 2020, Bupa Finance plc issued £300m of senior unsecured bonds, guaranteed  by the Company, which mature on 14 June 2027. Interest is payable on the bonds at 1.750%  per annum. The total hedged fair value of these £300m senior unsecured bonds, including  accrued interest, capitalised issue costs and discounts, is £274m (2023: £268m). The change  in value arising from interest rate risk is matched, subject to any hedge ineffectiveness, by  the fair value of swap contracts in place to hedge this risk. See Note 25.4 for details on the Group's interest rate hedging activities. (c) Bank loans and overdrafts Bank loans and overdrafts are £27m (2023: £48m), which includes a portfolio of loans held  in Bupa Chile totalling £27m (2023: £29m). In May 2024, the bank facility held in Grupo Bupa  Sanitas S.L. was renewed to May 2025 and is undrawn at 31 December 2024 (2023: £18m). The Group maintains a £900m revolving credit facility which matures in December 2028.  The facility was undrawn at 31 December 2024 (2023: undrawn). Drawings under the £900m  facility are guaranteed by the Company. Drawings are classified as a non-current liability,  as the Group has the ability to roll over borrowings during the facility’s term, subject to  compliance with covenants. These covenants consider the Group’s level of debt and ability  to make interest payments on that debt. The covenants are assessed each six months,  therefore drawings could become payable within twelve months of the reporting date if  covenants were breached. The Group was significantly above covenant requirements at  31 December 2024, and expects to remain so over the next twelve months. Despite  classifying drawings as non-current the Group may repay any amounts owed, or increase  drawings, within twelve months of the reporting date as part of its regular cash management  strategy. The overdraft facilities are subject to cross guarantees within the Group. The bank loans and  overdrafts bear interest at commercial rates linked to SONIA for sterling or equivalent for  other currencies. (d) Other debt The Group has other debt of £32m (2023: £29m), which includes a loan from George Health  Enterprises Pty Ltd of £27m (2023: £29m). This is an unsecured facility due on 30 June 2025  and is repayable at any time prior to the expiry date. Fair value of financial liabilities The fair value of a financial liability is defined as the amount for which the liability could be  exchanged in an arm’s-length transaction between informed and willing parties. Fair values  of subordinated liabilities and senior unsecured bonds are calculated based on quoted  prices.  The fair values of quoted liabilities in active markets are based on current offer prices.  The fair values of financial liabilities for which there is no active market are established  using valuation techniques. These may include reference to the current fair value of other  instruments that are substantially the same and discounted cash flow analysis.  Financial liabilities are categorised into a three-level fair value hierarchy as described in  Note 10. Where the fair value of a bond cannot be otherwise determined from quoted  market values, the instrument is discounted using similar duration treasuries and applying  an instrument-specific spread.

Note 18: Leases   Leases in brief Leases are contracts that convey the right to use an asset for a period of time in  exchange for consideration. The majority of the Group’s leases relate to properties. The Group’s leases primarily relate to hospitals, care homes, clinics and office buildings.  Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different  terms and conditions. Property leases often include extension and termination options,  open market rent reviews, indexation uplifts or fixed uplifts. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are  not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the individual lessee company’s  incremental borrowing rate taking into account the duration of the lease. The lease liability  is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with the  finance cost charged to the Consolidated Income Statement over the lease period so as to  produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. It is  remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in index  or rate, or if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise an extension or  termination option. The lease liability is recalculated using a revised discount rate if the lease  term changes as a result of a modification or reassessment of an extension or termination  option. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the  lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date,  plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs contractually required to  restore properties to their original condition, less any lease incentives received. The right-of- use asset, excluding restoration costs, is typically depreciated on a straight-line basis over  the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset may be adjusted for certain  remeasurements of the lease liability, such as indexation and market rent review uplifts.  Restoration costs included in the right-of-use asset are amortised over the same term as the  corresponding provision, which may be longer than the IFRS 16 contractual lease term where  occupancy of the property is expected to be longer than the existing contract. The  movement of the right-of-use asset is disclosed in Note 4. The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term  leases that have a term of 12 months or less or leases that are of low value (£4,000 or less).  Lease payments associated with these leases are expensed on a straight-line basis over the  lease term.

Expenses The Consolidated Income Statement includes expenses relating to short-term leases of £4m  (2023: £2m) and expenses relating to leases of low-value assets of £nil (2023: £nil).  Depreciation of right-of-use assets is reported in Note 4. Interest on lease liabilities is  reported within financial expenses (see Note 2.5). Extension options Some of the Group's property leases contain extension options exercisable by the lessee  before the end of the non-cancellable contract period. The periods covered by extension  options are only included in the lease term if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise  the options. At lease commencement an assessment is performed of whether the lessee is  reasonably certain to exercise the extension options, taking into account factors such as the  future timing of the options, economic incentives for the lessee to exercise the options or  the lessee's past practice. The Group reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise  the extension options if there is a significant event or change in circumstances within its  control.  As at 31 December 2024, potential discounted future cash outflows of £233m (2023: £298m)  have not been included within lease liabilities because it is not reasonably certain that the  related extension options will be exercised. Termination options A number of the Group's lease contracts contain termination options. Periods covered by a  termination option are only included in the lease term if the lessee is reasonably certain not  to exercise the option. As at 31 December 2024, potential discounted future cash outflows of £54m (2023: £51m)  have not been included within lease liabilities because it is not reasonably certain that the  related termination options will not be exercised.  Future lease commitments The Group is committed to leases that have not yet commenced to the value of £3m as at  31 December 2024 (2023: £9m). Variable lease payments Some leases, predominantly of care home properties in Spain, contain variable lease  payments that are based on earnings. The future potential cash flows arising from variable  lease payments not included within lease liabilities are estimated at £31m (2023: £30m). Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 188 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 191 ===== Note 19: Provisions for liabilities and charges   Provisions for liabilities and charges in brief A provision is recognised when the Group is expected to make future payments as a result of a past event. These payments can result from a legal obligation or a constructive obligation, where an expectation has been created by the Group. A provision is made where an outflow of resources is probable  and where the payments can be reliably estimated. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the estimated future payments at a pre-taxation rate that reflects a current  market assessment of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Although provisions are made where payments can be reliably estimated, the amounts provided are based on a number of assumptions which are inherently uncertain and therefore the amounts  that are ultimately paid could differ from the amounts recorded. 2024 Long service  and annual  leave £m Customer  remediation  and legal  provisions £m Insurance  provisions £m Provision for  underpayment  of employee  entitlements £m Property  restoration  provision £m NHS dental  contract  clawback  provision £m Contract  provisions £m Chile payment  plan provision £m Other £m Total £m At beginning of year 101  15  17  23  27  56  57  –  56  352  Arising on business combinations 2  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  2  Interest on obligations –  –  –  –  1  –  –  –  –  1  Charge for year 63  16  10  9  3  42  16  215  22  396  Released in year (2) (8) –  (1) (1) (8)  –  (215)  (8)  (243) Utilised in year  (41) (1) (15) (11) (1) (58)  (6) –  (11)  (144) Foreign exchange (10) (2) –  (3) (1) –  (1) –  (2)  (19) Total provisions for liabilities and charges 113  20  12  17  28  32  66  –  57  345  Non-current 29  12  9  –  22  –  47  –  21  140  Current 84  8  3  17  6  32  19  –  36  205                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 189 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 192 ===== Long service and annual leave The long service leave provisions relate to territories where employees are legally entitled  to substantial paid leave after completing a certain length of qualifying service. Uncertainty  around both the amount and timing of future outflows arises as a result of variations in  employee retention rates, which may vary based on historical experience. The annual leave  provisions relate to territories where the annual entitlement of leave is not required to be  taken within a predetermined time nor does it expire. Therefore, uncertainty exists around  the timing of future outflows as well as around the amount of future outflows due to wage  inflation. Customer remediation and legal provisions Customer remediation provisions relate to the costs of compensating customers for losses  or damages associated with a failure to comply with regulations or to treat customers fairly.  Legal provisions relate to potential and ongoing legal claims and represent the discounted  fair value of total estimated liabilities. Due to the nature of these provisions, the timing and  potential costs are uncertain. Insurance provisions  Insurance provisions are in respect of the Group’s self-insurance and cover the excess that  arises on claims made in relation to losses arising from damage to property, business  interruption and medical, employee or public liability. Any outflows relating to this provision  are dependent on the frequency and value of claims submitted as well as the excess amount  specified within individual policies with insurers. The fund is actuarially assessed twice a year  to ensure that the provision is adequate. Provision for underpayment of employee entitlements In 2021, a provision was established in respect of underpayments of employee entitlements  affecting some current and former employees, following an extensive proactive pay  compliance review carried out in Australia and New Zealand.  Property restoration provisions Property restoration provisions relate to the estimate of costs to be incurred by the Group  in its capacity as a lessee, when dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the  site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the  terms and conditions of the lease. Due to potential future renewals of leases, the timing and  potential costs are uncertain. NHS dental contract clawback provision A provision is held in respect of amounts that are expected to be deducted from future  NHS contracts held by Bupa Dental Care UK, as a result of not meeting required treatment  targets set by the NHS in the current contract period. Contract provisions Provisions are held in respect of amounts potentially due to third parties to settle liabilities  arising in relation to performance under certain contracts. Due to the nature of the matters  arising, the timing and potential costs are uncertain. Chile payment plan provision As at 31 December 2023, a contingent liability was disclosed in relation to Isapre Cruz Blanca  in Chile and a potential retrospective liability arising as the result of adverse governmental,  judicial and regulatory action being taken regarding the method and implementation of  statutory Risk Factor Tables (used to adjust the price of insurance contracts based on risk  factors such as age). Due to the wide range of possible outcomes and regulatory uncertainty  it was not possible to reliably estimate the value of any future payments. However, in May  2024 legislation came into force that gave clarity over the quantum and steps required for  implementation of the retrospective liability. The local regulator, the Superintendent of  Health (SIS) issued additional guidance on 7 June 2024 which set out details of the next  steps Isapres were required to take, allowing for a reliable estimate of the liability at that  date leading to the recognition of a £215m provision in the year. The Group has subsequently had a policyholder payment plan approved by the SIS in  relation to the Risk Factor Tables matter which has led to a financial liability being  recognised within trade and other payables for the amounts owed (see Note 20). The  provision has therefore been released. Other Other provisions include regulatory provisions relating to settlements, penalties and levies  payable to the Group’s various regulators and other smaller provisions.

The liability will  be settled over 13 years in accordance with legislation and the liability has been discounted over this period  using a discount rate of 4.245%. See Note 19 for further details. Trade and other payables (excluding deferred revenue) are carried at amortised cost. The  carrying value of trade and other payables is a reasonable approximation of their fair value.  Information regarding the maturity of accruals, refundable accommodation deposits, trade  payables, other payables and occupational rights agreement liabilities is shown in Note 25.6. (a) Refundable accommodation deposits Refundable accommodation deposits are non-interest-bearing deposits paid by some  residents of care homes held in Bupa Aged Care Australia as payment for a place in the care  home facility. These deposits are repayable at any time when the resident leaves the facility  and are therefore not discounted but are recognised as current liabilities in the Consolidated  Statement of Financial Position. The deposits are recorded as the proceeds received, net of  amounts deducted at the election of the resident. (b) Occupational right agreement liabilities Occupational right agreement liabilities represent the amount payable to a resident on  termination of the resident's occupation rights to an independent living unit in a retirement  village in New Zealand or Australia or a care home resident occupying a care suite in New  Zealand. The liability varies according to the agreement with the resident. Changes in the  value of the liability are recorded as an income in the Consolidated Income Statement.  Residents have the right to cancel their residency agreement with the Group at any time. As  such, the liability is not discounted but is recognised as a current liability in the Consolidated  Statement of Financial Position. Occupational right agreement liabilities are held net of  deferred management fees and amenities fees receivable. (c) Deferred revenue  The total balance of £136m (2023: £116m) includes £88m (2023: £80m) of deferred revenue  under IFRS 15, related primarily to care home government funding received in advance.  The liability is released and recognised as revenue as the services are provided and the  performance obligations are satisfied. Changes in this deferred revenue balance during the year are as follows:   2024 £m 2023 £m At beginning of year 80  79  Revenue recognised  (551)  (437)  Revenue deferred 563  440  Foreign exchange (4)  (2)  At end of year 88  80                      Revenue recognised includes £77m (2023: £72m) of revenue that was deferred at the  beginning of the year. £86m (2023: £77m) of revenue deferred as at 31 December 2024 will  be recognised during 2025 as the performance obligations are satisfied. £2m (2023: £3m) of  revenue deferred as at 31 December 2024 will be recognised over the remaining contract  period.

Transaction costs of £3m were recognised in respect  of the issue. The total coupon paid during the year was £12m (2023: £12m). The RT1 notes are perpetual, with no fixed maturity or redemption date. The notes have a  first call date of 24 March 2032 and interest is payable at the sole and absolute discretion of  Bupa Finance plc, with cancelled interest providing no rights to the holder of the notes nor  being considered a default. The RT1 notes are therefore treated as equity. The notes are  convertible to share capital of Bupa Finance plc on the occurrence of certain trigger events. Note 22: Non-controlling interests Non-controlling interests in brief Additional information is provided for entities which are consolidated where the Group  does not hold a 100% interest. (a) Non-controlling interests (NCI) On 8 January 2024, the Group acquired an additional 21.57% of the ordinary share capital of  Niva Bupa for consideration of £263m, strengthening the Group’s presence in the growing  Indian health insurance sector. The additional shareholding acquired has resulted in Bupa  holding a controlling interest in Niva Bupa of 62.98%, leading to the full consolidation of  the company as a subsidiary. Non-controlling interests of £87m have been recognised on  acquisition based on a proportionate share of identifiable net assets. This is disclosed further  in Note 23. In November 2024, Niva Bupa successfully completed an IPO, reducing the Group’s  shareholding to 55.98% (See Note 23).

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 193 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 196 ===== Note 23: Business combinations and disposals   Business combinations and disposals in brief A business combination refers to the acquisition of a controlling interest in a business,  which is further defined as an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of  being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing economic benefits to the  owners. A disposal refers to the sale of a subsidiary, liquidation or closure of a  company or a business. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. Identifiable assets  and liabilities acquired and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are  measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. Any non-controlling interests  are recognised as a proportionate share of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets. The identification and valuation of intangible assets arising on business combinations is  subject to a degree of estimation and judgement. We engage independent third parties  to assist with the identification and valuation process. In valuing these intangible assets,  market-accepted methodologies have been applied. Customer relationships are valued using  methodologies such as the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method (where the value of an  intangible asset is equal to the present value of the after-tax cash ﬂows attributable only to  that intangible asset). Brands and trademarks are valued using methodologies such as the  Relief from Royalty Method (applying an estimated royalty rate to the projected sales  relating to each asset over the economic life). The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the  identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition accounting must be completed within 12 months of the transaction date. Costs related to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. (a) 2024 acquisitions During the year, the Group made acquisitions for a total consideration of £316m, recognising  net assets on acquisition of £154m. The most significant being the increase in the Group’s  investment in Niva Bupa Health Insurance Company Limited (“Niva Bupa”), an Indian health  insurer. The following table summarises acquisitions recognised during the year: Niva Bupa Fair value £m Other Fair value £m Intangible assets 41  5  Property, plant and equipment 10  19  Financial investments 477  –  Reinsurance contract assets 46  –  Trade and other receivables 2  9  Cash and cash equivalents 44  1  Subordinated liabilities (24)  –  Lease liabilities (8)  (9)  Deferred taxation liabilities (4)  (1)  Provisions for liabilities and charges (2)  –  Insurance contract liabilities (301)  –  Trade and other payables (50)  (12)  Non-controlling interests share of net assets (87)  –  Bupa's share of consolidated net assets¹ 144  12  Bupa's share of consolidated net assets 144  12  Goodwill¹ 536  38  Existing investment in associate (96)  –  Fair value adjustment to investment in associate (321)  –  Consideration¹ 263  50  Consideration satisfied by: Cash 263  50  Total consideration paid¹ 263  50  Purchase consideration settled in cash 263  50  Cash acquired on acquisition (44)  (1)  Net cash outflow on acquisition of controlling interest 219  49  Net cash outflow associated with acquisitions 219  49                                                                                                       1. Includes adjustments to goodwill £(5)m, consideration £(3)m and net assets £2m from prior year acquisitions. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 194 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 197 ===== Niva Bupa On 8 January 2024, the Group acquired an additional 21.57% of the ordinary share capital of  Niva Bupa for consideration of £263m, strengthening the Group’s presence in the growing  Indian health insurance sector. The additional shareholding acquired has resulted in Bupa  holding a controlling interest in Niva Bupa of 62.98%, leading to the full consolidation of the  company as a subsidiary. Immediately prior to the acquisition on 8 January 2024, the  Group’s existing stake in Niva Bupa was remeasured by £321m to a fair value of £417m,  resulting in the Group recording a net £309m gain through other income and charges in the  Consolidated Income Statement after the release of associated foreign exchange translation  reserves. Non-controlling interests of £87m have been recognised on acquisition based on a  proportionate share of identifiable net assets. Transaction costs of £3m have been  recognised within other operating expenses.  The Group has identified intangible assets of £41m, representing customer relationships  (£38m) and software (£3m) with useful lives of 12 and 3 years respectively. Goodwill of  £536m has been recognised, arising on the write-up of the previously held investment to fair  value (£321m) and the increase in shareholding (£215m). Goodwill is not deductible for tax  purposes, and represents the future profit growth that is expected to be achieved through  accessing the growing Indian health insurance sector. In future periods, goodwill will be  assessed for impairment in line with the accounting policies as detailed in Note 3 based on  the estimated fair value of the business. The Group has recognised £461m of revenue, and £66m of loss before taxation in respect  of Niva Bupa in the Consolidated Income Statement for the year ending 31 December 2024  since acquisition on 8 January 2024. Profit on business incepted pre-acquisition that  would normally be earned during 2024 has been recognised as a fair value adjustment on  acquisition by the Group, together with some changes to align accounting policy choices  to those of the Group. As part of this transaction, put options were issued to non-controlling interest parties  whereby the Group could be required to acquire additional shares from non-controlling  interest parties of Niva Bupa between 1 January 2027 and 30 June 2030, at fair market  value, if a successful IPO of Niva Bupa was not completed. The Group recognised a share  purchase liability of £105m on initial recognition directly against equity reserves, being the  Group’s estimate of the discounted amount required to settle the liability based on the  acquisition valuation.  On 14 November 2024, Niva Bupa successfully listed on the National Stock Exchange of  India via an IPO. The listing involved new capital being raised and the sales of existing  shares, reducing the Group’s controlling interest to 55.98% and resulting in a gain of £62m  being recognised in equity. This also resulted in the derecognition of the share purchase  liability against equity. Other In June 2024, the Group acquired 70% of two companies operating dermatology clinics  business in Spain, for consideration of £12m. Goodwill of £10m and intangible assets of  £2m were recognised on acquisition. As part of this transaction, a put option and call option have been issued to non-controlling  interest parties and the Group respectively, whereby the Group can be required to acquire  up to 30% of the non-controlling interest parties shareholdings of the two companies  between 31 May 2029 and 30 August 2029, at fair market value, subject to the exercise of  the options. The Group has therefore recognised a share purchase liability of £6m on initial  recognition directly against equity reserves, being the Group’s estimate of the discounted  amount required to settle the liability. Subsequent remeasurements of the put option due to  changes in fair value are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. Other minor acquisitions in the year included acquisitions of a private hospital, a private  outpatient care provider and two dental clinics in Poland for total consideration of £12m. Net  assets of £6m were recognised in respect of the acquisitions along with associated goodwill  of £6m. The Group acquired the Dermatology Partnership, Blackberry Clinics and London  Medical in the UK, a small clinic business in Spain and a healthcare software company in  Türkiye for total consideration of £24m. Net liabilities of £1m, goodwill of £22m and  intangible assets of £3m were recognised on these acquisitions. The Group also acquired  four health centres in Australia for consideration of £4m with associated goodwill of £4m  and seven dental clinics in Spain for consideration of £1m with associated goodwill of £1m. There was an adjustment to goodwill and consideration in respect of the prior year  acquisitions in Brazil, Poland and the UK. Goodwill acquired decreased by £5m and  consideration decreased by £3m. Included in the Group Consolidated Income Statement is revenue of £25m and a profit  before taxation of £nil in relation to those businesses acquired in the year.  If the acquisition date of Niva Bupa and the other businesses acquired during the year had  been 1 January 2024, the Group would have reported revenue of £16,968m and a profit  before taxation of £971m for the year ended 31 December 2024. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 195 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 198 ===== (b) 2024 disposals During 2024, the Group made disposals for a total consideration of £42m, recognising net  loss on disposals of £15m. The Group completed the sale of 7 care homes in Bupa Villages and Aged Care New Zealand  for consideration of £20m, one care home in Bupa Villages and Aged Care Australia for  consideration of £7m, and the sale of 2 care homes within Bupa UK Care Services for  consideration of £4m, resulting in a net gain on disposal of £3m in total. In addition, the  Group completed the sale of 32 dental clinics in the UK for consideration of £6m, resulting  in a net loss on disposal of £6m. The Group also completed the sale of 8 dental clinics in  Australia for consideration of £2m, resulting in a net loss on disposal of £8m. Other minor disposals in the year included the sale of Bupa Insurance (Bolivia) S.A for  consideration of £3m and the disposal of the Group’s equity interest in Mobile Dental Pty  Ltd. (c) 2023 acquisitions During 2023, the Group made acquisitions for total consideration of £63m, recognising net  assets on acquisition of £26m. In June 2023, the Group acquired the insurance and medical business of Asefa, S.A.

Intangible assets consisting of customer relationships  and computer software totalling £18m, other net liabilities of £1m and resulting goodwill of  £15m were recognised on acquisition. Acquisitions with a total consideration of £13m were made in Poland over the course of the  year as the Group continued to grow and enter into new market segments. These included  the acquisitions of Orthos, Stomatologia Makara and 4Dent for consideration of £13m.  Intangible assets consisting of brands/trademarks of £1m and other net assets of £4m  were recognised in respect of the acquisitions along with associated goodwill of £8m.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 196 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 199 ===== Note 24: Capital management Capital management in brief Bupa is a company limited by guarantee, with no shareholders. It is funded through  retained earnings and borrowings. The Group’s capital management objective is to  maintain sufficient capital to protect the interests of its customers, investors,  regulators and trading partners while deploying capital efficiently and managing risk  to enable Bupa to continue to deliver its purpose in a sustainable manner. All profits  are reinvested to develop the Group’s business for the benefit of current and future  customers. The Group is subject to the requirements of the UK Solvency II framework which replaces  the Solvency II framework as enacted in the UK, effective from 31 December 2024. The Group must hold sufficient capital to cover its Group Solvency Capital Requirement  (SCR), which takes account of the risks in the Group, including those related to non- insurance businesses. The Group SCR is calculated in accordance with the Standard Formula specified under UK  Solvency II. Bupa has obtained approval from the PRA to substitute the insurance premium  risk parameter in the Standard Formula with a Group Specific Parameter (GSP) which  reflects Bupa’s own loss experience.  The capital positions of the Group and its regulated insurance entities are kept under regular  review and these are reported quarterly to the Board. The Group’s capital resources are managed in line with the Group Capital Management  Policy. While the Group is subject to the UK Solvency II requirements at a Group  consolidated level, all regulated entities within the Group maintain sufficient capital  resources to meet any minimum capital requirement required by respective local regulators.  In addition, the Group and its regulated entities are required to maintain a buffer over the  regulatory minimum requirements in line with their capital risk appetites. During the year, the  Group and its regulated entities complied with all external capital requirements. The ability  of the Group’s regulated entities to transfer funds to parent entities is subject to local  solvency requirements. The Group has target ranges for solvency and leverage ratios with a view to maintaining  investment grade access to both senior and subordinated bond markets. The Group as a  whole is not rated by any rating agency. Individual debt issues and certain subsidiaries within  the Group have public ratings from both Fitch and Moody’s. At least annually, the Group carries out an Economic Capital Assessment (ECA) in which it  makes its own quantification of how much capital is required to support its risks. The ECA is  used to assess how well the Standard Formula SCR reflects the Group’s actual risk profile. The ECA forms part of the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) which comprises  all the activities by which the Group establishes the level of capital required to meet its  solvency needs over the planning period given the Group’s strategy and risk appetite. The  conclusions from these activities are summarised in the ORSA report which is reviewed by  the Risk Committee, approved by the Board and submitted to the PRA annually.  The Group’s eligible Own Funds include the Group IFRS net assets of £8.0bn valued on a UK  Solvency II basis, together with eligible subordinated liabilities, subject to adjustments for  non-available assets and non-controlling interests. As at 31 December 2024, the Group’s eligible Own Funds, determined in accordance with the  UK Solvency II valuation rules, were £5.4bn¹ (2023: £5.0bn), which was in excess of the  Group estimated SCR of £3.1bn¹ (2023: £2.9bn). This represented a solvency coverage ratio  of 176%¹ (2023: 175%). 1. The UK Solvency II Capital position (eligible Own Funds, SCR and coverage ratio) is estimated and unaudited. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 197 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 200 ===== Note 25: Risk management Risk management in brief The Bupa Risk Committee has responsibility to the Board for the oversight of risk. It  recommends to the Board a risk appetite that reflects Bupa’s purpose and expresses the  degree of risk Bupa should accept in delivering on its strategy. Bupa operates a ‘three lines’ approach to the governance of risk management: 1. Business management and employees are responsible for the identification and  assessment of risks and controls. 2. Risk and Compliance functions provide support and challenge the completeness and  accuracy of risk assessments and the adequacy of mitigation plans. 3. Internal Audit provides independent and objective assurance on the robustness of the risk  management framework, and the appropriateness and effectiveness of internal controls. The operations of the risk management framework and current principal risks of the Group  and how they are mitigated are described on pages 56-62. The Group has adopted a risk management strategy that endeavours to mitigate these risks,  which is approved by the Board. In managing these exposures, the Corporate Finance  Executive Committee reviews and recommends changes to the management of insurance  and investment risks. The Group has exposure to a number of financial risks associated with its insurance business  and from its use of financial instruments. As we operate in highly regulated industries these  risks can also be impacted by regulatory or government policy changes. These have been  categorised into the following types of financial risk, and details of the nature, extent, and  how the Group has managed these risks is described below. ■Insurance risk Market risk Credit risk Liquidity risk ■ ■ ■ 25.1   Insurance risk Insurance risk only affects the insurance entities in the Group (see Note 12). It consists of  underwriting risks which relate to the potential inadequacy of insurance premiums as well  as reserving risk which relates to the potential inadequacy of claims provisions. (i) Underwriting risk Underwriting risk refers to the potential deviation of claims experience from the actuarial  assumptions used for setting insurance premium rates which could lead to premium  inadequacy. Underwriting risk is therefore concerned with both the setting of adequate  premium rates (pricing risk) and the management of claims (claims risk) for insurance  policies underwritten by the Group. Pricing risk Pricing risk relates to the setting of adequate premium rates taking into consideration the  volume and characteristics of the insurance policies issued. External influences on pricing  risk include (but are not limited to) competitors’ pricing and product design initiatives,  regulatory environments, economic factors and claims. The level of influence from these  external factors can vary significantly between regions and largely depends on the maturity  of health insurance markets and the role of the regulator. Actuarial analysis performed on a  regular basis combined with an understanding of local market dynamics and the ability to  change insurance premium rates when necessary, subject to any pricing controls, are  effective risk mitigations. The direct impacts of climate change on health are relatively unclear but these impacts are  likely to emerge over time and the short-tailed nature of the Group's products allows for  responses to be made to any developments relatively promptly, although this can be limited  by pricing controls in some markets. In every health insurer in the Group, the dominant product or policy category is an annually  renewable health insurance contract. This permits insurance premium rate revisions to  respond quickly to changes in customer risk profiles, claims experience and market  considerations. The ability to review premium rates is a significant mitigant to pricing risk. The Group does  not underwrite a significant amount of health insurance business that commits it to cover  risks at premiums fixed beyond a 12-month period from inception or renewal. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 198 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 201 ===== Claims risk Claims risk is the risk of claims exceeding the amounts assumed in the premium rates. This  can be driven by adverse fluctuations in the amount and incidence of claims incurred and  external factors such as medical inflation. Claims risk is managed and controlled by means of pre-authorisation of claims, outpatient  benefit limits, the use of consultant networks and/or agreed networks of hospitals and  charges. Specific claims management processes vary across the Group depending on the  local requirements, market environment and practice. Any identified recent adverse fluctuations in claims experience to date are reflected in these  Consolidated Financial Statements in the claims paid and movements in the LFIC. Factors  underlying such fluctuations could include changes in medical inflation, customer claiming  behaviours, utilisation and other internal and external factors. Adverse movements in respect  of claims experience relating to future periods will be reflected in the next financial year’s  Consolidated Financial Statements. Generally, the Group’s health insurance contracts provide for the reimbursement of incurred  medical expenses, typically in-hospital for treatment related to acute, rather than chronic,  medical conditions. The contracts do not provide for capital sums or indemnified amounts.  Therefore, claims experience is underpinned by prevailing rates of acute sickness events  giving rise to hospitalisations. Claims risk is generally mitigated by having processes to  ensure that both the treatments and the resulting reimbursements are appropriate. (ii) Reserving risk Reserving risk is the risk that provisions made for claims prove to be insufficient in light  of later events and claims experience. There is a relatively low exposure to reserving risk  compared with underwriting risk due to the very short-term nature of the claims  development patterns. The short-term nature of the Group’s health insurance contracts  means that movements in claims development assumptions are generally not significant.  The development claims settlement patterns are kept under regular review to maintain the  validity of the assumptions and, hence, the validity of the estimation of recognised health  insurance liabilities. In most jurisdictions, the Group has established fee agreements with  healthcare provider groups to limit the impact of unexpected claims cost inflation. The amount of claims provision at any given time that relates to potential claims payments  that have not been resolved within one year is less than 5% in the context of the Group.  The small provisions that relate to longer than one year can be calculated with reasonable  confidence. (iii) Other risks related to underwriting health insurance business Except for the circumstances described in Note 12, claims provisions are not discounted as  claims are expected to be materially settled in one year or less from the date that the claim  has been incurred. The short-term nature of the claims means that changes in interest rates  have no material impact on reserving risk. In addition, the future premium income and claims  outflows of health insurance premium liabilities are largely unaffected by changes in interest  rates. However, changes to inflationary factors such as wage inflation and medical cost  inflation affect the value of future claims outflows.  The Group’s health insurance contracts do not contain embedded derivatives; however; the  Group is exposed to foreign currency risk through some of the insurance liabilities which are  settled in a local currency. Where possible, these liabilities are matched to assets in the  relevant currency to hedge this exposure, as described in Note 25.3. The majority of the Group’s health insurance activities are single-line health portfolios.  Even though only one line of business is involved, the Group does not have significant  concentration of insurance risk for the following reasons: ■Broad geographical diversity across several markets – across the UK, Spain, Türkiye,  Australia, Latin America, India, the Middle East and Hong Kong. Product diversity between domestic and expatriate, and individual and corporate health  insurance. A variety of claims type exposures across diverse medical providers: consultants, clinics,  individual hospitals and hospital groups. ■ ■ The Group as a whole, and its principal health insurance entities, are well diversified in  respect of insurance risk. In select circumstances the Group uses reinsurance to transfer  risk. The reinsurance used does not give rise to a material counterparty default credit risk  exposure for the Group. Restrictions are in place on the credit quality and amount of  reinsurance ceded to individual counterparties.  (iv) Catastrophe risk A natural disaster or a man-made disaster could potentially lead to a larger than expected  number of claims being received over a short period of time, resulting in higher than  expected claims costs. In the majority of jurisdictions, the Group is not contractually liable  for such claims. Risks are reduced to a limited extent by excess of loss reinsurance provided  by third-party reinsurers. Bupa’s Group Actuarial function oversees and implements  strategic improvements to ensure the overall adequacy of these arrangements. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 199 Bupa Annual Report 2024  ===== PAGE 202 ===== 25.2   Market risk Market risk is the risk of adverse financial impact due to changes in fair values or future cash  flows of financial instruments from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates,  commodity prices, credit spreads and equity prices. The focus of the Group’s long-term  financial strategy is to facilitate growth without undue balance sheet risk. In order to reduce the risk of assets being insufficient to meet future policyholder  obligations, the Group actively manages assets using an approach that balances duration,  quality, diversification, liquidity and investment return. The Group invests in a limited portfolio of return-seeking assets (principally bonds and  loans) via the regulated entities in the UK and Australia. These assets totalled £647m as at  31 December 2024 (2023: £671m). These entities use value at risk analysis (VaR) to quantify  risk, taking account of asset volatility and correlation between asset classes.  In addition to local VaR thresholds, the Group applies an aggregate VaR limit to all cash and  investments within regulated insurance entities, which is designed to limit the expected  decline in capital coverage by a fixed percentage in stress scenarios of 1-in-20 year  probability. Additional supporting controls are applied to manage the level of exposure to  market risk, which include limits on exposure to individual counterparties and a cap on the  overall exposure to Sub-Investment Grade issuers.   25.3   Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risks arising from commercial transactions and  from recognising assets, liabilities and investments in overseas operations. The Group is  exposed to both transaction and translation risk. The former is the risk that a company’s  cash flows and realised profits may be impacted by movements in foreign exchange rates.  The latter arises from translating the financial statements of a foreign operation into the  Group’s presentational currency. The results and financial position of the Group’s foreign entities that do not have a functional  currency of sterling are translated into sterling as follows: ■Assets and liabilities at the exchange rate at the reporting date. ■Income and expenses at average rates for the period. All foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised initially in other  comprehensive income, and are only subsequently reclassified to the Consolidated Income  Statement in the period in which the entity is eventually disposed. Foreign currency transactions in the Group’s subsidiaries are measured using the functional  currency of the subsidiary, which is based on the primary economic environment in which  the subsidiary operates. The transactions are translated into the functional currency at the  exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the  functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the reporting date; the resulting foreign  exchange gain or loss is recognised in operating expenses, except where the gain or loss  arises on financial assets or liabilities, when it is presented in financial income or financial  expense as appropriate. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency at historical cost are  translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction; therefore, no exchange  differences arise.  Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency at fair value are  translated using the exchange rate ruling at the date that the fair value was determined.  Transactional foreign exchange differences are recognised in operating expenses. Transactional exposures arise as a result of differences between the currency of local  revenues and claims, typically in the case of international private medical insurance.  The currency exposures are deemed to be acceptable but are kept under review by  management. As disclosed in Note 1.7, Türkiye is a hyperinflationary economy. As a consequence, IAS 29 is  applied and the results and balances for the Group's Turkish operations have been adjusted  for changes in the general purchasing power of the Turkish lira. In addition, all Turkish lira  amounts, including transactions in the Income Statement during the year, are translated to  the Group's presentation currency of sterling, using the closing exchange rate in effect on  31 December 2024. The impact of this adjustment is recorded within other foreign exchange  translation differences in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and within  the foreign exchange translation reserve in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.  The Group recognises the remaining exchange difference arising on consolidation within  other foreign exchange translation differences through other comprehensive income in the  foreign exchange translation reserve.

Foreign exchange hedging activities The Group manages its exposure to foreign exchange risk by entering into hedging  transactions using derivative financial instruments. The Group also uses non-derivative  financial instruments, specifically foreign currency borrowings to hedge foreign currency risk  on its net investments in foreign operations. The Group applies fair value, cash flow and net  investment hedge accounting. The hedging relationship between a hedging instrument and a hedged item is formally  documented. Documentation includes the risk management objectives and the strategy  in undertaking the hedge transaction. (a) Fair value hedges Where a derivative financial instrument hedges the change in fair value of a recognised asset  or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, any gain or loss on remeasurement of the  hedging instrument at fair value is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. The  hedged item is fair valued for the hedged risk with any gain or loss on remeasurement being  recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. (b) Cash flow hedges  Where a derivative financial instrument hedges the change in cash flows related to a  recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, it is accounted for  as a cash flow hedge.  The effectiveness of a cash flow hedge is the degree to which the cash flows attributable  to a hedged risk are offset by changes in the cash flows of the hedging instrument. The  effective portion of any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in other  comprehensive income until the forecast transaction occurs, i.e. when a hedged interest  payment is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, the related hedging gain or  loss is also recycled to the Consolidated Income Statement, and when a hedged business  combination is recognised, the hedging gain or loss is also recycled to goodwill in the  Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is  always recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. If the hedged cash flow is no longer expected to take place, all deferred gains and losses are  released to the Consolidated Income Statement immediately. If the hedging instrument or  hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the  cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in other comprehensive income and is  recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. The impact of cash flow hedging activity is set out below.

As at 31 December 2024, the cash flow hedge reserve amounts to £nil (2023: £7m). (c) Net investment hedging The Group hedges appropriate levels of its net asset exposures after taking into  consideration key regulatory and financial metrics. In using derivatives to hedge currency  risk, the Group designates the forward element of foreign currency forward and swap  contracts as hedging instruments. The Group hedges the net investments only to the extent  of the notional amount of the foreign exchange leg of the hedging derivative. Where the Group uses foreign currency denominated debt to hedge currency risk, the Group  designates the foreign currency exposure on the debt as the hedge of the change in the  value of the investment in foreign operation attributable to a change in the spot rate.  Changes in foreign currency exposure on the debt are determined in accordance with  IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. Changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments are initially recognised in other  comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective. Exchange differences  arising on the consolidation of these net assets are deferred in equity until the foreign  operation is disposed of or liquidated, when the differences are then recognised in the  Consolidated Income Statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal. To assess hedge effectiveness, the Group determines the economic relationship between the  hedging instruments and the hedged items by comparing changes in the fair value of the  hedging instrument with changes in the fair value of a hypothetical derivative, representing  the net investment. An amount equal to the excess of the cumulative change in the fair value  of the hedging instruments over the cumulative change in the fair value of the hypothetical  derivative, is recorded in the Consolidated Income Statement as ineffectiveness. When using  derivatives as hedging instruments, ineffectiveness is expected to arise from the effect of  the counterparty and the Group’s credit risk on the fair value of the derivative which is not  reflected in the hypothetical derivative. Ineffectiveness could also arise from currency basis,  which is present in the hedging derivative but excluded from the hypothetical derivative.

The Group is exposed to interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in market rates. This  affects the return on variable-rate assets, the cost of variable-rate liabilities and the  Statement of Financial Position value of its investment in fixed rate bonds. Variable-rate  assets represent a natural hedge for variable-rate liabilities. The net asset balance on which the Group is exposed as at 31 December 2024 was £3,511m  (2023: £2,730m). The rate at which maturing deposits are reinvested, in currencies such as  sterling and Australian dollar where the Group has a significant variable-rate net asset  exposure, represents a significant potential risk to the Group. The Group has also used interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure whereby the  requirement to settle interest at fixed rates has been swapped for variable rates. This  increases the ability to match variable-rate assets with variable-rate liabilities. Variable loans are repriced at intervals of between one and six months. Interest is settled on  all loans in line with agreements and is settled at least annually. The impact of a reasonably possible rise of 100 basis points (bps) in interest rates at the  reporting date, on an annualised basis, would have decreased equity by £29m and increased  profit by £7m (2023: decrease of £1m and £2m respectively). The impact of a fall of 100 bps  in interest rates, on an annualised basis, would have the inverse effect. This calculation  is based on the assumption that all other variables, in particular foreign exchange rates,  remain constant. Interest rate hedging activities The Group applies fair value hedges and cash flow hedges to hedge its exposure to interest  rate risk on its borrowings.  As at 31 December 2024, interest rate swaps totalling £507m (2023: £817m) have been  entered into, to swap the fixed rate coupon of the £300m senior unsecured bond and 50%  of the €500m senior unsecured bond, to a variable rate. These interest rate swaps are  designated as fair value hedges of the underlying interest rate risk on the debt. The fair value  movement in the bonds attributable to the hedged risk for the year ended 31 December  2024 amounted to a loss of £7m (2023: gain of £38m). The fair value movement on the  interest rate swaps amounted to a gain of £8m (2023: loss of £38m) and the fair value and  carrying value of this derivative is a £15m liability (2023: £23m liability). 25.5   Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that those that are in debt to the Group default on their obligations.  Examples of credit risk would be non-payment of a trade receivable or a corporate bond  failing to repay the capital sum and related interest. Investment exposure with external counterparties is managed by the Enterprise Treasury  Policy which ensures that there is a sufficient spread of investments and that cash and  investment counterparties are rated at least A/A2 unless otherwise approved. The Corporate  Finance Executive Committee approves the full list of counterparties used on a periodic  basis. There are exceptions to the A/A2 rating requirement for a number of reasons  including where local country ratings are below this level and due to certain regulatory and  commercial requirements in specific markets. In estimating ECL on financial investments held at amortised cost and FVOCI, the Group  reviews individual issuer's default probability based on a credit score model over a 12-month  horizon to determine whether there has been a material change in an issue score from the  preceding period. Where a specific default score is not available for a single investment,  average default probabilities for instruments with a similar credit rating are used.  Determining when an issuer is in financial difficulty and that a lifetime ECL allowance is  required, requires the use of judgement. The Group considers a number of factors including  economy wide and industry specific risk factors, issuer’s financial and liquidity position, near- term prospects, credit rating declines and known breaches of contracts in determining  financial difficulty. When there is objective evidence of impairment of a financial asset as a result of one or  more events and the event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the assets  that can be reliably estimated, the Group considers such investment as credit impaired.  To the extent that an investment is impaired, it is written down to its recoverable amount,  measured as the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the original  effective interest rate on the instrument. Subsequent recoveries in excess of the written- down carrying value are credited to the Consolidated Income Statement.

The amount of collateral received or posted is shown  in the table above.  For the financial assets and liabilities subject to enforceable master netting arrangements  or similar arrangements above, each agreement between the Group and the counterparty  allows for net settlement of the relevant financial assets and liabilities where both elect to  settle on a net basis. In the absence of such an election, financial assets and liabilities will  be settled on a gross basis; however, each party to the master netting agreement or similar  agreement will have the option to settle all such amounts on a net basis in the event of  default of the other party. 25.6   Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not have available funds to meet its liabilities  when they fall due. The Group's insurance contract liabilities are predominantly backed by liquid assets, held  locally, including cash held in bank accounts, deposits, liquidity funds and covered bonds  so reducing the liquidity risk exposure relating to insurance contract liabilities.  The Group’s main source of short-term funding is via a £900m revolving credit facility which  matures in December 2028. The facility was undrawn as at 31 December 2024 (2023:  undrawn). The Group monitors funding risk as well as compliance with existing financial covenants  within the banking arrangements. There were no concerns regarding bank covenant  coverage in 2024 and that position is not expected to change in the foreseeable future. The Group holds a strong liquidity position and adheres to strict liquidity management  policies as set by the Board Risk Committee as well as adhering to liquidity parameters for  the Group’s regulated entities. Regular stress testing is conducted to assess liquidity risk. The contractual maturities of undiscounted financial liabilities and the expected maturities of  insurance liabilities based on the present value of future cash flows and including estimated  interest payments of the Group are as follows: Subordinated  liabilities £m Other  interest-  bearing  liabilities £m Lease  liabilities £m Insurance  contract  liabilities £m Trade and  other  payables¹ £m Derivative  liabilities £m Total £m As at 31 December 2024 2025 (37)  (26)  (177)  (2,897)  (2,445) (10)  (5,592)  2026 (437)  (30)  (153)  (122)  (54) (1)  (797)  2027 (17)  (323)  (136)  (34)  (26) (29)  (565)  2028 (17)  (21)  (118)  (9)  (19) –  (184)  2029 (17)  (21)  (100)  (2)  (17) –  (157)  2030-2034 (101)  (434)  (277)  –  (89) –  (901)  After 2034 (357)  –  (249)  –  (73) –  (679)  Total (983)  (855)  (1,210)  (3,064)  (2,723) (40)  (8,875)  Carrying value in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position (772)  (759)  (884)  (3,064)  (2,665) (40)  (8,184)  1.

The Group has such relationships with  its key management personnel, equity-accounted investments and associated pension  arrangements. The disclosure of transactions with these parties in this note enables  readers to form a view of the impact of related party relationships on the Group. All transactions with related parties are conducted on an arm’s-length basis. There were no material transactions during the year with any related parties, as defined  by IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures, other than those disclosed in this note. (i) Transactions with key management personnel The key management personnel are the Company’s Directors and the Chief Executive  Officers of the Group’s Market Units. No Director had any material interest in any contracts  with Group companies as at 31 December 2024 (2023: no Director) or at any time during  the year. The remuneration of the Company’s Directors is £12m (2023: £7m) as disclosed  on pages 90-113 of this report. The total remuneration of the Market Unit Chief Executive Officers is as follows:   2024 £'000 2023 £'000 Short-term employee benefits 5,017  5,302  Long Term Incentive Plan awards 3,570  –  Post-employment benefits 128  131  Total 8,715  5,433                  The total remuneration of key management personnel is included in staff costs (see Note  2.3). (ii) Transactions in relation to the non-registered pension arrangements  The Company has made pension commitments to certain former Executive Directors and  key management personnel through a non-registered unfunded pension arrangement which  mirrors the terms of The Bupa Pension Scheme (see Note 7). These unfunded benefits are  governed by The Law Debenture Pension Trust Corporation plc which is the Trustee of the  unfunded scheme and is secured by a charge over £32m (2023: £33m) of cash deposits  (see Note 9). Note 27: Commitments and contingencies Commitments and contingencies in brief A commitment is future expenditure that is committed to as at year end. These relate to  contracted capital expenditure. Contingent liabilities are those that are considered  possible at year end, whose existence will be determined by uncertain future events, or  present obligations that are not sufficiently probable or cannot currently be measured  with sufficient reliability to give rise to provisions.  (i) Capital commitments Capital expenditure for the Group contracted as at 31 December 2024 but for which no  provision has been made amounted to £59m (2023: £42m). Of this, £58m (2023: £38m)  relates to aged care facility lease properties purchase commitments in Australia and  property development project commitments in New Zealand and the extension of Cromwell  Hospital; specifically £40m (2023: £13m) in relation to property, plant and equipment and  £18m (2023: £25m) in relation to investment property. £1m (2023: £4m) relates to computer  software projects commitments in Australia and the UK. (ii) Contingent assets The Group currently has no contingent assets. (iii) Contingent liabilities  The Group has contingent liabilities arising in the ordinary course of business. These include  losses which might arise from litigation, consumer matters, other disputes, regulatory  compliance (including data protection) and interpretation of law (including employment  law and tax law). It is not considered that the ultimate outcome of any contingent liabilities  could have a significant adverse impact on the financial condition of the Group.

Investment in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment in the Company’s financial  statements.  Investments are reviewed annually to test whether any indicators of impairment exist. Where  there is objective evidence of such an asset being impaired, the investment is impaired to its  recoverable value and any unrealised loss is recorded in the Income Statement.  Dividends received from subsidiaries are recognised in the Income Statement when the right  to receive the dividend is established. As at 31 December 2024, the Company held investments in subsidiaries of £200m (2023:  £200m). In accordance with Section 409 of the Companies Act 2006, a full list of  subsidiaries, associated undertakings and significant holdings in undertakings other than  subsidiaries, the registered addresses and the effective percentage of equity owned, as at  31 December 2024, is disclosed after the Company financial statements. D. Post-employment benefits The Company operates defined benefit schemes and a defined contribution pension scheme  for the benefit of employees and Directors, in addition to an unfunded pension scheme and  a post-retirement medical benefit scheme. The main defined benefit scheme is The Bupa Pension Scheme which has been closed to  new entrants since 1 October 2002 and closed to future accrual since 31 December 2020,  although members retain any ongoing salary link, with future benefits payable dependent  upon member salary at the date of leaving or retirement. Existing current employees who  were members of The Bupa Pension Scheme were automatically enrolled into a defined  contribution scheme, the My Bupa LifeSight Plan, from 1 January 2021. The recognised surplus in relation to The Bupa Pension Scheme is limited to the present  value of any future refunds from the scheme in the event of a wind up. There are no  minimum funding requirements in place and the Trustees do not have the unilateral power to  trigger a wind up of the Scheme. Once all members have left the scheme, the Company can  wind up the scheme and is entitled to any remaining surplus. During the year, deficit reduction contributions of £1m (2023: £1m) were paid and a further  deficit reduction contribution of £1m is due for 2025 in respect of the smaller defined benefit  scheme.

Deferred taxation assets and liabilities Deferred taxation is an amount which recognises the differences between the carrying  amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and the amounts used for taxation  purposes. Recognised deferred taxation assets and liabilities Deferred taxation assets and liabilities are attributable to the following: Assets Liabilities Net 2024 £m 2023 £m 2024 £m 2023 £m 2024 £m 2023 £m Accelerated capital  allowances  18  32  –  –  18  32  Post-employment  benefits –  –  (73)  (126)  (73)  (126)  Employee benefits  (other than post- employment) 15  20  –  –  15  20  Provisions 4  7  –  –  4  7  Taxation value of  losses carried forward 65  16  –  –  65  16  Deferred taxation  (before allowable  netting) 102  75  (73)  (126)  29  (51)  Allowable netting of  deferred taxation 10  8  (10)  (8)  –  –  Net deferred taxation  asset/(liability) 112  83  (83)  (134)  29  (51)  The UK deferred tax liability relating to the pension surplus at 1 January 2024 was reduced  by £38m following a change in the UK tax rate applying to authorised payments from  defined benefit pension schemes from 35% to 25%. The UK deferred tax liability of £83m  (2023: £134m) relating to the Bupa Pension Scheme surplus has not been offset with other  UK deferred tax assets on the basis that an authorised surplus repayment charge may not  be reduced by the utilisation of tax losses arising in the UK group of entities. Recognised deferred taxation assets Deferred taxation assets relating to the carry forward of employee benefits, other provisions,  unused taxation losses and other deferred taxation assets are recognised only to the extent  that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can  be utilised.

Risk management The Board is responsible for identifying, evaluating and managing risks faced by the  Company and considers the acceptable level of risk, the likelihood of these risks  materialising, how to reduce the risk and the cost of operating particular controls relative  to the benefit from managing the related risks. The Group’s risk management strategy is outlined in detail within Note 25 of the Group  accounts. The risks of the Company are considered within those faced by the wider Group.  The Company is the sponsoring employer of The Bupa Pension Scheme; risk management  for this scheme is outlined within Note 7 of the Group accounts. The Company monitors the credit quality of receivables, with provisions made for expected  credit losses when appropriate. There are currently no expected credit losses held in respect  of the Company’s receivables and the Company considers the maximum credit risk exposure  to be £2m (2023: £2m), which comprises total trade and other receivables. This excludes  amounts owed by subsidiaries; based on the Company’s assessment, these are deemed to  carry an insignificant credit risk and prepayments. The financial liabilities held by the Company comprise total trade and other payables and  lease liabilities. The contractual maturities of these liabilities, including estimated interest  payments, are £239m (2023: £184m) falling due within one year and £37m (2023: £43m)  falling due after more than one year.

Our sustainability strategy, set out on pages 35 to 40,  seeks to build a healthier future for people and planet  and comprises three missions: Mission Zero, Mission  Accelerate and Mission Regenerate.  This strategy is underpinned by actions across a wider  range of ESG topics, including diversity, equity and  inclusion, how we look after and care for our people  and how we contribute to communities where we  operate, addressing the risks of modern slavery  and ensuring strong governance and business ethics.  For more information on People & Culture,  see pages 28 to 33.  Oversight of sustainability and ESG  The Board sets the sustainability strategy and closely  monitors progress as a Board and through the Board  Sustainability Committee. Details of how the Board has  considered sustainability, including ESG matters, is set  out in the Section 172(1) and Engagement Statement  on page 44. More information about the Board’s  governance in respect of sustainability starts on  page 78.  On a day-to-day basis, the Sustainability Steering  Committee, a management committee comprising  senior and executive leaders from across different  functions and Market Units, reviews progress on  sustainability, oversees reporting, and finalises  recommendations to the Group CEO, Chief  Executive’s Committee, Board Sustainability  Committee and the Board.  For more information on sustainability  governance structure: bupa.com/sustainability  Additional information on sustainability and ESG  governance can be found in the Taskforce on Climate- related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) on page 43.

We are focused on:  ▪ decarbonisation of our own operations, supply  chain, and healthcare provision  ▪ digitalisation of our products and services  ▪ delivery of sustainable healthcare.  KPI  By 2040 we will be a net zero business,  underpinned by 1.5 degree aligned science-based  targets (SBTs) across all three emission scopes.  Targets  1. Reduce our scope 1 and 2 (market-based)  greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our  global operations by at least 40% by 2025  from 2019 baseline.  2. Reduce scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions across  our global operations by at least 46.2% from  2019 baseline and become net zero across  scope 1 and 2 by 2030.  3. Reduce scope 3 emissions by at least 63% by  2034 from 2019 baseline.  4. Achieve SBTs in corporate bonds, loans and  equity by 2025, from a 2020 base year.  5. Become a net zero business across all scopes  by 2040.  For more information on Mission Zero: bupa.com/  sustainability  Pathway to decarbonisation  In 2023, we made significant progress to drive down  direct emissions across our Market Units and indirect  emissions associated with the electricity and energy  we buy, known as scope 1 and scope 2 emissions. We  increased our use of renewable energy to 90% for our  global business and 100% in our APAC Market Unit.  For our scope 3 emissions, which refer to the emissions  we are indirectly responsible for, up and down our value  chain, we completed a comprehensive inventory and  identified our focus areas for emission reduction  activity. These include reducing emissions from: the  goods and services we purchase, the health treatments  we fund for our customers, the investments we make,  business travel and travel undertaken by our patients  and customers to appointments.  Our reduction targets are ambitious. We acknowledge  that reaching these goals may prove increasingly  difficult and costly as we address more complex  markets and infrastructure. We will continue to  publish transparent progress on our carbon  emission reduction activity.  Further information on our decarbonisation  approach can be found in our GHG Emissions  Performance, page 37.  Reducing emissions from purchased goods  and services  During 2023, we expanded our sustainable procurement  programme to address emissions and reduce our  exposure to climate risk in our supply chain. We set  targets and ambitions to support Mission Zero and  developed our ESG due diligence in supplier  onboarding. Engagement is critical to our approach  as we look to partner with our suppliers to understand  their sustainability plans, key targets, alignment with  external initiatives, such as the Science-Based Targets  initiative (SBTi), inclusion and diversity approach, and  to test Bupa’s supply chain maturity regarding action  on net zero and ESG.  We undertook focused activity with our largest  technology suppliers, increasing the proportion of our  technology spend with those suppliers aligned to our  net zero ambition from 31% in 2022 to 63% in 2023,  exceeding our target for the year by three percentage  points. We will continue these efforts and increase  our alignment target in 2024.  Sustainable healthcare  We use the term sustainable healthcare to describe  a system that meets the health needs of the present,  without compromising the health of future generations  – delivering high-quality care in an affordable way,  while minimising the impact on the environment. In  2023, we identified and began to develop a number  of opportunities to reduce the environmental impact  of the care that we fund, particularly by reducing  emissions associated with anaesthetic gases across  our global businesses and from waste reduction.  We also continued efforts to digitalise healthcare  to reduce emissions associated with patient claims  and patient travel.  Responsible investment  We ensure that our sustainability strategy and ESG  considerations are incorporated in all investment  decision-making and we prohibit investments in certain  sectors. Our Responsible Investment Policy seeks to  help finance the transition to a low-carbon economy  and favours investment counterparties that have set  SBTs, thereby enabling us to lower the emissions profile  of our corporate bond portfolio over time (see target  4 of Mission Zero).  For more information, see our Responsible  Investment Statement: bupa.com/financials   ===== PAGE 4 ===== Strategic Report                                            |  Governance  |  Financial Statements  Bupa Annual Report 2023  37  Sustainability and ESG continued  2023 Group and UK operations GHG  emissions footprint  In accordance with the Streamlined Energy and Carbon  Reporting (SECR) requirements for a large unquoted  UK company, we report our UK-based energy usage  and GHG emissions. In addition, we publish the Group’s  2023 energy consumption and GHG emissions  compared with full year 2022, and 2019, our base year,  to show progress against our interim scope 1 and 2 GHG  emissions reduction target of 40% by 2025. We will  publish our detailed full-year 2023 GHG emissions  report covering scope 1, 2 and selected scope 3  (category 3 - fuel- and energy-related activities, and  category 6 - business travel) later in 2024 on bupa.com  following external limited assurance. Our full-year 2023  GHG emissions report will reflect our most up-to-date  GHG emissions position, including actual fourth quarter  activity data which, in part, has been estimated in  this report, predominantly based on previous  consumption trends.  We adopt the operational control approach, meaning  we account for 100% of emissions from business  locations over which we have control. Under this  approach, control is considered where we have the  authority to introduce and implement operational  policies. In accordance with the GHG Protocol’s  guidance on dual reporting, we report scope 2 GHG  emissions using both the location- and market-based  approach. Our GHG emissions reporting criteria can  be found at bupa.com/sustainability/sustainability­ documents, and sets out the basis of preparation of  our scope 1 and 2 and selected scope 3 (category 3  and category 6) GHG emissions.  Market-based GHG emissions performance  Group  In 2023, the Group’s scope 1 and 2 (market-based) GHG  emissions of 66,896 tCO2e decreased by 11,063 tCO2e,  or 14%, compared with last year (2022: 77,959 tCO2e).  Scope 1 emissions were stable compared with 2022.   The reduction in anaesthetic gas emissions following  the elimination of the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) in a  number of our Spanish hospitals and lower natural gas  consumption partly as a result of decarbonisation  initiatives have been offset by an increase in refrigerant  gas losses experienced in our Australian aged care  business and our provision business in Chile.  Scope 2 emissions were lower year on year by 11,102  tCO2e, or 36%, due to switching additional sites onto  renewable electricity in Poland, Australia, Chile and  Mexico as well as the one-month carry-over benefit  following the implementation of an Australian Power  Purchase Agreement in February 2022. In addition, we  secured 100% renewable electricity in our Hong Kong  business from January 2023. This has resulted in  the increased proportion of renewable electricity  consumption compared with last year by 6 percentage  points to 90% (2022: 84%). From January 2023, APAC  operations ran on 100% renewable electricity.  Our total selected scope 3 emissions increased this year  by 8,091 tCO2e to 42,690 tCO2e (2022: 34,599 tCO2e)  due to higher business travel emissions. Business travel  emissions remained lower than 2019 by 14%.  UK operations  Our 2023 scope 1 and 2 (market-based) GHG emissions  were lower by 838 tCO2e or 5% to 17,033 tCO2e (2022:  17,871 tCO2e). Scope 1 emissions decreased by 535  tCO2e primarily reflecting the optimisation of our  building management systems and the replacement of  air handling units at the Cromwell Hospital. In the fourth  quarter of 2023, we also commenced switching our  kitchens facilities from gas to electric across our care  home portfolio. Scope 2 emissions reduced by 303  tCO2e. The proportion of renewable electricity  consumption in the UK increased by 2 percentage  points to 97% (2022: 95%) mainly driven by switching  additional dental centres onto renewable electricity  together with the carry-over benefit of switching the  Group’s head office onto renewables in October 2022.  Our total selected scope 3 emissions increased by 2,941  tCO2e to 12,317 tCO2e (2022: 9,376 tCO2e) mainly due  to higher business travel. Business travel emissions  remained lower than 2019 by 18%.  Additional GHG emissions reduction and energy  management activities  Throughout 2023 we continued to drive GHG emission  reduction across all our Market Units including an  increase in the use of renewable electricity. in addition  to the decarbonisation activity described in this section  we continued efforts to increase sustainable digital  transformation to reduce emissions associated with  patient claims and patient travel. These initiatives  included the digitlisation of radiodiagnostic tests,  the use of intraoral scanners (dental), and video  consultations in Chile and Sanitas.   ===== PAGE 5 ===== Strategic Report                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |  Governance  |  Financial Statements  Bupa Annual Report 2023  38  Sustainability and ESG continued  Inc/(Dec)  Inc/(Dec)  % change  % change  Group  Unit  2023  2022  2019  vs. 2022  vs. 2019  Total energy usage¹  kWh  484,155,360 484,570,894  508,743,037  – %  (5) %  GHG emissions²  Scope 1  tCO₂e  47,103  47,064 ³  49,444 ⁴  – %  (5) %  Scope 2  Market-based  tCO₂e  19,793  30,895 ³  72,061 ⁴  (36) %  (73)%  Location-based  tCO₂e  97,011  98,446 ³  108,541 ⁴  (1) %  (11)%  Total scope 1 and 2 (market-based)  tCO₂e  66,896  77,959 ³  121,505 ⁴  (14) %  (45) %  Total scope 1 and 2 (location-based)  tCO₂e  144,114  145,510 ³  157,985 ⁴  (1) %  (9) %  Scope 3  Fuel- and energy-related activities (category 3)  tCO₂e  26,916  27,065  28,939  (1) %  (7) %  Business travel (category 6)  tCO₂e  15,774  7,534  18,429  109 %  (14)%  Total selected scope 3 (category 3 and 6)  tCO₂e  42,690  34,599 ³  47,368 ⁴  23 %  (10) %  Total reported market-based emissions  tCO₂e  109,586  112,558 ³  168,873 ⁴  (3) %  (35) %  Total reported location-based emissions  tCO₂e  186,804  180,109 ³  205,353 ⁴  4 %  (9) %  % of renewable electricity  %  90%  84%  54%  6 ppt  36 ppt  Energy intensity  kWh per customer  14.45  15.37  18.90  (6) %  (24) %  Market-based scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity metrics⁵  tCO₂e / £m revenue  4.43  5.54  9.87  (20) %  (55) %  tCO₂e / 000's customers  2.00  2.47  4.51  (19) %  (56) %  tCO₂e / average employees  0.77  0.96  1.56  (20) %  (51) %  Location-based scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity metrics⁵  tCO₂e / £m revenue  9.53  10.33  12.83  (8) %  (26) %  tCO₂e / 000's customers  4.30  4.61  5.87  (7) %  (27) %  tCO₂e / average employees  1.65  1.78  2.03  (7) %  (19) %  Inc/(Dec)  Inc/(Dec)  % change  % change  UK operations (SECR)  Unit  2023  2022  2019  vs. 2022  vs. 2019  Total energy usage¹  kWh  146,449,691  150,897,055  163,830,698  (3) %  (11)%  GHG emissions²  Scope 1  tCO₂e  16,420  16,955 ³  20,408  (3) %  (20) %  Scope 2  Market-based  tCO₂e  613  916 ³  1,200  (33)%  (49) %  Location-based  tCO₂e  11,688  11,196 ³  14,938  4 %  (22) %  Total scope 1 and 2 (market-based)  tCO₂e  17,033  17,871 ³  21,608  (5) %  (21) %  Total scope 1 and 2 (location-based)  tCO₂e  28,108  28,151 ³  35,346  – %  (20) %  Scope 3  Fuel- and energy-related activities (category 3)  tCO₂e  6,479  6,806  5,897  (5) %  10 %  Business travel (category 6)  tCO₂e  5,838  2,570  7,114  127%  (18) %  Total selected scope 3 (category 3 and 6)  tCO₂e  12,317  9,376 ³  13,011  31%  (5) %  Total reported market-based emissions  tCO₂e  29,350  27,247 ³  34,619  8%  (15) %  Total reported location-based emissions  tCO₂e  40,425  37,527 ³  48,357  8%  (16) %  % of renewable electricity  %  97%  95%  94%  2 ppt  3 ppt  Energy intensity  kWh per customer  20.69  24.11  26.83  (14)%  (23) %  Market-based scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity metrics⁵  tCO₂e / £m revenue  4.02  4.65  6.50  (14)%  (38) %  tCO₂e / 000's customers  2.41  2.86  3.54  (16) %  (32) %  tCO₂e / average employees  0.69  0.77  0.95  (10) %  (27) %  Location-based scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity metrics⁵  tCO₂e / £m revenue  6.64  7.33  10.64  (9) %  (38) %  tCO₂e / 000's customers  3.97  4.50  5.79  (12) %  (31)%  tCO₂e / average employees  1.13  1.21  1.55  (7) %  (27) %  1.  Total energy usage includes scope 1 and 2 consumption and car hire and private cars used for business purposes (scope 3, category 6). Conversion factors issued  by the UK Government's Department for Energy Security and Net Zero Business (DESNZ) are applied to convert distance travelled data to kWh. Actual  consumption is captured from a variety of sources including meter readings, supplier reports and supplier invoices where actual or estimated consumption is  provided. Where actual data is not available, consumption is estimated based on, but not limited to, previous consumption trends.  2.  Scope 1 (direct) emissions are from the combustion of fuels as part of stationary sources e.g. natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas, and from combustion of fuels  in company-owned and leased controlled mobile combustion sources, e.g. company vehicles. Release of anaesthetic gases from medical procedures and refrigerant  losses are also included. Scope 2 (indirect) emission sources are from purchased electricity and district heating and cooling. Our reported selected scope 3  (indirect) emissions are from i) category 3: well-to-tank and transmission and distribution (T&D) losses associated with scope 1 and scope 2 energy consumption  and ii) category 6: business travel which includes air and train travel, taxis, car hire and employee vehicles (business mileage only). Other scope 3 'value chain'  categories will be published in due course. A number of emission factor sets are used in the calculation of GHG emissions including DESNZ, International Energy  Agency (IEA) and the Australian Clean Energy Regulator (CER).  3.

KPI  By 2025 we will have engaged 500 start-ups and  other key innovation partners to deliver at least  one scalable sustainable healthcare solution per  year and share these insights with our partners.  For more information on Mission Accelerate:  bupa.com/sustainability  eco-Disruptive  In 2023, we continued to bring Bupa employees,  entrepreneurs and start-ups together to tackle  sustainability challenges within our business and  the health sector through our internal talent and  sustainability innovation programme, eco-Disruptive.  Our goal is to find and support scalable start-ups where  we can add value to their sustainability solutions.  Applications were received from over 270 start-ups,  with 18 shortlisted to work with us to develop a  minimum viable product. The 2023 winner was  UniSCool, an innovative team that has developed a  liquid cooling solution for hot spots on microchips.  This technology can help to reduce the energy used by  electrical appliances, including medical equipment – it  also has the potential to increase the performance and  life of this equipment. UniSCool received £200,000 to  continue to develop its solution, while all participating  start-ups benefited from access to Plug and Play, a  global start-up innovation platform.  We also convened entrepreneurs, colleagues, investors,  media, sustainability partners and healthcare  professionals at Bupa’s first ever eco-Disruptive Live  event in London, a one-day immersive celebration  of collaboration and sustainability innovation.  During 2023, we continued to work with the 2022  winners of eco-Disruptive, Cassava Bags Australia,  which produce 100% natural, biodegradable and  compostable bags and other products made from the  cassava plant, by piloting a programme to reduce the  use of plastic across a number of Bupa Dental practices  around Australia.  For more information on eco-Disruptive:  bupa.com/sustainability  Advocacy and coalitions  In 2023, we joined the Sustainable Markets Initiative –  Health Systems Taskforce, a coalition of healthcare  companies working together to lead the  decarbonisation of the healthcare sector.We  continued to work with Health Care Without Harm,  an international non-governmental organisation (NGO)  driving the sustainable transformation of the healthcare  sector, and took part in the first sustainable healthcare- focused Race to Zero Global Gathering.  We also became the official ‘health partner’ for the  Norman Foster Institute Programme on Sustainable  Cities, an initiative launched in 2023 by the Norman  Foster Foundation. Our aim is to use our clinical insights  to put health at the centre of how urban environments  are designed, especially in a changing climate. We  launched a white paper on ‘Healthy and Resilient Cities’  in partnership with The Lancet Countdown, the Norman  Foster Foundation and C40 Cities at the United Nations  Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP 28).  Across our businesses, we undertook local advocacy  work on climate, nature, and health. For example, in  Poland we launched the Healthy Cities Index with the  Warsaw School of Economics. This index ranks Poland’s  cities and towns according to core characteristics  that are most important to provide the best living  conditions, with the ambition of helping best practice  to be rolled-out to more communities across the  country. In Chile and Spain, we collaborated with the  Jane Goodall Institute to deliver One Health workshops  to over 5,000 students to help teach them about how  our health and nature are interlinked. Our Bupa Global  Latin America business expanded its ‘Footprints of  Change’ programme, working with more schools across  Ecuador and the Dominican Republic to include nature  in their lessons, helping children to make the connection  between people and planet health.

KPI  By 2025 we will support 1 million people  each year to improve their physical and mental  health by scaling initiatives like our Healthy  Cities programme that help restore and  regenerate nature.  For more information on Mission Regenerate:  bupa.com/sustainability  Healthy Cities  In 2023, we extended our Healthy Cities Challenge,  delivering it across Australia, New Zealand, the UK,  Egypt, Dubai, Hong Kong, Poland, Mexico, Chile, Brazil,  Peru, Dominican Republic, Panama and Ecuador, in  addition to Spain, where the initiative originated in 2015.  The programme mobilises our people, customers and  communities to take part in activities that are good  for their health. In turn, Bupa invests in restoring  and regenerating urban environments, working in  partnership with organisations to help make cities  healthier places for people to live and thrive in.  In 2023, 80,000 people, including our employees,  customers and community partners, took 10 billion  steps as part of the Healthy Cities Challenge, in turn  unlocking £2 million in funding for local regeneration  projects across the world.  For more information on Healthy Cities: bupa.com/  sustainability  Broader ESG action  While our sustainability strategy focuses our action on  the three Missions outlined above, we recognise the  importance of strong foundational performance on  wider ESG topics to underpin this focused action. These  include: creating diverse and inclusive environments of  belonging, supporting the wellbeing of our people and  providing opportunities for meaningful work (for more  information see People and Culture on page 28);  contributing to communities where we operate,  addressing the risks of modern slavery and ensuring  strong governance and business ethics.  Bupa’s contribution to communities  In 2023, we updated our Community Investment  Standard to align with our Mission 2040 sustainability  strategy. Our focus remains on investing in community  programmes which have co-benefits for human and  planetary health. Each Market Unit is also required to  have an approach in place to respond to emergencies,  such as natural disaster relief.  Following the devastating earthquake in Türkiye in  February 2023, we approved a funding package of £3m  for humanitarian aid and healthcare through our local  business, Bupa Acibadem Sigorta. During the year, we  invested a further £12.8 million in our communities, with  over £4.4 million of this through the Bupa Foundations.  Community investment has been measured using the  Business for Societal Impact Framework, which includes  financial donations to charities, funding to the Bupa  Foundations in Australia, Spain and the UK, as well as  volunteering hours and in-kind support.  We continued our official healthcare partnerships with  Paralympic associations in Great Britain, Spain, Poland,  Australia, Chile and began sponsorship of the National  Paralympic Committee of Mexico. These partnerships  support athletes on their journeys to Paris 2024 and  beyond and promote greater inclusivity in healthcare  and society for people with disabilities.

Bupa Foundation, Australia and New Zealand  In 2023, in Australia, the Bupa Foundation completed  the process of becoming a Health Promotion Charity  (HPC) following approval by the Australian Charities  and Not-for-Profit Commission and the obtaining of  appropriate state government fundraising licences. By  becoming an HPC, the Foundation is now able to accept  tax-deductible donations from our people, customers,  and the wider community, thereby enabling the  Foundation to drive greater engagement and  expand the impact of its work.  The Foundation Community Grants programme, led by  Bupa people, awarded over £200,000 to 41 grassroots  community organisations across Australia and New  Zealand. The Dr Evelyn Scott Scholarship, now in its  sixth year, contributed £54,000 in prizes to support  future First Nations leaders in Australia, and continued  its support of the Take Heart rheumatic heart disease  programme, focused on improving the health of  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. In total  during 2023, the Bupa Foundation in Australia and  New Zealand invested over £1.1 million in partnerships  and programmes.   ===== PAGE 8 ===== Strategic Report                                                                  |  Governance  |  Financial Statements  Bupa Annual Report 2023  41  Sustainability and ESG continued  Sanitas Foundation, Spain  In 2023, the Sanitas Foundation continued to advocate  for inclusive sport – the joint practice of sports between  people with and without disabilities. This included the  Inclusive Sport at School initiative in partnership with  the Spanish Paralympic Committee, providing resources  for teachers, and the release of the documentary  ‘Power’ following Pincho Ortega, a professional  wheelchair basketball player, and his inclusive  sport journey.  The Sanitas Foundation also continued its awards  recognising medical and nursing professionals, and the  project Solidarity in action to provide health assistance  for vulnerable people, such as dental care for refugees,  psychological support for children in Spain, and a  mother and child health support project in Cameroon.  During the year the Foundation made financial  donations of £1.3 million.  Bupa Foundation, BGUK  In 2023, the Bupa Foundation invested over £1.8m to  help create healthier communities, focusing on practical  projects which impact both people and planet health.  The Foundation launched a £500,000 ‘Green  Community Grant’ programme in partnership with  Groundwork, helping over 230 schools and community  groups to regenerate local green spaces, directly  impacting more than 130,000 people. Through our  partner, Trees for Cities, we planted thousands of trees  in urban woodlands, housing estates and urban parks  across the UK to help improve access to green space,  benefit air quality and help prevent surface flooding.  For more information on our work in communities:  bupafoundation.org  Preventing modern slavery  At Bupa, we recognise our responsibility to help  protect, preserve, and promote human rights and are  guided by fundamental principles of human rights, such  as those in the United Nations Universal Declaration of  Human Rights.  For more information, see our human rights statement:  bupa.com/important-notices/human-rights-statement  In accordance with section 54 of the UK Modern  Slavery Act 2015 and the Australian Commonwealth  Modern Slavery Act 2018, we publish annually  statements setting out the steps taken to prevent  modern slavery and human trafficking in our  operations and supply chain.  We have a suite of enterprise-wide policies that define  our minimum requirements and expectations to ensure  compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  as well as effective risk management. These include  enterprise policies on People, Suppliers and Speak Up.  The Bupa Code gives us a simple decision-making  framework to help us do the right thing by our people,  customers, residents and patients. Our Responsible  Supply Chain statement specifically references our  expectations that suppliers respect all internationally  proclaimed human rights, including the prevention of  modern slavery, forced labour, human trafficking and  child labour. For more information about the Bupa  Code and Responsible Supply Chain statement, see  'Business Ethics and Conduct', below.  In 2023, we refreshed our modern slavery risk  assessment of our UK operations and reviewed how  modern slavery risk is considered in our supplier due  diligence process overseen by Procurement. We  deepened our understanding of our supply chain  beyond direct suppliers by completing a deep-dive  risk assessment of our workwear supply chain. Our  Australian business, in partnership with a human  rights consultancy, developed a supplier assessment  framework (SAF) for use when considering potential  modern slavery risk associated with the appointment of  new (or the continuation of existing) suppliers. The SAF  draws on internationally recognised datasets, with risk  indicators including geographic location, sector and  procurement category.  To support the development and progression of our  anti-modern slavery agenda, we became a corporate  member of the UK modern slavery charity, Unseen. We  ran internal communications campaigns and delivered  targeted training to coincide with Anti-Slavery Day  in the UK.  In Australia, we partnered with not-for-profit Anti  Slavery Australia to deliver virtual modern slavery  training to our Australian Executives and Senior  Leaders. We also developed an online modern slavery  training module for our people focused on capacity  building and practical ways to address modern slavery  risk in their business area (including training to support  the adoption of the SAF).  Across the Group, our whistleblowing mechanism,  Speak Up, makes it easy to report any concerns in  confidence and can be used by anyone who has a  concern about Bupa, our suppliers or our partners.  In 2023, no reports were received through Speak  Up relating to modern slavery.

The Bupa Code  is the moral compass for everyone that works at Bupa,  empowering us to stand up for what’s right for our  customers, residents, patients, and for each other.  It is integrated across the business into local policies,  mandatory training, people processes, including  inductions, performance and reward. The Bupa Code  is underpinned by our performance management,  risk management, governance, and audit processes.  Mandatory training is required to be undertaken by  all our people, including contractors, covering ethics  issues such as Anti-Bribery and Corruption, Information  Security, Health and Safety and Risk Management.

The Bupa Code is directly  relevant to financial crime risk management, making  clear that bribery is prohibited, and our people are  required to act in compliance with all applicable laws  and regulations. The Code is underpinned by Bupa’s  Enterprise Policy on Financial Crime Risk, applicable  across the Group, which articulates our approach  and standards to preventing breaches of economic  sanctions, bribery and corruption, fraud, money  laundering and tax evasion offences. The Policy is  supplemented by key controls including regular risk  assessments, risk-based third-party due diligence  and training initiatives with oversight and guidance  provided by subject matter experts. Ongoing horizon  risk scanning activities ensure Bupa responds  appropriately to financial crime risks emerging through  legislative changes and geopolitical developments.  The Bupa Executive Risk Committee oversees the  management of all risk types across Bupa, including  financial crime risk and other risks relating to business  ethics. For more information, see our Prevention of  financial crime statement: bupa.com/important­ notices/prevention-of-financial-crime-statement  Speak Up  Speak Up is Bupa’s whistleblowing service and can be  used by anyone who has a concern either about Bupa  or individuals/organisations providing goods or services  to Bupa. It ensures people can raise genuine concerns  about wrongdoing, misconduct, or risk of harm in  confidence and anonymously, if preferred. We take  concerns seriously and the people who raise them  can be confident that they’ll be heard, protected from  retaliation, and supported. For more information on  Bupa Speak Up: www.bupa.com/important-notices/  bupa-speak-up  Responsible supply chain  We conduct ESG due diligence when onboarding  our suppliers and during the procurement life cycle  in accordance with our framework and governance.  We expect our suppliers to abide by Bupa policies,  fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations  and conduct themselves in line with the highest ethical  standards. Our Responsible Supply Chain Statement  outlines the minimum standards we expect from our  suppliers across a range of ESG areas and is reviewed  regularly. For more information, see our Responsible  Supply Chain Statement: www.bupa.com/important­ notices/responsible-supply-chain-statement  Approach to tax  Bupa is committed to complying with tax laws  responsibly, ensuring that tax is paid in the jurisdictions  in which the Group operates based upon applicable  laws and practices. For more information, see Bupa’s  Approach to Tax statement: bupa.com/important­ notices/approach-to-tax  Protecting data and using it responsibly  Our customers and people are at the centre of  everything we do at Bupa. Maintaining their trust  by ensuring personal data is handled responsibly  and securely not only sets the foundation for Bupa’s  digital transformation ambitions; it’s the right thing  to do. We are committed to protecting data and using  it responsibly. Information security, technology and  privacy risks continue to be high on the agenda of  the Bupa Board Risk Committee. See pages 76 to 77  for more information.  Cybersecurity threats are growing globally, and threat  actors use ever more sophisticated means of targeting  organisations. In 2023, we established a strategic  project to further enhance our cybersecurity threat  response globally, strengthening capabilities across  key control areas from vulnerability management to  zero trust and security testing. We are also working to  enhance Bupa’s cyber incident readiness by exercising  our response plans to cyber attacks, building our  security culture, and developing a group-wide  cybersecurity strategy and target operating model to  ensure our collective defences continue to be effective.  In parallel, each of our Market Units has mobilised a  set of initiatives to ensure key controls meet global  standards for effectiveness, from Multi-Factor  Authentication and Privileged Access Management  to crisis simulation and recovery testing.  Compliance and disclosure  Responding to the ESG regulatory reporting  landscape  The ESG regulatory landscape continues to evolve at  pace with external disclosure requirements extending  in scope and complexity. At Bupa, we are constantly  horizon scanning to ensure we are prepared to meet  our obligations across the different geographies in  which we operate.  The two most significant ESG-wide reporting  requirements that we expect will impact Bupa, and that  we have been focused on preparing for during 2023,  are the recommendations set out by the International  Sustainability Standards Board and the European  Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive.  We have several initiatives under way across the Bupa  Group to assess our readiness to report against these  requirements and will continue that work during 2024.  In addition, during 2023 we began to prepare the  foundation for a comprehensive climate transition plan.  Our approach takes into account the recommendations  from the UK’s Transition Plan Taskforce, which launched  its Disclosure Framework in October 2023. We will  continue this work during 2024.   ===== PAGE 10 ===== Strategic Report                                                      |  Governance  |  Financial Statements  Bupa Annual Report 2023  43  Sustainability and ESG continued  Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)  The following table presents a current view on our actions and intentions in relation to the recommendations  of the TCFD.

See pages 54 to 56.  Climate change – due to its pervasive and cross-cutting nature – has the potential to  affect our existing principal risks (e.g. Property, Insurance).  We have identified which of our significant risks may be affected – or ‘driven’ – in part  by climate change over the short, medium, and long term. In line with the TCFD  recommendations, we present the relevant risk drivers across two different types –  Transition (i.e. risks resulting from the transition to a lower carbon economy), and  Physical (i.e. risks resulting from short-term changes in weather patterns and long-term  changes in climate).  See also Risk Report pages 54 to 56.  As a healthcare company, we are particularly aware of the inextricable link between  the health of the planet, climate change, human health, and healthcare.

The Group Risk Function is responsible for the oversight of  identification and management of financial, and other, risks from climate change  throughout the Group. For more information see pages 54 to 56.  We use a range of metrics to measure and track our progress against key climate  targets. These include year-on-year location and market-based scope 1 and 2 absolute  carbon reduction, business travel emissions, customer-based, revenue-based, and  average employee-based carbon intensity metrics, and the temperature alignment  and carbon intensity of our investment portfolio.
