Industry’s commitment to emissions  reduction going strong with renewables  expansion in WA Goldfields Work is well underway on AngloGold Ashanti’s  renewables power system expansion – a hybrid  wind and solar project with battery storage –  at its Goldfield’s Tropicana mine in WA.  Pacific Energy was awarded the contract to  integrate 62MW of clean energy into Tropicana’s  existing 54MW gas-fired power system in June  2023. When completed, the 116MW power station  will incorporate four 6MW wind turbines, a 24MW  solar farm and a 14MW battery storage system.  It is expected to reduce Tropicana’s diesel and  gas consumption for power generation by 96 per  cent and 50 per cent respectively, slashing carbon  emissions by more than 65,000 tonnes a year on  average over the life of the agreement.

Clearly more action is needed.  Throughout 2023, the MCA thoroughly re- examined what the industry understands about  its safety practices and cultures to produce  critical insights to stop further fatalities.  The board is determined to provide strong  leadership around safety culture, questioning  accepted wisdom in order to better analyse and  understand causes, and challenging institutional  barriers that stop industry identifying issues and  acting on this knowledge.  Safety is a priority for 2024 and members will  hear more in the months ahead. Partnerships for prosperity Looking back on the rest of the year,  Australia’s mining companies delivered higher  export revenue, tax and employment, and  continued to build on the partnerships with  Australian communities, in particular with  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.  There is good conversation underway with  Indigenous partners on how Traditional Owners  can be part of mining investment and create long  term intergenerational opportunities, drawing  on success stories like Gulkula in the Northern  Territory, an Aboriginal-owned mining company.  Delivering economic growth and prosperity is  built on trust. Mining companies understand they  must earn the trust of the community through  building a world-class industry, providing strong  returns on the country’s natural resources  and contributing to the goals of prosperity,  innovation and a better, cleaner future. Australian mining is a nation builder  and global leader; its future is embedded in  Australia’s future and the future of the globe  as it provides the essential elements of modern  life needed around the world.  Trust takes time. Since the turn of the century,  Australian mining has been building assets,  training and supporting workers, investing in  technology and challenging itself to do better.  Over the past decade this trust and investment  delivered: $2.1 trillion in export revenue generating  21 per cent of national economic growth, $132  billion in company taxes and $106 billion royalties,  $241 billion mining wages and 54,000 new jobs. Advocating sound policy The physical scale of mining and its investments  and the timelines involved from discovery  through development to delivery demonstrates  the need for a consistent, long-term policy  environment to support and nurture the sector. As I said at the Annual Parliamentary Dinner  during Minerals Week in September, Australia  is at an incredibly important juncture. This is  a moment in time. A moment which will either  usher in a new era of prosperity, through  providing the metals and minerals essential for a  transition to net zero emissions, or see Australia  miss a golden opportunity. In 2023, the delivery  of these goals was the MCA’s mission and focus. It is why the MCA unashamedly took a stand on  major policy issues, such as flexible workplace  relations laws, consistent and competitive tax  regimes, the practical implementation of the  carbon management system (the safeguard  mechanism), as well as exhaustive efforts to  work with government, other communities  and environmental groups to develop better  environmental laws.  And it is why the MCA worked so hard to build  alliances with others across the community. The  ultimate goal is to help governments understand  the real, long-term practical implications of policy. A year of challenge and delivery for  Australia’s mining industry Australia is at an incredibly important juncture. A moment which will either  usher in a new era of prosperity, or see Australia miss a golden opportunity. CHAIR’S REPORT  Australian mining  is a nation builder; its  future is embedded in  Australia’s future and the  the world as it provides  the essential elements  needed for modern life.  ===== PAGE 6 ===== 6 MCA Annual Report 2023  Leadership MCA Chair  Andrew Michelmore with Prime  Minister Anthony Albanese  at the Australian Minerals  Industry Parliamentary Dinner  in September, and addressing  guests and award recipients  at the BHP 2023 Women in  Resources National Awards. Leading the way on industrial relations The debate over workplace relations has been  fundamental. The modern mining workplace  is built on cooperation, trust and reward for  experience and performance.  This is what delivers greater productive and  shared rewards. To return to an approach that  seeks to constrain that relationship from the  outside, rather than encouraging those in the  workplace to develop their own path – whether  directly or with the help of representatives if they  wish – will undermine the long-term prospects  of the industry.  Headwinds are emerging. Geopolitical  instability, increasing resource nationalism and  constraints on free trade threaten to undermine  gains that have been secured. In early 2024,  our metals industry confronted firsthand the  destructive and destabilising effects of external  interventions on global markets.  The answer is not more bad policy. Backing  competition and innovation must come first.  And where support is needed in exceptional  circumstances the focus should be on long- term, strategic interests.  If we get it right, then the benefits will reflect what  we saw 20 years ago when China’s demand for  our resources took an extraordinary leap. Addressing productivity and investment That way forward was spelt out in the MCA’s  signature report for the year, Future Critical:  Meeting the minerals investment challenge. It is  a tale of two parts: the risks of being beaten to  the punch by other nations in the trillion-dollar  critical minerals boom and the crucial role of  government with productivity-enabling policy  settings that facilitate investment and boost  international competitiveness.  If Australia were to replicate the success of  the previous mining boom, households would  be $11,700 better off, real wages 9.4 per cent  higher and the economy $290 billion larger.  The investment task cannot be underestimated.  Mining is a difficult and at times uncertain activity  and investors require a higher rate of return to  commit large amounts of capital to projects.  Unfortunately, mining’s net capital stock is  plateauing, with investment only matching what  is needed to sustain existing operations. A step- change in investment is needed.  Globally, capital is mobile. And national  governments taking a more active role in  developments at home or in supplier countries  is disrupting markets.  Miners are well practiced at seeing through  commodity cycles and taking up the challenge  of technological disruption but cannot do it if the  policy environment is not genuinely supportive.  It cannot be lip-service; the commitment from  government must be genuine and must be real. Furthering this agenda will be a central part  of the work of MCA’s board and the secretariat  this year. In 2023, the board operated with a full  complement of directors, with a refresh of  some member representatives and addition  of new ones. I want to thank directors for their  collegiality, insight and hard work and look  forward to more progress in 2024. Andrew Michelmore AO Chair  |  Minerals Council of Australia Headwinds are  emerging. The answer  is not more bad policy.  Backing competition  and innovation must  come first.  ===== PAGE 7 ===== Image: Newmont  ===== PAGE 8 ===== 8 MCA Annual Report 2023 Tania Constable Chief Executive Officer Global economic headwinds were increasing  and a change of government had brought new  policy challenges, but the task of the MCA  remained the same: to advocate from a strong  evidence base the need to ensure that changes  in policy supported investment, lifted productivity  and increased international competitiveness.  This we did with energy and effect, even if it  created uncomfortable truths in some quarters.  It was a challenge from which we did not resile  and will not in 2024.   There remains much to do as the MCA continues  to hold the rhetoric of promises to account with  the practicalities of policy.  On the back of MCA advocacy, 2023 saw an  increased understanding that there is no answer  to climate change, and no chance of meeting  the goal of net zero emissions by 2050, without  more mining. This sentiment was captured by  the theme of Minerals Week – A critical industry.  A critical opportunity. It is vital that governments  commit to ensuring mining remains strong  and internationally competitive to ensure the  industry’s ongoing contribution to the prosperity  of the nation, regions and communities.  As I said at the Annual Parliamentary Dinner we  all know the incredible opportunities ahead: to  lead the world through an emerging clean energy  mining boom and to deliver ongoing prosperity  for all Australians. As demand for minerals and  metals intensifies, our global competitors are  responding rapidly, incentivising development,  attracting investment, encouraging growth. And  they are stealing the march.   How the nation and its leaders chart the  coming years will define Australia’s place in the  global economy and the nation’s prosperity for  decades to come.   So, if there is so much at stake, why would it  be wise, at this very time, to place even greater  restraints on Australian businesses, to further  ramp up costs on businesses, threaten  investment and jobs and compound the cost  of living pressures on Australian families.  Workplace reforms must be reversed  Despite the rhetoric of supporting economic  growth the federal government’s workplace  relations changes were nothing short of an act  of economic vandalism.  This is why, with the strong support of the MCA  board, the secretariat marshalled resources  across the business community to spearhead a  campaign against these destructive changes.   Representing the employers of millions of  Australians, this unprecedented cooperation put  governments on notice. While there were some  gains through this unified campaign, there was  no diminution in the MCA’s resolve to advocate  for the reversal of these damaging changes.   Moving into 2024, the MCA will continue to  highlight the need to reverse the changes,  and advocate for a framework that fosters  productivity, competitiveness, and ultimately, the  prosperity of Australia’s mining sector and the  national economy at large.  Mining and emissions reduction   The climate wars are over. The resumption  of calls for simplistic and blunt taxes on  Australian industry is not the way forward.  The Australian mining industry is getting on  with the job of reducing emissions at pace,  investing in new technologies, innovating their  operations, and plotting a genuine path towards  decarbonisation.  The third Climate Action Plan released in  September highlights the array of practical  initiatives mining companies and their partners  are undertaking. Importantly, the report highlights  that our companies within the Safeguard  Mechanism have achieved a 9.3 per cent reduction  in emissions. Mining is more than playing its part  in the nation’s decarbonisation efforts.   Environmental reform must be measured   Throughout the year the MCA was at  the forefront of representing the mining  industry’s interests in the government’s  consultation process for national  environmental reform.  Mounting the case for productivity while  addressing challenges on multiple fronts The MCA continued its strong record of sound public policy advocacy in 2023  to support a productive, sustainable and inclusive Australian mining industry. CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REPORT  2023 saw an increased  understanding that  there is no chance of  meeting the goal of net  zero emissions by 2050  without more mining.   ===== PAGE 9 ===== 9 This engagement to date has led to several  significant outcomes including successfully  advocating against the extension of the water  trigger to all mining projects, and establishment  of an Environmental Protection Agency led by a  CEO rather than a board, thereby reducing the  risk of decisions influenced by stacked interests  and inserting social and economic considerations  into the decision-making process.  Tax and investment   Attracting investment in mining relies on  competitive tax policies. In 2021-22, the mining  industry boosted Australia’s economy with  $39.5 billion in company taxes and $23.8 billion  in royalties. Yet, Australia’s 30 per cent company  tax rate, above the OECD’s 26 per cent average,  highlights the need for efficient tax strategies.   This means protecting mechanisms such as the  Fuel Tax Credit (FTC) system to keep Australia’s  mining globally competitive.  Potential changes to the FTC pose significant  risks to investment and employment, especially  in Australia’s regional and remote areas.   Recognising this risk, an alliance of regional  industries, including the MCA, has successfully  lobbied for commitments from the Prime  Minister, Treasurer, and Resources Minister,  affirming that no adverse changes will be made  to the FTC.  Despite these assurances the MCA remains  vigilant and stands prepared to defend against  any shifts that might compromise the FTC.  This vigilance is driven by a concern that  modifications to the FTC could effectively  introduce a mining tax by stealth.   The MCA will continue to hold the government  accountable, ensuring that the mining industry  continues to operate in a tax environment that  supports its contribution to national and global  efforts towards sustainable development.  Support for mining must be  a political imperative  This year’s Annual Report reflects the  unwavering commitment of the MCA in  navigating the complexities and challenges  faced by the mining industry.   With the next federal election on the horizon,  the reluctance of politicians to embrace tough  policy decisions underscores the significant  responsibility we carry.   Our collective efforts in advocacy, policy  engagement, and strategic positioning mean  the MCA stands ready to challenge shortsighted  policy choices.  We will continue to use every opportunity to  underscore that unless government acts to  make business investment easier, Australians  can no longer rely on mining to secure their  future living standards.   I’d like to thank Andrew Michelmore AO for  his leadership as the Chair of the MCA Board,  guiding us through a year of both achievements  and challenges with wisdom and foresight. Our  appreciation also extends to the board members  who concluded their terms in 2023, Mia Gous and  Sherry Duhe – their counsel has been invaluable.   I acknowledge the dedication and hard work  of the MCA staff. Their commitment to the  industry ensures our advocacy is impactful, our  committees are effective, and our industry’s  voice is heard at all levels of government and  in the community.   As a team we continue to look ahead and remain  dedicated to advocating for policies that ensure  the mining sector’s continued contribution to  Australia’s prosperity.

MCA’s campaign activity included both positive  advertising explaining the benefits of a strong  mining sector and issue specific campaigns  seeking to influence public policy on workplace  relations and fuel tax credit.  For the first time since launching the MCA’s  More to Australian Mining campaign in 2018,  campaign activity and spend on policy related  campaigns exceeded that for our positive  industry positioning activity. The MCA continues to invest strongly in market  research to help inform the development of our  campaigns and activity.  Regular research and  reporting provides the backbone of our activity  and is critical to ensuring the ongoing success  of MCA campaign activity.     Australia does well when Australian  minerals do well  This campaign reminds Australians of the  economic contribution of the minerals industry. Many Australians are aware of our significant  tax and royalty contribution and this campaign  explains the benefits to all Australians of these  contributions, in a direct way. The campaign focused on younger Australians  and Australians who live in areas where they may  not have first-hand knowledge of the industry,  and digital and social media platforms. Same Job Same Pay workplace relations In response to the plan by the Federal  Government to introduce damaging changes  to workplace relations legislation and in  particular same job same pay, the MCA led a  significant national advertising campaign to  increase the awareness of the issue and the  consequences for Australian workforces. Over 40 per cent of Australians saw the campaign,  whether on TV, radio, billboards, print or digitally.  The campaign significantly increased opposition  to the legislation with more people opposed to  the changes once they had seen the advertising. Public sentiment and support for  mining industry remains strong Public support and sentiment remains at historic levels despite a multitude of  political and policy threats to the Australian minerals industry. Regular research and  reporting provides the  backbone of our activity  and is critical to ensuring  the ongoing success  of MCA campaigns.

The paid media campaign was supported by  strong earned media activity. Before it was yours it was mined Developed in-house, this campaign is designed  to increase awareness of the minerals industry’s  role in providing the critical minerals required  to build and create the technology needed to  reduce emissions. This campaign will continue into the future  as there are many opportunities to educate  the Australian public about the important role  Australian minerals will play into our future. The highly successful 30 Things campaign  continued during the year with the launch of a  sports themed calendar at Minerals Week. Road taxes are for road users  In early 2023 the Fuel Tax Alliance, led by the  MCA, launched a new campaign highlighting the  importance of the fuel tax credit scheme to the  current and future prosperity of regional Australia. The campaign features regional businesses and  reframes the debate away from false claims that  it is a fossil fuel subsidy. The MCA will continue to work with the Fuel  Tax Alliance in 2024 to highlight the importance  of retaining the fuel tax credit scheme in its  current form. The Fuel Tax Credit Alliance remains strong, with  the membership growing from other industry  organisations worried about concerned about  the impact on their businesses if the scheme  was removed.  Campaign mugs The MCA’s  ‘Before it was yours it was mined’  campaign mug reached viral  heights after a recipient posted  it online. A temporary pop up  shop was launched to respond  to demand, with more than  6000 mugs sold and distributed  around Australia and the brand  shared with mining bodies  abroad, included in New Zealand  and the Philippines. 5 February 2024 Fuel tax credits campaign roadtaxesareforroadusers.com.au Digital campaign  ===== PAGE 12 ===== 12 Future Critical  presents a reform agenda for  the minerals industry over the next 10 years.  The analysis finds that the international  competitiveness of Australia’s minerals industry  will determine the extent to which economic  benefits can be captured as the world transitions  to net zero emissions.  Competitiveness in the Australian context  comes from improving productivity growth  across the economy to ensure the nation’s  comparative advantages (geology and  proximity to key markets; and more recently  well-established education development and  sound governance) are converted into better  outcomes in the international market place.  Government policies play a contributing role  in achieving these outcomes along side the  private sector’s endeavours.   On the back of this latest research, and  consistent with member input over many years,  the MCA continued advocating for policies  aimed at removing impediments to investment  and ensuring Australia is well positioned for  the next wave of mining investment for this  generation and the next. Future Critical, which informed a range of  MCA submissions throughout 2023, including the 2024-25 pre-budget submission, reinforces  the proposition that growth in the stock of capital  investment as part of the mining boom earlier  this century produced long-term economic  benefits to households and businesses across  the nation: creating more jobs, higher paying  jobs and highly productive workplaces. Yet the report also highlights that investment  conditions for Australia’s minerals industry  is becoming challenging. Changing market  dynamics, rising costs and government policy  settings that impede investment in projects  could threaten Australia’s status as a favourable  destination for global mining investment.  Furthermore, international competition for  capital investment is increasing from established  and emerging resource rich countries taking  action to strengthen and grow their minerals  sector. This competition will only increase as  more countries seek to capture the economic  contribution from their mineral resources. For Australia to retain its competitive advantage  in mining and minerals exports and expand  minerals processing and mining-related  manufacturing, it is essential that government  improve investment conditions by reducing the  industry’s regulatory burden and supporting  competitive project returns. Achieving this requires policy settings that  deliver internationally competitive tax settings,  expanded trade and investment opportunities,  efficient and effective regulation, productive  workplace arrangements, an efficient  transformation to net zero emissions and  industry-focussed skills and training. Government must reduce policy distortions  and disincentives that are limiting investment in  Australia’s minerals industry to give Australians  the best chance of benefiting from the global  clean energy transition. If it does, the benefits will  be widespread and durable. If it does not, there  are considerable downside risks to the economy. Australia risks dealing itself out of trillion-dollar critical minerals markets unless  governments get serious about policy settings that facilitate investment. The MCA released a  landmark report Future  Critical: Meeting the  minerals investment  challenge during  Minerals Week 2023. Productivity growth is key  to unlocking minerals investment  C R I T I C A L MEETING THE MINERALS INVESTMENT CHALLENGE  ===== PAGE 13 ===== 13 Australia has the minerals, but is being outpaced by competitors Australia has enviable reserves of future critical minerals but risks falling behind other highly competitive  resource-rich countries with a strong political focus on the energy transition.

Eighty-eight per cent of mining workers were  permanently employed and 96 per cent are  full-time. The industry also paid the highest  average wages – approximately $151,500 a year  compared to $98,400 across all sectors.  Given the success of mining as an employer,  the MCA applied considerable effort to  counter ill conceived and detrimental policies  on workplace relations. A number of highly  regressive changes to workplace laws have  been passed by the federal parliament. These  add to the negative changes previously passed  in 2022. Whilst the individual impact of these  measures will invariably be damaging to  individual businesses, the cumulative impact  risks undoing a generation of productivity  enhancing workplace arrangements that have  underpinned the industry’s success. The most regressive elements included: •	 ‘Same Job, Same Pay’ laws, which apply to  an extremely broad range of commercial  arrangements, including service contractors •	 Multi-employer bargaining, including the  coercive ‘single interest employer’ bargaining  stream, under which employers can be roped  in to ‘agreements’ against their will •	 More union access and workplace delegates  rights – enshrining workplace conflict and  imposing unreasonable costs on employers •	 ‘Intractable bargaining’ laws that force  employers into arbitrations which can never  lead to ‘less favourable’ outcomes  for employees and unions. Over the past 12 months, the MCA has led the  business community in its public advocacy  against the federal government’s workplace  changes. In doing so, it managed to achieve  a previously unprecedented level of public  awareness and business unity. It is regrettable  that the government chose to ignore the  concerns of industry and persist with an agenda  which is a constraint on productivity and went  beyond both its election policies and previous  commitments to the industry.  Despite the robust advocacy, the key position  of anti-mining parties and independents saw  the changes passed. The MCA maintains the  government’s changes will reduce productivity  and compromise Australia’s competitiveness  in global export markets. The laws are also  becoming a decisive material factor in whether  new projects proceed or not, and whether  billions of dollars in investment capital is invested  in Australia or elsewhere. Moving into 2024, the MCA will continue to  support a united and proactive in defence of  industry’s record and highlight the need to  reverse the damage these changes will produce. Mining jobs have tripled in the past two decades, but regressive workplace  reforms risk undoing a generation of productivity enhancing arrangements.  The MCA will continue  to support a united and  proactive defence against  the federal government’s  anti-business policies.

AAP 4 June 2023  ===== PAGE 17 ===== 17 Starting in December 2022, when the Australian  government announced a review of its critical  minerals strategy, the MCA argued that putting  business growth and investment at the centre  of policy making was vital for success. Only this  approach would ensure the nation realised its  geological endowment and made the most of  its world leading exploration geoscience and  significant skills and technical expertise.  Without investment in mining and early stage  processing, there could be no opportunities for  mid- and end-stage manufacturing in Australia  regardless of stated government policy goals.  The MCA relentlessly argued that priority work  was needed with international partners (for  example the USA, Japan, South Korea, India,  UK and Europe) to establish preferential policy,  supply chain and trade connections.  The domestic challenge that remains is the same  that confronts mining in general: governments  must review domestic policy and regulatory  settings, remove economic and policy friction  points and target infrastructure inefficiencies  that drag on economic objectives. In June 2023, the federal government released  its revised Critical Minerals Strategy 2023- 2030. While the strategy’s high level focus areas  included priorities set out by the MCA, more  detail was needed on how to make it happen  quickly in practical terms.  In response, the MCA detailed the policy  reform program needed to operationalise  the strategy, including: the role of common- user infrastructure in catalysing economic  development, reducing domestic regulatory  burden, working with strategic partners to  generate value and supply chain security  and streamlining administration throughout a  complex project approvals landscape. In addition, the MCA engaged directly with  missions including the USA, Japan, Republic  of Korea, UK, EU and India as well as the  International Energy Agency and World  Economic Forum to ensure consistent  messaging into the Australian government from  strategic partners and global agencies.  The Australian government has acknowledged  there are priority reform areas that overlap  industry’s advice and signaled further work, such  as on market frameworks for critical minerals  and strategic partnerships between Australia  and countries such as South Korea and Japan.  Work is also underway on enabling planning and  investment in common infrastructure for mining  and processing, and a review of Australia’s  foreign investment framework.  In July 2023 the government, following a  review of the critical minerals list, established  a new strategic materials list beside the critical  minerals list. Molybdenum, copper, nickel and  aluminium were added to the lists. Nickel was  moved to the critical mineral list in February  2024 following intervention by the MCA.  Advocacy in 2023 centred on the critical importance of mining investment in  the face of strong and growing competition from other countries. Streamlined approvals,  common infrastructure  and easing the regulatory  burden are key to realising  Australia’s critical minerals  opportunity.

With locations in Queensland and New  South Wales, Peabody continues its work  alongside Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  peoples. Revealing Country serves as an  acknowledgement not only to the story of  Peabody, but as a legacy for future generations. ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY Good environmental, social and governance  (ESG) performance relies on ongoing investment  in workforce capability, research, technology  and innovative practice to improve safety and  workforce diversity, reduce emissions and water  use, support biodiversity and reduce waste. Two elements stand out. First, the industry is  committed to the protection of Australia’s unique  environment as partners with local communities,  First Nations’ landholders and groups, non- government organisations and others to support  broader environmental and social objectives.  Second, MCA members are implementing  the globally recognised Towards Sustainable  Mining (TSM) system which will provide greater  accountability and transparency of the industry’s  performance at site level – where it matters most. In 2023, TSM expanded to include a new protocol  on equitable, diverse and inclusive workplaces  and the inclusion of psychological safety, setting  a global benchmark of good performance.  Additionally, a multi-stakeholder advisory panel  was established to oversee the TSM program  and create a forum for national dialogue  between the industry and key stakeholders.  The MCA continues to support members  through nation-wide training. Implementation  will continue through to 2025-26, with reporting  of early aggregate results in 2024. On another front, the Australian government is  designing a new overarching Nature Positive Act  to replace the existing Environment Protection  and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, with  changes expected to be introduced into  parliament in 2024. While well-designed reforms  will offer opportunities to address longstanding  issues with assessment and approval  processes, and better outcomes for both the  environment and business, aims supported by  the MCA, significant risks have emerged.  These include moving from balanced decision  making that considers sustainable development  to decisions made on environmental grounds  only; handing all approval decisions to an  independent body (Environmental Protection  Australia, or EPA); low thresholds for excluding  development; and what transitional arrangements  will be put in place for existing projects.    The more positive aspects for industry include  an offsets fund and the ability to use data from a  new environmental information agency (EIA) to  avoid lengthy assessments.  The Stage 2 changes establish the EPA and EIA  will be introduced into Parliament in mid 2024,  with Stage 3 full suite of Nature Positive reforms  to be introduced later. The MCA will continue to strongly represent the  industry’s interests in this process to support  a practical federal approvals regime and hold  government to account on their commitment to  business and the environment. Australian mining’s ESG credentials position the industry well to meet future  demand growth, however government policy settings are critical. TSM took major  steps in 2023 with the  establishment of a multi- stakeholder advisory  panel, training and site  gap analysis. TSM implementation continues  with establishment of advisory panel  ===== PAGE 19 ===== 19 CLIMATE AND ENERGY Building on the MCA’s Climate Action Plan  launched in 2020, the MCA was actively involved  in discussions about the expansion of the federal  government’s central industrial sector emissions  policy – the safeguard mechanism. Critically, the MCA convinced government that  managing the risk of uncapped compliance  costs would be vital in maintaining confidence  in investment in Australia’s industrial sector. An  effective cap on the cost of compliance was part  of the final package of changes, with more work  needed in 2024 to ensure that investment can  continue on a practical and predictable basis.  Important policy development work remains  to determine the international best practice  frameworks for baselines for new facilities  entering the safeguard mechanism scheme. This  is vital not only for Australian competitiveness  but also to protect the integrity of global  emission reduction goals by preventing ‘carbon  leakage’ – the shift of production to jurisdictions  with different emissions reductions obligations.  These issues will come into sharper focus  as government develops six sectoral  decarbonisation plans for key sectors –  resources, industry, energy and electricity,  agriculture and land, transport and the built  environment. These will ensure the economy  is on track to achieve its 2030 target, inform  the 2035 target (to be submitted to the United  Nation’s processes in 2025), and be the  basis of the plan for net zero by 2050. The  MCA is engaging with members, government  departments and the Climate Change Authority  which is consulting on technology pathways to  inform these sectoral plans. The need for efficient, reliable and cost-effective  energy from a variety of sources remains vital  for industry both today but also in making a path  to net zero emissions by 2050. The Australian  government is developing decarbonisation  plans which will be important in creating a path  forward for energy intensive systems. During 2023, the MCA undertook further  work on understanding the challenges around  decarbonising electricity given that electrification  forms an important pathway for emissions  reduction in mining and minerals processing. This work has supported the MCA’s advocacy  for a technology-agnostic approach to energy  system development in Australia.  Allowing for  nuclear energy, and continued development  support for carbon capture use and storage, will  allow such dispatchable technologies to support  the strong and on-going roll out of renewable  technologies in Australia. The MCA continued to work constructively with governments to manage  the practical implications of national and international policies and targets. Safeguard mechanism the focus  of advocacy efforts in 2023 An effective cap on the  cost of compliance was  an important concept  strongly advocated for  by the MCA, and which  was reflected in the final  package of safeguard  reforms.  ===== PAGE 20 ===== 20 MCA Annual Report 2023 Stable and internationally competitive tax  settings are essential to attracting investment  in long life, large-scale mining projects. These  projects create jobs, develop critical skills,  produce minerals essential for the transition to  a low emissions global economy and generate  revenue to fund government services.  In 2021-22 the industry paid $39.5 billion in  company tax and $23.8 billion in royalties. The  minerals industry contributes more than one- third of all the company tax collected and more  than half of the company tax collected from large  business. In the ten years to 2021-22, the industry  paid $168 billion in company tax and $127 billion in  royalties – a staggering $295 billion contribution  to government revenues. At 30 per cent, Australia has the third highest  company tax rate of developed countries  (members of the Organisation for Economic  Cooperation and Development), well above  the OECD weighted average of 26 per cent. In  addition, the industry pays royalties, payroll tax  and land tax to state and territory governments.  Threats to the fuel tax credit (FTC) regime,  which has been in place for decades and is  well established in tax policy, creates risks for  investment and jobs in regional and remote  areas of Australia.  For the past decade, an alliance of regional  industries has stood together to defend the  FTC – a mechanism to ensure a key business  input used by industries off road is not taxed. The  industry secured commitments from the Prime  Minister, Treasurer and Resources Minister that  the government would not make any adverse  changes to the FTC.  The government’s multinational tax package  (changes to thin capitalisation and enhanced  public reporting of tax payment data) will affect  the industry and MCA has been highlighting  potential harm. Numerous amendments were  obtained to the thin capitalisation rules to align  them to international OECD best practice. In  addition, the government agreed to a 12 month  deferral of the commencement of the enhanced  tax reporting measures. This will enable industry  to adequately prepare for the new tax reporting.  In 2024, it is apparent that Australia’s tax settings  are not competitive with some key mineral  producing countries, in particular the USA and  Canada. For the industry to attract investment  it is vital that Australia utilises all policy levers,  including taxation, to ensure Australian mining  remains internationally competitive.  Australia’s miners poured a staggering $295 billion in company tax and  royalties into government revenue in the decade to 2021-22.   Australia’s minerals  industry pays more than  half of total company  tax collected from big  business in Australia. Investment outlook undermined by  globally uncompetitive tax settings TAXATION  ===== PAGE 21 ===== 21 Fatality prevention project work is advancing  in 2024, with the development of a series of  resources detailing previous research findings  and recommended preventative measures. The  MCA has reached out to Safe Work Australia  (SWA) which has committed to collaborating  with the MCA, particularly with how to share  MCA data in a way that can lead to better  policies and practices.  MCA has continued to advocate for incident  classification and legislative reviews to better  enable businesses to collaborate to improve  safety. The primary goal is to allow businesses  to freely share information related to serious  workplace incidents without risk of prosecution  or breach of legal privilege. The MCA continues to engage with SWA on a  range of policy areas. This includes workplace  exposure standards, governance, data and  statistics, the incident notification framework  and more. The CEO of SWA, Marie Boland  AO has committed to participating in the MCA  Safety Roundtable in April 2024. In the past 12 months, the MCA has achieved a  new level of engagement with the Department  of Employment and Workplace Relations, the  Employment Minister’s office, SWA members  and the state mining chambers. These all  provide platforms for sharing industry concerns,  highlighting unintended consequences, reducing  duplication of efforts, and advocating for positive  and meaningful legislative change for industry.  Mental health, wellbeing and psychosocial  safety also remain at the forefront of the Safety  and Health portfolio.  The MCA and the University of Queensland  have continued with research into understanding  behavioural psychosocial hazards in the mining  industry. Phase one provided an industry  specific literature review of the intersection of  non-behavioural and behavioural psychosocial  hazards. Phase two will analyse MCA member’s  reporting structures, processes, and culture. The  findings of this project will inform a best practice  guide into managing mining psychosocial hazards. The MCA is in the process of developing a  revised Respect@Work Toolkit, with an updated  National Industry Code to Eliminate Sexual  Harassment from Australian Mining. The mining  industry has made positive progress to achieve  a reduced rate of reported sexual harassment,  down to 32 per cent in 2022 from 40 per cent in  2018, dropping below the national incident rate  of 33 per cent. There is still more to be done. Tragically, six mine workers did not return home in 2023. This makes the work  of the MCA’s Fatality Prevention Project Working Group all the more important.  The safety, health and  wellbeing of employees  working in the Australian  mining industry remains  industry’s core priority. Working with industry and government  to create a safer mining industry HEALTH AND SAFETY  Training materials The  Fatality Prevention Project is  developing training materials to  support mine safety education  and awareness campaigns,  including posters, editable slide  decks, social media posts and  short animated videos.    ===== PAGE 22 ===== 22 Award ceremony National Portrait Gallery BHP 2023 Women in Resources National Awards    5 September 2023 Australian Minerals Industry Parliamentary Dinner    4 September 2023 Great Hall, Parliament House Parliamentary Dinner   Great Hall, Parliament House   Minerals Week  4-6 September 2023 WIRNA 2023   Newmont Excellence in Diversity Programs             and Performance Award Portrait Gallery Rio Tinto Aluminium  Women in Leadership Program YEARS  ===== PAGE 23 ===== 23 MCA Annual Report 2023 Minerals Week Conference Hyatt Hotel Canberra Category winners Dr Bianca Newcombe OptiFroth Megan Parry Energy Resources of Aust Lindsay Gerrard INPEX Joana Sousa BHP Lucy McClean Women in Mining NSW Dyno Nobel Exceptional  Woman in Australian  Resources Newcrest Exceptional  Young Woman in  Australian Resources The Bloomfield Group  Outstanding Australian  Tradeswoman, Operator  or Technician Maptek Woman in  Resources Technological  Innovation Award Rio Tinto Inclusion and   Diversity Champion in  Australian Resources  YEARS Minerals Week 2023   Hyatt Hotel Canberra    ===== PAGE 24 ===== 24 MCA Annual Report 2023 More than 250 representatives from resource  companies, government and family members  of finalists joined in the celebrations at the  National Portrait Gallery in Canberra.

MCA ACHIEVEMENTS 2023  ===== PAGE 32 ===== 32 MCA Annual Report 2023 MCA VICTORIAN DIVISION In the 20 years since the Victorian Chamber  of Mines formed the Victorian Division of the  Minerals Council of Australia, MCA Victoria has  strongly advocated for the minerals sector and  achieved important policy outcomes to help the  industry grow and benefit local communities. Reflecting on achievements in this milestone  year for the Victorian industry, key successes   include the MCA Victoria/Victorian Farmers  Federation land access guide for landowners,  30 years of the Victorian Mine Rescue  Competition (VMRC), the formation of the  Melbourne Mining Club (MMC), the Victorian  Women in Resources Awards, school education  programs in earth sciences and careers,  important policy outcomes including low impact  exploration approvals and legislative reform,  as well as keeping mining and exploration open  during the COVID-19  pandemic through the  application of MCA health protocols.  In 2023, MCA Victoria built on this positive  legacy with successful advocacy for legislative  reforms. The establishment of Resources  Victoria in 2023 further underlines the growing  importance of Victoria’s resources industry  to the state’s future.    Streamlining regulation MCA Victoria successfully advocated for the  Earth Resources Approvals Coordinator to  support complex mine approvals through  multiple regulatory agencies. MCA Victoria  also supported legislative reform to modernise  approvals frameworks through the new Mineral  Resources and Extractive Industries Act. Reform  of work plans is a priority area for the MCA to  improve approvals timeframes and certainty. School partnerships and skills promotion MCA Victoria’s mining career field trips hosted  over 250 students from 15 schools to Victorian  mines in 2023. Since the program’s inception  in 2022, more than 600 students from 29  schools have had the unique opportunity to visit  operating mines to learn about careers with  hands-on mine site tours and access to workers  across a range of diverse mining roles. In a major outcome, MCA Victoria successfully  led the development and accreditation of the  new Course in Mining Pathways to promote  skills development in regional Victoria. MCA  Victoria further ensured mining’s inclusion in  Victoria’s Skills Plan through active engagement  through the Victorian Skills Authority.  MCA Victoria also supported earth sciences  through the Teacher Earth Science Education  Program and Science Talent Search Awards. Reflecting on 20 years of the peak industry body, a united industry working  together on common policy and community outcomes is making headway. Policy advocacy  and outreach programs  helped meet MCA  Victoria’s key strategies  across regulatory and  community areas  of focus. MCA Victoria builds on two decades  of policy and community advocacy  Working together MCA Victoria  and Novo Resources at a careers  expo in Castlemaine; MCA Victoria  Environment & Community Working  Group members at Southern Cross  Gold’s new Kilmore core shed; and  James Sorahan at Agnico Eagle’s  Fosterville Gold Mine open day. James Sorahan Executive Director  MCA Victoria  ===== PAGE 33 ===== 33 Working for a safe industry MCA Victoria delivered the 30th Victorian  Mine Rescue Competition at Stawell Gold  Mine and hosted quarterly safety and health  workshops with mine safety representatives and  WorkSafe Victoria.  MCA Victoria also organised mine site  familiarisation visits for emergency services,  including Victorian Police and Ambulance  Victoria, with Central Victorian mines building  on the MCA Victoria Emergency Management  Guide for emergency services and mines. Supporting best practice  MCA Victoria working groups met across  regional Victoria  throughout the year to  share environment, community and safety  best practice. MCA Victoria hosted a valuable  workshop on community engagement training  as the industry grows and interacts with more  regional communities.   MCA Victoria also supported community  understanding of mining through the publication  of new factsheets on the mining industry in  Victoria and environmental rehabilitation. Promoting regional leadership MCA Victoria hosted the Victorian Women  in Resources Awards, and sponsored the  Wimmera Leadership Program and the  LEAD Loddon Murray Leadership program to  foster development for young professionals in  regional Victoria. Networking and promotion As the joint venture partner of Melbourne Mining  Club (MMC) with AusIMM, the MCA supported  MMC with multiple well-attended MMC lunches  and Cutting Edge information evenings in 2023.  MMC is a not-for-profit joint venture formed by  the MCA and AusIMM with a volunteer steering  committee as a forum for networking and to  promote the resources industry. MCA Victoria also effectively represented  members on multiple government advisory  groups as the voice for mining in Victoria.  Victoria’s industry continues to benefit from  MCA member input to support the sector  through MCA Victoria Council and priority  policy working groups. School outreach  Weeroona  College Bendigo students visit  Mandalay Resources' Costerfield  operations; Melbourne Storm  player Josh King talks to Rochester  Secondary College students about  careers in mining, and James  Sorahan during a careers visit to  East Loddon  P-12 College.   Safety and diversity Victorian  Women in Resources Awards  recipients with Minister for  Resources, the Hon Lily  D'Ambrosio MP and Bendigo  Mayor Cr Andrea Metcalf; and  below, a 2023 Victorian Mine  Rescue Competition scenario  at Stawell Gold Mine.   ===== PAGE 34 ===== 34 MCA Annual Report 2023 MCA NORTHERN TERRITORY DIVISION Mining maintained its position as a leading  contributor to the NT economy; providing close  to a third of the Territory’s gross state product.  This contribution isn’t just limited to financial  contributions, it has also provided employment  and training opportunities, community  investment, infrastructure and frontline  emergency services. Improved policy and regulatory settings The NT government released the long-awaited  Minerals Development Taskforce (MDT) report  into lifting NT mining as it heads to a $40 billion  economy by 2030. Government implemented  some changes, with mixed results.  Fulfilling an election commitment to amend  environmental protection legislation, the  government moved approval decision making  from the mining minister to the environment  portfolio, and the Mine Management Act 2001  was repealed.  While MCA NT argued that this change was  not needed, the MCA nonetheless secured  specific mining provisions, including a tiered  licencing system to speed up approvals by the  Department of Environment, Parks and Water  Security. MCA NT also advocated for sensible  changes to the NT Legacy Mines Remediation  Act, which will see the administration of the  Legacy Mine Strategy and the NT’s Legacy  Mines Fund clearly define what is considered  a legacy mine and take stock of how and why  these historic mines need to be rehabilitated.  MCA NT undertook extensive analysis of the  proposed changes and successfully advocated  for industry to ensure reforms were workable  and would not hinder the industry’s growth,  development and prosperity.  MCA NT also worked with the Territory  Government to advance acceptance of the  broader resources industry, which was found  by the MDT to be critical for industry expansion,   and to ensure policy changes stemming from  MDT recommendations support the goal of  attracting investment in minerals projects. A significant part of this work program is the  review of the NT Minerals Royalty Scheme and  a change from the current hybrid-profit based  scheme, a complex approach which is difficult  to understand and administer, to an ad valorem  scheme to increase competitiveness of the  Territory in attracting investment.  Creation of a NT minerals display  Like many other Australian jurisdictions, the  NT is acutely aware of the potential impact a  prolonged skills and workforce deficit will have  on operations and growth of the industry. MCA  NT has been working with member companies  and government to identify what stops school  Improved policy and regulatory settings were a key area of focus of the MCA  NT Division throughout the year, as the Territory government looked to 2030. The NT government’s  landscape of mining  regulation and approvals  underwent significant  changes in 2023.  NT mining delivered close to a third  of the Territory’s wealth in 2023  MCA NT at NT Resources  Week in September; and Amber  Jarrett (MCA NT) and Lachlan  Hallett (AusEarthEd) at the Bite  of Science, National Science  Week held at Charles Darwin  University in August.

With exposure to mining often limited, the  MCA NT has been working on tangible ways to  support education and outreach. With ore and  raw material samples provided by members,  the MCA NT has curated an NT minerals display  that showcases commodities found within the  Territory and links them to the end products   needed for day to day life.  This interactive display has been used to  engage with the public and drive support for the  mining industry, and will be taken into schools  to promote careers in earth sciences and the  broader industry. The display has also been  a catalyst for MCA NT to engage with future  school leavers. MCA NT will leverage this  engagement at career expos and to advocate  for favourable skills and workforce policies.  Local and trusted industry  The MCA NT ramped up engagement with  Traditional Owners and Land Councils in 2023.  The goal is to strengthen working relationships  to foster interest and participation in the broader  mining industry, increase understanding of the  benefits of mining to local communities, and the  end products of mined commodities. MCA NT engaged with the public throughout the  year to drive support for the minerals industry  and highlight the benefits of projects to the  communities in which they operate.  Activities included:   •	 Hosting a booth during the National Science  Week 2023 STEM weekend in Alice Springs •	 Hosting a booth at the Bite of Science family  STEM day at CDU Darwin •	 Representing NT mining industry at  Resourcing the Territory Conference. In addition to public-facing events, MCA NT also  advocated for improved policy through Territory   and federal government forums, and alongside  other NT industries. With a general election  scheduled for August 2024, it will be important  to ensure that the benefits and value the mining  industry contributes to the Northern Territory is  understood by Territorians from all walks of life. MCA NT team looks forward to continuing our  strong advocacy for the sector to ensure the  growth of Territory mining and the benefits that  will flow for generations of Territorians to come. MCA NT meeting with the  Indonesian Ambassador to  Australia, Dr Siswo Pramono,  Indonesia’s Darwin Consul  Gulfan Afero, and an Indonesian  trade delegation discussing  critical mineral opportunities  in the NT.  Geologist Jalu Bias Firdausi from  KGL Resources Limited visited  the MCA NT office in October  to share highlights and samples  from the Jervois Copper Project  in Central Australia, and below,  members of the newly elected  Women in Resources Inc 2024  committee at the 2023 AGM.  ===== PAGE 36 ===== 36 MCA Annual Report 2023 Andrew Michelmore AO Chair Economic Reform Committee  Chair: Gerhard Veldsman  |  Roy Hill Co-chair: Felicity Hughes  |  Newmont Australia Develops and advocates policies that encourage an internationally  competitive minerals industry in Australia.

The current portion for this provision includes the total amount accrued for annual leave entitlements and the amounts accrued for long  service leave entitlements that have vested due to employees having completed the required period of service. Based on past experience,  the entity does not expect the full amount of annual leave or long service leave balances classified as current liabilities to be settled within  the next 12 months. However, these amounts must be classified as current liabilities since the entity does not have an unconditional right to  defer the settlement of these amounts in the event employees wish to use their leave entitlement. The non-current portion for this provision includes amounts accrued for long service leave entitlements that have not yet vested in relation  to those employees who have not yet completed the required period of service. In calculating the present value of future cash flows in respect of long service leave, the probability of long service leave being taken is  based upon historical data. The measurement and recognition criteria for employee benefits have been discussed in Note 15(k). . The entity is incorporated under the Corporations Act 2001 and is a company limited by guarantee. If the entity is wound up, the constitution  states that each member is required to contribute a maximum of $10 each towards meeting any outstanding obligations of the entity.

These policies  have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.  The financial statements are for the Minerals Council  of Australia and its 50% interest in the jointly operated Melbourne Mining Club. (a) Basis of preparation These general purpose financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations  issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board and the Corporations Act 2001. Minerals Council of Australia (MCA) is a not-for- profit entity for the purpose of preparing the financial statements. (i) Compliance with Australian Accounting Standards - Reduced Disclosure Requirements The financial statements of the MCA comply with Australian Accounting Standards – Simplified Disclosures as issued by the Australian  Accounting Standards Board (AASB).  ===== PAGE 53 ===== 53 (ii) Historical cost convention These financial statements, except for the cash flow statement, have been prepared on accrual basis and are based on historical cost  basis. The amounts presented are in Australian Dollars and have been rounded to the nearest dollar. (iii) New standards adopted There were no changes to the accounting policy during the year ending 31 December 2023. (b) Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised for the major business activities as follows: (i) Membership fees Revenue from membership fees relates to the provision of annual membership benefits to members. The consideration for memberships  is based on fixed fees and is recognised over the membership year as members simultaneously receive and benefit from the services  provided. Components of the membership fees that are collected for annual programs are recognised over time as the MCA provides the services  with reference to qualitative achievement of planned activities for each program. (ii) Service fees Service fees include the recovery of costs associated with the delivery of special campaigns. Revenue is recognised at a point in time  when the costs are incurred, the services are delivered and outcomes achieved. (iii) Management fees The MCA provides management support services to an external entity as determined in the contractual agreement. The contract contains  fixed monthly management fees and specifies the services as the provision of public affairs and policy support services and provision of  management personnel services. The services provided are substantially the same each month and have the same pattern of transfer,  therefore the MCA accounts for the contracts as two performance obligations, the annual provision of support services and management  personnel services. Revenue is recognised over the life of the contract as the customer simultaneously receives the benefits as MCA  provides the services. (iv) Events The MCA holds a number of events during the year. Revenue is recognised when the event has been held and the consideration is based  on fixed fees. (v) Sponsorship The MCA receives sponsorship income from customers in support or partnership of MCA events. Revenue is recognised when the event  has been held and the consideration is based on fixed fee amounts. (vi) Contract assets and liabilities Contract assets represent services provided to customers which are not yet billed. Contract liabilities recognised are in relation to revenue  billed to customers, where MCA has not yet provided the services. (c) Interest revenue Interest income from cash and cash equivalents and other investments is recognised when earned. (d) Income tax The MCA is exempt from income tax under Section 50-40 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. (e) Cash and cash equivalents For the purpose of presentation in the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call  with financial institutions, other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months that are readily  convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. (f) Term deposits Term deposits are classified as financial assets at amortised cost as they are held with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows  and the contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest. The original maturity of the term  deposits are greater than three months. (g) Trade and other receivables All debtors are recognised at the amounts receivable on settlement. Trade receivables are due for settlement no more than 30 days from  the date of recognition. Collectability of trade debtors is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Debts which are known to be uncollectible are  written off. MCA holds the trade receivables with the objective of collecting the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them initially at fair  value and subsequently at amortised cost. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 54 ===== 54 MCA Annual Report 2023 15	 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont.) (h) Plant and equipment Plant and equipment are measured on the cost basis less depreciation and impairment losses. The cost method of accounting is used for  all acquisitions of assets. Cost is measured as the fair value of the assets given up at the date of acquisition, plus costs incidental to the  acquisition. Where assets are acquired through a non-reciprocal transfer the balance is recognised as revenue in profit or loss. (i) Depreciation Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis so as to write off the net cost of each non-current asset during its expected useful life.  Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of either the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the  improvements. Estimates of remaining useful lives are made on a regular basis for all assets, with annual reassessments for major items. The following rates of depreciation have been employed: Furniture, fitting and equipment	 Leasehold improvement	 Motor vehicles	 10% - 100%	 7.5% - 60%	 25% (i) Impairment of assets Assets that are subject to depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the  carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds  its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in use. (j) Trade and other payables These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services received prior to the end of the financial year and which are unpaid. The  amounts are unsecured and are paid in accordance with specified terms. MCA recognises the trade payables initially at fair values and subsequently at amortised cost. (k) Employee benefits (i) Wages and salaries and annual leave Liabilities for wages and salaries and annual leave, expected to be settled within twelve months of the balance date, are recognised and  are measured as the amount unpaid at the reporting date at current pay rates in respect of employees' services up to that date. (ii) Long service leave Liabilities for long service leave are recognised, and are measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect  of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience  of employees departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using interest rates on investments with terms  that match as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows. (iii) Retirement benefit obligations – defined contribution superannation benefits All employees of the MCA receive defined contribution superannuation entitlements, for which the entity pays the fixed superannuation  guarantee contribution (currently 11% of the employee’s average ordinary salary) to the employee’s superannuation fund of choice.  All contributions in respect of employee’s defined contribution entitlements is limited to its obligation for any unpaid superannuation  guarantee contributions at the end of the reporting period. All obligations for unpaid superannuation guarantee contributions are  measured at the (undiscounted) amounts expected to be paid when the obligation is settled and are presented as current liabilities in the  entity’s statement of financial position. (l) Goods and Services Tax (GST) Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST, unless the GST incurred is not recoverable from the  taxation authority. In this case it is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense. Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or  payable to, the taxation authority is included with other receivables or payables in the statement of financial position. Cash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing or financing activities which are  recoverable from, or payable to the taxation authority, are presented as operating cash flows. (m) Jointly controlled operation The proportionate interest in the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a jointly controlled operation have been incorporated in the  financial statements under the appropriate headings. The MCA is party to a jointly controlled operation called Melbourne Mining Club.  The MCA has a 50 percent participating interest in this venture, and is entitled to 50 percent of its output. MCA's interests in the assets  employed in the jointly controlled operation are included in the statement of financial position. The principal place of business is Australia. (n) Comparative figures When required by Accounting Standards, comparative figures have been adjusted to conform to changes in presentation for the current  financial year.  ===== PAGE 55 ===== 55 (o) Accounting for leases All leases are accounted for by recognising a right-of-use asset and a lease liability except for: •	 leases of low value assets •	 leases with a duration of twelve months or less Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the contractual payments due to the lessor over the lease term, with the discount  rate determined by reference to the rate inherent in the lease. If this is not readily determinable, an incremental borrowing rate on  commencement of the lease is used. Variable lease payments are only included in the measurement of the lease liability if they depend on an  index or rate. In such cases, the initial measurement of the lease liability assumes the variable element will remain unchanged throughout the  lease term. Other variable lease payments are expensed in the period to which they relate. Right-of-use assets are initially measured at the amount of the lease liability, reduced for any lease incentives received, and increased for: •	 lease payments made at or before the commencement of the lease •	 initial direct costs incurred •	 the amount of any provision recognised where the MCA is contractually required to dismantle, remove or restore the leased asset. Subsequent to initial measurement, lease liabilities increase as a result of interest charged at a constant rate on the balance outstanding and  are reduced for lease payments made. Right-of-use assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the lease  or over the remaining economic life of the asset if, rarely, this is judged to be shorter than the lease term. (p) Provisions Provisions are recognised when the entity has a legal or constructive obligation, as a result of past events, for which it is probable that an  outflow of economic benefits will result and that outflow can be reliably measured. Provisions recognised represent the best estimate of the  amounts required to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period. (q) Financial instruments (i) Initial recognition and measurement Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions to the instrument.  For financial assets, this is the date that the Entity commits itself to either the purchase or sale of the asset (i.e. trade date accounting is  adopted). Financial instruments (except for trade receivables) are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs, except where the instrument  is classified “at fair value through profit or loss”, in which case transaction costs are expensed to profit or loss immediately. Where available,  quoted prices in an active market are used to determine fair value. In other circumstances, valuation techniques are adopted. Trade receivables are initially measured at the transaction price if the trade receivables do not contain significant financing component or if  the practical expedient was applied as specified in AASB 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers. (ii) Classification and subsequent measurement Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at: •	 amortised cost; or •	 fair value through profit or loss. A financial liability is measured at fair value through profit or loss if the financial liability is: •	 a contingent consideration of an acquirer in a business combination to which AASB 3: Business Combinations applies; •	 held for trading; or •	 initially designated as at fair value through profit or loss. All other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The effective interest  method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest expense over in profit or loss over the  relevant period. The effective interest rate is the internal rate of return of the financial asset or liability. That is, it is the rate that exactly discounts the  estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the instrument to the net carrying amount at initial recognition. A financial liability  cannot be reclassified. Financial assets  Financial assets are subsequently measured at: •	 amortised cost; •	 fair value through other comprehensive income; or •	 fair value through profit and loss NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 56 ===== 56 MCA Annual Report 2023 MCA evaluates estimates and judgements incorporated into the financial statements based on historical knowledge and best available  current information. Estimates assume a reasonable expectation of future events and are based on current trends and economic data,  obtained both externally and within MCA. Key Estimates   (i) Impairment MCA assesses impairment at the end of each reporting period by evaluation of conditions and events specific to MCA that may  be indicative of impairment triggers. Recoverable amounts of relevant assets are reassessed using value-in-use calculations which  incorporate various key assumptions. MCA determined conditions of impairment through obtaining market information about the cost  of the existing assets in which would cost to purchase at current arm’s length market prices. Key Judgements (i)   Employee benefits For the purpose of measurement, AASB 119: Employee Benefits (September 2011) defines obligations for short-term employee benefits as  obligations expected to be settled wholly before 12 months after the end of the annual reporting period in which the employees render the  related services. As MCA expects that all of its employees would use all of their annual leave entitlements earned during a reporting period  before 12 months after the end of the reporting period, MCA believes that obligations for annual leave entitlements satisfy the definition of  short-term employee benefits and, therefore, can be measured at the (undiscounted) amounts expected to be paid to employees when  the obligations are settled. 16	 Significant accounting estimates and judgements on the basis of the two primary criteria, being: •	 the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset; and •	 the business model for managing the financial assets A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortised cost when it meets the following conditions: •	 the financial asset is managed solely to collect contractual cash flows; and fair value through other comprehensive income; or •	 the contractual terms within the financial asset give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal  amount outstanding on specified dates. A financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income when it meets the following conditions: •	 	the contractual terms within the financial asset give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal  amount outstanding on specified dates; and •	 	the business model for managing the financial asset comprises both contractual cash flows collection and the selling of the financial asset. The initial designation of the financial instruments to measure at fair value through profit and loss is a one-time option on initial  classification and is irrevocable until the financial asset is derecognised. (iii) Derecognition Derecognition refers to the removal of a previously recognised financial asset or financial liability from the statement date in accordance  with the entity’s accounting policy. Derecognition of financial liabilities A liability is derecognised when it is extinguished (i.e. when the obligation in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires). Derecognition of financial assets A financial asset is derecognised when the holder’s contractual rights to its cash flows expires, or the asset is transferred in such a way  that all the risks and rewards of ownership are substantially transferred. The Entity recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets. Loss allowance is not recognised for: •	 financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss; or •	 equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Expected credit losses are the probability-weighted estimate of credit losses over the expected life of a financial instrument. A credit loss  is the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due and all cash flows expected to be received, all discounted at the original  effective interest rate of the financial instruments. 15	 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont.)  ===== PAGE 57 ===== 57 MCA has determined that all employees are expected to reach the required years of service to qualify for long-service leave. This  probability assessment has been relied upon when competing the calculation to determine long-service leave obligations. (ii)   Performance obligations under AASB 15 To identify a performance obligation under AASB 15, the agreement must be sufficiently specific to be able to determine when the  obligation is satisfied. Management exercises judgement to determine whether the agreement is sufficiently specific by considering  any conditions specified in the arrangement, explicit or implicit, regarding the promised goods or services. In making this assessment,  management includes the nature/type, cost/value, quantity and the period of transfer related to the goods or services agreed. (iii)   Lease term an option to extend under AASB 16 The lease term is defined as the non-cancellable period of a lease together with both periods covered by an option to terminate the lease  if the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. The options that are reasonably going to be exercised is a key management  judgement that the entity will make. The entity determines the likeliness to exercise the options on a lease-by-lease basis looking at various  factors such as which assets are strategic and which are key to future strategy of the entity.

Independent auditor’s report  To the members of Minerals Council of Australia  Our opinion  In our opinion:  The accompanying financial report of Minerals Council of Australia (the Company) is in accordance  with the Corporations Act 2001, including:  (a) giving a true and fair view of the Company's financial position as at 31 December 2023 and of its financial performance for the year then ended (b) complying with Australian Accounting Standards - Simplified Disclosures and the Corporations Regulations 2001. What we have audited  The financial report comprises:  • the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2023 • the statement of changes in equity for the year then ended • the statement of cash flows for the year then ended • the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the year then ended • the notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information and other explanatory information • the directors’ declaration. Basis for opinion  We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under  those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial  report section of our report.  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis  for our opinion.  Independence  We are independent of the Company in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of  the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional & Ethical  Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence  Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have also  fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.  Other information  The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the  information included in the annual report for the year ended 31 December 2023, but does not include   ===== PAGE 60 ===== 60 MCA Annual Report 2023   the financial report and our auditor’s report thereon. Prior to the date of this auditor's report, the other  information we obtained included the Directors' Report.  Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and accordingly we do not  express any form of assurance conclusion thereon through our opinion on the financial report.  In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information  and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial  report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of  this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are  required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.   Responsibilities of the directors for the financial report  The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a  true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards - Simplified Disclosures and the  Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable  the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Company  to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using  the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Company or to  cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.       ===== PAGE 61 ===== 61   Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial report  Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is  free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that  includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that  an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material  misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material  if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic  decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial report.

The challenge of remaining the leading  mining jurisdiction and attracting the  talent and capital needed to grow  is joined by a new one: increasing  prosperity while contributing to the  global task of reducing emissions. This means continuing to supply  the important bulk commodities that  underpin modern societies as well  as meeting the growing demand for  the critical minerals essential for  technological innovation and the energy  transition – an exciting new frontier. It is with great pleasure that I return  for another term as Chair of the MCA.  Mining has been a significant part of  my life and I’m honoured to oversee the  organisation once again. I look forward to  working with my fellow board members,  member companies, the industry and  communities in which we operate  to progress the key policy platforms  that will drive this mission of greater  prosperity and lower emissions.  With thanks to  the Hon Helen Coonan I want to thank the previous chair the  Hon Helen Coonan for the significant  contribution she made to the MCA at  a difficult time for Australia and for  the mining industry. Under her leadership, the MCA  provided guidance to the industry  and governments as it navigated the  COVID-19 pandemic. Mining remained  fully operational and delivered for the  nation when it needed it most. Ms Coonan also championed the  industry’s response to the 2020  Australian Human Rights Commission’s  Respect@Work report with actions  to stamp out sexual harassment. This  important work must continue across  the industry. Other significant initiatives  included the launch of the first Climate  Action Plan and subsequent reports, and  confirming the industry’s ambition to  achieve net zero emissions by 2050.  The MCA membership also took  environmental, social, and governance  (ESG) responsibility to a new level with  members committing to adopt the  Towards Sustainable Mining initiative.  Member companies drive engagement  with communities and economic activity.  The MCA supports and informs these  activities. Together the industry has  been focused on learning, repairing  and better engaging with First Nation’s  communities.  The MCA has helped identify skills  needs and career paths, working with  the education sector, governments and  companies to create more apprenticeships,  increase skills, build more inclusive and  respectful workplaces, encouraging more  women to join the industry.  The MCA will continue to work and lead  on these important initiatives with the  same commitment, focus and hard work  it has always displayed. It is vital Australia has a strong mining  industry given the predominant export- driven contribution it makes to the  national economy and regional areas  through meeting the world’s need for  minerals and metals for modern life. Mining’s decadal  contribution to Australia In the decade to 2021-22, mining  contributed $2.4 trillion to Australia’s  export revenue and its share of the  nation’s GDP growth was 21 per cent.  The industry also contributed significantly  to federal, state and territory government  revenues in this period – $170 billion  in company taxes and $127 billion in  royalties – paying for schools, hospitals  and public infrastructure.  The industry employs – directly  and indirectly – 1.1 million Australians,  with many of those in regional areas;  paid $252 billion in mining wages;  and supported thousands of regional  businesses in the mining supply chain.  It also made a significant contribution to  capital spending totalling $246 billion. Australian mining continues to make  strides in innovation, employs more  highly skilled workers every year and  has increased women’s participation  by 35 per cent in the past decade.  Geopolitical challenges  While the industry has enjoyed  much success in the last decade, it is  now confronting new domestic and  international challenges.   Australian mining leads the  way with a focus on the future  As the nation rebounds from the shocks of recent years, Australia’s mining sector  turns its focus to the future and the global task of reducing emissions.  5  ===== PAGE 6 ===== 6 MCA Annual Report 2022 	 MCA Policy Roundtable  MCA Chair Andrew Michelmore   (far right) with Queensland  Resources Council CEO Ian  Macfarlane and MCA CEO Tania  Constable in March 2023.   Image: Queensland Resources Council Rising inflation, interest rates and energy  costs pose risks for investment activity  globally. Competition for investment  funds will become harder. Added to this,  the Australian economy is at risk with a  structural budget deficit that stretches  well beyond the next decade presenting  a difficult policy landscape.   Australia is not unique as the rest  of the world emerges from the global  pandemic. The fallout of the Russia- Ukraine War will likely have long-lasting  generational effects and European  economies are turning to suppliers other  than Russia to provide their energy and  minerals needs. The US is aggressively  pursuing a strong domestic investment  agenda with a number of new policies  including the US$400 billion Inflation  Reduction Act.     Every country needs to turbocharge its  economies and Australia has what the  world wants: access to reliable energy  sources and critical minerals. This is a  real opportunity as Australia is poised to  benefit from a diversified strategy in coal,  gas, critical minerals and uranium.   The risk is however that Australia  might squander this opportunity through  unnecessary regulatory burdens on  the industry.  Australia has over 100 prospective  mining and processing projects totalling  around $50 billion in investment,  30,000 construction jobs and 20,000  operational jobs.   Converting these prospective projects  into actual investment is dependent on  government ensuring Australia retains  internationally competitive policy settings. Legislative changes to workplace  relations, the safeguard mechanism,  energy, taxation and environmental  approvals are areas that directly affect  the minerals industry. By themselves  some can be managed, but together they  present significant additional costs for  projects and present real challenges  for new projects seeking final  investment decisions.  The Australian mining industry is severely  affected by the current skills and labour  shortages. There is an acute shortage of  mining engineers, metallurgists, electrical  engineers, geological engineers,  geologists and tradespeople.  The MCA will continue to focus on talent  acquisition and retention for the industry  and push for more students – particularly  female – to enter STEM professions. The MCA has been a responsible  advocate and stands ready to work with  all governments to ensure that policy  outcomes enhance and not inhibit the  investment task.  This year the MCA is working hard  to emphasise the contribution mining  makes to modern life and showcase new  minerals and their process potential,  particularly in metropolitan cities.  Maintaining exploration is key  Australian mining’s success is dependent  on investment to unearth mineral  deposits of global significance and  expand existing operations.  Minerals exploration activity in Australia  reached a record $4.05 billion in 2022,  up 13 per cent from the previous year.  Geoscience Australia’s Exploring for the  Future program, in partnership with the  states and Northern Territory, has been  fundamental in providing pre-competitive  geoscience information for companies  and indeed has led to good results  recently in the Barkly region of the NT.  While these exploration results are  impressive, the time it takes from  discovering a mineral deposit to the  development of a new mine often  exceeds 15 years.  It is a policy imperative to ensure  exploration investment continues,  particularly for critical minerals that will  help the globe’s efforts to decarbonise  and achieve the goal of net zero  emissions by 2050. The MCA will continue to work with  the industry and government to ensure  it realises its full potential, contributes  to the nation and provides the world  the critical minerals needed for the  energy transition.  I commend this annual report to you.  Andrew Michelmore AO Chair  |  Minerals Council of Australia  ===== PAGE 7 ===== Swift and decisive action by the  MCA and Board was required as we  refocused efforts and resources to  address the priority areas of industrial  relations, the prospect of climate policy  changes via the safeguards mechanism,  taxation and environmental assessment  and approvals.  The government ramped up its support  for critical minerals investment, tying  it directly to the need to secure supply  chains and create new value-adding  industries directly in Australia. Australia is fortunate to have abundant  reserves of the minerals necessary  for modern life, including rare earths,  lithium, nickel, cobalt and copper. These  minerals are essential components in  the production of high-tech goods from  smart phones and laptops to electric  vehicles and renewable energy. With abundant mineral reserves and  advanced mining skills and capabilities,  Australia is perfectly poised to take  advantage of growing market demand  and, like iron ore in the 1980s, become  a leading supplier. Not only would this  help secure Australia’s economic future,  but be a significant additional boost to  regional communities. As our theme for Minerals Week  captured, Australia’s miners and  communities are nation builders and  global leaders. With a record high of  $461 billion export revenue in 2022  (69 per cent of the nation’s total revenue  exports), global demand for Australia’s  resources, led by coal and iron ore,  continues to underpin the nation’s  economic prosperity. However this cannot be taken for granted.  Global competition to attract investment  in mining and particularly for the minerals  and metals required for the clean energy  transition is intensifying. The global race for critical  minerals investment If mining is to continue making a  major economic contribution to the  nation – to build the nation and lead  global development – it has to attract  a significant slice of the additional  US$100 billion of global mining  investment forecast for critical minerals  annually for the next two decades.  By 2030 alone, 50 new lithium mines,  60 new nickel mines and 17 new cobalt  mines will be required to meet global  demand for electricity storage. While Australia has a world-class  mining industry, being prepared for  competition should be placed at the  centre of governments’ policymaking  to ensure the industry maintains its  leading performance. There is a genuine risk of Australia’s  minerals remaining in the ground as  companies and investors prioritise  foreign resource developments where  costs are lower, policy settings more  stable and returns are higher. Australia is better placed with its  resource base than any nation to  reap the benefits of this new-energy  transition. But the opportunity needs  to be seized, not squandered. Workplace relations, taxation, emissions  management, environment and energy  policies that impose additional costs on  the mining industry threaten the capital  investment that underpins mining’s  contribution to the economy. In 2022, the MCA worked hard to  highlight the importance of getting  these critical policy areas right via direct  representation, submissions and actively  engaging with government, industry  (forming close partnerships) and  communities.  Workplace flexibility is vital The Australian government released  a series of workplace relations reforms  aimed at simplifying and modernising the  system. These reforms included changes  to casual employment, a new bargaining  framework to encourage bargaining  between employers and employees.  The MCA supported changes that  would protect the most vulnerable in  our society, but was united with other  business groups in opposition to a  number of the reforms, particularly  the multi-employer bargaining. The  reforms were passed by parliament  and will take effect in June 2023.  The reforms will have a significant  negative impact on the industry  and more broadly on the economy.  Disappointingly, the reintroduction  of multi-employer bargaining into the  Australian workplace relations regime  is a fundamental departure from nearly  30 years of bipartisan support for  enterprise-level bargaining focused on  boosting productivity and real wages.    A year of change and challenge  for the mining industry 2022 was certainly challenging, with a change of government early in the year and  a barrage of new policies affecting mining.  Tania Constable Chief Executive Officer Chief Executive Officer’s report 7  ===== PAGE 8 ===== The MCA is concerned at the potential  risks of legislation to implement the  government’s so-called ‘same job, same  pay’ policy. Such legislation runs the risk  of imposing unsuitable and incompatible  workplace arrangements on employers  and disrupting existing arrangements  that have generated high wages and high  productivity. If not implemented carefully,  it will jeopardise a range of existing  arrangements in the industry, discourage  future investment and ultimately cost jobs. Workplace flexibility is vital for the  Australian mining industry to continue  to grow to meet the world’s appetite for  critical minerals.  Internationally competitive  tax system The Australian government has a  four-pillar approach to creating an  internationally competitive tax system  – lower taxes, targeted investment  incentives in priority areas, simpler  compliance and administration rules  and actively promoting Australia as  an attractive destination for foreign  investors. While mining has not been  singled out, fiscal policies targeting  multinationals have had a negative  impact on some of our members.  The biggest news on taxation, and relief  for industry, came in the Prime Minister’s  speech at the Australian Minerals  Industry Parliamentary Dinner where  he said there would be no mining tax or  change to the fuel tax credit scheme.  Mining and emissions reduction The MCA and its members are  committed to climate action, support  the Paris Agreement and an industry  ambition of net zero by 2050. The MCA  released its second Climate Action  Report which highlighted continuing  modest reductions in carbon emissions  and significant investment in technology  development and deployment.  Following the government’s commitment  to achieve an interim target of 43 per  cent reduction in greenhouse gas  emissions by 2030 (from 2005 levels),  the MCA entered ongoing discussions  with government on the design of  changes to the safeguard mechanism.  The MCA argued the need for  appropriate treatment of emissions  intensive/trade exposed industries while  ensuring international competitiveness  and the avoidance of carbon leakage.  The MCA was successful in achieving  a cost containment/price management  mechanism to manage the upside  price risk for facilities and the full use  of Australian Carbon Credit Units.   Environmental protection  Australian mining is committed to the  protection and restoration of our unique  environment and national heritage values. It was disappointing to see that the remit  of the proposed national environment  protection agency will be expanded  beyond an election commitment of  compliance and assurance to include  project assessment and approvals,  presenting increased risks for new  projects. Timely approvals, national  coordination and clearer guidelines  will help Australia’s minerals industry  create more jobs, boost investment and  continue to improve national biodiversity  and heritage outcomes. The Towards Sustainable Mining  sustainability accounting system –  under adoption by the MCA members  – supports continual improvement and  provides unprecedented transparency  around the industry’s environmental and  social performance governance. Indigenous partnerships in focus Mining companies and Traditional  Owners and communities have  partnered for decades to deliver  tailored opportunities for people to work  on country, to return and live locally,  gain new skills and qualifications and  establish businesses. Mining employs a higher proportion  of Indigenous Australians than any other  sector and the industry is also a major  customer of the vibrant Indigenous  business sector thus contributing  significantly to long-term wealth  creation. Mining is committed to increasing  Indigenous Australian participation  across the industry, including enhancing  employment and business opportunities  and representation in leadership and  industry professional roles.   Pilbara mine site tour  October 2022 8 MCA Annual Report 2022  ===== PAGE 9 ===== The MCA strongly supports the National  Roadmap on Indigenous Jobs, Skills and  Wealth Creation’s ambition of further  unlocking Indigenous Australian aspiration  and excellence in the economy. Trade, skills and technology  The MCA is working with government  to expand opportunities for trade and  investment, including through promotion  of Australian mining’s strong ESG  performance.  The secretariat also continues to work  with member companies to target skills  and deliver quality education and training  to satisfy the industry’s workforce  requirements that will be crucial in  delivering the critical minerals the world  will need to decarbonise. Finally, the MCA is an advocate for a  coordinated approach across federal,  state and territory governments to  regulate transformative technologies to  unlock productivity gains from innovation. The future for mining in Australia looks  positive providing the right business  and regulatory environment is in place  to attract the significant investment the  world will allocate for critical minerals in  the next couple of decades.  Safety a core priority There remains a vital issue where  the industry is not living up to its own  aspirations: the safety and wellbeing  of our workers. Three people did not  return home in 2022. This follows  five deaths in 2021.    Society’s understanding of wellbeing  is expanding and presents a new  challenge for the industry to ensure not  only physical safety but psychosocial  health are considered. The response  by the industry to the Australian Human  Rights Commission’s Respect@Work  report has been a key part of this, but  there is more to be done.  Industry positioning   The MCA switched gears in the second  half of the year to fully implement  a change in priorities and industry  positioning. A new positioning and  engagement strategy was put into  practice which included a series of  proactive and positive advertising  campaigns featuring the use of new  minerals to reinforce the industry’s  responsible community approach  and contribution.  Continuing to build a long-term positive  perception and support for the minerals  industry is critical and our research and  evaluation has shown a positive change  in public support is occurring post  COVID-19 which continues in 2023.   A defensive campaign has guarded  against adverse action on tax, climate  and energy, workplace relations and  environment. A fuel tax credit campaign  was created and rolled out in conjunction  with regional industries including forestry,  oil and gas, irrigators, fisheries, maritime,  farmers, canegrower, tourism, agriculture  and winemakers. This campaign had an  immediate and positive effect for regional  industries and the MCA is grateful for the  support and ongoing partnership with the  Fuel Tax Credit Alliance.  The MCA has remained steadfast in its  commitment to strongly advocate on  behalf of MCA members and this report  highlights some of the successes and  challenges throughout the year. We have  adapted to changing circumstances  and continued to deliver targeted policy  advocacy and improved our industry  positioning strategy.  I’d like to thank the Hon Helen Coonan  for her leadership as Chair of the MCA  Board and I’d also like to acknowledge  the board members who left during 2022,  including Edgar Basto, Alex Bates, Tyler  Mitchelson and Darren Yeates. Finally, none of this would be possible  without the dedication and hard work of  our staff who have worked tirelessly to  ensure that our policy advocacy is first  rate and committees and other services  run smoothly and efficiently. I thank my  team and all of our members for their  unwavering commitment to our shared  vision which continues to be the driving  force behind our success.   Tania Constable Chief Executive Officer   Minerals Council of Australia 9 Chief Executive Officer’s report 	 Images: MCA, CMEWA and APPEA  hosted a tour of Pilbara mine sites,  including BHP, Rio Tinto, Mineral  Resources and FMG in October 2022.  Resources Minister Madeleine King  (main picture with MCA CEO Tania  Constable) was among federal Labor  MPs taking part, which also included  Member for Paterson Meryl Swanson  MP, Member for Pearce Tracey  Roberts MP and Member for Swan  Zaneta Mascarenhas MP.  ===== PAGE 10 ===== 10 MCA Annual Report 2022 Consultation and engagement  shapes policy agenda Policy agenda The MCA policy agenda covers a  broad range of significant issues.  Policy positions are built upon a  sound evidence base, the principles  of opportunity, sustainability and  transparency, extensive consultation  with members, and ongoing engagement  with communities and governments. Mining investments are a long- run decision, requiring stable and  dependable policy settings to underpin  multi-decade obligations to investors  and communities. This is a fundamental   priority. Yet policy is also dynamic  and requires a willingness to reflect  preparedness to adapt and empathise with communities.  In 2022, the MCA kept Australians  informed about the industry’s ongoing  support for the economy: the increased  export revenue, higher wages, growing  employment, leading-edge innovation  and its significant tax and royalties  contribution.  The MCA urged governments to use  the recovery from COVID-19 to adopt  productivity-enhancing reforms to  bolster investment and expand the  sector’s contribution to Australia’s  prosperity into the future. Across the broad sweep of policy issues,  leading the MCA’s advocacy were: 	 Creating safe and respectful  workplaces 	 Strengthening partnerships with  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  peoples 	 Ensuring an internationally  competitive taxation regime 	 Promoting diverse, flexible and  rewarding workplaces 	 Improving the efficiency and  effectiveness of environmental  approvals regimes 	 Providing a practical pathway to  net zero emissions by 2050. The MCA’s policy  agenda mirrors the  Australian minerals  industry’s engagement  with communities, the  nation and the world.  ===== PAGE 11 ===== 11 // Safety The safety, health and  psychological wellbeing  of the mining workforce –  where everyone who goes  to work returns home safe  and healthy – is the industry’s  core value and commitment. Sadly, three people did not return  home during 2022. The MCA’s policy work focused on  improving the sector’s understanding  of the systemic causes of an incident  and how to address this, which included  a deep dive into industry and regulator  statistics to identify unrecognised  trends and new responses.  Work focused on three types of  uncontrolled or unexpected energy  releases: vehicle, machinery and  gravitational. While much attention  has been given to the movement of  vehicles and changes in stability that  cause falls and collapses on the mine  site, increased focus is needed on the  risks from operational machinery. Using these findings to develop  practical guidance for members and  the broader industry is a central focus  in 2023. A dedicated consultative  project with industry and subject  matter experts will develop meaningful  resources to assist members with  continual safety improvements. // Respect at work  The Australian Human Right’s Commission released its fifth  national survey on sexual harassment in late 2022. Encouragingly, the report found the  reported rate of sexual harassment in  the mining industry decreased from  40 per cent in 2018 to 32 per cent and is  now below the national incidence rate of  33 per cent. Sixty-two per cent of women  experienced sexual harassment in the  past five years (compared with 74 per  cent in 2018 survey) and 25 per cent of  men (compared with 32 per cent in 2018).  These findings reflect the commitment  demonstrated by member companies to  eliminate sexual harassment and ensure  respectful workplaces. During 2022 this work, led by Board Chair  the Hon Helen Coonan and Director  Michael Wright, included convening a  CEO and senior leaders forum to reaffirm  the industry’s commitment to eliminate  sexual harassment and to share  progress in tackling sexual harassment in  workplaces. That commitment consists  of developing a culture of respect that  empowers individuals to raise concerns  in a supportive and protected way,  directly dealing with problems and  ensuring individuals receive real and  tangible support. In addition, the MCA held a number of  workshops, webinars and seminars to  reinforce the industry’s commitments  on eliminating sexual harassment  and support members to embed the  Australian Minerals Industry Code on  Eliminating Sexual Harassment.  Over 70 per cent of MCA’s membership  have formally endorsed the commitment  to eliminate sexual harassment and  adopted the industry code. The MCA  continues to support small and medium- sized members and new members to  increase this coverage. Further work around the intersectional  nature of a range of psychosocial risks  that can affect the workforce was  developed during 2022. Industry is now developing a new  approach to psychological wellbeing,  by not just identifying risks one by  one but systematically and holistically  addressing the range of workplace  risks that can harm the psychological  wellbeing of the workforce.  Industry is committed to continue the  work on preventing and responding to  any disrespectful behaviour and the full  range of psychosocial risks, alongside  the continued vigilance on physical  safety and health risks.

The mining industry’s partnerships with  Indigenous communities are paramount  in creating intergenerational wealth  and health outcomes for Aboriginal  and Torres Strait Islander people. By  partnering with the Melbourne Business  School, the MCA has been instrumental  in reviewing procurement policies that  will ensure genuine Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander businesses are  considered for works, services, materials  and contracts with the minerals industry.   This is an ongoing research project that  the MCA and member companies will  continue to passionately engage on. Advocating for genuine change for  communities to determine their own  futures, the MCA has added its support  for the Uluru Statement from the Heart’s  call for an Indigenous Voice to Parliament.  This long demonstrated history of  listening to Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander communities is why the industry  believes that a Voice to Parliament will  contribute to overcoming Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander disadvantage. The industry has worked, and will  continue to work, with the First  Nations Heritage Protection Alliance  to ensure that the minerals industry’s  views are considered in the design  implementation of any new national  cultural heritage legislation. The minerals  industry continues to actively, and with  genuine purpose, regain the trust of the  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  communities in relation to ongoing  cultural heritage management. Following the release of the government’s  response to the Juukan Gorge senate  inquiry, the minerals industry continues  to call upon the Australian government  to work with the native title sector and  private industry to develop best practice  tools and frameworks to better engage  with Prescribed Bodies Corporate.  The MCA supports the Australian  government’s endeavours to ensure that  funding is appropriate for these bodies to  undertake the works and accountabilities  required under the Native Title Act  1993 (Cth). In focussing on future investments, the  industry is looking forward to the skills  and jobs that will contribute to wealth  creation in Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander communities. In understanding  where the skills gaps are now, the  MCA and member companies are able  to develop specific programs for the  current and future jobs in the minerals  industry. This has an added benefit of  being transformative by identifying the  emerging industry leaders amongst the  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  communities.   Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  leadership initiatives are critical to the  minerals industry. The MCA and member  companies continue to review existing  programs that can be adapted to ensure  that they are fit for purpose for the next  generation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander leaders in the minerals industry. Image: Tallison Lithium  ===== PAGE 13 ===== 13 // Workplace relations Unflagged legislative changes exposed the industry to an  untested system of multi-employer bargaining in 2022. The sustained increase in highly paid,  highly skilled, secure mining jobs over the  past 20 years (from 83,000 to 286,000  direct employees) demonstrates that  Australia’s workplace relations system  was neither broken in the mining industry  or in need of radical surgery. The government’s decision in late  2022 to rush a number of unflagged  legislative changes to the Fair Work Act,  with minimal consultation, exposes the  industry to an unprecedented and untried  system of multi-employer bargaining.  Whilst a number of elements of the  legislative package were disappointing,  the MCA successfully engaged with  government to secure amendments that  will reduce some of the serious risks. In 2023, the federal government will  introduce a number of additional  legislative changes concerning casual  employment, contracting and the so- called ‘same job, same pay’ labour hire  model. A broad range of industries are  concerned that the proposed changes  could be highly damaging to business  and workers if they are not drafted with  care. The MCA will continue to advocate  to the government and publicly, to  ensure the industry’s concerns are at  the forefront of the government’s policy  considerations. The government’s policy to pursue  substantial changes to the workplace  relations framework has brought into  focus the need for the industry to be  united and proactive in defence of its  successful record, and to highlight the  risk posed by regressive changes.  At best, these will reduce productivity  and compromise Australia’s  competitiveness in global export  markets. At worst, they risk becoming a  decisive material factor in whether new  projects proceed or not, and whether  billions of dollars in investment capital is  invested in Australia or elsewhere. // Taxation Stable and internationally  competitive tax settings  are essential to attracting  investment in innovative,  large-scale projects.  These projects create jobs, develop  critical skills, generate revenue to fund  government services and produce  minerals essential for the transition to  a low emissions global economy.  Australia must maintain a stable and  internationally competitive business  tax regime through this next important  period which offers opportunity for  investment in the mineral projects. At 30 per cent, Australia already has  the third highest company tax rate of  the OECD countries and is well above  the OECD weighted average tax rate of  26.3 per cent. High rates of taxation are  a barrier to investment and economic  growth. Ad hoc increases in taxation  undermine investor confidence and  risk harming decisions to invest in  Australia. The Queensland government’s  decision to increase its royalties had  repercussions across the industry  and the globe. The MCA supports  the Queensland Resources Council  campaign to reverse this decision.  Threats to the fuel tax credit (FTC) regime, which has been in place for  decades and is well established in  tax policy, has also created risks for  investment and produces an economic  drag across regional Australia and  its industries. For the past decade an  alliance of regional industries has stood  together to defend the maintenance  of the fuel tax credit – a mechanism for  ensuring that business inputs used by  industries that do not operate on public  roads are not taxed. Amid increasing false  claims that the FTC is a fossil fuel subsidy,  mining, farming, fisheries, forestry and  tourism communities renewed their  alliance to highlight the importance of the  FTC to the survival of rural and regional  businesses including mining.  Early in 2023 a new campaign was  launched to highlight the unfair nature  of removing the credit. In response to  the campaign, the federal government  confirmed there would be no changes  to the fuel tax regime. The alliance will  continue its work to educate the public  on why the credit is sound policy.  Image: BHP Policy agenda  ===== PAGE 14 ===== 14 MCA Annual Report 2022 // Environmental approvals National environmental law should support responsible minerals development. Australian companies are global  leaders in innovative, high-tech mining  and minerals processing and lead the  way in environmental management.  The Australian industry’s credentials are  recognised globally, and its expertise  and leading practice is exported around  the world.  Australian industry is well positioned  to responsibly meet the growing global  demand for minerals, including critical  minerals, to support the energy transition.  However the ongoing efficiency and  certainty of regulatory settings for  environmental assessment and approvals  remains a key determinant in attracting  the capital investment needed to ensure  Australia can harness this opportunity.   The industry is committed to protect  the country’s unique environment and  biodiversity through leading practice  based on science and robust risk- based approaches.  MCA member companies are  implementing the Towards Sustainable  Mining (TSM) system. TSM will provide  greater accountability and transparency  of the industry’s management at the  site level – where it matters most. Good  environmental and social performance  relies on investment in workforce  skills and capability, research, new  technologies and innovative practice to  improve safety and workforce diversity,  drive down emissions and water use,  support biodiversity and reduce waste. Australia is also a leader in water  stewardship. The MCA launched its  updated Water Accounting Framework  User Guide on World Water Day 2022.  This leading practice tool has been  adopted internationally and is reflected  in global sustainability reporting  requirements.  Significant investment over many  decades has resulted in substantial  improvements in the industry’s  environmental performance in line with  community expectations.  While there will always be a strong focus  on responsible on-site environmental  management, industry also partners  with local communities, First Nations’  landholders and groups, non-government  organisations and others to support  broader environmental objectives. These efforts have ensured the industry  is well positioned to responsibly supply  increasing minerals demand driven by  expanding global infrastructure, the  energy transition and minerals security.  2023 will be an important year for  national environmental law, with the  promise of well-designed reform offering  opportunities to address longstanding  issues with assessment and approval  processes. However the reforms  process also carries risks for the sector,  should these be rushed and impractical. In December 2022, the Australian  government released its response  to the second ten-year Independent  Review of the Environment Protection  and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.  The government’s ‘nature positive plan’  has the twin aims of improving outcomes  for both the environment and business –  objectives supported by the industry.   Image: Glencore  ===== PAGE 15 ===== 15 The government has flagged an  expanded remit for a proposed national  environmental protection agency to  decide upon project assessments and  approvals. This may present risks for  new projects if the new agency does  not take proper account of social and  economic factors as well as broader  societal needs, such as the energy  transition and supply chain security,  when making decisions. The reform process hinges on the  development of national environmental  standards and regional planning. While  this provides opportunity to streamline  Commonwealth, state and territory  approval processes, project-level  application of these standards may  result in unachievable criteria.  Changes to environmental offsets,  including greater flexibility through  biodiversity compensation payments  will support projects to meet their offset  obligations, but must be cost-effective. // Climate and Energy The Australian minerals industry has an ambition of achieving net zero emissions by 2050.  Early in its new term, the government  legislated a more rapid intermediate  target for emissions reduction,  committing to a 43 per cent reduction  in Australia’s 2030 emissions from 2005  levels. The Climate Change Act became  law in September 2022. The MCA continues to consult with  government on meeting the goals of both  reducing emissions while protecting  international competitiveness and mining  jobs, including in the coal industry. The government’s policy focus  has two key drivers. First, it seeks to  dramatically increase the penetration  of renewable energy into the National  Electricity Market (NEM) to 82 per cent  by 2030 (up from around 29 per cent in  2022). This would reduce the emissions  of the NEM by an additional 56 Mt in  2030 over business-as-usual according  to their pre-election modelling. Second, the government will amend  the safeguard mechanism and require  facilities to reduce allowable emissions,  or baselines, at a faster pace. The goal  is to reduce emissions by 48 Mt in 2030  over business-as-usual. The MCA successfully argued for a price  risk mechanism in the design to ensure  that safeguard mechanism facilities were  not exposed to unlimited upside price  risk for compliance. Amending the safeguard mechanism  is a substantial change. As baselines  decline, facilities will have an increasing  incentive to develop technologies and  processes to reduce their emissions or  face rising carbon offset costs.  The government also proposed to  issue safeguard mechanism credits  (SMCs) to facilities operating below their  baselines which they can use for future  compliance or to sell to those  operating above their baselines.   Throughout the consultation, the  MCA emphasised the desire of industry  to work towards net zero by 2050,  and to engage constructively with  the government in developing and  implementing the sustainable changes  to the safeguard mechanism.  The MCA’s priority was to ensure  that compliance costs were managed  and that the government kept its  commitment to maintain Australia’s  competitiveness, and in particular its  commitment to ensure that exporters  remain competitive and that emissions  do not leak overseas.

Released in April 2022,  the campaign ran through to December  and including television, digital and  cinema advertising. A new skills and careers-focused  website was launched in September  to support the campaign. The website  provides a trove of information to guide  and support students and prospective  employees to map a careers pathway  in the mining industry.  Lift in public support off back  of industry campaigns  Industry positioning The MCA’s 2022 brand  campaign, with its focus  on modern life’s reliance  on Australian mining  and mineral resources,  resonated with the public.  As well as educational resources, the  website includes links to employment  sites, videos and much more to promote  awareness and encourage people to  consider a career in mining. Further  promotion of the website and supporting  resources will continue during 2023.   Research confirmed that the campaign  was well received and continued to drive  support and positive sentiment for the  mining industry. The campaign was well-recalled and  delivered messages of utility and a future  role for mining, and was successful  in driving significant improvement in  national sentiment towards mining. Fuel tax credits campaign In early 2023, the Fuel Tax Alliance, led  by the MCA, launched a new campaign  highlighting the importance of the fuel  tax credit scheme to the current and  future prosperity of regional Australia. 18 MCA Annual Report 2022  ===== PAGE 19 ===== 19 National skills campaign Fuel tax credits campaign The campaign ‘Road Taxes are for Road  Users’ aimed to build greater awareness  of the importance of retaining the  scheme and, if scrapped, would drive up  the cost of living even further. The campaign featured regional  businesses and reframed the debate  around the fuel tax credit scheme away  from false claims that it is a fossil fuel  subsidy and towards the proposition  that it is a road tax and should not be  applied to the fuel of machines that  don’t use roads. 30 Things The MCA launched a new 30 Things  Futuristic Edition publication, video and  digital assets during Minerals Week   building on the success and popularity of  the original 30 Things launched in 2019.  The 30 Things brand continues to  grow. More than 12,000 hard copies of  the original edition have been distributed  and are still regularly requested by  member companies, educators and  the general public.  International mining organisations  including the Mining Association of  Canada, have adopted the campaign.   The Futurist Edition has been equally well  received, and was recently translated  into Spanish for use in South America. australianminingcareers.com.au roadtaxesareforroadusers.com.au  ===== PAGE 20 ===== 20 Minerals Week 2022    6-8 September 2022 Award ceremony National Portrait Gallery WIRNA 2022   National Portrait Gallery   BHP 2022 Women in Resources National Awards    6 September 2022 Australian Minerals Industry Parliamentary Dinner Great Hall, Parliament House Parliamentary Dinner   Great Hall, Parliament House    ===== PAGE 21 ===== 21 MCA Annual Report 2022 Minerals Week Conference Hyatt Hotel Canberra Lydia Gentle OAM BHP Elle Farris Newmont Casey Martin Alkane Resources Emily Jacques Newcrest Michelle Wetherell CMOC-Northparkes Dyno Nobel Exceptional  Woman in Australian  Resources Newcrest Exceptional  Young Woman in  Australian Resources Thiess Outstanding  Australian Tradeswoman,  Operator or Technician Maptek Women in  Resources Technological  Innovation Award Rio Tinto Gender  Diversity Champion in  Australian Resources  Category winners Parliamentary Dinner   Great Hall, Parliament House    ===== PAGE 22 ===== MCA Victoria will celebrate 20 years in  2024. The Victorian Chamber formed  the Victorian Division of the Minerals  Council of Australia in 2004. Since that  time, MCA Victoria has advocated for  a growing minerals sector and worked  with companies and local communities  to support regional prosperity. In 2022, MCA Victoria’s policy advocacy,  engagement and outreach programs,  community resources and work on  industry safety helped meet the division’s   strategy across key regulatory and  community areas of focus. Another strong year of growth  for Victoria’s miners MCA Victorian Division As the industry grows, a united industry voice is more important than ever to meet  new challenges and secure a modern, effective policy framework. Regional engagement  MCA Victoria supported community  understanding of minerals exploration  with the production of an exploration  fact sheet for regional communities  and landowners, updated a best  practice engagement guide for  industry, published exploration and  mining approvals pathways maps, and  hosted Indigenous cultural awareness  workshops for industry. Multiple media articles and industry  journal articles were published with  MCA comment through the year. Policy advocacy  MCA Victoria launched Rediscover  Victoria, a policy priorities publication  in the lead-up to the state election,  secured mining’s place in the Victorian  Skills Plan, provided input to Earth  Resources Regulation matters including  the Resources Management System  and ERR Licensing Lifecycle project  to support more efficient regulation of  exploration and mining in Victoria. Schools outreach MCA Victoria delivered a new industry  immersion program hosting almost 350  students from 14 Victorian schools to  mine sites across the state to learn more  about careers in mining.  The program explores career pathways  into the industry with hands-on mine site  tours giving students the opportunity  to hear from workers across a range of  diverse mining roles.  MCA Victoria also supported earth  sciences in schools through sponsorship  of the Teacher Earth Science Education  Program and the Science Talent  Search Awards. Supporting a safe industry  MCA Victoria delivered the Victorian  Mine Rescue Competition at the  Fosterville Gold Mine and ISH24,  and hosted an industry safety  representatives safety workshop  with WorkSafe Victoria.  22 	 This page: MCA Victoria  Executive director James  Sorahan visits A1 Gold Mine  in eastern Victoria; Weeroona  College Bendigo pictured  during a mine site visit; and  James visiting Mandalay  Resources and Agnico Eagle  booths at the Prospectors and  Developers Association of  Canada conference.   ===== PAGE 23 ===== 23 James Sorahan Executive Director MCA Victoria MCA Victoria also published new  guidance on emergency management  for the Victorian minerals sector setting  out emergency management roles by  control agency and mine site obligations  under Victoria’s safety legislation. Critical minerals  MCA Victoria advocated strongly for  support for critical minerals exploration  and development. The division also  worked with government to design  critical minerals exploration and  development budget initiatives in  line with MCA Victoria’s pre-budget  submission.  Promoting excellence and  regional leadership MCA Victoria working groups met across  regional Victoria to share environment,  community and safety best practice. MCA Victoria hosted the Victorian  Women in Resources Awards. MCA  Victoria sponsored the Wimmera  Leadership Program and the LEAD  Loddon Murray Leadership program  to foster development for young  professionals in regional Victoria. Networking and promotion Melbourne Mining Club (MMC) held a  number of successful and well-attended  MMC lunches and Cutting Edge  information evenings in 2022.  MMC is a not-for-profit joint venture  formed by the MCA and AusIMM with a  volunteer-based steering committee to  promote the resources industry.  Mining advocacy MCA Victoria effectively represented  members on multiple government  advisory groups as the voice for mining  in Victoria.

The Territory has set an ambition  of increasing its economy to $40 billion by  2030, a goal that will only be achievable  with growth of the mining industry.   Building a bigger NT minerals industry  needs a concerted strategy. To its credit,  the NT Government was prepared take  a good look at the drivers and barriers  and development, through a dedicated  group, the Minerals Development  Taskforce – a group which included  MCA CEO Tania Constable. To assist the taskforce, the MCA NT  Division galvanised the membership and  experts to help feed into the process,  identifying and leading an agenda for  reform: a royalty regime that was simpler  and easier for investors to compare  with other Australian successful mining  states, particularly Western Australia;  a more efficient titles and land access  process; a closer and genuine pro- Mining sets the pace to help  Territory achieve growth goals MCA Northern Territory Division The mining industry  maintained its position  as the largest private  sector contributor to  the Northern Territory’s  economy in 2022. growth partnership with Traditional  Owners and land councils; a skills  development agenda; a greater focus on  shared infrastructure and opportunities  for downstream processing.  The Taskforce’s work was completed  in December and released at the  Darwin Mining Club in April 2023. In a  win for industry, the NT Government  has accepted in principle all of its  recommendations to win more private  sector investment and accelerate the  process of turning prospective mines  into operational mines. Importantly the  NT government will examine reforms to  royalties, moving away from its complex  and opaque hybrid system. Clean energy future  The Northern Territory’s minerals  sector is in a fortunate position with an  abundance of the rare earths and critical  minerals that are in high demand for a  clean energy future. 	 This page: Executive  Director Northern Australia  Cathryn Tilmouth addressing  the media with NT Deputy  Chief Minister Nicole  Manison at the launch of the  final Minerals Development  Taskforce report; and MCA  NT Council Chair Brad Welsh  pictured with MCA CEO  Tania Constable.   ===== PAGE 25 ===== 25 Cathryn Tilmouth Executive Director Northern Australia Recent developments for MCA member  companies, such as Arafura Rare Earths  and Core Lithium, have shown the NT is  capable of providing these commodities  to the market.  MCA NT has strengthened relationships  with the broader resources industry,  as well as pastoralists and Traditional  Owner stakeholders, as the NT makes  moves to invest in a clean energy future  that will affect all of these parties.  Building our workforce With the residual challenges of the  COVID-19 pandemic, the MCA NT has  focused on working with members to  address the subsequent labor shortages.  In June the division convened a jobs and  skills summit that allowed NT-based  businesses to identify and assess the  challenges and opportunities across the  Top End and feed this information through  to national policy decision makers. This resulted in a collaboration between  the NT Government, the Master  Builders Association, the NT Chamber  of Commerce and MCA NT to trial a  skilled migration pilot program to look at  attracting overseas workers and their  families to fill some of the skills gaps. To future proof the NT skills and labor  talent pool, the MCA continued to  promote mining as an industry of choice  with school leavers.  Activities included promoting career  pathways to high school and university  students in the Territory, and the Clontarf  and Stars programs for Indigenous  students. Supporting a safe industry  MCA NT delivered the 2022 Northern  Australia Emergency Rescue  Competition at the Charles Darwin  University Casuarina campus.  Six teams from different mine sites  competed to test their skills and training  across various accident and emergency  scenarios during a successful  competition. Celebrating our industry The MCA NT held a number of Darwin  Mining Club luncheons with high profile  guest speakers providing updates on  projects, policy, government objectives  or topical interests. MCA NT also held a Darwin women’s  networking lunch, attended by around  500 women, to promote employment  opportunities in the minerals industry  and to highlight safety and wellbeing  work in the industry.

The current portion for this provision includes the total amount accrued for annual leave entitlements and the amounts accrued for long  service leave entitlements that have vested due to employees having completed the required period of service. Based on past experience,  the entity does not expect the full amount of annual leave or long service leave balances classified as current liabilities to be settled within  the next 12 months. However, these amounts must be classified as current liabilities since the entity does not have an unconditional right to  defer the settlement of these amounts in the event employees wish to use their leave entitlement. The non-current portion for this provision includes amounts accrued for long service leave entitlements that have not yet vested in relation  to those employees who have not yet completed the required period of service. In calculating the present value of future cash flows in respect of long service leave, the probability of long service leave being taken is  based upon historical data. The measurement and recognition criteria for employee benefits have been discussed in Note 15(k). The entity is incorporated under the Corporations Act 2001 and is a company limited by guarantee. If the entity is wound up, the constitution  states that each member is required to contribute a maximum of $10 each towards meeting any outstanding obligations of the entity.  At 31 December 2022, the number of members was 119 (2021: 104). 11	 Members’ guarantee  ===== PAGE 48 ===== 48 MCA Annual Report 2022 2022  $ 2021  $ Commitments in relation to operating leases for office rental and office  equipment contracted for at balance date but not recognised as liabilities: Within one year 5,789 5,789 Later than one year but not later than five years 15,956 21,008 Later than five years - 1,750 21,745 28,547 MCA leases various offices and equipment under non cancellable operating leases expiring within six months to sixty four months.

These policies  have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.  The financial statements are for the Minerals Council  of Australia and its 50% interest in the jointly operated Melbourne Mining Club. (a) Basis of preparation These general purpose financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations  issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board and the Corporations Act 2001. Minerals Council of Australia (MCA) is a not-for- profit entity for the purpose of preparing the financial statements. (i) Compliance with Australian Accounting Standards - Reduced Disclosure Requirements The consolidated financial statements of the MCA comply with Australian Accounting Standards – Simplified Disclosures as issued by the  Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB). Notes to the financial statements  ===== PAGE 49 ===== 49 (ii) Historical cost convention These financial statements, except for the cash flow statement, have been prepared on accrual basis and are based on historical cost  basis. The amounts presented are in Australian Dollars and have been rounded to the nearest dollar. (iii) New standards adopted The MCA has adopted AASB1060: General Purpose Financial Statements – Simplified Disclosures for For-Profit and Not-for Profit  Tier 2 Entities for the first time this reporting period. The Standard, which sets out a new separate disclosure Standard to be applied  by all entities that are reporting under Tier 2 of the Differential Reporting Framework in AASB 1053: Application of Tiers of Australian  Accounting, replaces the previous Reduced Disclosure Requirements (RDR) framework. The application of this standard has resulted  in new and/or increased disclosures in areas such as receivables, right-of-use assets, trade and other payables, provisions, members’  guarantee and financial risk management. (b) Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised for the major business activities as follows: (i) Membership fees Revenue from membership fees relates to the provision of annual membership benefits to members. The consideration for memberships is  based on fixed fees and is recognised over the membership year as members simultaneously receive and benefit from the services provided. Components of the membership fees that are collected for annual programs are recognised over time as the MCA provides the services  with reference to qualitative achievement of planned activities for each program. (ii) Events The MCA holds a number of events during the year. Revenue is recognised when the event has been held and the consideration is based  on fixed fees. (iii) Sponsorship The MCA receives sponsorship income from customers in support or partnership of MCA events. Revenue is recognised when the event  has been held and the consideration is based on fixed fee amounts. (iv) Management fees The MCA provides management support services to an external entity as determined in the contractual agreement. The contract contains  fixed monthly management fees and specifies the services as the provision of public affairs and policy support services and provision of  management personnel services. The services provided are substantially the same each month and have the same pattern of transfer,  therefore the MCA accounts for the contracts as two performance obligations, the annual provision of support services and management  personnel services. Revenue is recognised over the life of the contract as the customer simultaneously receives the benefits as MCA  provides the services. (v) Contract assets and liabilities Contract assets represent services provided to customers which are not yet billed. Contract liabilities recognised are in relation to revenue  billed to customers, where MCA has not yet provided the services. (c) Interest revenue Interest income from cash and cash equivalents and other investments is recognised when earned. (d) Income tax The MCA is exempt from income tax under Section 50-40 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. (e) Cash and cash equivalents For the purpose of presentation in the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call  with financial institutions, other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months that are readily  convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. (f) Term deposits Term deposits are classified as financial assets at amortised cost as they are held with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows  and the contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest. The original maturity of the term  deposits are greater than three months. (g) Trade and other receivables All debtors are recognised at the amounts receivable on settlement. Trade receivables are due for settlement no more than 30 days from  the date of recognition. Collectability of trade debtors is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Debts which are known to be uncollectible are  written off. MCA holds the trade receivables with the objective of collecting the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them initially at fair  value and subsequently at amortised cost. Notes to the financial statements  ===== PAGE 50 ===== 50 MCA Annual Report 2022 15	 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont.) (h) Plant and equipment Plant and equipment are measured on the cost basis less depreciation and impairment losses. The cost method of accounting is used for  all acquisitions of assets. Cost is measured as the fair value of the assets given up at the date of acquisition, plus costs incidental to the  acquisition. Where assets are acquired through a non-reciprocal transfer the balance is recognised as revenue in profit or loss. (i) Depreciation Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis so as to write off the net cost of each non-current asset during its expected useful life.  Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of either the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the  improvements. Estimates of remaining useful lives are made on a regular basis for all assets, with annual reassessments for major items. The following rates of depreciation have been employed: Furniture, fitting and equipment	 Leasehold improvement	 Motor vehicles	 10% - 40%	 7.5% - 60%	 25% (i) Impairment of assets Assets that are subject to depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the  carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds  its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. (j) Trade and other payables These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services received prior to the end of the financial year and which are unpaid. The  amounts are unsecured and are paid in accordance with specified terms. MCA recognises the trade payables initially at fair values and subsequently at amortised cost. (k) Employee benefits (i) Wages and salaries and annual leave Liabilities for wages and salaries and annual leave, expected to be settled within twelve months of the balance date, are recognised and  are measured as the amount unpaid at the reporting date at current pay rates in respect of employees’ services up to that date. (ii) Long service leave Liabilities for long service leave are recognised, and are measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect  of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience  of employees departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using interest rates on investments with terms  that match as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows. (iii) Retirement benefit obligations – defined contribution superannation benefits All employees of the MCA receive defined contribution superannuation entitlements, for which the entity pays the fixed superannuation  guarantee contribution (currently 10.5% of the employee’s average ordinary salary) to the employee’s superannuation fund of choice.  All contributions in respect of employee’s defined contribution entitlements is limited to its obligation for any unpaid superannuation  guarantee contributions at the end of the reporting period. All obligations for unpaid superannuation guarantee contributions are  measured at the (undiscounted) amounts expected to be paid when the obligation is settled and are presented as current liabilities in the  entity’s statement of financial position. (l) Goods and Services Tax (GST) Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST, unless the GST incurred is not recoverable from the  taxation authority. In this case it is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense. Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or  payable to, the taxation authority is included with other receivables or payables in the statement of financial position. Cash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing or financing activities which are  recoverable from, or payable to the taxation authority, are presented as operating cash flows. (m) Jointly controlled operation The proportionate interest in the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a jointly controlled operation have been incorporated in the  financial statements under the appropriate headings. The MCA is party to a jointly controlled operation called Melbourne Mining Club.  The MCA has a 50 percent participating interest in this venture, and is entitled to 50 percent of its output. MCA’s interests in the assets  employed in the jointly controlled operation are included in the statement of financial position. The principal place of business is Australia. (n) Comparative figures When required by Accounting Standards, comparative figures have been adjusted to conform to changes in presentation for the current  financial year. Notes to the financial statements  ===== PAGE 51 ===== 51 (o) Accounting for leases All leases are accounted for by recognising a right-of-use asset and a lease liability except for: •	 leases of low value assets •	 leases with a duration of twelve months or less Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the contractual payments due to the lessor over the lease term, with the discount  rate determined by reference to the rate inherent in the lease. If this is not readily determinable, an incremental borrowing rate on  commencement of the lease is used. Variable lease payments are only included in the measurement of the lease liability if they depend on an  index or rate. If such cases, the initial measurement of the lease liability assumes the variable element will remain unchanged throughout the  lease term. Other variable lease payments are expensed in the period to which they relate. Right-of-use assets are initially measured at the amount of the lease liability, reduced for any lease incentives received, and increased for: •	 lease payments made at or before the commencement of the lease •	 initial direct costs incurred •	 the amount of any provision recognised where the MCA is contractually required to dismantle, remove or restore the leased asset. Subsequent to initial measurement, lease liabilities increase as a result of interest charged at a constant rate on the balance outstanding  and are reduced for lease payments made. Right-of-use assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the lease or  over the remaining economic life of the asset if, rarely, this is judged to be shorter than the lease term. (p) Provisions Provisions are recognised when the entity has a legal or constructive obligation, as a result of past events, for which it is probable that an  outflow of economic benefits will result and that outflow can be reliably measured. Provisions recognised represent the best estimate of the  amounts required to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period. (q) Financial instruments (i) Initial recognition and measurement Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions to the instrument.  For financial assets, this is the date that the Entity commits itself to either the purchase or sale of the asset (i.e. trade date accounting is  adopted). Financial instruments (except for trade receivables) are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs, except where the instrument  is classified “at fair value through profit or loss”, in which case transaction costs are expensed to profit or loss immediately. Where available,  quoted prices in an active market are used to determine fair value. In other circumstances, valuation techniques are adopted. Trade receivables are initially measured at the transaction price if the trade receivables do not contain significant financing component or if  the practical expedient was applied as specified in AASB 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers. (ii) Classification and subsequent measurement Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at: •	 amortised cost; or •	 fair value through profit or loss. A financial liability is measured at fair value through profit or loss if the financial liability is: •	 a contingent consideration of an acquirer in a business combination to which AASB 3: Business Combinations applies; •	 held for trading; or •	 initially designated as at fair value through profit or loss. All other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The effective interest  method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest expense over in profit or loss over the  relevant period. The effective interest rate is the internal rate of return of the financial asset or liability. That is, it is the rate that exactly discounts the  estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the instrument to the net carrying amount at initial recognition. A financial liability  cannot be reclassified. Financial assets  Financial assets are subsequently measured at: •	 amortised cost; •	 fair value through other comprehensive income; or •	 fair value through profit and loss Notes to the financial statements  ===== PAGE 52 ===== 52 MCA Annual Report 2022 MCA evaluates estimates and judgements incorporated into the financial statements based on historical knowledge and best available  current information. Estimates assume a reasonable expectation of future events and are based on current trends and economic data,  obtained both externally and within MCA. Key Estimates   (i) Impairment MCA assesses impairment at the end of each reporting period by evaluation of conditions and events specific to MCA that may be  indicative of impairment triggers. Recoverable amounts of relevant assets are reassessed using value-in-use calculations which  incorporate various key assumptions.   MCA determined conditions of impairment through obtaining market information about the cost of  the existing assets in which would cost to purchase at current arm’s length market prices. Key Judgements (i)   Employee benefits For the purpose of measurement, AASB 119: Employee Benefits (September 2011) defines obligations for short-term employee benefits as  obligations expected to be settled wholly before 12 months after the end of the annual reporting period in which the employees render the  related services. As MCA expects that all of its employees would use all of their annual leave entitlements earned during a reporting period  before 12 months after the end of the reporting period, MCA believes that obligations for annual leave entitlements satisfy the definition of  short-term employee benefits and, therefore, can be measured at the (undiscounted) amounts expected to be paid to employees when  the obligations are settled. 16	 Significant accounting estimates and judgements on the basis of the two primary criteria, being: •	 the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset; and •	 the business model for managing the financial assets A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortised cost when it meets the following conditions: •	 the financial asset is managed solely to collect contractual cash flows; and fair value through other comprehensive income; or •	 the contractual terms within the financial asset give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal  amount outstanding on specified dates. A financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income when it meets the following conditions: •	 	the contractual terms within the financial asset give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal  amount outstanding on specified dates; and •	 	the business model for managing the financial asset comprises both contractual cash flows collection and the selling of the financial asset. The initial designation of the financial instruments to measure at fair value through profit and loss is a one-time option on initial  classification and is irrevocable until the financial asset is derecognised. (iii) Derecognition Derecognition refers to the removal of a previously recognised financial asset or financial liability from the statement date in accordance  with the entity’s accounting policy. Derecognition of financial liabilities A liability is derecognised when it is extinguished (i.e. when the obligation in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires). Derecognition of financial assets A financial asset is derecognised when the holder’s contractual rights to its cash flows expires, or the asset is transferred in such a way  that all the risks and rewards of ownership are substantially transferred. The Entity recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets. Loss allowance is not recognised for: •	 financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss; or •	 equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Expected credit losses are the probability-weighted estimate of credit losses over the expected life of a financial instrument. A credit loss  is the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due and all cash flows expected to be received, all discounted at the original  effective interest rate of the financial instruments. 15	 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont.) Notes to the financial statements  ===== PAGE 53 ===== 53 MCA has determined that all employees are expected to reach the required years of service to qualify for long-service leave. This  probability assessment has been relied upon when competing the calculation to determine long-service leave obligations. (ii)   Performance obligations under AASB 15 To identify a performance obligation under AASB 15, the agreement must be sufficiently specific to be able to determine when the  obligation is satisfied. Management exercises judgement to determine whether the agreement is sufficiently specific by considering  any conditions specified in the arrangement, explicit or implicit, regarding the promised goods or services. In making this assessment,  management includes the nature/ type, cost/ value, quantity and the period of transfer related to the goods or services agreed. (iii)   Lease term an option to extend under AASB 16 The lease term is defined as the non-cancellable period of a lease together with both periods covered by an option to terminate the lease  if the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. The options that are reasonably going to be exercised is a key management  judgement that the entity will make. The entity determines the likeliness to exercise the options on a lease-by-lease basis looking at various  factors such as which assets are strategic and which are key to future strategy of the entity. There were no changes to the accounting policy during the year ending 31 December 2022. 17	 Changes in accounting policies Other than the following, the directors are not aware of any significant events since the end of the reporting period. The MCA paid a total of $309,100 following the cancellation of an event hire contract on 18 January 2023. The expense will be brought to  account in 2023. The MCA continues to work with stakeholders and partners to secure value from the future delivery of a similar event. 18	 Events occuring after balance date Notes to the financial statements  ===== PAGE 54 ===== 54 MCA Annual Report 2022 In the directors’ opinion: (a) the financial statements and notes set out on pages 41 to 53 are in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including: (i) complying with Accounting Standards – Simplified Disclosures, the Corporations Regulations 2001 and other mandatory  professional reporting requirements, and (ii) giving a true and fair view of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 31 December 2022 and of its performance for  the year ended on that date, and (b) there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Company will be able to pay its debts as and when they become due and payable. This declaration is made in accordance with a resolution of the directors.
