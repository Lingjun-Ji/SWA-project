United by a passion for our work as well as our  inclusive culture and team spirit, we innovate to conserve  water and create value from waste, in the form of recycled  materials and energy. We promote and implement  responsible behaviors, more efficient technologies and  circular solutions to recycle and make the best possible  use of the finite resources of the Earth. Deeply rooted in our  communities, we are committed to providing people and the  planet with the resources for a common future”. SUEZ benefits from its historical expertise and know-how  in the waste and water sector, all along the value chain,  for more than 160 years, as an environmental services  multinational company. The Group is one of the main  players in the global environment market. SUEZ relies on a solid consortium of investors made up  of Meridiam and GIP – with 40% stakes each - and the  Caisse des Dépôts Group with a 20% stake in the capital,  including 8% held by CNP Assurances, to pursue its  strategic development plans in France and internationally.  In addition, 3% of SUEZ’s capital is held by employees  following the «Go SUEZ 2022» employee shareholding plan,  the largest in the Group’s history. With its 40,000 employees present in 40 countries (notably  in France, Italy, Central Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia),  the Group offers tailor-made environmental solutions to all  its customers, local authorities and industrial companies,  to drive their ecological transition, together with their end- users. The Group which focuses on a circular economy model,  has a presence throughout the water management and  waste-recovery value chain: from the construction and  the operation of water networks and infrastructure to  collection, sorting and recycling, and even the production  of renewable energy, new materials and the provision of  digital services. Backed by its expertise and 9 technical and innovation  centers and R&D centers in Europe and Asia, SUEZ places  innovation at the heart of the Group’s strategy to speed  up the development and implementation of radically new  solutions.

SUEZ    |    GREEN BOND REPORTING 2022   INTRODUCTION  ===== PAGE 5 ===== 5 Our businesses and expertise contribute by nature to  preserving the environment and provide essential services.  Our sustainable development roadmap aims to strengthen  and amplify this contribution by structuring our actions  around a strong common ambition wherever we operate  beyond our natural contribution, based on 3 pillars and 24  commitments. Innovations & digital Solutions On top of waste and water historical core businesses,  SUEZ is actively developing innovative & digital Solutions to  accelerate the Group’s differentiation through its positive  impact on health, quality of life, the environment and  climate. Through innovative technology and expertise, the  Group supports its clients transitioning in the following  areas:   •	 air quality monitoring and remediation;  •	 design and operation of smart cities;  •	 natural capital protection; and  •	 consulting in key areas of urban management - hydraulic  infrastructure, waste manage-ment and recovery, urban  development, mobilities, renewable energy and digital  rollout in regions.  1.2 | Our sustainable development             roadmap2 Climate pillar Contributing to decarbonizing energy, reducing greenhouse  gas emissions, and adapting our most exposed sites to  climate change are our 3 main levers for climate. Our key commitments: •	 By 2030, 70% of the electricity that we use worldwide will  be renewable, increasing to 100% in Europe; •	 As of 2023 in Europe and throughout the duration of  the plan, we will be electricity self-sufficient: we will  produce more electricity than we consume; •	 We will lower 39% of our greenhouse gas emissions  from our Water activities by 2030; •	 We will decrease 26% of our greenhouse gas emissions  from our Waste3 activities by 2030 and invest 40 M€ in  R&D dedicated to carbon capture and storage; •	 By 2027, we will cover 100% of our priority and vulnerable  sites with a specific action plan to adapt to climate  change. _ _ 2 https://www.suez.com/-/media/suez-global/files/publication-docs/pdf-english/suez-en-ambition-commitments-sustainable-development-2023-2027.pdf?open=true  3 Excluding energy from waste SUEZ    |    GREEN BOND REPORTING 2022   INTRODUCTION Nature pillar Preserving  resources,  growing  nature  regeneration  capacities of SUEZ, and addressing the pres-sures on  biodiversity are our 3 main levers for nature to address  the 5 drivers of biodiversity decline identified by IPBES  (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity  and Eco-system Services). Our key commitments: •	 By 2027, every year, we will double the area of land we  restore to reduce the land arti-ficialization pace; •	 100% of new drinking water contracts could have a water  savings plan by 2027 to save up to 10% of consumption; •	 By 2027, we will end the use of phytosanitary products   ===== PAGE 6 ===== 6 Social pillar Guaranteeing  sustainability  with  universal  values,  growing skills and fostering employee en-gagement,  and contributing to the sustainable development of  communities everywhere we operate are our 3 main  levers to reconcile human and economic development  as well as in-crease positive externalities of our  businesses together with our partners and customers.      Our key commitments: •	 We target zero serious accidents in the area of  occupational health & safety •	 By 2027, we will enable 5,000 people per year to benefit  from vocational integration programs •	 We will increase the proportion of local suppliers to  contribute to the development of the communities in  which we operate •	 We will increase the employees shareholding in our  capital to 10% by 2029 to build engagement among our  employees. Governance In line with the Group’s strategy, we defined these targets  through a review of stakeholder expectations, outlining the  most important issues, and close dialogue with subsidiaries  as part of the development of their medium-term plans.  The targets were revised by the Executive Committee and  CSR Committee prior to final approval by the Board itself.  They were then presented before the European Works  Council. The above commitments are reviewed on an  annual basis by the CSR Committee. The latter also sets  targets for the next year, overseeing alignment between the  resources allocated and their deployment.  In addition, 20% of SUEZ executives’ long-term compensation  is indexed on the attainment of these targets, with a focus on  health and safety, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions  and equal opportunities.  Sustainable development and strategy are inextricably  linked. The Group strategic review includes reporting on  sustainable development commitments. This enables us  to monitor the correct implementation of the company’s  medium-term plan. SUEZ    |    GREEN BOND REPORTING 2022   INTRODUCTION on the green spaces of our op-erating sites worldwide;  •	 In all our new wastewater plants construction contracts,  we will propose, whenever possible, solutions to  eliminate microplastics and micropollutants; •	 Starting 2025, we will systematically integrate local  species in our land restoration and development projects.  ===== PAGE 7 ===== 7 2 Green Bond   issuances in 20224 In strong alignment and consistency with its sustainable  development roadmap and ambition, and keen to be an  active player in sustainable finance, SUEZ published in May  2022 its Green Bond Framework5, aligned with the 2021  Green Bond Principles, which benefited from Sustainalytics’  Second Party Opinion6. In 2022, SUEZ hit a new milestone in the deployment of  its finance model when it set up a €7,5 billion Green Euro  Medium Term Note programme.  In 2022, SUEZ, rated Baa2 by Moody’s, issued five green  bonds, with 2 operations for a total value of €4.3 billion: Ccy  Amount  Coupon  Issue Date Maturity date   ISIN EUR 750 m 1,875 % 24 mai 2022 24 mai 2027 FR001400AFL5 EUR 850 m 2,375 % 24 mai 2022  24 mai 2030 FR001400AFN1 EUR 1 000 m 2,875 % 24 mai 2022 24 mai 2034 FR001400AFO9 EUR  800 m 4,625 % 03 nov 2022 03 nov 2028 FR001400DQ84 EUR 900 m 5,000 % 03 nov 2022 03 nov 2032 FR001400DQ92 _ _ 4 https://www.suez.com/en/finance/debt-and-rating  5 https://www.suez.com/-/media/suez-global/files/publication-docs/pdf-english/finance/suez-greenbondframework-en-2022.pdf?open=true 6 https://www.suez.com/-/media/suez-global/files/publication-docs/pdf-english/finance/suez-greenbondframework-secondpartyopinion-en-2022.pdf?open=true  SUEZ    |    GREEN BOND REPORTING 2022   GREEN BOND ISSUANCES IN 2022  ===== PAGE 8 ===== 8 3 Green Bond   Reporting 3.1 | Allocation reporting As of 31/12/2022, 100% of the Green Bond proceeds have  been allocated to Eligible Green Projects: •	 100% of the proceeds (€4.3bn) is allocated to the  acquisition of SUEZ activities acquired on 31/01/2022 by  the consortium of shareholders7, with 84% allocated to  Water activities and 16% to R&R activities; •	 100% of the proceeds are used for the refinancing of the  acquisition debt; •	 > 90% of the revenue from the refinanced portfolio  is derived from Eligible Green Project Categories (as  defined in the Framework section Use of Proceeds /  Eligible types of Investments). Methodology:  The figures published in this reporting rely on our environmental  reporting that feeds our NFPS9 (Non Financial Performance  Statement) and so the methodology is the same (methodology  described in the paragraph 4 of our NFPS: “4. Methodology of  annual reporting”). The figures relate exclusively to companies  over which SUEZ has operational control. As soon as a company  enters the scope of operational control, its environmental data  is integrated up to 100% regardless of the percentage of capital  held. The scope is fixed at June 30 of the year of the exercise. The  figures published here are those of annual reporting year 2021  to correspond to the Green Bond allocation. As this allocation  doesn’t concern the full scope of SUEZ, comparison with upcoming  publication for the same indicators is not possible. 3.2 | Impact reporting Eligible  Activity  GHG emissions: Total Scopes 1&2 market based  (tons of CO2eq) GHG avoided emissions   (tons of CO2eq) Renewable energy production   (MWh) Water 1 233 474 29 868 338 793 Waste  1 135 933 3 427 100 1 245 811 At global Green Bond portfolio perimeter8:  _ _ 7 The calculation of the green value was made using the equity value of the different categories as of 31/01/2022.

This  transposition was completed in November 2018 with an amendment to Article  L. 225-102-1 of French commercial law. By focusing on social, environmental, and societal information that is relevant  to the main risks and challenges identified by the company, this system favors  a ''materiality'' approach and the search for greater relevance and usefulness  of the information presented for companies and their stakeholders. It also  makes it possible to include in the requirements relating to the publication  of information: 	- An explanation of SUEZ business model; 	- An analysis of the main risks and opportunities associated with SUEZ  activities; 	- A description of the policies applied and the associated action plans; 	- The results of those policies, including key performance indicators. Furthermore, pursuant to the European Commission's two delegated acts of  June 4 and July 6, 2021 clarifying the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2020/852  of June 18, 2020 on taxonomy (''Taxonomy Regulation''), French companies  subject to the obligation to publish non-financial information pursuant to  Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU, as amended by Directive 2014/95/  EU (known as the ''NFRD'') must include in their non-financial performance  statement the information provided for in the Taxonomy Regulation relating  to activities considered to be ''sustainable economic activities'', as defined in  that regulation. Section 5 of this non-financial performance statement meets  these obligations.  ===== PAGE 5 ===== 5 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y For over 160 years, SUEZ has been  providing essential services to  protect and improve the quality of life  in the face of growing environmental  challenges. SUEZ offers resilient and  innovative solutions to enable its  customers to provide access to water  and waste services. With a presence in 40 countries  and nearly 40,000 employees, SUEZ  also gives its customers the ability  to create value over the entire life  cycle of their assets and services,  and to drive the ecological transition  together with their end users. In 2023, SUEZ provided drinking  water to 57 million people worldwide  and sanitation services to over 36  million people. The Group produced  7.7 TWh of energy from waste and  wastewater.  Under the leadership of Sabrina  Soussan, the Group recorded revenue  of nearly €9 billion in 2023.  Backed by its expertise and capacity  to innovate, SUEZ has strong growth  prospects. SUEZ relies on a solid  consortium of investors made up of  Meridiam and GIP – with 40% stakes  each - and the Caisse des Dépôts  Group with a 20% stake in the capital,  including 8% held by CNP Assurances,  to pursue its strategic development  plans in France and internationally. In  addition, 3% of SUEZ capital is held  by employees following the ''Go SUEZ  2022'' employee shareholding plan,  the largest in the Group's history. 1 Group  Business  Model © SUEZ / CDPNEWS / Cyrille Dupont  ===== PAGE 6 ===== 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N TA L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 6 SUEZ adopted its purpose in September 2022 and  included it in its by-laws in 2023: ''Faced with growing environmental challenges, each day,  for more than 160 years, we have been acting in support  of our clients and partners to deliver essential services  that protect and improve the quality of life wherever we  operate. United by a passion for our work as well as our inclusive  culture and team spirit, we innovate to conserve water  and create value from waste, in the form of recycled  materials and energy. We promote and implement  responsible behaviors, more efficient technologies, and  circular solutions to recycle and make the best possible  use of the finite resources of the Earth. Deeply rooted in our communities, we are committed to  providing people and the planet with the resources for a  common future.'' The Group actively involved its stakeholders in the  formulation of that purpose:  	- by making the most of extensive survey data (customers,  employees, stakeholders) and in-house and external  documentation on the Group's challenges, history, and  activities in various geographical zones, 	- by consulting a variety of external leaders from  different fields (scientists, philosophers, artists), 	- by bringing in two panels of around one hundred  employees, French-speaking and English-speaking,  representing the diversity of the Group's employee  profiles and geographies, 	- through discussions with employee representatives on  the European Works Council, 	- by devoting several meetings of the Executive  Committee and the Board of Directors' CSR Committee  to it, prior to approval by the full Board.  1.1 | Purpose SUEZ ambition is to become the trusted partner for  circular solutions in water and waste. The strategy focuses on core business, i.e. the waste and  water value chains and related services. Those business  lines form a dynamic, diversified, and balanced portfolio.  The Group also focuses on core markets: combining  mature, resilient markets with an appetite for innovation,  and high-growth emerging markets. SUEZ sets itself apart from its competitors with a value  proposition tailored to its customers' priorities and needs,  bringing together its unique expertise in construction  with recognized leadership in digital technology, the  user experience, and innovation. The growth strategy  will enable to increase the proportion of business that is  carried out both internationally and in the waste sector.  This is in line with the Group’s ambitious and proven  commitments to people, the planet, and the environment:  SUEZ wants to be the leader in its sector in terms of ESG  (environmental, social, and governance factors). The Group is strengthening the customer focus of the  organization, processes, and performance programs. It is  improving its operational, commercial, and environmental  performance by promoting a culture of entrepreneurship,  based on local entrepreneurship, responsibility,  inclusiveness, as well as a strong sense of purpose and  collaboration. Thanks to the support of its shareholders, the Group is  aiming for an increase in its investments in Research &  Innovation of 50% over 5 years versus 2022, in both water  and waste management. The innovation strategy enabled  SUEZ to hold over 1,700 patents (in 456 patent families)  by the end of 2022. Within 5 years, that strategy will enable SUEZ to set the  benchmark in  industry, recognized for its agility, restored  margins, its capacity to create value and innovation, and  its commitment to people and the environment. 1.2 | Strategy  ===== PAGE 7 ===== 7 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y In 2023, SUEZ generated 59% of its revenue in France and  41% internationally. 39% of this revenue was generated in  the water market and 61% in waste management. 1.3 | Activities WATER INFRASTRUCTURE DRINKING WATER WASTE WATER DESALINATION SERVICES DRINKING WATER WASTE WATER SMART & DIGITAL SOLUTIONS •	 In 2023, the Group operated 883 drinking water  production sites, producing around 4.1 billion m³ of  drinking water;  In the water sector: •	 In 2023, the Group operated 2,334 wastewater  treatment sites, and biologically treated 2.9 billion m³  of wastewater. •	 In 2023, the Group processed almost 28 million metric  tons of waste and served around 13 million people and  66,403 customers in the service and industrial sectors  through its waste collection activities; In the waste sector: WASTE COLLECTION SORTING PROCESSING LANDFILL INCINERATION RECYCLING •	 In 2023, the Group operated 60 composting platforms,  45 incineration sites, 375 material sorting, recovery,  and transfer stations, and a fleet of 4,445 heavy  vehicles. With the acquisition of IWS at the end of 2022, SUEZ has  broadened its scope of activities with the treatment and  recovery of hazardous waste (transport, stabilization and  storage, incineration, production of alternative fuel for the  cement industry, energy and material recovery, treatment  of polluted water, transit platform). This subsidiary  provides an integrated approach to its clients with a  wide range of solutions covering all types of hazardous  waste, over the entire value chain and with the associated  traceability. SUEZ operational responsibilities vary according to the  types of projects and contracts that support them. As a  result, the Group does not always own the infrastructures  it operates on behalf of its industrial or municipal  customers. In the water sector, this is almost never the  case. Its ability to intervene on these sites, particularly  for actions requiring major investments (for adaptation to  climate change, for example), is subject to the agreement  and support of its customers.

That monitoring involves regular surveys of customers  and stakeholders, systematic exchanges with SUEZ BUs,  as well as tools for analyzing the press, social media,  and stakeholder publications, as well as the network of  the Strategy, Sustainable Development, Public Affairs,  Marketing, and Communications Departments. Group's risks and opportunities stem from the following  macro trends:  Political instability Political instability may result in frequent changes in  policies and regulations related to water and waste  management. This inconsistency can create uncertainty  for industry stakeholders, making it difficult to plan  and adapt operations accordingly. Regulatory gaps  or conflicting policies may also lead to inadequate  protections for water quality and environmental  standards. Political instability can weaken the capacity  of government institutions to effectively govern and  enforce regulations within the water and waste sector.  Instability can lead to frequent turnover of key positions,  lack of expertise, and limited resources for monitoring  and enforcement. This can result in inadequate oversight  of water and waste management practices, potentially  leading to pollution, improper disposal, and inadequate  treatment. Current geopolitical tensions affect supply,  availability of raw material and inflation, which has  consequences on costs and margins. The impacts of climate change The latest IPCC report highlighted the overall inadequacy  of the commitments made under the Paris Agreement to  secure a maximum temperature rise of 1.5°C and limit the  risks associated with the consequences of climate change.  This was confirmed by the last COP: implementation of  the Paris Agreement is not where it should be. There is  a big mitigation gap, with the current trajectory of global  emissions not being consistent with limiting the global  temperature rise to 1.5°C, while adaptation to climate  change is not at the levels needed. Climate change will continue to have an impact on  the water and waste cycle, with more frequent severe  droughts, less snow, more deadly floods, multiplying  pollutions, increased greenhouse gas emissions, and  loss of biodiversity. There are technological solutions to  mitigate those effects and plan ahead for a more resilient  model of society. The waste and water businesses have  become resource businesses for local authorities.  With the help of digital technology, local authorities  are combating the strain on the quality and quantity of  resources, reducing the carbon footprint of services and  customers by producing, for example, secondary raw  materials, or producing renewable energies.  Demographic growth and ''metropolization'' Since November 15, 2022, the world's population has  passed the 8 billion marks. Current projections suggest  that population growth will continue and then stagnate  over the coming decades, reaching 9.7 billion by 2030  and 11 billion by 2100. This trend, coupled with the strong  urban concentration of populations near coastal areas  and the westernization of lifestyles, is very significative.  As a consequence, cities—which concentrate most of the  wealth and innovation, but at the same time crystallize  most of the risks and difficulties (impoverishment,  budgetary constraints, overstretched resources, new  nomadic lifestyles, health problems, employment, etc.)— have begun to adapt. Systemic approaches, based on  interactions and taking local conditions into account,  will need to be developed. The cross-disciplinary and  universal nature of the water and waste activities means  that they need to be integrated into projects, providing  practical, suitable solutions.  The impacts of digital technology  Spurred on in the early 1970s, the digital revolution has  become part of our daily lives. In territorial terms, the  digital revolution is helping to reshape cities and rural  areas. Whether in terms of transportation, mobility, the  environment, employment, education, energy, waste or  water, all of our areas of competence incorporate a digital  aspect. Those solutions contribute to an unprecedented  cross-disciplinary approach to urban services, opening  up a whole new range of possibilities and new uses. The  rapid expansion of regenerative Artificial Intelligence will  probably accelerate the evolution of all industries, bring  new solutions in our sector as well as challenges related  to the environmental impact of Information Technologies. 2.1 | Identification of non-financial challenges 2.1.1 | Methodology  ===== PAGE 11 ===== 11 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 11 SUEZ approach to managing risks and opportunities is  based on an overall risk management process (Enterprise  Risk Management), that aims to identify major stakes  facing the Group. This approach defines a “major stake”  as any event (or series of events) or trend likely to: 	- impact SUEZ strategic objectives,  	- and/or to have a major impact, positive or negative,  on one or more of its key assets (financial, tangible,  intangible and human). Identified risks and opportunities are: 	- classified by category: strategic, financial and  compliance, operational, 	- assessed in terms of likelihood, Impact and Room for  improvement, 	- quantified where possible, and the way of handling  them is reviewed, feeding into action plans at different  levels of the company. That work enables SUEZ to draw up an annual summary  of the major stakes (risks & opportunities). Those major  stakes are then discussed and validated by the Executive  Committee. However, environmental, industrial, and  climate-related risks are addressed from a number of  angles and in relation to other policies (e.g. health and  safety, human rights, reputation). The ERM process involves several stakeholders, including:  	- Group Risk Manager: responsible for defining the  methodology, consolidating and overseeing the  deliverables, monitoring action plans and conducting  regular watch 	- Executive Committee: responsible for validating the list  of major stakes, defining priority stakes and appointing  risk/opportunities pilots to define and implement  action plans 	- ''Risk/Opp. Referents'' within Business Units :  responsible for implementing the ERM methodology  within their scope and monitoring action plans. 2.1.2 | Risks and opportunities management approach © SUEZ / William Daniels  ===== PAGE 12 ===== 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N TA L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 12 There were some significant external and internal events  in 2023 that had an impact on the Group. From an operational perspective perspective, with  2 fatal accidents in 2023 (including one among our  subcontractors), health and safety issues are still a  priority for SUEZ (see section 2.5).  From a governance perspective, it is the second year  after the acquisition of SUEZ by the Consortium of  Shareholders comprising Meridiam, GIP and Groupe  Caisse des Dépôts and the appointment of Chairman  and CEO Sabrina Soussan on January 31, 2022. After  the adoption of its purpose in September 2022, SUEZ  published its Sustainable Development roadmap in  February 2023. SUEZ businesses and expertise contribute  to preserving the environment and provide essential  services. The sustainable development roadmap aims to  strengthen and amplify this contribution by structuring  its actions around a strong common ambition wherever  it operates. The Group's new sustainable development  orientations are detailed later in this document (see  section 2.2.1).  After its Purpose, which defines its course, the Strategy,  which defines the path to follow, and the Sustainable  Development Roadmap, which ensures the sustainability  of its actions, SUEZ launched in July 2023 its new  operating model. This new organization is driven by   5 objectives:  	- to place the customer at the heart of the organization; 	- to encourage entrepreneurship and responsibility in  everyone;  	- share our expertise and know-how throughout the  company; 	- to reduce complexity and make our organizations more  efficient; 	- promote collaboration. This operating model is supported also by a new  Leadership Model, which will become the foundation of  SUEZ corporate culture. The objective of this Leadership  Model is to become a behavioral guide for all the  company's managers and employees, whatever their  function, Business Unit or country.  In 2023, the Group acquired three major entities:  EnviroServ in South Africa, SUEZ UK and IWS in France.  The integration of these entities was a priority for  2023 including the implementation of our Sustainable  Development objectives and vigilance duty. The war in Ukraine and the energy crisis reinforced  the importance of resource-efficiency and energy  independence. The price of energy had an impact on  our service rates at a time of growing investment needs,  particularly in the context of the climate and biodiversity  crisis. SUEZ adapted by rapidly putting forward an  energy efficiency plan in 2022. In 2023, led by the Energy  department newly created at Group level, efforts were  extended toward the diversification of our energy supply  and focus on energy production on site.  In 2023, the Group pursues its international expansion  with the acquisition of an independent recycling and  waste management company F&R Cawley Ltd. It enables  recycling and recovery activities of SUEZ in the UK to  expand their footprint north of London and to enter the  lithium-ion battery processing market. This second UK  acquisition in 12 months marks another step towards  SUEZ international growth targets. As one of the largest  waste markets in Europe, the UK is a strategic growth  area for SUEZ. It forms a key part of SUEZ international  growth ambitions, with a target to reach 40% turnover  from international markets by 2027. In the last quarter, SUEZ successfully priced 2 new  Green Bond issuances: the first one is an inaugural £600  million Green Bond issuance on the Sterling market and  few weeks later, another a 500 million euros Green Bond  issuance. Reflecting its ambition to become the trusted  partner for circular solutions in water and waste, SUEZ  reaffirms its commitment to sustainable financing.  The Group is also preparing to the Corporate  Sustainability Reporting Directive. It realized its double  materiality assessment and prepares actively for its first  sustainability reporting in 2025. 2.1.3 | Notable events in 2023  ===== PAGE 13 ===== 13 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y The Group has set out the risks and opportunities associated with those major challenges: Main risks and  opportunities  identified Description  of the issue  and the  associated  management  policy Associated  risks Key performance  indicators audited Sustainable  Development  Goals 1.

The 2023-2027 Roadmap was  drawn up in line with the United Nations Sustainable  Development Goals (SDGs), based on a review of their  materiality regarding the Group's activities worldwide. It was jointly drawn up with the Group's operating entities,  the SUEZ CSR Committee made up of representatives of  our shareholders, and the Executive Committee.   The roadmap is structured around 3 main pillars: climate,  nature and social. With this roadmap, SUEZ makes public  24 operational commitments that are specific, achievable,  and measurable. Progress on these commitments will be  monitored using 43 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). An annual Sustainable Development action plan is drawn  up with each Business Unit to approve objectives tailored  to local issues and in line with the activities conducted in  that location. It ensures thus a proper appropriation of  the roadmap from an operational perspective. The CSR  Committee meets several times per year on a quarterly  basis to monitor its implementation. The long-term  incentive plan for Group executives includes targets  relating to the priority issues set out in the roadmap:  reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving health  and safety, and achieving gender equality. 2.2 | Governance on ESG topics 2.2.1 | Sustainable Development Roadmap To support the implementation of the sustainable  development roadmap and to ensure all other missions  on Environment, Social and Governance (ESG), SUEZ has  defined a Sustainability Governance Structure: •	 Board of Directors Oversight: The Board of Directors  plays a crucial role in overseeing sustainability  efforts. It sets the overall strategic direction, review  and approve sustainability policies and initiatives, and  ensure alignment with the company's long-term goals  and shareholder interests. •	 CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) Committee plays  a pivotal role in overseeing and guiding SUEZ CSR  initiatives. It evaluates how CSR efforts can contribute  to long-term value creation, reputation enhancement,  risk management. The committee oversees the  allocation of resources, to support CSR initiatives. It  reviews on a quarterly basis the implementation of the  SD roadmap, as well as the vigilance plan on an annual  basis.  •	 Executive Committee: The CEO and executive leadership  team are responsible for championing sustainability  within the organization, setting the tone from the  top, and integrating sustainability considerations  into strategic decision-making processes. The Chief  Sustainability Officer is under the director authority  of the CEO, he is in charge of defining, validating and  rolling out the Sustainable Development strategy. He  is also responsible for implementing the strategy  of SUEZ, defined jointly with the board of directors  through an ambitious development plan for both of its  primary activity sectors, water and waste, in France  and internationally.  •	 Sustainability Department: A dedicated sustainability  department is responsible for the implementation of  the Sustainable development strategy in all operations  and is organized around the 3 pillars of the SD  roadmap (Climate, Nature, Social). It is supported by a  Sustainable Development network with correspondents  in all Business Units in charge of the local declination  of the Sustainable Development roadmap.  The Sustainable Development roadmap was presented to  all employees during a live webcast, then locally detailed  to all Business Units steering committees. Employees’  representatives were also frequently involved through  dedicated trainings on ESG topics or information on  specific topics such as new policies. 2.2.2 | Sustainable Development organization  ===== PAGE 15 ===== 15 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y The Operations Committee (COMOP) approves any  project (related to a new investment or a new or existing  contract) with a value in excess of one of the thresholds  set out in the Group policy, reviewed in September 2022.  Certain projects must be approved by the SUEZ Board  of Directors or a Board Committee. The policy includes  a risk grid, based on environmental, nature, social and  reputation criteria, reviewed by the corporate Sustainable  Development team. SUEZ role is to ensure projects are  aligned with the Sustainable Development roadmap.  SUEZ gives priority to the asset's or project's capacity  contributing to accelerate the ecological transition of the  territories.  2.2.3 | Review of major investments in Sustainable Development As defined by the United Nations, “Nature underpins  the functions and health of the planet and thereby the  existence and health of humankind”. Nature is facing  an unprecedented loss through biodiversity decline and  resource scarcity: •	 A total of 75% of the land surface has been significantly  altered; more than 85% of wetlands have disappeared1; •	 According to the IPBES, the rate of extinction of species  is 10 to 1,000 times faster than the natural rate, at  which rate the planet could lose 75% of its species, to  the point where we talk now of a sixth extinction2; •	 1 million species are threatened with extinction in the  coming years3;  •	 At present, humanity consumes 1.7 Earth planet to  meet its annual needs4;  •	 By 2035, the demand concerning phosphorus may be  higher than supply5 so as many metals in the coming  decades. A study from Harvard demonstrated in 2021 that “air  pollution from burning fossil fuels like coal and diesel  was responsible for about 1 in 5 deaths worldwide”6.  According to the World Economic Forum, half of Gross  Domestic Product is ''moderately'' or even ''highly''  dependent on nature.  As a company operating in the environmental sector -  water and waste - where access to essential services  and circular economy are at stake, SUEZ value chain  is intimately linked to services provided by nature. For  example, drinking water production depends on the  quality and quantity of water resources, and sanitation  processes are linked to the genetic diversity of bacterial  pools. SUEZ waste activities are becoming more and  more circular to preserve the maximum of resources and  allow the transition from a linear economy to a circular  economy. This is why the company's contribution to  preserving and restoring nature has been integrated into  SUEZ purpose. However, nature remains a vulnerable component  impacted by SUEZ activities, whether in terms of residual  pollution, pressure on resources or land artificialization.  Processes involved in waste and water treatment are  managing pollution as part of the resource treated and  are closely monitored through adequate management  system. SUEZ ensures to avoid impacts on nature through  stringent environmental and industrial risks management  but also operational excellence. In addition, the Group  seeks to minimize and compensate for its impacts on  biodiversity, in accordance with the applicable regulations. 2.3 | Preserving Nature 2.3.1 | Description of the challenges _ _ 1 Ibid, p14   2 IPBES: Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services 3 IPBES, https://zenodo.org/record/5906976#.Y61Uo3bMI2w, p11 4 Eu https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/foresight/topic/aggravating-resource-scarcity/more-developments-relevant-aggravating-resource-scarcity_en 5 European commission, 2024 https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/foresight/topic/aggravating-resource-scarcity/more-developments-relevant-aggravating-resource-scarcity_en 6 Karn Vohra, Alina Vodonos, Joel Schwartz, Eloise A.

SUEZ is particularly  committed to preventing the health and environmental  risks associated with its activities, as well as reducing  nuisance for residents on sites where it operates on  behalf of its customers. Cybersecurity is a strong focus of  the environmental and industrial risk management plan,  described in the following section. SUEZ is identifying most vulnerable sites and activities to  help them adapt to the physical risks anticipated by the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (as detailed  in section 2.4). Environmental and operational performance  measurement and control systems  A specific management system is implemented to  manage environmental and industrial risks (EIR). The  risks considered may be of accidental or natural origin.  They may be due to human or organizational factors,  material accidents, or malicious acts. The scope of this  management system covers all types of pollution (air, soil,  aquatic environments) or environmental nuisance (noise,  vibrations, odors, visual nuisance, etc.). It also covers  environmental damage, as well as material or human  damage caused by fire, explosion, machinery breakdown,  natural disasters, collapse of structures, etc. A structured management system ensures that the  defined management principles are applied across all  Business Units internationally, under the responsibility  of the General Manager of each business unit. To that  end, the General Manager appoints an Environmental and  Industrial Risk Officer (EIRO) within their organization to  ensure coordinated functional management of those risks  at every level of the organization. In addition, a series of environmental and industrial  operating rules define mandatory requirements for all  Group operations. Business Unit management systems  must consider and comply with the principles of those  operational rules. Their purpose is to enable operating  entities or subsidiaries to check that the operations under  their responsibility comply with the criteria set out by  the Group. Those Group rules are supplemented where  necessary by rules or directives specific to each business  unit. Failure by existing entities or newly acquired  companies to comply with those operating rules are  subject to an action plan designed to ensure compliance  within an appropriate timeframe. Those operational rules are supported by ''Practical Data  Sheets'' which provide guidelines and examples for their  application in practice. Those practices are supplemented  by feedback from accident analysis, in collaboration with  insurance company risk prevention engineers. The process of monitoring and managing environmental,  industrial, and climate-related risks and opportunities is  the responsibility of several Group departments, reporting  to the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee.  The Environmental and Industrial Risks Department is  responsible for identifying and assessing risks, with the  support of the Sustainable Development Department. The  resulting matrix is then reviewed and validated by the  Board of Directors' CSR Committee. The Group's strategy  with regard to those issues is also reviewed by the Board  of Directors. Furthermore, audits (on selected operating sites) are carried  out by the Environmental and Industrial Risks Department.  Any failure to apply the management rules and associated  standards is escalated to the appropriate managerial  level for analysis and arbitration on corrective measures.  A summary of any recorded shortfalls is presented to the  Group General Management on an annual basis. Through its network of Environmental and Industrial  Risks Officers (EIROs) and its annual Environmental and  Industrial Risks reporting, SUEZ monitors the industrial  and environmental risk management activities of its  Business Units and shares best practices.  SUEZ is continuing its efforts to increase the reliability  of its environmental data, which is audited by accredited  third parties. The indicators used to measure and improve  operating performance are transmitted by the Business  Units (BUs), consolidated at central level, and the results  are made available to the operational and technical  teams in charge of managing the BUs' operating and  environmental performance via business intelligence  applications. They show the progress made and provide  an overall view as well as a close-up view of each of the  Group's entities with comparable activities (benchmark  analysis). In 2023, the Performance and Sustainable Development  Departments sent a letter to all managers and teams in  charge of reporting to remind them of the importance  of performance data for the proper monitoring of  performance plans, as well as for the sustainability  actions undertaken by the Group (preservation of  biodiversity, reduction of Greenhouse Gas emissions,  optimization of water and energy consumption, etc.). 2.3.2.1 | Environmental and industrial risks management  ===== PAGE 17 ===== 17 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y Limiting olfactory, noise, visual nuisance and  improving air quality SUEZ has developed a service called ''NOSE'', which is  a way to make an objective assessment and model the  olfactory footprint for local residents of a wastewater  treatment, sludge recovery, or waste management activity  or site. This service offers ways to control the olfactory footprint,  to keep it below the threshold of two odor units per cubic  meter (UO.m³) and thereby meet regulatory requirements  (footprint below the threshold of five odor units per m³)  where they exist. This makes it possible to take precise measurements  to avoid or deal with odor nuisance right from the plant  design stage. For existing facilities, preventive and corrective measures  are put in place to limit olfactory, noise, and visual  nuisance. The following examples illustrate this: •	 Sizing and installation of dedicated treatment units; •	 Installation of biogas capture and processing systems; •	 Implementation of operational practices to minimize  the generation and dispersion of odors; •	 Application of masking agents (e.g. in the working  areas of landfills in operation); •	 Organization of measurement campaigns and  verification of compliance with regulatory thresholds  for day/night noise levels; •	 Soundproofing of technical rooms and noisy machines; •	 Use of collection vehicles that run on compressed  natural gas (CNG) or all-electric vehicles. In line with this last example, in order to improve air  quality as well as reduce local carbon emissions, SUEZ  supports decarbonized mobility. In the UK, as for the new  waste and environmental contract with Milton Keynes City  Council, many of the new waste and landscaping vehicles  will be fully electric. For the Mid-Kent waste partnership  contract for waste collection and recycling services, SUEZ  will introduce a new fleet of lower emission vehicles  using electric bin lifts. In France, in Nîmes by 2025, the   40 collection vehicles will run on alternative fuels with  most using waste vegetable oil. In Limoges, as for the  waste collection, 16 electric trucks and 10 trucks running  on XTL biofuels (made from used oils and fats) will  replace the current fleet of fuel trucks. Certification of management systems As a player in the environmental sector, the Group  encourages its sites to certify their activities to  international standards such as ISO or equivalent.   ISO 14 001 environmental management system  certification and ISO 50 001 energy management system  certification are particularly well developed in the Group's  activities. In France, for example, all SUEZ water activities are   ISO 50 001 certified. Our waste-to-energy plants in  France are all ISO 9 001, 14 001, 18 001/45 001 and 50 001  certified. Because of their environmental exposure, all of  our non-hazardous waste storage and mechanical sorting  facilities are also covered by ISO 14 001 certification.  Waste activities in the UK are also covered by ISO 14 001  certification (almost 100% of coverage – only 7 sites are  still in the process of accreditation). In terms of SUEZ international water activity, 91% of the  volumes produced, distributed, or processed are covered  by ISO 14 001 certification (100% in Egypt, India, Australia  and Panama). Cybersecurity Cyber-attacks are becoming more and more widespread,  frequent, sophisticated, and potentially costly.  Cybersecurity risk relates to both the operation of  industrial sites managed by the Group and the protection  of data relating to the Group, its employees, and its  customers. Cybersecurity risk management enables us  to prevent the vulnerability of our industrial facilities'  control and supervision systems, which could lead, for  example, to a partial loss of control of water or waste  treatment units. In line with the recommendations of the ISO 27 000  international standards, with the cybersecurity standard  of the ''National Institute of Standards and Technology''  (NIST CSF) as well as with the guide on Cybersecurity  of Industrial Systems published by the French National  Agency for Information Systems Security (ANSSI), the  Group has reinforced the following points in terms of  governance: •	 the implementation of an integrated Group  cybersecurity governance system, with strong  involvement of teams dealing with Data Privacy, safety,  ethics, and environmental and industrial risks; •	 strengthening the Group's cybersecurity team in these  areas, notably in terms of detection and response to  security incidents on a 24/7 basis, with the set-up of  a ''Global Security Operations Center'' (GSOC) covering  the entire Group and its entities;  ===== PAGE 18 ===== 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N TA L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 18 •	 continuous improvement of cybersecurity crisis  management governance throughout the Group,  following the organization of cybersecurity crisis  exercises; •	 continued implementation of measures relating  to the GDPR regulations with impact analyses on  privacy (Privacy Impact Assessment) for certain key  personal data processing operations, the drafting and  signature with suppliers of Data Protection Addendum  integrating GDPR requirements and raising employee  awareness of the GDPR; •	 the inclusion in the internal audit plan of undertakings  to review the management of cybersecurity by Group  entities (governance, organization, compliance with  Group policies, technical tests); •	 renewal of the overall cybersecurity insurance policy  covering all the legal entities. Approved by the Group's Executive Committee, the 2023- 2027 cybersecurity roadmap is designed to ensure the  security of industrial sites. That highly ambitious program  is designed to improve the level of security at all sites,  with priority given to over 130 major sites around the  world. According to the United Nations (UN), by 2025, 1.8 billion  people will be living in countries or regions affected  by a complete water shortage, and two-thirds of the  world's population could be living in water-stressed  conditions. Risks related to water resources and extreme  climatic events incorporated into the Group's integrated  management process are of several types: •	 those linked to the availability of a sufficient volume  of water: existing pressure on water resources  represents a significant operational risk, due to the  potential impact of prolonged periods of drought or  chronic water stress on service continuity. The same  applies to repeated heavy rainfall events, which can  lead to deadly flooding. Such situations can lead to  temporary interruptions in the drinking water supply  and wastewater treatment operations. Beyond that,  conflicts over the use of water resources are on the rise.  As a result, the Group is working with its customers  to promote initiatives to reduce consumption and  preserve resources, notably through digital technology,  the use of alternative techniques such as reuse or  groundwater replenishment, improving the efficiency  of water distribution networks, and raising public  awareness. •	 those linked to water quality: the Group's ability to  supply water that meets the required standards and  specifications depends on the quality of the resources  available locally and the technological solutions offered  to customers. New production and consumption  patterns, combined with climate change, are having  a direct impact on the quality of water resources,  leading to tighter regulations. The availability of water  resources of sufficient quality is at the heart of current  and future challenges, to control the risk of service  interruptions due to pollution. The quality of life and  health of populations is also largely intrinsic to the  quality of the water delivered to the tap and discharged  into the natural environment. In addition to service  continuity risks, extreme weather events leading to too  much or too little water can cause significant damage  to assets managed by SUEZ (built and natural) under  its contracts. Equipment that is underused due to water  shortages or exposed to flooding will require more  extensive maintenance and adapted, predictive asset  management plans. The preservation of groundwater and surface water is  becoming a major concern for public authorities and  industrialists alike, to guarantee their production and the  local acceptability of their activities. SUEZ supports them  both in optimizing the management of the ''small'' water  cycle (i.e. infrastructure management), and in mitigating  and adapting to effects of climate change on the ''large''  water cycle (i.e. protection of upstream and downstream  resources and biodiversity).  Regulations are following these concerns and the  European Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive has  been revised from 2022 with two main objectives: protect  EU citizens and ecosystems from the remaining sources  of inadequately treated wastewater, while improving  transparency and governance in the sector. The revised  directive also aims to align EU water policy with the  objectives of the Green Deal and climate neutrality. In  particular, the Commission wishes to introduce more  circularity (reuse of treated wastewater, energy recovery,  nutrient recovery), implement measures to achieve  carbon neutrality through the use of renewable energies  at wastewater treatment plants, lower the level of  pollutants, and integrate the notion of Extended Producer  Responsibility (i.e. the ''polluter pays'' principle). All these trends are directly linked to SUEZ Water  activities. 2.3.2.2 | Optimizing water management  ===== PAGE 19 ===== 19 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y Distributed water: an imperative to protect the  quality of the drinking water supply for end- consumers Self-monitoring programs for network water quality  generally exceed regulatory requirements, and Group- operated sites are equipped with remote monitoring  systems or 24-hour alert systems. The organization of  work, and in particular the implementation of on-call  systems, also ensure 24/7 service continuity. In its annual Water Quality Report, the Group gathers all  the information on the performance of its contracts in  terms of quality of the water produced and distributed.  That report provides means to monitor action plans jointly  steered by the Group's Water Technical Department and  BUs, aimed at eliminating the risk of non-conformities  or quality thresholds being exceeded. In addition to  that prevention policy, the Group has developed specific  crisis management procedures in the event of accidental  deterioration in the quality of distributed water or  equipment malfunction, in coordination with local  authorities and customers. SUEZ assesses the quality of the drinking water produced  and/or distributed by its entities according to several  bacteriological and physico-chemical parameters derived  from European Directive no. 98/83/EC of November 3,  1998, concerning water intended for human consumption.  That directive was updated in December 2020 (new  European Parliament and Council Directive 2020/2184 of  December 16, 2020, which was transposed in the Member  States in 2022 and is already in force in France). New health concerns relating to quality parameters of  distributed water appear regularly, in connection with  the identification of new emerging risks. In addition to  bacteriological and physico-chemical criteria, certain  substances grouped under the term ''emerging pollutants''  (pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors, etc.) are the  focus of particular attention from public authorities,  experts, and players in the water and environment  sectors. In addition to developing treatment solutions for  such emerging pollutants in wastewater, as described  below, the Group has set up targeted research programs  to better understand, analyze, monitor, and treat those  new molecules, while contributing to the public debate  on the subject. Wastewater treatment for protecting health and  natural environments Wastewater treatment at facilities managed by the  Group contributes to a significant reduction in the  level of pollutants discharged into the environment  and likely to affect the quality of water resources. The  quality of discharge from wastewater treatment plants is  continuously measured based on predefined parameters  (chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen  demand (BOD), suspended solids, nitrogen, phosphorus,  coliforms, etc.) using analyzers and regular samplings.  Tested parameters and frequency are defined by Group's  monitoring guidelines, whose thresholds are stricter than  those set out in existing national regulations. In its annual Wastewater Quality Report, the Group  gathers information relating to the performance of its  contracts in terms of treated water quality. In addition, the Group implements a broad variety of  innovative solutions to meet environmental challenges,  protect consumer health, and conserve natural capital.  For instance, Aquadvanced® Urban Drainage is a real time  software solution dedicated to the monitoring and control  of sewerage networks. Thanks to the processing of  meteorological data, information from different sensors  on the sewerage system, and advanced algorithms, the  solution allows to anticipate and prevent floods, control  the quality of discharges into the receiving environment,  while optimising the existing regulation and treatment  infrastructures.   In recent years, major research programs have been  dedicated to developing solutions for the treatment of  micropollutants in wastewater discharges, essentially  based on the transposition of processes used in  the treatment of drinking water. Examples include  the coupling of ozone oxidation with biological  treatment processes, a process applied at the Sophia  Antipolis wastewater treatment plant in France,  where performance guarantees for the treatment of  micropollutants are required by the customer; or the  adsorption of micropollutants on activated carbon, which  can be coupled with the above process, as envisaged at  the Lausanne wastewater treatment plant in Switzerland  and under construction at the Klar facility in Denmark. The Group has also developed a partnership with a  company called Toxmate to carry out tests to measure  ecotoxicity caused by micropollutants at wastewater  treatment sites in Switzerland and France. That solution  makes it possible to: 	- Monitor the discharge toxicity in real time online by  means of integrated measurement; 	- Reuse treated wastewater safely; 	- Validate advanced treatment processes; 	- Reinforce the protection of the environment; 	- Minimize the impact on biodiversity. Those research programs, which are generally conducted  in collaboration with partners from the academic  world, will enable the Group to meet the following  commitment made as part of its 2023-2027 Sustainable   ===== PAGE 20 ===== 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N TA L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 20 Development roadmap: to include treatment solutions  of micropollutants in 100% of commercial proposals for  the construction of wastewater infrastructure in areas at  stake, according to mapping by national environmental  agencies. Beyond, SUEZ turns wastewater into resources while  recovering energy for plants’ self-consumption (see  section 2.4) and phosphorus, an essential, yet limited,  resource.  20% of current world demand of phosphorus could be  covered by recovery from wastewater. Without reuse of  phosphorus, depletion is foreseen in 100 years from now  and the European Commission has classified phosphorus  among the 20 “critical materials”. SUEZ developed a  solution that extracts phosphorus via struvite from  wastewater and turns it into a fertilizer. This process  recovers 40-50% of the phosphorus from incoming water.  Phosphogreen™ solution was fist implemented in a full- scale at Marselisborg wastewater treatment plant located  in Aarhus. In the future, SUEZ is looking to extract other  materials such as lithium. Most of this research is carried  out in our ten R&D and excellence centres worldwide. Haliotis 2 in Nice, France, a wastewater treatment plant  in construction by SUEZ, will be a true European hub  for advanced “all-in-one” technologies working toward  the ecological transition to treat and reuse wastewater,  eliminate all types of pollutants including microplastics  (90% removed), treat sewage sludge and sand, and  improve air quality, all while generating new renewable  energy sources (biomethane, solar, heat and cold for  buildings). Preserving the availability and quality of water  resources As part of its Sustainable Development Roadmap 2023-  2027, SUEZ is committed to the following by 2027: •	 In 100% of new water commercial proposals, include a  commitment aiming to preserve water resources (reduce  withdrawals, minimize losses, or encourage sobriety); •	 Propose a water resource preservation commitment for  100% of drinking water distribution contracts in water- stressed areas. To improve the efficiency of the distribution networks,  SUEZ is developing digital tools such as smart meters  and network instrumentation. Those tools enable better  consumption forecasting, online calculation of the water  network yields, and more accurate location of leaks. They  also enable users to control their water consumption and  their bills.  SUEZ offers its municipal customers solutions  designed to improve the operational performance of  drinking water networks: Aquadvanced® Water Networks,  enables improved monitoring of drinking water networks  by analyzing a wide range of data from various sensors  (flow, pressure, flow rate). SUEZ and PUB, Singapore’s National Water Agency, have  been working closely since 2015 in R&D pilot and full- scale projects for the management, conservation and  digitalization of water for the country. A water innovation  hub and delivery center for services was established in  Singapore. Collaborating closely with various PUB user  teams, SUEZ has tailored its proprietary technologies  for a range of projects such as CWOS: PUB uses CWOS  (Catchment and Waterways Operations System) to monitor  its stormwater networks and water catchment areas.            In India, SUEZ drastically reduced water losses and  restored equitable pressurized water supply in Kolkata- Cossipore. The Group’s integrated asset management  approach includes network rehabilitation, leak detection  and repair, AI based analytical tools along with innovative  collaborations with the local community of women  self-help groups (Jal Bandhu program) to implement  water conservation awareness campaigns. As results,   420,000 people covering 36,000 households are provided  with equitable and pressurized water. And water losses  reduced from 56% down to 13%. In recent years, Macao Water, a SUEZ subsidiary, has  maintained a 7% non-revenue water rate, consistently  leading the world and outperforming China’s target to be  below a 9% non-revenue water rate by 2025. Leakage in  the network has significantly fallen, saving 2 million m3  of water every year, equivalent to the water consumption  of about 3,200 households. Macao Water has also been  recognized as the most successful PPP model in Asia and  a benchmark for China’s water industry for its operational  and service excellence.   The Tashkent Water Transformation Plan implemented in  collaboration with the Uzbek authorities that came into  effect in August 2023. This contract acts as a pilot project  for the modernization of the Uzbek water sector and will  be a showcase for the entire Central Asian region. It is  based on an innovative approach of joint management and  close monitoring of performance and technical excellence  including through key performance indicators, as well as  an action plan to improve the quality of drinking water,  reduce the Non-Revenue Water by 12%, and increase  the Collection rate to achieve financial balance. SUEZ  will also support the development of the next generation  of Uzbek managers and water specialists through an  ambitious know-how and expertise transfer program  which includes 1,500 days of training, 350 days of study  abroad, and more than 1,200 days of technical assistance.  It will allow the company to meet the highest international  HSE standards. The contract is financed by a Direct Loan  from the French Treasury and a BPI France Assurance  Export buyer’s credit.  ===== PAGE 21 ===== 21 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y Thanks to all these initiatives, by December 31, 2023,  SUEZ had achieved a technical efficiency of 84.2% on its  drinking water distribution networks (no impact from  acquisitions as they’re on the waste business). The Group is also implementing actions targeting user  behavior, through the introduction of tariffs and tools to  encourage water savings, and awareness campaigns against  water wastage. In France, SUEZ has set up the ON’connectTM  Coach solution for private individuals, which enables users  to track their water and related energy consumption on an  online platform. This prevents the risk of leaks and offers  advice on how to optimize usage and reduce environmental  impact. Similar services will be set up in the Brive basin  agglomeration in France, where all residents are set to be  equipped with a remote meter reading system and a digital  application for monitoring their consumption by early 2024  to contribute to the community's resource conservation  objectives. This would help SUEZ with achieving the minus  21% of water taken from the natural environment within   7 years, targeted by this innovative contract, based on  “service economy” principles. The contract signed with the  Bassin de Brive in 2021 was the first in France relating to  water efficiency, which links SUEZ remuneration to the  annual decrease in volumes.  SUEZ is also committed to helping its customers improve  their capacity to withstand the effects of climate change:  as part of its Sustainable Development Roadmap 2023- 2027, the Group is committed to setting up an action plan  for 100% of priority sites vulnerable to the consequences  of climate change by 2027 (more details in section 2.4). Groundwater recharge is an example of SUEZ solution to  fight impacts of climate change on water resource. The  Le Pecq Croissy Plant was commissioned in 1959. Since  then, SUEZ has implemented its Aquifer Storage and  Recovery (ASR) technology. With this solution, water is  injected into the groundwater and the water stock so that  it can be recovered from a single facility. This technology  offers the advantages of a smaller land footprint and low  maintenance, since water flows in and out of the borehole,  reducing clogging. This technology has been deployed for  the past eight years in Adelaide, Australia, using treated  wastewater for recharge. The Adelaide water table in  Australia is regularly replenished with treated wastewater  from the Bolivar treatment plant. The water is then used  to irrigate agricultural land north of the city.  Reusing treated water is another solution that SUEZ  rolls out in France, in Versailles (agricultural irrigation),  Cannes (golf course and for street cleaning) or in Orléans  (watering green spaces), but also in Egypt. At Gabal El  Asfar plant, the treated water is discharged into a drain  that joins an irrigation canal located a little further  north. A part of the treated water is used to irrigate a  400-acre park of fruit trees. In total, by 2023, 4.2% of  the wastewater treated by the Group had been reused  (no impact from acquisitions as they’re on the waste  business). In countries most exposed to water stress, the Group  offers solutions to help regions adapt to the situation,  such as seawater desalination systems to ensure the  availability of drinking water in areas with insufficient  resources or suffering from repeated droughts. Desalination plants make it possible to diversify the  sources of water used to produce drinking water. They  are not dependent on traditional freshwater resources  such as rivers and lakes, which helps to increase the  security of water supply. Desalination plants offer a  reliable solution for producing drinking water even in arid  zones and coastal regions where freshwater resources  are limited. According to figures, the desalination market  could reach 22.7 billion dollars by 2027 (with a CAGR of  9.4% from 2023 to 2030). The construction and operation  of desalination plants can generate jobs, stimulate  technological innovation and support the economic  development of the regions concerned. As a major player in the water market, SUEZ is recognized  for its cutting-edge solutions, based on membrane  filtration, ozone and UV treatment, and reverse osmosis  processes. Main references include: •	 Egypt: participation in several desalination plant  construction projects in partnership with Meridiam and  SASCO. •	 Australia: SUEZ built and is now operating the Victoria  reverse osmosis desalination plant, one of the largest  in the world. SUEZ also delivered the Perth Seawater  Desalination Plant (PSDP), which supplies more than  2 million people with over 45 billion liters of drinking  water every year.

The plant will save more  than 36 million m3 of fresh water a year. •	 Elba in Italy which will provide up to 6,900 m3 of drinking  water per day SUEZ continues to improve its value  proposition with a brine valorization R&D program to  efficiently produce chemicals from desalination waste  and reduce energy consumption. Sustainable energy supply and efficiency is an important  focus to limit the impact if this activity on climate change.  In Australia, the plant in Victoria is 100% powered by  renewable energy. Geofiltration techniques involving the  reinjection of pre-treated surface water into the water  table are also in place and available when required.  Critical raw materials can also be extracted in large  quantities from desalination brines: a brine valorization  R&D program is being developed at SUEZ to efficiently  produce chemicals such as hydrochloric acid, sodium  hydroxide, or magnesium from desalination waste. In addition to solutions that it offers to its customers for  better water resource management, the Group is also  involved in partnership initiatives with local authorities,  manufacturers, and farmers to protect the quality of water  resources in watersheds. In France, SUEZ is experimenting  with Payments for Environmental Services. The Group  lends its support to farmers who make a commitment to a  verified improvement in indicators such as the quantities  of inputs used or the areas planted with grassland, to  preserve the quality of the water produced locally. This  is notably the case in Western Paris, where SUEZ and  the Grand Paris Seine & Oise urban community have  joined forces with the Agence de l'Eau Seine Normandie  to improve water quality by signing a regional contract  for water and climate. Among other things, that contract  includes funding and support for farmers to implement  agricultural practices that improve water quality. Based  on performance indicators, farmers are encouraged to  reduce the use of herbicides and increase the area of  their property left to grassland. While the results are  not immediate in terms of the quality of the groundwater,  these initiatives will help reduce the groundwater's  exposure to nitrates and pesticides in the medium term. Furthermore, the Group regularly monitors the quality of  the water sources it uses and is constantly innovating to  contribute to their sustainability. To be prepared for any  type of accident that may arise, the Group has set up an  on-call, round-the-clock, remote monitoring, and alert  system across all its water activities. SUEZ supports mitigating risks of conflicts over the use  of water resources and affordability of services to the  most vulnerable. Thus, the Group promotes solidarity  mechanisms and commits to map water poverty risks on  its water distribution contracts. It also offers solutions for  all types of situations and territories, including modular  solutions for crisis situations (see section 2.5.2.3). 22 © SUEZ / Franck Dunouau  ===== PAGE 23 ===== 23 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y Raw materials are becoming more and more critical and  the impact of their production on Nature underlines the  importance to increase resource recovery. This dynamic  is common to all countries in which SUEZ operates  and regulations are following this trend. In Europe,  since 2022, states are gradually adopting regulations  aimed at fostering the circular economy. The goal is to  reduce, reuse, and recycle waste, under the impetus of  the European Commission's Circular Economy package  of measures. Regulations on packaging, eco-design,  and recycled materials for food products are regularly  published and SUEZ has already conducted initial  analyses and participated in public consultations. Final  adoption of those regulations took place in 2023. Thanks to its key role within circular economy value chain,  SUEZ has a key role to play in order to optimize waste  management, especially through waste recovery. Recovering processed resources and   the associated waste The management of the Group's waste activity is fully in  line with the objectives a circular economy. SUEZ aims to support the transformation of the  business model primarily by means of the following two  mechanisms: 	- Reducing the volume of waste sent to landfill; 	- Redirecting flows to material and energy recovery. To optimize waste recovery, the Group operates several  types of facilities, including: 	- Voluntary waste drop-off centers/waste collection  centers; 	- Sorting and recycling centers; 	- Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF) production units; 	- Dismantling and disassembly facilities: waste electrical  and electronic equipment, end-of-life vehicles, bulky  waste, furniture, etc.; 	- Facilities for reprocessing specific recyclable materials  already sorted for conversion into secondary raw  materials. Each site processes incoming materials  with a view to recycling them and promoting circular  economy models. In addition to mechanical recycling  techniques, biological solutions also present  opportunities for recovery: 	- Composting platforms: household waste, urban or  industrial sludge, green waste, livestock sludge,  grease, etc.; 	- Bio-deconditioning and mechanical-biological treatment  units; 	- Methanization plants. Lastly, waste-to-energy plants complete the cycle for  waste that cannot be recycled into materials, through the  production of renewable or recovered energy.	 For example, a partnership project between TEREOS and  SUEZ, through the construction of a boiler which will  supply TEREOS with energy in the form of steam produced  from Solid Recovered Fuels (SRF), will deliver 400 GWh of  heat and so will reduce the sugar-distillery's fossil energy  consumption by 40%. This industrial achievement will  establish a local circular economy loop that is beneficial  for all stakeholders and the environment. The production  of alternative energy from SRF will contribute to the  ecological transition and decarbonization of the client  site, while enhancing its competitiveness. In 2023, SUEZ recovered 48.5% of the total volume of  waste treated in the form of material or energy recovery. Results per year are available below. 2022 updated value  corresponds to the update following integration of new  acquisitions (IWS, UK and Enviroserv). This value is lower  because Enviroserv has more landfill assets which are  not considered as a mean to recover waste. If we compare  the evolution with the same scope of assets (2022 updated  vs 2023), there is an increase in the recovery rate by more  than 4%.   As part of the Sustainable Development Roadmap  2023-2027, SUEZ is committed to improving its sorting  efficiency ratio to advance the development of its recovery  capacities. It involves the implementation of actions and  projects over the entire value chain: upstream actions  (prevention, awareness campaign) to reduce waste at  the source, but also downstream actions to increase on- site performance and thus increase material recovery  capacities (reuse and recycling). The Group is continuing  to innovate on this subject not only to preserve resources  and limit its impact on biodiversity, but also to support  clients to face a societal trend as citizens expect more  and more circularity.   For example, the Group converted its selective collection  sorting center at Epinal into an over-sorting center for the  new recycling streams. Here, 25,000 tons of plastics can  be recycled into new materials: colored PET (oil bottles,  for example), opaque PET (certain milk bottles), PET  trays (pastries, fruit and vegetables, etc.) and polystyrene  (yoghurt pots, trays). SUEZ is also part of the international project of Saint- Avold, with Loop Industries and SK Geo Centric, to  manufacture virgin-quality PET plastic made from 100%  2.3.2.3 | Optimizing waste management SUEZ Waste recovery rate 2022 47.9% 2022 updated 44.0% 2023 48.5%  ===== PAGE 24 ===== 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N TA L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 24 recycled content and infinitely recyclable by leveraging  the Infinite Loop technology. The facility has a planned  capacity of 70,000 metric tons per year. It will help address  the demand for recycled PET, which has continued to grow  due to European regulations and requirements and will  provide European-based global brands with a solution  to their sustainability objectives of increasing the use of  recycled content in their packaging and products. In the UK, Flexible Plastic Fund (FPF) FlexCollect project  was set up in May 2022 and pursued in 2023 to understand  the best way to collect and recycle flexible plastic  packaging and to trial curbside collections across nine  different waste collection authorities over three years. As  promising results, collections are very well received by  households and the quality of flexible plastic packaging  are very good (90% recyclable). Further data is required  to determine how effective and efficient this system is on  a larger scale. Moreover, in France, SUEZ has started to develop  performance contract, a new type of contract that aims at  incorporating prevention and recycling objectives beyond  waste collection. After Montauban, which was the first  reference, Limoges, La Rochelle and Nîmes have chosen to  switch to this new business model. The contract includes  performance targets: they aim to reduce the volume of  waste directed to energy recovery and to improve sorting  at source, thanks to an innovative and ambitious prevention  and awareness-raising policy. In Nîmes, the ambition is  to reduce the volume of household waste by 15% at the  end of the 6-year contract, while increasing the selective  collection of recyclable waste by 21%. Multiple trainings and awareness-raising initiatives will  be developed to encourage food waste sorting. Digital  tools will also be deployed to promote sorting practices  among citizens. For example, the application,''Mon Service  Déchets'' (''My Waste Service''), which effectively connects  Nîmes Métropole to its users by facilitating access to  waste management information and offering tips on how  to sort and recycle, will be implemented. Finally, the data  collected by collection trucks (volume, location, etc.) will  be used to fine-tune awareness campaigns while focusing  on areas that need improvement. Beyond those performance contracts, the Syndicat Pic et  Etang awards SUEZ the first contract in France for the  operation of a waste-to-energy plant incorporating waste  reduction targets. The contract aims to cut the volume  of waste incinerated by 25% over the space of 10 years  through an ambitious waste prevention policy. To achieve  this result, the Group will implement a targeted action plan  aiming to remove biowaste from household waste, promote  donation, reuse and repair of bulky waste items, sort more  recyclable household packaging and sort it better, raise  user awareness through digital and local communication  with the deployment of the app “Mon Service Déchets”. In the UK, SUEZ is the contractor for Greater Manchester’s  waste and resources management services to treat   1.1 million tonnes of municipal waste from over 1 million  households across nine boroughs with a combined  contract value of over £1 billion. The two contracts include  the operation of 41 facilities over 24 sites including,   4 mechanical treatment and rail head reception facilities,  20 household waste recycling centres, 8 transfer loading  stations, a materials recovery facility, the Bolton thermal  recovery facility and the creation of a Renew Hub.   In operating the contract, SUEZ has committed to the  delivery of 54 social value commitments as well as  improving the recycling rate, which through operational  interventions has already increased from 44% in 2019/20,  to 53% in 2022/23 (with a target of 60% by the end of the  10-year contract) whilst also diverting over 96% of Greater  Manchester’s municipal waste from landfill (with a target  of 98% at the end of the contract). This new business model, shifting from volumes to uses  and functionalities, also takes the stakeholders into  account and delivers benefits: 	- the impact of the performance results on the overall  cost of waste management is taken into account  (beyond the market); 	- a bonus or a penalty applied depending on the  achievement of a minimum performance target; 	- a share of the bonus is allocated to the partners  associated with the contract. To optimize waste sorting and recycling, SUEZ innovates  and uses artificial intelligence, a promising solution for  optimizing waste management. SUEZ ambitions to support the customers in improving  their knowledge and traceability of waste flows by  partnering with startups or developing internal solutions.  The objectives are to maximize performance of the  group’s core businesses, improve the quality of service  and develop innovative service offers.  For example, Qualiwaste® Collection is an innovation that  uses computer vision to detect 3 types of information: 	- the nature of flows; 	- the presence of undesirable materials; 	- the presence of recoverable materials.  It covers the whole value chain of waste businesses:  from collection, to sorting, recycling and energy  recovery.

Qualiwaste® EFW enables the detection of undesirable  waste at the plant entrance, which interferes with the  process and increases the risk of accidents. For sorting centers, SUEZ has developed the Autodiag®  solution, which uses artificial intelligence to continuously  calculate the mass purity of outgoing flows in real time,  before baling and dispatch. Waste: controlling atmospheric emissions In the waste sector, atmospheric emissions of pollutants  (NOX, SOX, mercury, dust, particulate matter, etc.) are  primarily a result of the processing of flue gases from the  thermal processing of waste (APCR: Air Pollution Control  Residues). Those emissions are constantly monitored in  line with local, regional, and/or national regulations, and  are published in site annual reports for customers and  local authorities. Each year, the Group consolidates information on  atmospheric emissions from its incinerators in its Air  Quality Report (AirQR). This makes it possible to monitor  the action plans jointly steered by the Group's Recycling  and Recovery Technical Department and the Business  Units, aimed at completely eliminating the risk of non- compliance or exceeding quality thresholds. Information relating to air quality is presented annually  to the SUEZ Board of Directors. Prepared by the teams  from the Performance Department in conjunction with  the Business Units, the AirQR is the preferred tool of  management bodies for monitoring the implementation  and performance of action plans, as well as regulatory  compliance. SUEZ water and waste management activities inherently  contribute to nature conservation:  •	 solving water and land resources pollution (2.86 billion m3  of wastewater treated in 2023) by treating water and  waste;  •	 contributing to the preservation of water resources by  implementing solutions such as wastewater reuse and  leakage control; •	 reducing the depletion of natural resources by producing  secondary raw materials from waste (2.7 million tons of  secondary raw materials produced in 2023);   •	 reducing soil depletion by creating new enriching  agents for agriculture (651,933 tons of standardized  compost produced in 2023). With its Sustainable Development Roadmap, the Group  highlighted the importance of nature preservation and  defined 9 new commitments. To reduce the impact of   its activities, it addresses the five factors responsible  for the decline of biodiversity as identified by the  Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and  Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the biodiversity equivalent  of the IPCC for climate: 	- Land degradation 	- Over-exploitation of resources  	- Climate change: see climate commitments 	- Pollution 	- Fight against invasive alien species SUEZ main KPI on biodiversity protection is the  percentage of priority sites with biodiversity action  plan implemented. Some sites have more impact on  biodiversity than others due to their location. The Group  through a data-driven analysis of its operations identifies  those sites defined as priority sites. At SUEZ, a priority  site regarding biodiversity is a site:  	- that is in or crosses or is situated along 1) In Europe  Natura 2000 areas (birds or habitats) and in the rest of  the world IUCN protected areas 4, 5 or 6   	- or has a surface that is superior to 10 ha  	- or is an open landfill site A biodiversity action plan consists of a set of actions  designed to preserve the biodiversity present at a facility  and/or encourage its development. At the very least, it is  based on an initial diagnosis of biodiversity on the site,  including flora and fauna. Following the initial diagnosis,  potential actions to preserve and/or develop biodiversity  are identified. Once the actions have been validated by  internal stakeholders, they are described in a formalized  action plan with actions localized and described over time. The action plan must be monitored over time and  evaluated at the end of the planned duration. The action  2.3.2.4 | Protecting biodiversity and ecosystems SUEZ Percentage of priority  sites with a biodiversity  action plan implemented 2022 63.6% 2023 65.4%  ===== PAGE 26 ===== 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N TA L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 26 plan can evolve over time. Only a competent body can  carry out the initial diagnosis and the action plan (an  approved association for the protection of nature or a  consultancy specialized in ecology or an internal expert).  The action plans can then be implemented by the site's  operational teams (depending on the measures). SUEZ is currently finalizing a Green Charter for worksites  and a Nature Reference Document for sites with practical  worksheets dedicated to biodiversity preservation good  practices. Those documents provide rules that will be  applicable to any types of worksites and sites belonging  to SUEZ or managed by the Group on behalf of our  customers. They will replace SUEZ Technical Guide  created in 2021.  Besides, as described above, SUEZ took a commitment  on invasive alien species to reach 100% of sites with  renaturation and landscaping operations using only local  species by 2027. The Group has also deployed numerous  solutions and tools to eradicate at the maximum invasive  species present on sites operated or owned by the Group  such as a specific guidance and explanatory signs in  France for the extraction and destruction of invasive alien  species the Group faces on its sites.  Avoidance, reduction, and ecological compensation  measures have been incorporated into the Group's  environmental management and risk prevention systems. In France, SUEZ has reaffirmed its commitment to  the National Strategy for Biodiversity by joining the  ''Entreprises Engagées pour la Nature - Act4nature France''  scheme, run by the French Office for Biodiversity (OFB).  As such, SUEZ is officially ''committed to nature'' and is  a legitimate partner when it comes to supporting local  authorities that are committed to the ''territoire engagé  pour la nature'' (region committed to nature) initiative. For example, as part of this commitment, SUEZ includes  for its waste activity in France a biodiversity component in  all of its responses to calls for tenders for infrastructure  projects (sorting centers, energy recovery units, etc.).  This biodiversity component is adapted to the context and  potential of the site in question and aims to implement  actions designed to reduce the impact of its activities  and enhance the existing potential. It consists in an  ecological diagnostic of the facility, an assessment of  the challenges at the site, and recommendations for  implementation. That is followed up with the drafting  and implementation of an action plan. The Group is in  the process of extending that best practice so that, it will  offer a biodiversity preservation package whenever the  site is located in a priority zone and the call for tenders  authorizes such an initiative by 2027. It includes actions  to integrate biodiversity promoting features and habitats  into the design of operations sites. Each Business Unit oversees the deployment of the  Nature pillar of the Sustainable Development roadmap  ensuring its fit with local challenges and contexts.  Therefore, biodiversity training and toolkits developed all  over the world are usually created and deployed at the  scale of business units to fit with local needs and local  biodiversity and ecosystems issues. SUEZ in France has  developed a biodiversity training based on gamification  focusing on French biodiversity local challenges. SUEZ  in the UK uses its Sustainability Champions Network to  raise awareness, train its employees on the biodiversity  topic and an app is available on all phones to identify flora.  SUEZ Sustainable Development network is used to share  feedbacks and tools within SUEZ employees responsible  for the deployment of the Nature pillar all over the world.  SUEZ is speeding up the implementation of solutions  that significantly improve the ecological quality of the  environment, both within its own scope of activity and  that of its customers. The Group offers operations to  restore soil functions, ecological rehabilitation and land  restoration initiatives that can be part of the Nature  based Solutions concept, and environmental monitoring  services. Such solutions are not only helpful in promoting  biodiversity, but also in adapting to climate change.  Several examples of offers could be mentioned as:  	- the production of biochar, a highly promising  agricultural fertilizer and carbon sink;  	- the dragonfly zone, an environmental innovation  inspired by natural wetlands acting as a buffer space  downstream from wastewater treatment plants, where  treated wastewater continues to be purified by a series  of ecological processes that work naturally in wetlands,  with the bonus of developing local biodiversity and  storing carbon.  As the Group has no activities directly related to the use  of animal resources, its business does not require any  special measures to ensure animal welfare other than  those described above.  ===== PAGE 27 ===== 27 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y SUEZ activities are closely linked to the fight against  climate change. For the Group, that may involve risks  related to the economic impact of environmental  regulations, but it may also take on a more operational  dimension due to the physical impacts that could arise,  such as those tied to extreme climatic events. Besides,  the Group can also address climate change by proposing  to its clients operational solutions such as decarbonizing  their activities or the location where they are based,  energy/climate performance, community resilience and  securing industrial processes in the face of the already  proven effects of climate change. There are two types of risk linked to climate change  incorporated into the Group's integrated risk management  process: •	 Risks relating to changes in environmental regulations,  particularly those focusing on climate challenges, and  their implementation, as well as the potential impact  of a carbon tax applied to some of the Group's waste  activities or those of some of its suppliers; •	 Physical risks of a more operational nature, in  particular those linked to service continuity in a global  context of accelerating frequency and intensity of  extreme meteorological phenomena, such as droughts  and floods. Regulatory changes are a powerful driver for the  development of circular economy solutions, such as  energy and material recovery from waste (recycling  and reuse of materials) and wastewater, optimization of  the energy efficiency of industrial facilities, or even the  implementation of renewable energy supply solutions.  Targets set by governments as part of their Nationally  Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreement,  by municipal authorities, and by industry have put the  Group in a position to be able to identify certain business  growth opportunities for its low-carbon solutions. In  developing countries, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission  reduction targets enable the Group to promote the  transformation of the municipal and industrial waste  management model, from disposal to recovery. Those  new treatment processes are clearly in line with the  priorities espoused by national governments, and they  come with a host of benefits, such as improved health  and quality of life in cities. Energy is also a key challenge and an opportunity for the  Group. Indeed, energy management has always been key  for operations as many of our sites depend on energy.  But this is also an opportunity as our sites also produce  energy (electricity, thermal energy and biogas). In Europe,  60% of the energy consumed is imported, this shows that  a real strategic autonomy in energy in Europe is far from  achieved. SUEZ contributes to reinforcing this autonomy  by producing more energy than it consumes, this being  also the case in Europe. 2.4 | Fighting and adapting against climate change 2.4.1 | Description of the challenges SUEZ addresses all those challenges in its Sustainable  Development roadmap, and it commits to contributing to  energy decarbonization, decarbonizing its value chain and  adapting its most exposed sites to climate change. 2.4.2 | Policies and action plans As explained above, energy is a key topic in 2023 and will  continue to be so for geopolitical reasons, sovereignty and  climate reasons. To understand how SUEZ is contributing to energy  decarbonization, this section will introduce the Group’s  activities with regards to energy consumption and  production. 2.4.2.1 | Contributing to energy decarbonization  ===== PAGE 28 ===== 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N TA L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 28 Internal Supply 660 GWh Electricity 768 GWh Heat External Energy Networks 3,041 GWh Electricity 1,352 GWh Hydrocarbon 1,043 GWh Diesel 219 GWh Natural Gas 90 GWh Others (Gasoline, Propane, LPG, CNG...)

The table below explains these 2 figures by activity. While  both water and waste activities are consuming energy,  waste activities are clearly the ones producing most of  SUEZ energy thanks to energy from waste. In terms of geography, most of SUEZ production is  actually in Europe which is the same for its consumption  and even in this geography the Group produces more than  it consumes. To better understand the different sources and types of  energy consumed and produced, the picture below helps  to visualize this:  ===== PAGE 29 ===== 29 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y In terms of geography the split between Europe and “rest  of the world” can be represented as follow: Global map: Consumption and Production  (GWh of ''equivalent'' energy = Final energy consumed or produced by SUEZ) Consumption Production Energy self-sufficiency (Production/Consumption - %) Understanding SUEZ energy profiles is important before  looking at SUEZ commitments and 2023 results. SUEZ energy roadmap and decarbonization Each table of this section will present 2022 data, as  published in the last Non-Financial Reporting Statement;  2022 updated including changes in perimeter with  acquisitions realized in 2022; and 2023 data.   Regarding energy decarbonization, SUEZ, as a producer of  energy is contributing to both energy decarbonization and  energy self-sufficiency of locations in which it operates. In  its roadmap, the Group has set the following targets: •	 Achieve self-sufficiency in electricity for its activities  in Europe: the water and waste activities are not only  consumers, but also producers of energy, thanks to  waste and wastewater recovery. SUEZ will mobilize the  potential of waste more strongly in the service of the  energy transition, to produce more electricity than it  consumes by 2023 in Europe, and to maintain that self- sufficiency over the duration of the plan.

As mentioned in the section “2.3.2.3 Optimized waste  management”, thanks to Solid Recovered Fuel projects,  SUEZ helps its clients decarbonizing by producing  renewable and recycled energy. This contributes directly  to GHG emissions avoided by energy production. •	 Accelerating the development of renewables is key to  achieving carbon neutrality in 2050. For communities,  it also represents a major challenge to sovereignty.  In this regard, waste-to-energy solutions can play a  key role because they enable the production of local  and renewable or recycled energy. Therefore, SUEZ  also commits to make its own energy consumption  more sustainable by increasing the share of  sustainable electricity to 70% of the Group's total  electricity consumption by 2030. This share will  be raised to 100% for electricity consumption in  Europe. SUEZ defines sustainable electricity by  renewable and recycled (electricity produced from  waste heat on waste to energy plants) electricity.  To reach that goal, the Group relies on both its own  power generation capacities and new renewable  electricity supply contracts. There is a slight decrease in 2023 that is because the  Victoria desalination plant in Australia hasn’t produced  any water (no need from the client due to high water  resources in 2022, so no need for desalination water in  2023). If we reprocess the data without this plant, the  2022 ratio would have been 21%, hence an increase of  sustainable electricity consumed by the Group of +2%. This explanation is easily illustrated looking at results at  European level where SUEZ has a commitment to reach  100% of sustainable electricity by 2030: This increase is supported by the development of  renewables which is a priority for SUEZ which has signed  four long-term power purchase agreements (PPA) in 2023. SUEZ intends to continue developing new PPAs to reach  this target and has already identified a new potential  for 2024. The Group will also develop photovoltaic solar  production projects on its closed landfills.

To contribute to carbon neutrality, SUEZ is committed to: •	 Reduce emissions from its water activity by 39% by 2030,  by improving the operational efficiency of treatment  processes, optimizing the energy consumption of  pumping systems, increasing the production of  renewable energy from sewage sludge, or reinforcing  its renewable energy supply contracts (wind, solar); •	 Reduce emissions from its waste activity by 26%  by 2030 (excluding incineration), in particular by  leveraging the biogas production potential of its landfill  sites, covering its landfill sites, switching to a more  sustainable fleet of vehicles for waste collection, and  improving the energy efficiency of its processing sites; •	 Improve the environmental performance of its  incineration activities through innovation: the Group  will invest a further €40 million in its Research &  Development programs dedicated to carbon capture  and sequestration. Reducing Greenhouse gas  emissions remains a top priority, it will not be enough  to achieve the carbon neutrality targets established in  the Paris Agreement. In this respect, all stakeholders  must continue and scale up their efforts as well  as deploying carbon sequestration solutions with  immediate effect. The Intergovernmental Panel on  Climate Change estimates that achieving that objective  will require, in addition to emission reduction targets,  the sequestration of 2 billion metric tons of CO2 per  year by 2030, rising to 10 billion metric tons annually  by 2050. SUEZ carbon profile Greenhouse gas accounting methodology  Assessing SUEZ greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is an  essential part of its efforts to reduce its impact on climate.  SUEZ calculates its emissions each year to manage and  keep track of its reduction plans. Those calculations  are based on technical data collected from each of the  Group's operating sites, using the “GHG Protocol®”  methodologies. More methodology is available in the  section “4.3 Methodological aspects of the environmental  reporting”. Type of emissions calculated In terms of GHG emissions different emission’s types are  calculated: •	 Direct emissions (scope 1) incoming from sites and  assets under the operational control of SUEZ.  •	 Indirect emissions linked to the usage of energy (scope 2)   according to two accountability methods defined by the  GHG protocol:  	-''Location based'' using geographical grid average  emissions factors for electricity; 	-''Market based'' using emissions factors shared by  the supplier of electricity and allowing the usage of  market instruments.  •	 Other indirect emissions (scope 3) produced by  the Group upstream and downstream value chain  (providers, subcontractors, clients, …).  2.4.2.2 | Contributing to SUEZ and its value chain decarbonization 31 © SUEZ / Franck Dunouau  ===== PAGE 32 ===== 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N TA L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 32 •	 Biogenic emissions resulting from SUEZ activities. Indeed,  biogenic emission by convention are separated for fossil  emissions. They are presented here for pedagogic purposes to  demonstrate the non negligeable weight of this type of emissions  within the water and waste activities.  •	 Avoided emissions produced by or products and services. They are  calculated in comparison with a reference scenario. Indeed, they  quantify the emissions that would have occurred in the absence  of the product or the service provided by SUEZ (for instance, the  production of a virgin material quantity versus the production of a  recycled version, the use of high carbon-intensive energy versus  the consumption of recovered energy for incineration, …). They  cannot be subtracted from induced emission this is why they are  reported in parallel.   GHG presentation scope choices and justification  At SUEZ, most important sources of emissions are the use of water  by the consumer (including the heating of domestic hot water) and  the transformation of the recovered material by industrials further  in the value chain (new materials produced from metal scraps,  sorted plastics and paper, …). The reduction options for these two  emission sources are constrained by the fact that they fall outside  the direct scope of SUEZ actions. In consequence SUEZ emissions  are presented according to two distinct focuses:  •	 The “Exhaustive” GHG focus: taking into account all of the  extended sources of the scope 3;  •	 The “Operational” GHG focus: excluding water heating and  transformation of recovered materials. This approach focuses  on scope 3 sources where SUEZ has more direct and operational  means to reduce emissions thanks to technical decision, policies,  etc…  Both concepts are presented below, but the detailed analysis  focuses on the second option. Similarly, as SUEZ reduction targets are explained in terms of a  ''market-based'' scope 2 basis, in that report we outline the concept  of the two ''location-based'' and ''market-based'' methodologies, but  detailed results are presented on a ''market-based'' scope 2 basis. 35,000,000 30,000,000 25,000,000 20,000,000 15,000,000 10,000,000 5,000,000 0 Exaustive GHG focus GHG emissions broken down by scope “Exhaustive” GHG focus  Scope 1, 2 “Market Based” and 3 (water heating and  transformation of recovered materials included) 32,689,000  tons of CO2eq 10,000,000 9,000,000 8,000,000 7,000,000 6,000,000 5,000,000 4,000,000 3,000,000 2,000,000 1,000,000 0 Operational GHG focus GHG emissions broken down by scope  “Operational” GHG focus  Scope 1, 2 “Market Based” and 3 (water heating and  transformation of recovered materials excluded) 9,507,000   tons of CO2eq Scope 3 transformation of recovered materials  by the client Scope 3 water heating by the client Scope 3 operational Scope 2 market based Scope 1 Scope 3 operational Scope 2 market based Scope 1  ===== PAGE 33 ===== 33 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y Total scope 1 and scope 2 market-based amounts to 5,291,537 metric  tons of CO2 equivalent in 2023.

Most of these emissions are indirect  (Scope 2 Market based, 88%) come  primarily from the electricity  consumption required to operate  SUEZ plants and networks. •	 In the waste activity, excluding waste- to-energy: 1,875,748 metric tons of  CO2 equivalent, i.e. 35% of the Group's  total emissions (scope 1 and 2). Most  of these are direct emissions (Scope 1,   98%) arising from the release of  methane emissions from landfill sites  and emissions from waste collection  vehicles. •	 In the waste-to-energy activity:   2,346,432 metric tons of CO2  equivalent, i.e. 45% of the Group's  total emissions (scope 1 and 2). These  are mainly direct emissions (Scope 1,   98%) arising from GHG emissions  (primarily CO2, but also some N2O)  from waste combustion, which  includes a proportion of fossil carbon. •	 Calculating scope 2 according to  the GHG Protocol's ''market- based''   methodology increases SUEZ CO2  equivalent emissions by 105,294   metric tons compared to the  “location-based” approach.  Indeed,  the Market Based approach implies  that every fraction of energy  purchased not covered by green  energy certificates shall be accounted  using the respective country’s  residual mix emission factor. Typically,  this factor is higher than the average  grid mix utilized in the location Based  approach because all renewable  energy is allocated to the consumer  who bought it. It's important to note  that in 2023, for France specifically,  the residual mix was significantly  higher than the average grid mix. This  was primarily due to the decrease in  nuclear production. 5,291,537  teqCO2  ===== PAGE 34 ===== 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N TA L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 34 Biogenic emissions  In parallel to fossil emissions, SUEZ  monitors its scope 1 biogenic emissions.  As a reminder biogenic emission are  part of the natural carbon cycle (biomass  decomposition or combustion) and are  distinct from anthropogenic CO2 emissions,  which result from human activities such  as burning fossil fuels. This is why by  convention they are accounted separately.  These types of emissions are presented  here for pedagogic purposes and to provide  order of magnitudes. The main source of biogenic CO2 is the  biomass fraction contained in the waste  that is incinerated within SUEZ own  facilities. This biomass, when energetically  valorized, serves as a source of renewable  energy for final consumers. The second  source of biogenic carbon arises from  pollution reduction processes within  water treatment systems operated, often  attributed to microbiological activity.  This function is essential for purifying water before its return to the  environment or reuse. Other sources include various activities such as  waste degradation in landfills, secondary activities related to wastewater  treatment. Greenhouse gas emissions comparison with last year  In 2022, notable acquisitions expanded the Group perimeter, including  SUEZ UK, IWS France, and EnviroServ in South Africa. These additions  were not consolidated in the previous year's reporting because the  consolidation rule mandates at least six months of operational activity.   To enable a comparison of emissions with the previous year, a presentation  of emissions both with (2022 updated) and without the acquisitions   (2022 as in our last report) is presented.  The proposed comparison is solely based on identical perimeters. 2022 (teqCO2) 2022  updated (teqCO2) 2023  (teqCO2) 2023   vs 2022  updated Water 1,142,788 1,125,216 1,069,357 -5.0% Waste activity  excluding   waste-to-energy 1,099,384 2,067,684 1,875,748 -9.3% Waste-to-energy 1,520,476 2,371,595 2,346,432 -1.1% Global 3,762,648 5,564,495 5,291,537 -4.9% Scope 1 & 2 market-based comparison with and without acquisition (teqCO2) SUEZ 2023 biogenic emissions (t biogenic CO2) Incineration  46% Wastewater  (pollution removal  and other sources)  32% Landfill 22% 5,716,000 biogenic teqCO2 By comparing 2022 updated and 2023  we can observe that all businesses  have reduced their scope 1 and 2  Market Based emissions.  •	 For the water business (-5%  reduction): the explanation mainly  resides in SUEZ capacity to  increase energy efficiency on its  sites, more production of energy  for self-consumption (Alexandria  wastewater treatment plant),  an improvement in Asia and  Australia electricity mix with more  renewable electricity. •	 For the Waste excluding waste to  energy business (-9.3% reduction):  improvement in biogas capture  (Meknes-Morocco, France and  UK landfills), improvement in  CH4 measurement (South Africa)  and improvement in SUEZ fossil  fuel consumption (both less  consumption and switch to  alternative fuel vehicles). •	 For the Waste to energy business  (-1.1% reduction): improvement of  SUEZ plants’ overall performance. In overall the Group has reduced its  emissions by 4.9% in comparison to  2022.  ===== PAGE 35 ===== 35 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y Highlights of main reducing actions and plans  •	 Water:  	- Pau-Lescar Biofactory is a good example of solutions  proposed by SUEZ to its clients for decarbonizing  their water activities. Indeed, near Pau (France),  SUEZ operates a wastewater treatment plant and  is building anaerobic digestion and methanation  facilities. The project is employing breakthrough  technology to make the Pau-Lescar wastewater  treatment unit a positive energy plant that will  produce 10 resources and green energy sources. The  project includes two innovative solutions resulting in  an energy-positive building and an unrivalled carbon  footprint. 	- Catalytic methanation. The site’s energy  performance will be increased by the production of  synthetic methane from the methanation of carbon  dioxide (CO2). This innovative catalytic methanation  technology will transform all the CO2 emitted into  synthetic methane, a renewable green gas. 	-''Ultra-dewatering'' by hydrothermal carbonisation.  This new technology divides treatment sludge  volumes by four and consumes three to four times  less energy than a conventional thermal dryer,  while reducing the potential disruption associated  with drying. This SUEZ-designed process  considerably increases biomethane production and  generates a new material resource, biocoal, which  can either be returned to the soil, or turned into  energy through combustion. 	- As mentioned in the water section (2.3), Nice Haliotis  2 project will also have exemplary credentials as  it will help decarbonize the region. It will produce   4 times the energy that it consumes today. It will enable  optimal energy recovery of sludge from wastewater  treatment and produce biomethane [equivalent to   11,000 homes powered/day and 290 buses fueled/ day]. 	- In Egypt, at Alexandria wastewater treatment plant,  the digesters were fully commissioned and providing  100% of their capacity, enabling the site to decrease  12,000 tons of CO2 equivalent (50%) its scope 2 GHG  emissions. 	- Nitrous Oxyde (N2O) is a strong greenhouse gas  (GHG) with a Global Warming Potential (GWP) of  273 (meaning 1 ton of N2O is equivalent to 273 tons  of CO2). N2O is emitted through waste water and  organic treatments, so SUEZ invests on Research  and Innovation to mitigate its effects and has already  developed AirAdvanced®-ActiLayer, a novel cover  for sludge treatment plants which reduces 80% of  nitrous oxide emitted through the use of catalytic  material and the power of sunlight. This solution will  be deployed on the wastewater treatment plant of  Staffordshire, in the UK, which aim to contribute to  carbon neutrality of the local hub. 	- As part of its participation to the COP28, SUEZ was  invited to be part to the Sharm El-Sheikh Adaptation  Agenda Working Group on Urban Water Resilience and  took part to its launch in December 2023. Since then,  SUEZ leads one of the subgroups of this initiative on  the “climate resilient utilities”. The latter will produce  every year recommendations and indicators to help  utilities and municipalities all over the world building  plants reducing at the maximum their GHG emissions  and adapted to climate change. This subgroup is  composed of public and private stakeholders.  •	 Waste (excl. incineration):  	- To decrease greenhouse gas and atmospheric  pollutants, SUEZ optimizes, when possible, waste  collection through less emissive trucks. Internal tools  like CO2 Pilot in France and analysts support tender  teams with optimizing fleets of waste collection trucks  and reducing at the maximum their relative emissions  of GHG and atmospheric pollutants. For instance,  for Limoges Métropole, 16 electric vehicles and   10 vehicles running on XTL (HVO 100) biofuel replaced  the diesel fleet. Combined with the optimization  of collection routes implemented, SUEZ helps its  customer reducing by 93% GHG emissions compared  to the previous contract. 	- SUEZ is continuing its effort to reduce methane  leakage on landfills sites. SUEZ AirAdvanced®- Scan360 service allows to aggregate and disseminate  methane (CH4) datasets at landfills site. The study  includes the use of meteorological data and  ambient air quality datasets to produce site specific  concentration mapping for on-site CH4. The service  also provides a coherent understanding for the  localisation of on-site leakages. More than 20 sites  were measured in 2023 enabling to precisely localize  leakages.  	- In South Africa, this first study provided data  to support first model adjustment for emission  declaration and resulted in a 19% (144,878 tons  of CO2) reduction in reported GHG in 2023. The   modelling also assisted in identifying and  prioritising 3 sites with high potential for emission  reduction through flaring and or installation of  engines. 	- Besides, SUEZ is continuously improving its biogas  capture on all its most emitting sites. For instance,  in Meknes (Morocco), the site can demonstrate   in 2023 a decrease of 35,000 tons of CO2eq (-21%)  thanks to better biogas capture which has been  used to produce 1,580 MWh of electricity on-site.  ===== PAGE 36 ===== 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N TA L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 36 •	 Waste incineration: SUEZ takes action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  from its incineration activities, with a dedicated budget  and innovation teams working on CCUS (carbon  capture, storage and recovery) solutions. Regulations  on fossil CO2 emissions are changing, with the possible  inclusion of non-hazardous waste-to-energy plants in  the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) between 2028  and 2031. The impact study that will determine the  inclusion of these plants in the EU ETS will be delivered  by the European Commission by July 2026. SUEZ is already anticipating these regulatory changes  by studying carbon capture and storage, to provide its  customers with the best possible support and offer  them alternative solutions for decarbonizing their  waste-to-energy facilities.   In addition, the proportion of biogenic CO2 (from biomass)  present in the flue gases from waste-to-energy plants  and RDF boilers, as well as in biogas from methanization,  is of interest to many downstream customers.  SUEZ is studying various innovative CO2 recovery  solutions, for example to help decarbonize transport  by producing low-carbon alternative fuels and other  uses (mineralization, new materials, microalgae, etc.). At its Terres d'Aquitaine methanization site (Gironde),  SUEZ has teamed up with Prodeval to capture, purify  and recover the CO2 from biogas with a view to using  it directly locally. Initial results are expected in 2024. Finally, regarding key waste-to-energy projects, 2023  marked the beginning of service for the biomass/ Solid Recovered Fuel heating facility, BIOSYNERGY,  located in the city of Le Havre, France. Since the end  of 2023, this facility has been providing renewable and  recovered heat for the city's urban network and some  nearby industrial sites.

Even though these materials are  destined to be recycled, replacing virgin materials  which are often more emissive than the recovered  ones, SUEZ decided to include the emissions produced  by the client's recycling processes, to achieve the most  exhaustive and transparent Scope 3 possible. •	 3.11 – Use of sold products: Water heating: Water  heating accounting method evolved between 2022 et  2023. Previously only the volume of water distributed by  SUEZ directly to a client was accounted. For 2023, the  figure now includes emissions for the scenario where  SUEZ produces the water, but it is distributed to the  client by a third party. Avoided emissions  As seen above most of SUEZ greenhouse gas (GHG)  emissions come from providing services that are  essential to society, i.e. managing and processing the  waste material entrusted to the Group. Through its  activities, SUEZ enables other players to reduce their  emissions by producing, for instance, renewable energy  (biogas, biomass combustion, …) or participating in the  production of recycled materials. To quantify this positive  environmental impact within its client’s scope or its  supply chain, SUEZ accounts for avoided emissions. As a  reminder, these kinds of emissions cannot be subtracted  from the induced one. Nevertheless, they can be used as  an external decarbonization indicator.

The sources of the avoided emissions are essentially  linked to the implementation of circular economy  solutions offered by the Group to its municipal and  industrial customers, namely: •	 Material recovery, by means of: 	- collection, sorting, and recycling, 	- composting, 	- recovery of residual waste from the incineration of  non-hazardous waste, 	- production of Solid Recovered Fuels (SRF);  •	 Energy recovery, by means of: 	- incineration of municipal or industrial waste, 	- energy recovery from biogas recovered at landfill sites, 	- energy recovery from biogas produced from wastewater. In 2023, the emissions avoided by the Group's customers  can be broken down as follows: •	 In the water activity: 40,514 metric tons of CO2 equivalent,  i.e. 1% of the Group's total avoided emissions. Those  avoided emissions correspond to reductions in scope 2  emissions for the Group's customers through the use  of energy produced from the digestion of sludge from  wastewater treatment plants (biogas transformed into  biomethane or natural gas), compared with a reference  scenario in which the energy used by customers would  be more carbon-intensive; •	 In the waste activity, excluding waste-to-energy:   5,322,505 metric tons of CO2 equivalent, i.e. 83% of the  Group's total avoided emissions. Avoided emissions  refers to the emission reductions for the Group's  customers, such as customer scope 1 (via the use  of Solid Recovered Fuels), customer scope 2 (via the  use of energy from biogas produced from waste or  wastewater), or customer scope 3 (via the use of  secondary raw materials); •	 In the waste-to-energy activity: 1,050,186 metric tons  of CO2 equivalent, i.e. 16% of the Group's total avoided  emissions. Avoided emissions refers to the emission  reductions for the Group's customers, such as  customer scope 2 (via the use of electrical or thermal  energy from waste combustion in waste-to-energy  plants) or customer scope 3 (via the use of secondary  raw materials from the reclamation of bottom ash and  recycled metals from waste-to-energy plants). Moreover, SUEZ is always investigating new solutions to  help its clients decarbonize in several ways, including the  production of biochar. In 2023, SUEZ joined forces with Airex Energy and Groupe  Rémabec to create Canada’s first industrial biochar  production plant in Port-Cartier, Quebec. By transforming  forest and agricultural residues into carbon sinks and  soil amendments, the facility will produce a carbon- rich biochar with high environmental qualities from the  residual biomass of Groupe Rèmabec’s operations. It will leverage Airex Energy’s innovative CarbonFXTM  pyrolysis technology and SUEZ expertise in the  transformation and valorisation of organic waste,  agricultural soil enhancement, biofertilisers, and new  resources from the circular economy. Biochar is a  material with highly promising environmental benefits,  identified by the UN IPCC as one of five negative-emission  solutions to curb global warming and help achieve the  carbon-neutral targets set by the Paris agreements. Other actions  In parallel the Group was involved in several notable  action related to GHG accounting initiative and climate  standards.  In France, SUEZ water activities were the main facilitator  of the ASTEE’s Water GHG Working Group (French  Association of Water and Waste Professionals), which  main objective was this year to update the ''Water and  Wastewater Sectorial Guide of GHG Accounting.'' This  initiative was financed by ADEME and the French Ministry  of Ecological Transition. The updated guide provides  guidelines to enhance the GHG accounting methodology  of the sector and a library of directly applicable emission  factors. Although developed in the French context,  this guide contains best practices applicable to all  international perimeters.   The consulting activities of SUEZ, along with a wide  variety of actors such as Société Forestière, contributed  to the publication of a new ‘Label Bas Carbon’ method  official French carbon finance mechanism piloted by the  government named “Arboreal City” (Tree in the city). This  methodology will promote carbon sequestration as well  as the other co-benefits brought by urban tree planting.  ===== PAGE 39 ===== 39 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y To ensure resilience of essential services, one must  already adapt most vulnerable infrastructures to the  consequences of climate change. Extreme weather  events can affect the continuity of water, wastewater, and  waste services: flooding risks for water treatment plants  close to coastlines and aquatic environments; pollution  of pumping wells and drinking water production plants  in the event of heavy rain; fire risks at waste treatment  sites in the event of drought, and so on. To protect these  essential services, SUEZ will draw up a action plan for  100% of the priority sites it operates by 2027. A project dedicated to adapting to climate change is  currently in progress, led by the Sustainable Development  Department and bringing together Operations, Risks and  Insurances Departments with all the Business Units. The  first step was to build a tool enabling us to measure site by  site the level of exposure regarding the 28 climate-related  hazards identified by the EU Taxonomy. The second step  will be to determine at site level vulnerability regarding  these hazards and then to define and implement action  plans. Thanks to this in-depth analysis, SUEZ is continuing to  improve its risk and opportunities financial assessment  with regards to climate change. This is helping SUEZ  fulfill its TCFD7 approach and to prepare for CSRD8.  Examples of first results are available in SUEZ CDP  Climate disclosure of 2023. Based on a first analysis, SUEZ has already started this  work for its most vulnerable sites in France, Asia and the  UK. Besides, SUEZ already offers solutions to help its client  mitigate effects of climate change (see also section 2.3).  As this is still evolving, SUEZ is also investing in Research  & Innovation to continue designing new solutions for  climate adaptation. As examples, these three offers cover many aspects of  SUEZ value chain: •	 Thanks to Aria Technologies, SUEZ can help its sites  and clients to process accurate assessments of their  exposure to climate hazards. Indeed, ARIA Technologies  has a team of climate researchers, specialized in  adaptation to climate change, forecasting extreme  events such as cold or heat waves, hurricanes, etc.  They’re able to produce data analyses and maps on  what will happen. •	 SUEZ provides solutions to adapt some of SUEZ plants,  particularly on the water side (e.g. solutions from the  AQUADVANCED® suite). It allows SUEZ to adapt its  infrastructures to what impacts the most, torrential  rains, floods but also water stress. For instance, the  AQUADVANCED® Urban Drainage solution makes it  possible to adapt rainwater and wastewater networks  in real time in the event of flooding or flooding to  avoid water and soil pollution and better preserve  ecosystems. In Chongqing city (China), AQUADVANCED®  Urban Drainage system provides local authorities with  a global, real-time view of the entire sanitation network  based on data collected using sensors installed on the  network and in the receiving environment, and short- term weather forecasts. It is used to monitor, analyze,  and forecast the operating status of the rainwater  drainage system, urban flood risks, influences on  natural ecology and the rainwater reuse system. It  will also calculate and report on how a sponge city  performs against key performance indicators. By centralizing and analyzing all these data, the  software will protect the population from the risk  of flooding inhabitants against flood risks and limit  pollution in the Yangtze, Asia's longest river, which is  an essential resource for the population's water supply.  The system has also been successfully applied to   20 cities and regions. •	 SUEZ has dedicated expertise capacities in terms of  consulting missions for territorial adaptation strategies  its clients, both in France and abroad. 2.4.2.3 | Adapting our most exposed sites to climate change _ _ 7 Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 8 Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)  ===== PAGE 40 ===== 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N TA L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 40 2.5 | Contributing to social and societal   	   challenges 2.5.1 | Description of the challenges The consequences of climate change and the destruction  of ecosystems considerably impact populations, primarily  affecting the most vulnerable. The International Labor  Organization estimates that global warming will cause  the loss of 80 million jobs. Moreover, the ecological  transition requires transformations that call for collective  commitment. Together with its partners and customers,  SUEZ is committed to reconciling human and economic  development as well as increasing the positive impact  of its businesses with a focus 3 challenges: protecting  the health and safety for all, growing skills, and  fostering employee engagement; and contributing to the  sustainable development of communities. As an industrial company, the Group is exposed to several  risks on Health and Safety. Protecting the health and  safety of all its employees and subcontractors as well  as the customers and populations among which SUEZ  work is a priority. During its activities, the Group handles  or even produces hazardous products or by-products.  Such is the case for certain facilities that treat specific  industrial or hospital waste of a toxic or infectious nature.  Some chemicals used in the water treatment process are  also considered hazardous substances. For any industrial  site, there are also risks of industrial accidents such as  fire or explosion. These can result from design flaws or  be caused by external events beyond the Group's control  (actions of third parties, natural disasters, etc.). Road  risk, particularly in the context of waste collection, is also  a major risk for SUEZ. 2.5.1.1 | Health and safety The Group pursues its various lines of work by bringing  to bear a wide range of expertise among its technical and  managerial staff. To maintain the key skills of the Group's  current activities (e.g. sales forces for the industrial  sector, major project managers or mega-data experts)  and develop those linked to its transformation into new  activities, such as smart cities or digital technology, the  Group needs to plan ahead for the skills that will be  needed for certain lines of work. Continuing to develop  its expertise and, more broadly, the employability of  employees is a priority for SUEZ. The Group's success  depends on its ability to identify existing skills, and to  recruit, train, and retain enough employees, including  executives, engineers, technicians, and salespeople with  the required skills, expertise, and local knowledge, amid  a context where competition for employees with such  profiles can be fierce. As regards to employee commitment, as soon as the new  General Management team was in place, SUEZ made sure  to gauge that commitment by conducting a Pulse survey of  all Group employees. That has given us a baseline against  which we can regularly gauge employee commitment and  the impact of any implemented actions. In-house and  external surveys, such as the Pulse in-house engagement  survey, show that a sense of social and environmental  responsibility is a key factor for attracting and retaining  talented people, as well as for satisfying the expectations  of public and industrial customers. In that regard, 73% of  SUEZ employees responding to the latest Pulse in-house  survey in January 2023 gave a positive assessment of the  company's engagement with social and environmental  issues. As such, SUEZ intends to reflect society at large  and promote equality, diversity and social dialogue and  to pave the way for its employees to get involved in the  environmental transition. 2.5.1.2 | Skills and employee engagement  ===== PAGE 41 ===== 41 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 2.5.2 | Policies and action plans In 2023, SUEZ recorded two fatal accidents: 	- An employee of Water France died due to lack of oxygen  during an intervention in a pit; 	- In Bangladesh, a subcontractor died due to traffic  accident. In 2023, the severity rate dropped from 0.546 to 0.46, and  the frequency rate also decreased from 6.43 to 5.97. As part of its Sustainable Development Roadmap 2023-  2027, SUEZ is aiming for ''zero severe or fatal accidents''  and is committed to reducing both the frequency and  severity of workplace accidents, with the aim of achieving  a frequency rate of less than 6.15 and a severity rate of  less than 0.45 by 2023.  SUEZ Health & Safety actions are guided by three main  priorities: 	- Controlling its major risks to preserve health and life; 	- Making health and safety a key factor in decision- making; 	- Making individual and collective commitments to  Health and Safety.   The personal commitment of management at all levels  (Group, BUs, regions, entities, etc.) ensures effective  implementation of the Group's Health & Safety Policy.  Operational managers and operators were supported  by a network of approximately 400 Health & Safety  professionals in 2023. That policy and the associated actions plans are then  implemented and monitored by a comprehensive Group  system: annual contractualization of qualitative and  quantitative objectives with the General Managers of  each Business Unit, Health & Safety audits, managerial  training and monitoring by the Health & Safety  Department through proactive and reactive performance  indicators. The Group action plan is drawn up by the Health & Safety  Department and its steering committee, made up of the  H&S Directors of each BU, and then presented to the  Board of Directors' CSR Committee. It is then broken  down into ''Annual Health & Safety Objectives Contracts'',  comprising both quantitative objectives (frequency rate  and severity rate) and qualitative objectives, including  the main actions set out in the ZERO severe and fatal  accidents roadmap. As a global environmental services company, SUEZ  develops and distributes technological and social  solutions for regional development. To be both acceptable  and effective, such solutions need to take into account the  specific characteristics of the areas they affect, as well as  the interests of stakeholders.  As such, SUEZ intends to: 	- contribute to local wealth with responsible procurement, 	- invent solutions in line with the United Nations'  Sustainable Development Goals with social innovation  practices, 	- strengthen its impact through corporate philanthropy,  	- extend its positive influence with academic partnerships  or business associations. 2.5.1.3 | Sustainable Development of communities 2.5.2.1 | Protecting the health and safety of all Key performance indicator 2022 results  2023 results Fatal accidents  involving employees 1 within SUEZ direct employees  3 within SUEZ subcontractors  1 within SUEZ direct employees  1 within SUEZ subcontractors  Severity rate 0.55 0.46 Frequency Rate 6.43 5.97  ===== PAGE 42 ===== 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N TA L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 42 Those ''Health & Safety Objective Contracts'' ensure that  objectives are implemented in line with each other. They  are drawn up with each subsidiary manager at the start  of the year and co-signed by the Group Health & Safety  Department. They are supported throughout the year  by designated contact persons in the Corporate Health  & Safety team, followed by a detailed general review at  the end of the year. Their implementation is integrated  into the scorecards that have a significant impact on the  variable pay of all the Group's top executives. Lastly, the Health & Safety Department has introduced  proactive performance indicators to assess the level  of maturity of the subsidiaries' safety culture, and in  particular the experience acquired through the analysis  of accidents, ''near misses'' and, above all, high severity  potential events (HIPO). In 2023, over 1266 HIPO events  were reported and analyzed, and over 30,000 near-misses  or dangerous situations were reported by employees,  thanks to the climate of trust that has been created. The Group's Health & Safety action plan for 2023  encompasses various key areas to enhance safety  and well-being within the organization. The foremost  priority is centered around Leadership in Health &  Safety, emphasizing the redeployment of life-saving  rules to ensure effective and consistent implementation.  Regarding the control of major safety risks, the plan  addresses specific domains such as road risks in  waste collection, trench work, lock out tag out, the use  of dangerous tools and machines, the startup of new  facilities, working at height, chemical risks, and confined  spaces. Additionally, the plan includes initiatives to control  health risks, including mental health and the prevention  of psychosocial risks, ergonomics, biological risks, and  the prevention of alcohol use. These comprehensive  measures underscore the group's commitment to the  safety and health of its employees, while implementing  specific actions to address particular risk areas. The health and safety of its employees, partners and all  its stakeholders, is the top priority for SUEZ. The Group  is continuing its actions to achieve the goal of zero severe  and fatal accidents. SUEZ is committed to reducing both  their frequency and severity, with the goal of achieving a  frequency rate of less than 5.30 and a severity rate of less  than 0.39 by 2027. 42 © SUEZ / William Daniels  ===== PAGE 43 ===== 43 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y Training and skills development  In 2023, a specific development plan for experts has  been rolled out.  Experts were offered learning programs  to reinforce their communication skills and to improve  their capacity to share knowledge. SUEZ has structured  a global policy to develop and support experts in Water  and Waste activities. In 2023, the following profiles were  trained:  	- 30 experts 	- 36 key experts 	- 6 lead experts (new promotion) In 2023, following the definition of the company’s  strategy, its purpose, and the implementation of a new  organisation, the Group has decided to adopt a leadership  model to clarify the attitudes and behaviours expected  from all and contribute to SUEZ cultural evolution. The purpose of this leadership model is to become a  behavioural guide for all managers and employees of  SUEZ, regardless of their role, business unit, or country.  Some dedicated communication sessions (Global webcast,  senior management dialogue...) have been held. A training  called “Leadership calendar” was made available online  to all employees. The purpose of this training was to  discover and experiment the leadership model in 21 days. Top management has decided to reinforce the onboarding  process. This strategic approach not only accelerates  the acclimation of newcomers but also yields tangible  benefits such as increased productivity, higher job  satisfaction, and improved employee retention. Indeed,  SUEZ has focused in 2023 on the deployment of an  onboarding tool for all the new SUEZ employees. This  online program is called “Welcome to SUEZ” and  presents the company’s organization,  SUEZ purpose  and  strategy. It also encompasses presentation of the  Executive Committee and presentation of the Sustainable  development roadmap. In addition, trainings are allocated  in Health & Safety, ethic, and cybersecurity. Since the  launch of this program in April 2023, 85% of the skilled/ management employees (“Cadres”) who have joined SUEZ  have completed the “Welcome to SUEZ” onboarding path. Given the specificity of its activity, the Group develops  dedicated trainings to help its employees to be fully  committed into ecological transition.  •	The Group supports an initiative called The Environment  Fresco designed to raise awareness among all Group  employees through a network of ambassadors. The  Fresco initiative aims to provide an interactive and  enjoyable way to build on the skills and awareness of all  SUEZ employees regarding Sustainable Development,  and to get them engaged on the issue in their day- to-day lives, helping them to realize the impact and  contribution of their actions in their professional and  personal lives. To date, 2,631 employees have tried  it out, and 114 have signed up to become facilitators  and continue to spread the word throughout the Group.  A ''citizen's passport'', consisting of five e-learning  modules, enables participants to deepen their  knowledge of the challenges involved in the Fresco,  SUEZ solutions, best practices at sites, and eco-  gestures at an individual level. All SUEZ employees are  offered the chance to embark on the path to a ''citizen's  passport'' as soon as they join the company. •	Many trainings have been developed and largely  implemented in the different Business Units. For  instance, climate issues and climate change have been  launched internally in 2023 through digital content. Other  key topics have been addressed in specific modules such  as Water as a resource, Circular economy or Biodiversity  in France. More “hands-on” training sessions were also  organized on eco-driving to optimize fuel efficiency  across the Group’s truck fleets in France. SUEZ has also launched eco-responsible challenges for  some of the Group's employees. The aim is to encourage  people to get involved in the effort by leading initiatives  that contribute to improving our daily habits, and even to  setting up virtuous systems in their activities. 2.5.2.2 | Growing skills and fostering employee engagement 2022 results  2023 results % of employees trained, including digital training 75.3% 77.4% % of management positions held by women 33.8% 34.5% % of employees covered by a social dialogue system 92.9% 94.2% Key performance indicator  ===== PAGE 44 ===== 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N TA L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 44 In 2023, different challenges were organized within  the Group. The ''Go for Good Challenge'' has been a  great success in France: more than 70 teams have been  mobilized to think, imagine and put into action good  eco-responsibility practices in both the water and waste  sectors, around the 6 pillars of action: waste, food, mobility,  equipment, green waste and biodiversity, buildings.   In Asia, SUEZ Asia ESG Award program 2023 was launched  to encourage and inspire colleagues to take more actions  contributive to SD roadmap. In total 90 projects were  gathered with the involvement of all BAs in Asia. The  submission covers dimensions of climate, nature, CSR  and H&S. Promoting equality, diversity and inclusion  The action plan for professional equality is based on  various mechanisms, such as recruitment, reducing  the pay gap, internal promotion of women, working  environment conditions and corporate culture. That  action plan comes with specific objectives, such as: •	increase the proportion of women recruited to ensure  a more balanced representation of the sexes within the  Group’s various lines of work; •	reduce pay gaps where they exist; •	create an inclusive work environment conducive to  equitable treatment; •	promote development programs and accelerate the  promotion of women to key positions; •	develop coaching and mentoring programs to open  additional career opportunities; •	implement actions to promote an inclusive culture  that is conducive to professional equality, with the  aim of changing attitudes and removing any remaining  barriers. The proportion of women recruited to executive positions  was 35.5% in 2023. In 2023, women made up 23.7% of  the workforce and 34.5% of managerial positions (which  is 0.8 points higher than last year). SUEZ Diversity &  Inclusion policy promotes professional equality and  fosters initiatives centered on: •	improving working conditions to pave the way for  women to work in operational positions (personal  protection equipment designed for women, installation  of changing rooms, etc.); •	fighting against sexism and sexual harassment, with a  whistle-blowing procedure (protection of victims with  the creation of a helpline and psychological support,  designation of a contact person in each BU, zero  tolerance on sexism). Several e-learning programs  are available to all employees to raise awareness of  Managers and employees;  •	developing support for parenthood (neutralization of  maternity leave in salary policy, promotion of paternity  and parental leave without gender discrimination,  payment of paternity leave under the same conditions  as maternity leave); •	retraining and promoting career development in lines  of work where the gender is under-represented; •	coaching with specific programs such as “Alignés” in  France which aims to accompany women in reaching  professional and personal goals; •	boosting women management with “Women journey”  program helping women in leadership development  skills with a combination of webinars, mentoring, digital  learnings, working groups on SUEZ business projects  and mentoring sessions. It is based on a 6-month  journey to facilitate appropriation and experimentation.  In 2023, an executive mentoring program called PO2  was also offered to a few women in key management  positions to support their career.  SUEZ promotes diversity and inclusion in all its forms  and actively fights against all types of discrimination,  such as those linked to origins, gender, disability, sexual  orientation, or religion. The Group has an ambitious policy  of integrating people with disabilities into its workforce.  In 2023, the Group's workforce included 1,052 people with  disabilities. SUEZ has developed e-learnings on 3-pilar  of inclusion (spreading an inclusive culture, promote  diversity and build an inclusive environment).  By the end of 2023, 7,680 employees had finished  at least one of the 3 modules promoting inclusion   (21,638 modules were realized in total by the end of 2023).  Several webinars were launched in 2023 on specific  topics such as fighting against stereotypes, “wonder  parent”, sexism issues, neurodiversity as unexplored  potential. On average, 600 people per event participated  in 2023 to these webinars. In addition, SUEZ continues  its podcast “Diversité sur les ondes” and created content  with “Create the desire to evolve”. SUEZ is also involved in  the Disability Day with a sensibilization campaign whose  2023 topic was “Innovation for all”. Moreover, a kit for inclusive management has been  launched in 2023 whose goal is to make SUEZ a more  inclusive workplace by helping Managers to get rid of  stereotypes in management and trigger discussions with  their team on diversity.  ===== PAGE 45 ===== 45 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y Stimulating social dialogue  SUEZ is committed to promoting  social dialogue, as well  as the establishment of collective agreements. In 2023,  94.2% of the Group's employees were covered, either  directly within their legal entity or at a more general level,  by a system of social dialogue.  Current European instance that was reviewed in 2022  have been fully functional in 2023 with the European  committee council. Local or national councils have  continued to run and address key topics. For instance,  the European committee was consulted on the operating  model which was validated by the representative in March  2023. In addition, some negotiations at European level  have started in 2023 related to Health & Safety agreement. In order to define its Sustainable Development  priorities, and with the aim of preventing or dealing with  controversies linked to its activities, SUEZ adheres to a  proactive policy of dialogue and regularly consults experts  and stakeholders to collectively address dilemmas as and  when they arise. In the field, SUEZ proposes mechanisms  of dialogue adapted to the contexts and stakeholders of  its projects. The Sustainable Development Department  is in charge of coordinating that dialogue: it monitors  social issues, raises awareness among managers, and  gets internal stakeholders involved in the challenges to  be addressed. Fostering employee engagement  Since 2021, SUEZ is measuring employee satisfaction  through the “Pulse” internal survey covering all SUEZ  employees. In its Sustainable Development Roadmap,  the Group has set the target to remain 10 points above  the benchmark. In 2023, the results of the survey are   7 points above the benchmark. Social and environmental  commitment of the company is clearly a strength  identified in the survey, with 15 points above the  benchmark, as well as the focus on safety and the respect  of diversity. In terms of improvement areas, collaboration  or customer centricity have been highlighted.  To strengthen the commitment of its employees and  involve them in the rollout of its strategy, SUEZ aims to  increase the proportion of employee shareholding in its  capital. Between September and December 2022, the ''Go  SUEZ'' operation offered employees in nine countries the  chance to become shareholders in the Group. Nearly half  of the employees with assets in the former Sharing plans  in France, i.e. over 6,800 employees, have subscribed  to the ''Go SUEZ Réinvest''' package. And more than  12,000 Group employees—over 40% of eligible employees  in Spain, France, Hong Kong, India, Macau, Morocco,  Poland, the Czech Republic, and the United Kingdom— have subscribed to the Go SUEZ Classique and Multiple  offers. This has enabled SUEZ to raise over 140 million  euros through employee shareholding. In 2023, SUEZ  employees' participation in the Group total  capital was around 3%, representing more than  13,000 employees. SUEZ was awarded by the the Fédération  Française des Associations d'Actionnaires  Salariés et Anciens Salariés (FAS), by the  “Grand Prix de l'actionnariat salarié”, for its  proactive employee shareholding policy.  © SUEZ / Jérôme Baudoin  ===== PAGE 46 ===== 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N TA L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 46 2.5.2.3 | Contributing to the sustainable development of communities SUEZ implements tailor-made solutions that can be  adapted to the specific characteristics of each region, the  size of each town, the constraints of each farmer, and the  location of each industrial company. In general, SUEZ strives to take into account the UN's  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in its investment  strategies, in order to bring its expertise to bear locally  while taking into account the economic, legal, and  technical realities. SUEZ intends to play a leading role  in achieving the UN's 2030 Sustainable Development  Goals (SDG), in particular the one relating to water  and sanitation (SDG 6), as well as those relating to  climate (SDGs 7 and 13) and sustainable production and  consumption (SDG 12). By transforming its activities,  SUEZ aims to strengthen its presence in areas of growing  need (SDGs 11 and 15). In its Sustainable Development Roadmap 2023-2027,  SUEZ makes a commitment to contribute to a responsible  economy by providing employment and local development  in the regions where it operates:  	- by increasing the share of local businesses among its  suppliers; 	- by increasing the proportion of spending on  organizations that promote inclusion, e.g. for the  employment of vulnerable people;  	- by having 5,000 people benefiting annually from its  programs supporting reintegration into the workforce  in 2027.  It also supports voluntary work from SUEZ employees  monitoring the number of hours dedicated to local  associations and support access to basic services in most  critical situations with 2 main indicators:  •	pourcentage of contracts of drinking water distribution  covered by a solidarity mechanism;  •	pourcentage of water distribution contracts “profiled”  towards water poverty (i.e., mapping of areas at risk  regarding availability, accessibility or affordability of  services). Contributing to local wealth with responsible  procurement With 40,000 suppliers, SUEZ has a responsible purchasing  charter that associates its subcontractors and suppliers,  with its Sustainable Development roadmap. SUEZ  contributes to the progress of the industry as a whole  and encourages the emergence of eco-industries. SUEZ is  committed to acting fairly, transparently, and impartially  towards its suppliers, in accordance with the applicable  regulations and the rules and guidelines set out in its  Ethics Charter, its Human Rights policy, and its Vigilance  Plan, which is currently being drawn up. SUEZ responsible  purchasing charter stipulates its commitments towards  Sustainable Development:  	- contribute to mitigating climate change, especially with  regards to Scope 3 impacts; 	- preserve Biodiversity; 	- social and territorial commitment; 	- responsible Governance.  Those commitments are detailed into operational  objectives. SUEZ expects its suppliers to proactively  implement these operational objectives, thereby  contributing to the creation of overall value, economic,  social and environmental performance, as well as  managing sustainable development risk management.  Ethical and Sustainable Development clauses are  stipulated in SUEZ General Purchasing Conditions.  (GPCs) and standard contracts. In 2023, 59.9% of  supplier contracts included a CSR clause at the Group  level. This indicator measures the rate of contracts that  include a CSR clause outlining several engagements that  suppliers must adhere to, such as adherence to SUEZ  'Ethics Charter,' 'Ethics in Business Relations' guide,  and 'Ethics in Supplier Relations' practical guide, as well  as compliance with international and national norms  addressing fundamental topics such as human rights,  the health and safety of employees and third parties,  environmental protection, anti-corruption measures,  competition laws, and economic sanctions. It is applicable  to various contract types, including framework contracts,  listing contracts, application contracts, and project  contracts. This indicator encompasses suppliers from all  countries where SUEZ operates. Many Business Units have launched initiatives to  animate and reinforce inclusion of sustainability in their  processes. In particular, trainings over different forms  have been conducted on the purchasing teams in France,  in the UK etc… In the UK, SUEZ partners with the Supply  Chain Sustainability School and use this to train the  procurement team and others within SUEZ.  As part of the  partnership, a series of workshops were held in 2023 on  Biodiversity, Modern Slavery, Carbon reporting.  In France,  a seminar with the purchasing team of the water activities  was made to train buyers on social and environmental  issues within the Supply Chain. SUEZ in the UK run supplier awards for 3 past years.  These  awards recognize and reward suppliers who support SUEZ  in achieving its goals in the following categories: 	- protecting the Environment; 	- health, Safety and Wellbeing; 	- delivering Social Value; 	- continuous Improvement and Innovation; 	- excellent Collaboration.  ===== PAGE 47 ===== 47 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y Developing appropriate solutions for all regions  and their inhabitants  Social innovation In France, the role of the Social Innovation Department  is to ''bring employment and the circular economy  together'' in the regions where SUEZ operates, by  supporting the subsidiaries and meeting their needs  as closely as possible (inclusion clauses in contracts,  employees' commitment to solidarity, etc.), and by  developing collaboration with local players. That  department coordinates various integration programs  and mechanisms, such as Rebond Insertion: a wholly  owned subsidiary of SUEZ that helps reintegrate people  into the workforce.  Rebond Insertion was launched in 2002. In 22 years, it  has supported more than 11,000 beneficiaries on 13 sites.  70% of employees leave Rebond Insertion with a long- term employment or a qualifying training. The action of social innovation department covers 3 areas:  •	propose enhanced commercial solutions by designing  a circular and inclusive economy component in SUEZ  offers. After having analyzed territories and local  ecosystems, SUEZ concludes partnerships with  circular economy entrepreneurs. In some cases, those  entrepreneurs are even supported by one of the SUEZ  incubators based in Paris, Lyon, Bordeaux.  •	promote inclusive recruitment through apprenticeship  or integrated social purchasing thanks to Rebond  Insertion for instance. The objective is to offer these  employees a career, specific trainings and support in  their daily life for instance.   •	encourage skill-based sponsorship of SUEZ employees  to provide access to essential services to population  which are not covered. This is possible through SUEZ  foundation or Aquassistance, whose missions are  described later in this document and through an  employee volunteering charter allowing employees  in France to work 2 days per year for an association  through Vendredi web platform.  In France, 3,337 people were beneficiaries from SUEZ  inclusive structures & job inclusion programs in 2023.  In 2023, Rebond Insertion allowed 784 disadvantaged  people to get a job and solve housing, mobility or health  problems. 74% of people employed by Rebond Insertion  ended up with a sustainable job or a qualifying training. In the United Kingdom, SUEZ ensures since 2019 Greater  Manchester's waste management, which is equivalent  to 1.1 million ton produced by around 2.3 million people  inhabitants. The Group supports Greater Manchester in  its strategy to promote a circular economy, as part of  the 5 Year Environment Plan, to significantly improve  recycling rates and avoid the storage of more than 96%  of household waste. In the course of this contract, the  Renew Hub was created to focus on prevention, reuse and  repair and move towards a circular economy and reduce  reliance on imported resources. The Renew Hub is the  UK’s largest re-use operation. It has created 20 new jobs  in the green sector so far.  In South Africa, EnviroServ has over 300 reclaimers at  two of its waste management facilities.  Over the years,  the reclaimers have proven to be critical stakeholders.  The relationship between EnviroServ and the reclaimers  is mutually beneficial. By reclaiming waste at both the  Chloorkop and Rosslyn waste management facilities, they  divert waste from landfill and save much needed airspace.  In return, EnviroServ provides safe, humane, sanitary and  convenient working conditions. Access to water services In other geographies, to meet the challenge of access to  water in certain regions of the world or in specific contexts,  SUEZ is developing decentralized water treatment and  sanitation plants in more than 40 countries, including  Ivory Coast, Benin, Ghana, the Philippines, Malaysia, and  in the Caribbean and Pacific islands. Officially committed  to the implementation of the right to water and sanitation  since that right was recognized by the UN in 2010, SUEZ  intends to contribute to the achievement of Sustainable  Development Goal 6 by: 	- developing sustainable access to essential services as  part of its contracts; 	- dedicating nearly €3 million in 2022 for the SUEZ  Foundation, which has supported 21 projects, including  five dedicated to access to essential services in  countries where needs are greatest; 	- sharing know-how to accelerate access to services by  supporting training programs and making its expertise  available as part of the AgroParisTech-SUEZ ''Water for  All'' Chair. The expertise developed by the Group enables it to  meet the challenges of access to essential services, in  countries in both Northern and Southern countries. •	In Northern countries, SUEZ helps its customers set  out and implement social policies in relation to water  aimed at guaranteeing access to service for people  experiencing economic difficulties. Whether that  means implementing a mediation and social support  program, introducing special water rates, or putting  subsidy mechanisms in place, all these measures are  defined in consultation with local parties, with the aim  of responding as effectively as possible to the specific  challenges of the area. In France, 60% of drinking water  contracts were covered by a solidarity mechanism.  ===== PAGE 48 ===== 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N TA L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 48 •	In response to the major challenges of access to  services faced by residents of cities in Southern  countries, the Group makes available to its customers  the expertise and experience it has acquired in  improving and extending services in underprivileged,  unconnected neighborhoods. Deployed in India, as  well as in Senegal since January 1, 2020, the Group's  expertise in this field combines knowledge of the water  activity and expertise in social engineering practices  to ensure a good understanding of the local context,  community involvement throughout the project, and the  implementation of technical and commercial solutions  adapted to the context.  In India, 15 million people have benefited from SUEZ's  expertise in improving the efficiency of wastewater  networks and drinking water distribution. Between  2021 and 2023, more than 1,500 km of water network  was replaced, 10,000 leaks were fixed, and 2,800 km of  sewers were cleaned. The Group has designed and built  250 drinking water and wastewater treatment plants in  the country, and will be operating 25 plants starting from  2022, seven of which recycle over 90% of the treated water  for agricultural or industrial use. SUEZ provides drinking  water and wastewater services for major metropolises  such as New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Kolkata,  and other major cities such as Lucknow, Mangalore,  Davanagere, Coimbatore, and Udupi.  To help its managers set out their priorities in terms of  dialogue and actions to optimize its societal contribution  in the regions where it operates, SUEZ has developed  a specific methodology, tools, and dedicated training  courses. SUEZ employs that methodology for all its critical  projects. In line with SDG 17, the Group encourages the  use of innovative partnerships that enable local players  to work together to find solutions to the issues and  problems they face. Strengthening our impact through sponsorship SUEZ intends to combine its expertise and the energy of  its employees with that of civil society. This commitment  to solidarity stems from a strong desire on the part of  the Group's employees, as evidenced in feedback from  in-house surveys.  In 2023, 6,738 hours of voluntary work were dedicated  from SUEZ employees with local associations.  In 1994, the Aquassistance association was founded by a  group of SUEZ employees: it is a network of 625 members  that makes its volunteers’ skills and equipment available  to support projects around the world. Aquassistance  provides assistance to vulnerable populations in the  areas of water, sanitation, and waste, both in development  aid projects and in emergency and post- emergency  situations.  SUEZ focuses its philanthropic efforts on the areas and  populations that need them most, making sure to set  them clearly apart from its contribution to its commercial  activities. Within the framework of its public service  delegation contracts, SUEZ promotes and implements  contractual solidarity mechanisms and decentralized  cooperation initiatives, where that is provided for in  regulations and contract specifications. In terms of  corporate philanthropy, the Group has three foundations  and two associations in Europe and Asia, to which SUEZ  devotes a total budget of over €3 million annually.  The Board of Directors of the SUEZ Foundation is chaired  by Sabrina Soussan, CEO of SUEZ and Chair of SUEZ  International, and comprises 6 directors, including  a representative of the Group's employees and three  individuals qualified in its scopes of intervention. In the  area of access to essential services, the Foundation takes  action by supporting partner associations, including  Aquassistance, an NGO for SUEZ employees and retirees,  and by training water and wastewater service operators  in developing countries through the AgroParisTech-SUEZ  ''General Management of Urban Water and Wastewater  Services'' Chair. Since its creation in 2009, the Chair has  trained over 500 managers from four continents. The  Foundation also plays an active role in France on the  theme of inclusion, supporting employment and training  for people who have fallen out of the workforce, and social  cohesion through education, culture, and sport for young  people in priority urban districts and fragile rural areas.  In September 2023, the SUEZ Foundation set up an  emergency fund for Morocco, to support NGOs and  associations helping people affected by the earthquake.  The Foundation has continued to promote inclusion  through access to essential services in emerging and  developing countries:  •	In Bangladesh, the SUEZ Foundation supports an  NGO called “ACTED” in a program to improve waste  collection mechanisms and community awareness  on waste management to foster sustainable sanitary  conditions for Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar Sadar  refugees’ camps;  •	The SUEZ Foundation is continuing its partnership with  “Fondation Raoul Follereau”, which is implementing  a program to combat Neglected Tropical Diseases  (NTDs) by improving the quality of water, hygiene, and  sanitation (WASH) services and through community  response in the Soubré Health District, Côte d'Ivoire. In France, the Foundation promotes inclusion through  professional integration and education. In 2023, it  supported an organization called “Emmaüs Connect”,  in its program to help people in precarious social and  digital situations to integrate society and recycling   ===== PAGE 49 ===== 49 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y digital equipment. It also supports an organization called   “Ma Chance Moi Aussi” supporting children from the  earliest age, globally, continuously and in the long term,  which makes their approach unique. The SUEZ Foundation  also supports Kodiko, an organization that provides  mentoring thanks to refugee/ SUEZ employee tandem, for  their integration in France and to support them in their  job search. It supports MakeSense in its action-research  project to get young people in impoverished neighborhoods  engaged in climate and environmental issues.  At the end of 2023, a process of co-construction with all  its stakeholders was launched, to define the Foundation's  new strategy and roadmap, in line with SUEZ Purpose.  Working within the framework of the UN's Sustainable  Development Goals, the Foundation works with its  partners to ensure that the right conditions are in  place to sustainably improve the living conditions of the  populations concerned by its projects, and that the results  are long-lasting.  In October 2023, SUEZ launched its first Solidarity  Commitment Week. At this occasion, the employee  engagement system was launched officially. It provides,  for all employees based in France the possibility of: 	- volunteering (outside working hours, unlimited)  through a dedicated platform offering different  missions for numerous associations; 	- benefit from a solidarity time credit of 2 days per year  per employee; 	- carry out an adapted transition mission at the end of   their career (employees with more than 10 years of  seniority and having acquired all their quarters, limited  to 12 months).  Sharing our expertise and exerting a positive  influence Academic Chair Eau pour Tous In 2008, the SUEZ Foundation joined forces with  AgroParisTech to create the ''General Management  of Urban Water and Wastewater Services'' Chair,  with the support of AFD (Agence Française de  Développement) from 2009. The aim of this Specialized  Master's degree is to train the future leaders of public  organizations in charge of providing public water  and sanitation services in emerging and developing  countries. For almost 15 years, 280 students from   54 countries have benefited from the Master's courses,  and over 200 professionals have been trained in short  courses (sanitation, PPP, etc.). In addition to SUEZ via its  foundation and AFD, the Chair's partners include Agence  de l'eau RMC, PAM Saint-Gobain, Amane advisors, and  the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The 2023-2024 class, sponsored by Sylvain Usher,  Executive Director of the African Water Association, has  42 auditors (31 men, 11 women), including 17 French- speaking and 25 English-speaking, from 19 countries  in Africa, Asia, Europe and Central Asia. More than   30 SUEZ employees are involved in skills sponsorship as  expert speakers, coaches, trainers, thesis and defense  evaluators, etc., and 8 academic partner countries  are taking part in the ''K-OpT'' immersion case studies  (Ghana, Togo, Senegal, Cambodia, Singapore, Kenya,  Morocco, Benin) carried out this year in Morocco, Senegal,  Cambodia, Togo, Singapore and Ghana). 21 countries have  shared their service management indicators to build a  unique Bench-OPT service management database, and an  ex-post evaluation is being carried out with service HRDs  to measure the impact on improving partner water and  sanitation services. 49 © SUEZ / Franck Dunouau  ===== PAGE 50 ===== 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N TA L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 50   Relations with institutions   The Group implements a strategy of positive influence  with institutions on subjects related to its activities, builds  strategic alliances with other players to support the  environmental transition, and is at the root of platforms  for discussion and the sharing of ideas and standards.  SUEZ keeps up a regular dialogue with public institutions  at the local, national, European, and international  levels (European Parliament, Commission, Council (via  the permanent representations of the Member States).   The Group communicates regularly with French,  European, and international institutions through position  papers, direct contact, and by participating in events  organized by professional organizations. The main topics  covered include issues of  general  interest, such as the  fight against climate change, the efficient management  of natural resources, sustainable production and  consumption, and adapting to the challenges of the  energy crisis. They also relate to subjects more directly  linked to the Group's day-to-day activities, such as  public procurement management methods, legislation  on waste recycling and recovery, and drinking water and  wastewater treatment. In France, in accordance with the Sapin 2 law of  December 9, 2016, the Group is listed on the register  of the High Authority for the Transparency of Public  Life (HATVP). SUEZ publishes annual reports on all its  interest representation activities with public institutions  and the related costs. Part of the costs of those activities  are incurred through SUEZ membership of national  associations and federations.  The Group is registered as an interest representative with  the European institutions. Each year, the Commission  publishes the following information on its website: the  Group's areas of interest, its membership of associations  linked to the European Union, the amount and sources of  funding received from European Union institutions, and  the costs incurred in representing the Group's interests  to European institutions (staff and travel expenses,  membership of professional associations, external  service providers).  Standardization SUEZ has been an active member of AFNOR for many  years and recognizes the importance of regulations  and standards in the conduct of its activities, both for  operational performance and business development.  SUEZ has always been a major player in French  standardization in the environmental sector. Every year, to  keep abreast of standardization-related work, we appoint  numerous experts to technical committees, either on  behalf of SUEZ or the professional federations to which  SUEZ belongs (FP2E / FNADE). Over 30 working groups  and standards were monitored in 2023. SUEZ has been a member of the AFNOR Board of  Directors since 2023, and is represented by the Group's  Standards Director, who also chairs the Environment and  Social Responsibility Strategic Orientation Committee  (COS), as well as the Iso/TC 224 committee on Systems  and services relating to drinking water, wastewater  and stormwater management, and its French mirror  committee. SUEZ was a partner in the organization of AFNOR's  annual meetings on energy performance and efficiency,  which took place on Thursday November 23 at the CB21  auditorium and brought together around a hundred  experts from all horizons on this theme. This meeting is  recognition of SUEZ involvement in AFNOR bodies over  many years. Professional organizations and associations  SUEZ is also involved in many professional organizations  or associations both at international and national level  to achieve progress on sustainable development and  advocate on environmental protection. The following list  is not exhaustive.  In the waste business, SUEZ is an active member  of the European Federation for Waste Management  and Environmental Services (FEAD) and of the  Fédération Nationale des Activités de la Depollution et  l’Environnement (FNADE).  In the water business, SUEZ is a member of the  International Water Association (IWA) and of the  Fédération Professionelle des Entreprises de l’Eau (FP2E).  SUEZ is a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact  and board member of the Pacte Mondial des Nations  Unies in France. It is also member of the Observatoire  de la Responsabilité Sociétale (ORSE), Entreprises pour  l’Environnement (EpE) and Entreprises pour les Droits  Humains (EDH) in France.  ===== PAGE 51 ===== 51 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 2.6 | Enforcing basic rights among the value chain 2.6.1 | Description of the challenges SUEZ has made ethics an essential means of improving  its overall performance. Respect for and compliance  with those ethical values is essential in all the Group's  activities, both in internal dealings and in relationships  with customers, partners, suppliers, and all external  stakeholders. The Group applies a ''zero tolerance''  principle, set out in its Ethics Charter, to any act that could  be considered an attempt at active or passive corruption  in the context of its business relationships. Such acts are  prohibited in all relationships with customers and their  technical advisors, as well as with competitors, partners,  suppliers, subcontractors. Because it manages common goods in sometimes  complex economic and political contexts, relying on more  than 40,000 suppliers around the world, SUEZ is regularly  confronted with situations involving the protection of  human rights.  As a major company with a worldwide  presence, SUEZ is vigilant in its respect for human rights,  through its employees and business partners. SUEZ is  careful to identify and prevent risks of serious violations  of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as  risks to the environment, health, and safety. In addition  to its vigilance approach, SUEZ intends to promote human  rights, in particular professional equality and diversity,  and to play a driving role in the effective implementation  of the right to water, on behalf of its customers as well  as through its corporate sponsorship efforts (see section  above). 2.6.2 | Policies and action plans As part of the social pillar of its Sustainable Development  roadmap, SUEZ commits to comply with universal values.  This means to enforce basic rights among its value chain  and make health and safety a priority for all each and  every day (see section 2.4).  Enforcement and promotion of basic rights in SUEZ value  chain is supported by 3 main levers:  	- Its Ethics charter and anti-bribery policy; 	- Its Human rights policy; 	- Its Vigilance plan. 2022 results  2023 results Number of basic rights infringements 0 0 Number of corruption cases   0 0 Number of employees trained in ethics 1,957 2,601 SUEZ employees are asked to consider the impact of  their actions and decisions on people, so as to prevent  their integrity or dignity from being harmed by a Group  entity or one of its employees. In February 2022, one of  the first messages from the new CEO, Sabrina Soussan,  addressed to all Group employees, reiterated her ethical  commitment, and referred everyone to the SUEZ Ethics  Charter. A new Ethics Charter was drafted in the first half  of 2022 and signed by Sabrina Soussan in her capacity as  CEO of SUEZ. The mapping of ethical risks was updated in 2022. It was  presented by the Group Ethics Officer and validated by the  Management Committee in July 2022. In its roadmap for  2023, the Group's Compliance and Ethics department has  asked each compliance officer to improve the identified  risks. In addition, procedures aimed at managing ethical risks,  and in particular the risk of corruption, have been set out  and verification measures have been put in place: 2.6.2.1 | Promoting ethical practices and fighting corruption  ===== PAGE 52 ===== 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N TA L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 52 •	A specific procedure governs the conclusion of  contracts with commercial or institutional consultants.  In particular, it sets out the due diligence measures to  be carried out prior to the conclusion of such contracts  and the prior approval mechanisms; •	Due diligence measures have been put in place when  selecting co-investors, co-contractors, subcontractors,  and suppliers; •	A procedure for patronage and sponsorship initiatives  sets out the applicable principles and the mechanisms  for prior approval; •	An Ethical and Responsible Lobbying Charter has  been drawn up to serve as a point of reference for all  employees who undertake to represent the Group's  interests. A procedure for controlling third parties at risk was  implemented in 2023. It applies to all the Group's legal  entities on the one hand, and on the other, is ensuring  that all public or private customers, suppliers, companies  likely to be acquired by SUEZ, SUEZ industrial partners,  certain employees hired by SUEZ, intermediaries, etc.  comply with the requirements set out by SUEZ in its ethics  guide and by the Sapin 2 law.  The implementation of these policies and processes  is under the responsibility of the Group Ethics and  Compliance Officer and their network of 15 Ethics and  Compliance Officers (ECO) in Business Units. In 2023,  training courses on compliance and new rules and  process were conducted to the Ethics and compliance  network.  Over the course of 2023, 2,601 employees received  training on ethical matters. SUEZ ethics and anti-corruption system has also been  incorporated into the Group's internal audit system. As a large company present all over the world, SUEZ is  vigilant in terms of respect for human rights, through its  employees and business partners. SUEZ seeks to identify  and prevent the risks of serious violations of human rights  and fundamental freedoms, as well as the environment,  health and safety. SUEZ has adopted a specific policy  regarding the respect and promotion of basic rights in  July 2023. This policy applies to all SUEZ activities and its  subsidiaries included in its scope of consolidation. The  principles of this policy are promoted by Group employees  who sit on the boards of directors or supervisory boards of  companies in which SUEZ holds a stake. They also apply  to SUEZ subcontractors and suppliers, in accordance with  the ethics and sustainability clauses included in their  contracts. The Group's human rights policy is based on international  reference texts, in particular: •	The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and  Additional Covenants; •	Conventions of the International Labour Organization  (ILO), in particular with regard to the non-use of  forced labour (Conventions no. 29 and 105), child  labour (Conventions no. 138 and 182), discrimination  (Conventions no. 100 and 111), and the protection of the  right to organise and collective bargaining (Conventions  no. 87 and 98); •	The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European  Union; •	The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and  Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational  Enterprises; •	The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and  Human Rights United Nations; •	The United Nations Convention against Corruption; •	The French law on the duty of vigilance and similar  laws, in particular those on the fight against modern  slavery in the United Kingdom and Australia; •	The Group's purpose adopted in September 2022, and  its Ethics Charter, updated in 2022: the commitments  voluntarily made by SUEZ as part of its Ethics Charter,  its Sustainable Development roadmap, its adherence to  the 10 principles of the United Nations Global Compact,  and the OECD Principles on water governance. •	The International Finance Corporation's sustainability  standards, which apply directly to many SUEZ projects. This policy covers three main areas / stakeholders:  	- Commitments towards employees; 	- Commitments towards responsible purchasing; 	- Commitments towards local communities. An action plan is being implemented to strengthen  existing measures for mitigating and preventing the risks  of human rights abuses that may arise in connection with  the Group's activities and its supply chain. It is based on  two pillars: 2.6.2.2 | Promoting human rights  ===== PAGE 53 ===== 53 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y •	Informing employees and training them in the best  practices to adopt when faced with the risk of human  rights violations. For example, information sheets on  the main human rights issues to be observed in certain  countries are sent to managers of teams operating in  those countries, and awareness-raising and training  materials are available for all Group managers; •	Based on a mapping of supplier-specific risks,  the Purchasing Department has strengthened its  qualification process for suppliers and subcontractors,  as well as control and support systems, coordinating  relationships and negotiations with the Group's  strategic suppliers and ensuring, in particular, that  they are committed to respecting the principles of  Sustainable Development and Human Rights, as well  as complying with SUEZ ethical rules. Ethical and  Sustainable Development clauses are stipulated in  SUEZ General Purchasing Conditions (GPCs) and  standard contracts. In 2023, 59.9% of supplier contracts  included a CSR clause at the Group level (which is more  than 10 point higher than last year). The Group's Sustainable Development and Legal  Departments are responsible for co-steering the human  rights policy and, in particular: 	- establish and regularly update a global mapping of  potential negative impacts and inform other Group  stakeholders of any new risks or issues related to their  activities; 	- ensure the existence and deployment of an appropriate  control framework; 	- monitor this operational implementation and report on  application of this Policy; 	- promote it inside and outside the Group. At operational level, risk officers are responsible for the  annual review of local impact mapping. Each department  responsible for the various risks identified is responsible  for ensuring that the Policy is properly applied. The results of the implementation of the Human Rights  policy are: 	- discussed annually by the Executive Committee; 	- presented annually to the CSR Committee of the Board  of Directors; 	- presented to the social partners, within the framework  of the European Works Council annually; 	- published each year in the Group's Extra-Financial  Performance Statement, for information and dialogue  with stakeholders. Anyone is able to report alerts on ethics and/or human  rights. SUEZ has a Group alert system open to all its  stakeholders. The confidentiality and protection of those  who use it are guaranteed. In application of French law no. 2017-399 of March 27, 2017,   on the duty of care of parent companies and ordering  companies, as well as British or even Australian  regulations on the fight against modern slavery in global  value chains, SUEZ is implementing a vigilance plan.  In line with the United Nations Guiding Principles on  Business and Human Rights, it describes: 	- the characteristics and organization of SUEZ in the  exercise of its duty of care, 	- the method for assessing and mapping the risks of  serious violations of human rights and fundamental  freedoms, human health and safety, and the  environment, 	- key risk mitigation and prevention actions, 	- monitoring and performance indicators. This stand-alone document is accessible on SUEZ website.  As a player in the environmental sector, SUEZ owns or  manages numerous types of water and waste treatment  facilities on behalf of third parties. By the very nature  of such processing activities, such sites entail risks  of damage to natural capital (air, water, soil, natural  habitat, and biodiversity) and can also present health  risks for consumers, local residents, employees, and  subcontractors. Those risks are compounded by the  potential physical impacts of climate change. 2022 was a year dedicated to adapting SUEZ vigilance  approach to its new scope, by the new players involved  in its governance. In January 2024, SUEZ publishes  its new Vigilance plan covering the activities of all its  subsidiaries for 2023, available on its website. That plan  aims to identify and prevent the risks of negative impacts  on people and the environment resulting from the Group's  activities or those of subcontractors and suppliers when  they are related to the Group's activities. It reports on a  continuous improvement approach within SUEZ and to its  partners. SUEZ participates in voluntary initiatives and working  groups such as the Global Compact on Human Rights  and is a member of the Entreprises pour les Droits de  l'Homme (EDH) office: those discussions with peer  organizations support SUEZ continuous improvement  approach by applying the shared best practices and using  the educational tools developed therein. 2.6.2.3 | Vigilance plan  ===== PAGE 54 ===== 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N TA L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 54 3 Key performance  indicators  associated with  the identified main  challenges as part  of the non-financial  performance  statement  ===== PAGE 55 ===== 55 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y Section of the  challenge in the  non-financial  performance  statement Key performance indicator Assurance  level Unit 2022   result (without  acquisitions) 2023   result 2.3 Preserving  Nature Waste recovery rate Moderate % 47.9% 48.5% Technical yield of drinking water distribution networks Reasonable % 83.7% 84.2% Wastewater reused Moderate % 3.7% 4.2% Percentage of priority sites with a biodiversity action  plan deployed Moderate % 62.5% 65.4% 2.4 Fighting  against climate  change  Direct emissions - Scope 1 Reasonable tCO2e 2,673,370 4,273,410 Indirect emissions - ''Location-based'' scope 2 Reasonable tCO2e 1,297,034 912,833 Indirect emissions - ''Market-based'' scope 2 Reasonable tCO2e 1,089,278 1,018,127 Indirect emissions - Scope 3 “Global” including water  heating and transformation of sold products  Moderate tCO2e 17,405,105 27,398,298 Indirect emissions – Scope 3 ''Operational'' excluding  water heating and transformation of sold products  (details below) Moderate tCO2e 2,871,377 4,216,392 Indirect emissions - Scope 3.1 Moderate tCO2e 1,261,425 1,262,258 Indirect emissions - Scope 3.2 Moderate tCO2e 6,748 266,466 Indirect emissions - Scope 3.3 Moderate tCO2e 502,829 329,976 Indirect emissions - Scope 3.4 Moderate tCO2e 158,732 221,588 Indirect emissions - Scope 3.5 Moderate tCO2e 839,414 1,729,651 Indirect emissions - Scope 3.6 Moderate tCO2e 2,718 6,946 Indirect emissions - Scope 3.7 Moderate tCO2e 34,308 40,057 Indirect emissions - Scope 3.8 Moderate tCO2e NA NA Indirect emissions - Scope 3.9 Moderate tCO2e 53,166 120,364 Indirect emissions - Scope 3.10 Moderate tCO2e NA 1,965,959 Indirect emissions - Scope 3.11  Moderate tCO2e 14,540,755 21,297,523 Indirect emissions - Scope 3.11 “without water heating “ Moderate tCO2e 7,028 81,576 Indirect emissions - Scope 3.12 Moderate tCO2e NA NA Indirect emissions - Scope 3.13 Moderate tCO2e NA NA Indirect emissions - Scope 3.14 Moderate tCO2e NA NA Indirect emissions - Scope 3.15 Moderate tCO2e 5,009 157,510 Avoided emissions Moderate tCO2e 4,040,487 6,413,206 2.5 Contributing to  social and societal  challenges % of management positions held by women Moderate % 33.8% 34.5 % % of women in the Executive committee - % - 28.6% % of women in the Board of Directors - % - 23.1% % of employees trained, including digital training Moderate % 75.3% 77.4% % of employees covered by a social dialogue system Moderate % 92.9% 94.2% Fatal accidents involving employees Moderate Number 1 SUEZ employee 3 Subcontractors 1 SUEZ employee 1 Subcontractor Frequency rate of workplace accidents Reasonable Rate 6.43 5.97 2.6 Enforcing basic  rights among the  value chain Number of basic rights infringements Moderate Number 0 5.97 Number of corruption cases   - Number 0 0 Number of employees trained in ethics Moderate Number 1,957 2,601  ===== PAGE 56 ===== 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N TA L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 56 4 Application   of the European  Green Taxonomy   to SUEZ activities  for the financial  year 2023  ===== PAGE 57 ===== 57 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 4.1 | Context and consistency European Regulation 2020/852 of June 18, 2020, on the  establishment of a framework to encourage sustainable  investment, known as the ''European Green Taxonomy''  establishes a classification system for economic activities  considered environmentally sustainable. That shared  European Union frame of reference identifies economic  activities that contribute to the European objective of carbon  neutrality, i.e. ''the Green Deal'', and establishes a basis for  comparison between companies. Ultimately, the aim of the  European Green Taxonomy is to steer investment by public  and private players towards activities that contribute to the  transition to a more sustainable economy. To that end, the regulation sets out six environmental  objectives: 1.	 Climate change mitigation; 2.	 Climate change adaptation; 3.	 Sustainable use and protection of water and marine  resources; 4.	 The transition to a circular economy; 5.	 Prevention and reduction of pollution; 6.	 Protection and restoration of biodiversity and  ecosystems. The Regulation, through its Delegated Acts, establishes  scientific, ambitious, and transparent criteria for  assessing an activity's contribution to one of the six  objectives. Two main concepts are identified to that end: Eligibility An eligible activity is one listed in the Delegated Acts  as contributing to at least one of the six environmental  objectives and for which technical criteria have been  defined. To date, those are the ''priority'' activities with  the greatest potential for contributing to environmental  objectives. However, the Delegated Acts will be  progressively updated and reinforced, with the aim of  integrating more and more activities and strengthening  the requirements. In 2023, new eligible activities have been introduced by  the amendments to the Climate Delegated Regulation  (EU) 2023/2485 and the Taxonomy's Environmental  Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486 adopted by the EU  Commission in November 2023.  As such, an activity eligible under the ''climate change  mitigation'' or ''climate change adaptation'' objectives  in force is an activity listed in Annexes I and II of the  Taxonomy's Climate Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139  or in Annexes I and II of the Taxonomy’s Amended Climate  Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2485. An activity eligible  under the ''sustainable use and protection of water and  marine resources'', ''transition to a circular economy'',  “pollution prevention and control” or “protection and  restoration of biodiversity” objectives in force is an  activity listed in Annexes I, II, III and IV of the Taxonomy's  Environmental Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486. Alignment An aligned activity is an eligible activity that makes a  substantial contribution to an environmental objective  according to the technical criteria set out for each  environmental objective, that does not cause significant  harm to other environmental objectives, and that  complies with the minimum safeguards criteria. Under Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 of July 6,  2021, stipulating details on the content and presentation  of information to be published by companies [...] as  well as the method to be followed to comply with that  information obligation, companies are required to publish  the share of their turnover, capital expenditure, and  operating expenditure associated with their eligible and  aligned activities. 4.1.1 | Regulatory context Alignment of activities within the meaning   of the Taxonomy Eligible activities are defined and described by an initial categorization  based on 6 objectives.  ELIGIBLE ACTIVITIES Substancial Contribution (SC) The activities  meet the  criteria  Do not  Significant Harm   (DNSH) Minimum  Safeguards (MS) Activities are  carried out in  compliance withe the  International Charter  1 2 3 Aligned activities make a substancial contribution to one   of the environmental objectives without prejudice to the other objectives,  while complying with the requirements of the Minimum Safeguards.

In 2024, for the financial year 2023, the regulatory  obligation to publish information is now extended to  the eligibility of activities under the four environmental  objectives as well as to activities listed in the amended  Climate Delegated Regulation. SUEZ as a new SUEZ S.A.  entity is subject to that publication obligation. The financial year 2022 was the first year of publication for  SUEZ S.A., following the acquisition on January 31, 2022, of  the SUEZ business lines sold by Veolia. As a result, the 2022  published figures were the consolidated figures for only  eleven months (February 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022). This is the second Taxonomy report for SUEZ S.A. and the  first one with consolidated figures for twelve months. In January 2023, SUEZ published its new Sustainable  Development Roadmap 2023-2027. It includes strong  ambitions for the six Climate and Environmental  objectives of the EU Taxonomy. The taxonomy will be  an important steering tool for our operational and non- financial performance. Eligibility (and alignment in the future) with the taxonomy  are now criterias incorporated into project evaluations  when projects come  for approval by the Operations  committee. That committee approves any project relating  to a new investment or a new or existing contract whose  amount exceeds one of the thresholds set out in the Group  procedure. Some projects must be approved by the SUEZ  Board of Directors or a Board Committee. The procedure  also includes a risk grid, including environmental and  social criteria, reviewed by the central Sustainable  Development team. 4.1.2 | Link with SUEZ Sustainable Development strategy 4.2 | Results of eligibility and alignment of SUEZ   	   activities with the European Taxonomy 4.2.1 | Turnover indicators Summary of 2023 EU Taxonomy results (including Taxo4 alignment) Non  eligible Activities 38% 38% Aligned 62% Eligible Eligible Activities Not  aligned 24% Aligned Activities (Climate Objectives)   - Regulatory 31% Aligned Activities  (taxo4) - Voluntary 7% 2023 Turnover  ===== PAGE 59 ===== 59 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y This year, under the two climate objectives and the four  new environmental objectives of the taxonomy: •	 62% of the revenue is eligible; •	 31% of the revenue is aligned under the two climate  objectives (38% of the revenue is aligned under the six  objectives). That eligible revenue primarily corresponds to the  following activities: •	 Municipal water supply: 	- Production and distribution of drinking water; 	- Wastewater collection and treatment. •	 Waste management: 	- Selective waste collection; 	- Sorting and recycling; 	- Biowaste: anaerobic digestion and composting; 	- Landfill biogas recovery; 	- Collection and transport of hazardous waste; 	- Treatment of hazardous waste. In the same way, SUEZ has carried out this second  alignment reporting exercise in a spirit of total  transparency and in strict compliance with the criteria set  out in the regulation. A conservative approach was chosen  whenever arbitration was needed on the interpretation  of substantial contribution or Do No Significant Harm  (DNSH) criteria. Details of those interpretations are  presented in the methodological note (section 6). The  Group may review those arbitrations in future reports in  the light of future additions made by the commission or in  the light of joint interpretations by the industry.

As a result,  2022 published figures were consolidated figures for only  eleven months (February 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022).  The financial year 2023 is the first one with consolidated  figures for twelve months. Compared to prior year, the main changes are related to  the three following acquisitions:   •	 SUEZ Recycling & Recovery UK (December 2022).  42% of its revenue is eligible including municipal,  commercial and industrial sorted collection, processing  & recycling;  •	 IWS the leading hazardous waste company in France  (November 2022). 83% of its revenue is eligible  including hazardous waste incineration, facility  management and production of solid recovered fuels  from hazardous waste;  •	 EnviroServ the leading waste management company  in South Africa (September 2022). 37% of its revenue  is eligible including hazardous waste collection and  sorted commercial and industrial collection. Indeed the 2022 publication included these three entities  only from the date of their integration: EnviroServ on  September 30, 2022, IWS on December 1, 2022, and SUEZ  Recycling and Recovery United Kingdom (R&R UK) on  December 5, 2022.  Other changes are mainly related to regulatory evolutions  including:  •	 New eligible activities including hazardous waste  collection and treatment, waste transfer stations due  to integration of the four new environmental objectives  for eligibility;  •	 Improvement of alignment on Climate Objectives with  integration of international perimeters aligned. 4.2.4 | Variations compared to the previous year 4.3 | Outlook The taxonomy will be a key tool for steering SUEZ  strategic choices.  For the financial year 2023, the analysis of eligibility and  alignment with the European Taxonomy highlighted areas  of improvement for future Taxonomy reporting exercises,  as well as drawing strategic lessons for the company in  terms of its contribution to the environmental transition. As such, SUEZ has identified several actions to be  implemented over the next few years: •	 Reinforcing analysis of the alignment with the four  new objectives, which include sorting and recycling  activities, hazardous waste collection and treatment  activities, wastewater reuse after treatment,  desalination, etc.; •	 Raising awareness among internal stakeholders to  challenges of the taxonomy; •	 Alignment with federations to share interpretations of  regulations between players in the same sector, and to  best reflect the spirit of the taxonomy regulations. •	 Analysis of climate resilience and a diagnostic of  physical risks. Defining, implementing, and financing  action plans is a priority integrated into the Group's  new 2023-2027 SD roadmap. As described in chapter  2.4, the Group has started to strengthen its work on  adaptation by building a tool enabling us to measure  site by site the level of exposure regarding the 28  climate-related hazards and climate projection  scenarios identified by the EU Taxonomy. This tool will  also help us monitoring our vulnerability and deploying  actions plans to mitigate it.  ===== PAGE 63 ===== 63 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 5 Methodology  of annual  reporting  ===== PAGE 64 ===== 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N TA L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 64 Through its subsidiaries, SUEZ is active in a broad variety  of water and waste management business lines, with  a variety of contractual forms and operating methods  at several thousand sites around the world. This great  diversity of situations, in addition to the constant evolution  of the Group's operating scope, makes it particularly  complex to stabilize the definition of relevant indicators,  as well as the calculation and collection of quantitative  data. As a result, SUEZ is continuing its efforts to provide  data audited by third parties as a guarantee of ever-  greater reliability. The aim is to make the Group's non-  financial reporting an ever more effective management  tool for achieving the goals set out in the Group's  Sustainable Development Roadmap and corporate  social responsibility, as well as a tool for dialogue on the  continuous improvement of its overall performance. 5.1 | General guidelines The work requested by the Group from the independent  third-party body falls within the obligations of Order  no. 2017-1280 of July 19, 2017, and Decree no. 2017- 1265 of August 9, 2017, transposing European Directive  no. 2014/95/EU on the publication of non-financial  information, namely the production of a reasoned opinion  on the non-financial performance statement, expressing  a conclusion of moderate assurance on: •	 The statement's compliance with the provisions of  Article R. 225-105 of French commercial code; •	 The sincerity of the information provided pursuant to  3°of I and II of Article R. 225-105 of French commercial  law, i.e. the actions and results of policies including key  performance indicators relating to the main challenges  identified. 5.2 | External checks and audits 5.3.1 | Scope The environmental figures published in the non-financial  performance statement relate exclusively to companies  over which SUEZ has operational control. Once a company  partly owned by SUEZ enters the scope of operational  auditing, its environmental data are fully taken into  account, whatever the share held in that company. The  scope of consolidation is fixed at June 30 of the financial  year. For disposals taking place after that date, the entity  is expected to complete the environmental survey with the  data available up to the date of disposal. All acquisitions  made after June 30th are excluded from the consolidation  scope for the current fiscal year.  The legal entities included in the scope of environmental  reporting are those whose activity is relevant in terms  of environmental impact (as such, financial, construction,  and engineering activities are excluded). Only entities  with an industrial activity and over which SUEZ has a  dominant operational technical influence are included  in the report. Year-on-year comparisons are made on a  like-for-like basis. Restrictions on scope may be applied  to certain published variables. Those are indicated on a  case-by-case basis. A major evolution in 2023 is the contract SEN’EAU that  is no longer under SUEZ operational control and was in  2022. In terms of period, the scope of reporting is the full  calendar year from 1st of January 2023 until the 31st of  December 20239. 5.3 | Methodological aspects of            the environmental reporting _ _ 9 This year, SUEZ in the UK has exceptionally used 12 rolling months data (from November 2022 to October 2023) in order to give better accuracy due to their integration  late 2022 but it will align again to Group procedures (full calendar year) next year.  ===== PAGE 65 ===== 65 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 5.3.2 | Waste activities Waste activities includes notably collection, transfer,  sorting and recycling, material, biological or energy  recovery, incineration, landfill (open and closed), and  treatment of hazardous waste. 5.3.3 | Water activities Water activities covers all the activities in the water  cycle,  including  drinking  water  treatment and  distribution,  wastewater  collection  and treatment, reuse of treated  wastewater, seawater desalination, and sludge treatment  and recovery. It also includes all water production and  wastewater treatment activities for industrial customers. 5.3.4 | Reporting tool SUEZ uses an online application for environmental  reporting. That application enables management  and documentation of the reporting scope, the input,  verification, and consolidation of indicators, the  production of reports and, last but not least, the provision  of the documents required for data collection and the  information feedback. 5.3.5 | Procedures SUEZ provides its data contributors with online  procedures, tools, and support documents for  reporting technical information. According to the  current organization and allocation of responsibilities,   SUEZ IT procedures and tools are rolled out directly  through the business units' central departments. The  process of escalating and validating information at  lower levels (subsidiaries, regional departments,  operating sites) is organized in accordance with internal  procedures and checks set up by each business unit.  In-house procedures and IT tools adapted to each local  organization are used at those levels. The roll-out of procedures and instructions throughout  the Group relies on a network of Data Owners formally  appointed by each data entry entity. Those Group-level  procedures and work instructions describe in detail the  phases of collecting, checking, consolidating, validating,  and sending technical data to the central department in  charge of organizing the process. They are backed up by  technical documents providing methodological guidelines  for calculating certain variables. © SUEZ / William Daniels  ===== PAGE 66 ===== 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N TA L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 66 5.4.1 | Scope The social analyses in that report relate exclusively to  fully consolidated entities (FC), i.e. companies in which  SUEZ has a controlling interest, both in terms of capital  and management. As soon as a company enters the FC  scope in the SUEZ accounts, 100% of its social data are  integrated, regardless of the percentage of capital held.  With the exceptions mentioned below, the 2023 reporting  scope (coverage of the target indicator as a percentage of  the Group headcount) is 100% for all the indicators. 5.4 | Methodological aspects of             the social reporting 5.4.2 | Tools and methods The social reporting is based on: •	 A network of some 100 people worldwide, who collect  and check the indicators for their entity/entities  during each quarterly social reporting campaign. Each  quarter, data from around 230 legal entities is collected  and consolidated, and then entered by local Human  Resources managers. That network is run via quarterly  meetings (in-person meetings for correspondents from  French entities, meetings over Microsoft Teams for  international correspondents). Those meetings provide  an opportunity to pass on information, clarify the  definition of certain indicators, share best practices,  and reiterate key points to watch out for. A collaborative  space is also available to all correspondents; •	 On the ''User Guide'', which brings together all the  definitions and procedures that make up the Group's  shared frame of reference, i.e. some 50 primary  indicators, whose various collection criteria (by  age group, gender, etc.) result in a total of around   250 social indicators. This guide is available in English  and French. It is distributed to all contributors; •	 SUEZ financial consolidation tool which, via a  section dedicated to social indicators, enables the  collection, processing, and return of data entered by  local legal entities that are subsidiaries of the Group.   An e-learning module on social reporting is available  to the contributors. That module enables new users to  teach themselves how to use the tool, and to familiarize  themselves with the requested social indicators  (definitions, examples and tips). For existing users, that  training enables them to deepen their knowledge. © SUEZ / Cyrille Dupont  ===== PAGE 67 ===== 67 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 5.4.3 | Consolidation and internal audit Once collected, the data is consolidated by the  subsidiaries and the Group Human Resources Department  (HR Department) according to clearly defined procedures  and criteria. Internal control of those data is ensured at  the following stages: •	 Automatic checks: consolidation packages include a  number of automatic checks that enable contributors  to ensure the reliability of information entered at  the finest level. In addition, contributors can include  comments in the packages to explain significant  changes or situations specific to the entities concerned; •	 Checks at the subsidiary level: the main subsidiaries  carry out consistency checks on the data from their  entities; •	 Checks at the Group HR Department level: the Group  HR Department in turn carries out consistency checks  on the data from all the entities. Those checks involve  analyzing changes in the indicators over time. In  the event of a significant change, the contributor in  question is contacted for a more in-depth analysis,  which may lead to a correction. 5.5.1 | Human rights violation The scope covered by this indicator is all SUEZ. This indicator is monitored by the whistleblowing system  for SUEZ: ethics@suez.com.  The receipt and processing of alerts are managed  by the dedicated procedure “Procedure for ethical  whistleblowing”. Alerts are received by the Ethics and  Compliance Department, which handles them with the  help of the relevant functions where necessary.  Alerts for 2023 are listed in the dedicated register and  categorised by theme:  	- Ethics ; 	- HR ; 	- Customer service ; 	- RGPD ; 	- Request for information ; 	- Cybersecurity ; 	- Integrity ; 	- Human rights ;  	- Other. To report this indicator in the NFPS, we account for  the number of alerts which falls under “Human Rights”  category. 5.5 | Methodological aspects of             other indicators (except Taxonomy) 5.5.2 | Fighting against corruption The response to this challenge is tracked through number  of employees trained in ethical conduct. To that end,  the Group relies on its online training monitoring tool  “Talent’up”. The scope covered by this indicator is all SUEZ  entities reporting their trainings through Talent’Up, and  every employee working for the Group at the end of 2023  (an employee that did a training in 2023 but left the Group  before the end of the year will not be counted). The trainings concerned by this indicator could be digital  training or physical ones.  ===== PAGE 68 ===== 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N TA L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 68 5.6.1 | GRI correspondence table 5.6 | Correspondence tables:    	   Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), TCFD 		     	   (Task Force on Climate-related Financial  	   Disclosure), United Nations Global Compact Source  GRI Disclosure Section no. 102-1 Name of the organization See Management Report 2023 102-2 Activities, brands, products, and services See Management Report 2023 102-3 Geographical location of the head office See Management Report 2023 102-4 Geographical locations where the activities take place See Management Report 2023 102-5 Registered capital and form of legal entity See Management Report 2023 102-6 Markets covered See Management Report 2023 102-7 Size of the organization See Management Report 2023 102-8 Number of employees See Management Report 2023 102-9 Organization's supply chain See Management Report 2023 102-10 Significant changes to the organization and its supply chain See Management Report 2023 102-11 Precautionary principle See Management Report 2023 102-12 Charters, guidelines, and other external initiatives See Management Report 2023 102-13 Membership of national and international associations See Management Report 2023 102-14 Statement by the most senior decision-maker about the importance of sustainability to the  organization and its strategy See Management Report 2023 102-16 Organizational values, principles, standards, and rules, such as Codes of Conduct and Codes of Ethics See Management Report 2023 102-18 Corporate governance structure, including committees of the highest governance body See Management Report 2023 102-40 List of stakeholder groups with which the organization has established a dialogue See Management Report 2023 102-41 Percentage of all employees covered by a collective agreement See Management Report 2023 102-42 Criteria for identifying and selecting stakeholders to engage with in a dialogue See Management Report 2023 102-43 Approach to stakeholder involvement See Management Report 2023 102-44 Challenges and major concerns raised See Management Report 2023 102-45 Entities included in the financial consolidation, with explanations concerning any exclusions See Management Report 2023 102-46 Definition of the report content and scope of the challenges See Management Report 2023 102-47 List of relevant challenges See Management Report 2023 102-48 Reaffirmation of the information See Management Report 2023 102-49 Changes in the reporting See Management Report 2023 102-50 Reporting period See Management Report 2023 102-51 Date of last published report, if applicable See Management Report 2023 102-52 Reporting cycle See Management Report 2023 102-53 Contact person for any questions about the report or its contents See Management Report 2023 102-54 GRI-compliant reporting statements See Management Report 2023 102-55 GRI correspondence table See Management Report 2023 102-56 External audit of the report See Management Report 2023  ===== PAGE 69 ===== 69 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y Source  GRI Disclosure Section no.

Activities contributing to climate change mitigation and  adaptation are identified in appendices I and II of the  Delegated Regulation of June 4, 2021 and in Annexes I  and II of the Taxonomy’s Amended Climate Delegated  Regulation (EU) 2023/2485.  As mentioned in section 2.4, SUEZ is already anticipating  climate change and is conducting a project to adapt  its assets to climate change. To date, SUEZ is not able  to declare any turnover, CAPEX and OPEX under the  adaptation objective as the action plans are not fully  deployed yet. Activities contributing to the sustainable use and  protection of water and marine resources, the transition  to a circular economy, the pollution prevention and  control and the protection and restoration of biodiversity  and ecosystems are identified in appendices I, II, III and IV  of the Delegated Regulation of June 27, 2023.

The Group  has chosen to allocate the corresponding revenues to  water activities eligible for classification under headings  CCM5.1 or CCM5.3 only, without taking into account  the differentiation between renewal and construction,  extension, and operation of water collection, treatment  and supply systems. Individual measures Within SUEZ, expenses eligible under ''individual  measures'', as defined by the Taxonomy Regulation,  correspond to the following activities: •	 CCM6.5.

These revenue sources derive from activities and business  models not covered by the taxonomy, and specific to the  Group's business sector. Furthermore, these activities  play a full part in the environmental transition needed to  meet international targets for combating climate change  and protecting natural capital and water resources. •	 Treatment of industrial water enables the Group's  customers to benefit from water whose composition  and quality are adapted to their manufacturing  processes and consumption. These treatment  processes are tailored to the needs of each particular  industrial sector: food processing, microelectronics,  pulp and paper, etc. •	 Invoicing for the provision of services on a one-time  basis or as part of the contractual framework for the  management and operation of water and waste sites  is commonplace for the Group, and includes various  types of service provision, such as conducting studies,  drawing up master plans and modeling in the water  sector, engineering projects, environmental consulting  assignments, and the collection and processing of  data and the design of innovative digital applications  for the environmental efficiency of cities and users.  These service provisions help maintain or improve  the efficiency and effectiveness of water and waste  treatment activities, thereby contributing to better  management of water resources and protection of  natural resources. Activities excluded from the reference system •	 Landfill excluding biogas capture and valorization:  Landfill of final not recycled waste replaces  uncontrolled dumping of waste whose untreated,  unsupervised degradation poses risks to human health  and the environment as a result of air, water, and soil  pollution. It is therefore an activity that contributes  directly to public health in regions. More specifically, the waste storage solutions offered  by SUEZ to its customers in emerging countries  initiate environmental management and protection  initiatives in areas where waste treatment facilities  are still being developed. These solutions take the  place of uncontrolled landfills, which are significant  sources of methane emissions and industrial accidents.  Furthermore, rehabilitating unauthorized landfills  involves integrating the site into the local environment  by redeveloping the area, and installing a drainage  and collection network for leachates and rainwater to  reduce pollution for the environment and human health. The Group considers that such activities, which have  so far been excluded from the standard, should be  included in the European taxonomy as part of the  objective of preventing and reducing pollution, when  they contribute to preventing pollution impacting the  environment and human health in emerging countries. •	 Mixed waste collection: In a similar way to strictly  separate collection, mixed waste collection, if combined  with a thorough downstream sorting process, can also  ensure the recovery of a proportion of non-hazardous  waste by redirecting some of it to existing recycling and  reclamation channels. Moreover, separate collection  is not always possible due to specific local conditions,  particularly in certain developing countries; a mixed  collection process coupled with an efficient sorting  system therefore makes for a more circular model. •	 Non-Hazardous Waste Incineration (excluding  downstream activities): The activity of non-hazardous  waste incineration is not currently covered by a  Delegated Act.  ===== PAGE 75 ===== 75 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 6.1.2 | Methodology for analyzing technical alignment review criteria   	   and key arbitration decisions SUEZ eligible activities were evaluated with regard to the  three Technical Review Criteria (TRC) categories: 	- activity-specific TRCs, including substantial contribution  criteria and activity-specific DNSH criteria; 	- generic DNSH criteria, which are applicable in the same  way to activities in question; 	- minimum safeguards criteria, which must be verified at  the Group level. 6.1.2.1 | Specific technical review criteria and arbitration decisions The tables below set out the information used to qualify  the alignment of eligible activities for Climate change  mitigation objective of the EU Taxonomy, and the details  of the methodological approach. As required by the EU  Taxonomy regulation, SUEZ includes in its regulatory  tables only alignment with Climate Objectives. Water activities (revenue, CAPEX, OPEX) Substantial contributions Specific  DNSH  criteria  Approach and arbitration decisions CCM 5.1 Construction,  extension and  operation of  water collection,  treatment and  supply systems SUEZ sites / contracts declared  aligned record either an average net  energy consumption for abstraction  and treatment equal to or lower  than 0.5kWh per cubic meter of  water produced or an Infrastructure  Leakage Index (ILI) equal to or lower  than 1.5 (international BUs only) ,  and as such meet the substantial  contribution criteria. N/A CCM 5.3 Construction,  extension and  operation of  wastewater  collection and  treatment SUEZ sites / contracts declared  aligned record an average net energy  consumption for treatment and  collection equal to or lower than the  threshold defined for their population  equivalents. N/A With regard to average net energy consumption,  SUEZ has taken into account in its calculations  the energy produced, whether self-consumed or  sold. With regard to population equivalents, SUEZ  has taken into account in its calculations the  capacity corresponding to the pollution load  actually treated (based on the biochemical oxygen  demand over five days: BOD5) rather than the  nominal capacity of the plant.

SUEZ strictly  complies with the  Circular Economy  DNSH criteria in its  separate collection  of sorted waste:  separately collected  waste fractions are  not mixed in waste  storage and transfer  facilities with other  waste or materials  with different  properties. As the choice of strictly separate collection and treatment of  waste is generally the responsibility of the Group's customers (particularly municipal customers), it is not SUEZ  responsibility to set out the waste collection and transportation  methods. However, the industrial techniques and processes put in place  by SUEZ ensure that volumes of mixed waste collected are  prepared so that some of it can be redirected to recycling and recovery channels for reuse and recycling. Where identified, those volumes have been included in eligible  revenue, OPEX and CAPEX. ''Co-mingled'' collection is considered separate here.   Co-mingled'' flows are recyclable waste flows sent for recovery  of materials, but collected and transported together before  being sorted a second time prior to processing. For municipal waste collection activities, the proportion of  waste collected separately has been identified among the total  volumes of waste collected during the year. It should be noted  that pre-sorted mixed fractions have been included.   The associated financial data have been calculated in  proportion to those identified volumes. For industrial collection activities, financial indicators are  associated with flow categories: all incoming flows have  been considered for eligibility and substantial contribution,  excluding unsorted non-hazardous industrial waste. SUEZ accounts for the transportation of sludge and green  waste upstream of treatment and recovery through land  application or composting under activity CCM5.5, as the flows  collected are sorted at source and collected separately. CCM5.6 Anaerobic  digestion of  sewage sludge The SUEZ sites  declared aligned  under criterion CCM5.6 strictly  comply with  the criteria for  substantial  contributions. SUEZ sites declared  aligned under  criterion CCM5.6  strictly comply with  the Pollution DNSH  criteria. In category CCM5.6, SUEZ only considers sludge anaerobic  digestion sites for wastewater treatment activities. CCM5.7 Anaerobic  digestion of bio- waste The SUEZ sites  declared aligned  under criterion CCM5.7 strictly  comply with  the criteria for  substantial  contributions. SUEZ sites declared  aligned under  criterion CCM5.7  strictly comply with  the Pollution DNSH  criteria. In the waste management activity, the majority of SUEZ  anaerobic digestion treatment plants are fed with biowaste,  but some sites are authorized to process sludge.   As proportion of the sludge is low in terms of volume,   SUEZ decided to include everything in the majority category  5.7 (bio-waste), as details by activity are not available for the  financial data requested.  ===== PAGE 77 ===== 77 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y CCM5.8 Composting of  bio-waste   In order to meet the alignment criteria  below, SUEZ considers the volumes  of biowaste composted at biowaste or  mixed sludge/bio-waste composting  facilities. SUEZ sites  declared aligned  under criterion  CCM5.8 strictly  comply with the  Pollution DNSH  criteria.   SUEZ takes into account all revenue from  bio-waste composting facilities in France and  in UK, including green waste. For mixed bio- waste and sludge sites, SUEZ will only include  the revenue associated with the bio-waste  component, and for the associated OPEX and  CAPEX, applied pro rata based on revenue. CCM5.9 Material  recovery from  non-hazardous  waste SUEZ sites declared as aligned convert  at least 50%, by weight, of separately  collected non-hazardous waste into  secondary raw materials suitable for  replacing virgin materials in production  processes.  N/A  SUEZ takes into account all the revenue that  may include sorting, processing, and sales of  materials.  It includes IBA10 processing activities. Production  of SRF (Solid Recovered Fuels) or RDF (Refuse  Derived Fuels) has been excluded. It is important to note that SUEZ has complied  with question 68 of the FAQ of December 19,  2022, and, as such, has taken into account only  its sorting activities that can be considered as   recycling activities, and not only as “pure sorting”  activities.  This FAQ clarification runs counter to the  principle of the circular economy and climate  change mitigation, since sorting centers are an  essential link provided by SUEZ in the recycling  chain. This position is also supported by FEAD  and Euric federations. To calculate the proportion of waste recycled,  SUEZ compares outgoing flows with incoming  flows in terms of metric tons per site. The  outgoing flows taken into consideration are  those that can be considered as secondary raw  materials. CCM5.10 Landfill gas  capture and  utilisation SUEZ strictly complies with the following  criteria: 1.The landfill has not been opened after  July 8, 2020. 3. The produced landfill gas is used for  the generation of electricity or heat as  biogas, or upgraded to bio- methane  for injection in the natural gas grid, or  used as vehicle fuel or as feedstock in  chemical industry. 4. Methane emissions from the landfill  and leakages from the landfill gas  collection and utilisation facilities  are subject to control and monitoring  procedures set out in Annex III to Council  Directive 1999/31/EC. However, with regard to the following  criterion SUEZ has adopted a specific  approach presented in column 3. 2. The landfill or unit where the gas  collection system is newly installed,  expanded, or modernized is permanently  decommissioned and no longer accepts  new biodegradable waste. SUEZ sites  declared aligned  under criterion  CCM5.10 strictly  comply with the  Pollution DNSH  criteria. In order to encourage investment in biogas  capture and recovery infrastructure, the scope  of this study also includes landfill sites that  are still in commercial operation, indeed such  infrastructures are always installed before the  landfill ceases operations. The revenue reported for this activity  corresponds strictly to the one generated by  the sale of energy from landfill gas that has  been closed or is still in commercial operation,  as well as the associated capital expenditure. SUEZ is not in a position to identify the  gas captured from its landfill units still in  operation, which moreover represents a  non-significant proportion of total quantities  captured. The gas is collected via collection  networks common to the whole site, which  includes the collection facilities of the open  units (the minority) and those of the closed  units (the majority). In this context, SUEZ  has chosen to account for all its landfill gas  capture activities in the financial year 2023  considering that gas capture activities offer the  significant environmental benefit of avoiding  the release of greenhouse gases into the  atmosphere.  ===== PAGE 78 ===== 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N TA L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 78 Energy production Substantial  contributions Specific DNSH criteria  Approach and arbitration decisions CCM4.8 Electricity  generation from  bioenergy SUEZ sites declared  aligned under criterion  CCM4.8 strictly comply  with the Pollution  DNSH  criteria.

SUEZ takes into account all revenue from heat  production using waste heat on its facilities in  France. Individual measures (CAPEX, OPEX) Due to the complexity and diversity of the criteria relating  to individual actions, the Group was unable to verify the  alignment criteria. As a result, CAPEX and OPEX eligible  for individual actions are not aligned. 6.1.2.2 | Environmental objectives In order to assess the voluntary alignment with the  4 environmental objectives and in the same way as for  alignment with the climate objectives, SUEZ activities  were evaluated with regard to the three Technical Review  Criterias (TRC) available to date :  	- activity-specific TRCs, including substantial  contribution criteria and activity-specific DNSH criteria; 	- generic DNSH criteria, which are applicable in the  same way to the activities in question; 	- minimum safeguards criteria, which must be verified  at the Group level.  ===== PAGE 79 ===== 79 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 6.1.3 | Generic DNSH criteria 6.1.3.1 | DNSH Adaptation In accordance with Appendix A of Annex I of the Delegated  Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 on Climate Change Mitigation,  the Group has verified compliance with the generic DNSH  adaptation criteria for all its eligible activities. The DNSH adaptation criteria require: 	- identification of physical climatic risks that could have  a negative impact on the Group's activities; 	- an evaluation of the vulnerability of activities to these  risks according to relevant scenarios linked to the  expected duration of activities and use of assets; 	- where major risks are identified, an evaluation of  the adaptation measures and implementation of an  adaptation plan. Analysis of climate resilience and diagnostic   of physical risks The identification of risks and the analysis of asset  vulnerabilities were part of the analysis carried out by  consulting firm Carbone 4 according to the ''OCARA''  (Operational Climate Adaptation and Resilience  Assessment) methodology. This analysis, carried out in 2021, covers the entire  SUEZ S.A. scope, with the exception of the Water France  BU. It assigned a risk level to SUEZ sites based on  the   vulnerability  of  the site's processes,  its  location,  climatic   hazards, and the IPCC climate projection SS5-8.5. A specific analysis covering the same methodological  aspects was done on the Water France scope, not covered  by the previous analysis, in collaboration with consulting  firm EcoAct. Defining, implementing, and financing action plans is a  priority integrated into the Group's new 2023-2027 SD  roadmap. As described in chapter 2.4, in order to align  all BUs with the same methodology, SUEZ has launched  a dedicated project. The first step was to build a tool  enabling us to measure site by site the level of exposure  regarding the 28 climate-related hazards and climate  projection scenarios identified by the EU Taxonomy. This  tool is useful for compliance with Adaptation DNSH.  The  second step will be to determine at site level vulnerability  regarding these hazards and then to define and implement  action plans. Adaptation measures Thanks to this work, adaptation measures have been  identified and sites have been prioritized in order to pace  the implementation of such actions over the coming  months and years. 6.1.3.2 | DNSH Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems Under the generic DNSH criteria on biodiversity, detailed  in Appendix D of Annex 1 of the delegated regulation,  in accordance with European regulation 2011/92/  EU, projects must undergo a preliminary analysis to  determine whether an environmental impact assessment  (EIA) is required. Depending on the results of the  assessment, the project may be exempt. Conversely, if  an environmental impact assessment (EIA) is required,  the assessment must be carried out and mitigation and  compensation measures must be implemented to protect  the environment. All of SUEZ eligible activities (with the exception of waste  collection (CCM5.5 and CE2.3)) are subject to compliance  with this DNSH Biodiversity criteria. Most of facilities built or operated by SUEZ in France  have the ICPE classification as environmental protection  facilities. Facilities with the ICPE classification are subject to  environmental authorization and registration. They are  among the categories of projects subject to environmental  assessment or case-by-case review, according to the  appendix to Article R122-2 of French environmental law.  As a result, they are aligned with the DNSH criteria. For other sites in Europe (ICPE-classified and subject to  declaration and sites not classified as ICPE), there are  two cases: 	- the facility falls into another project category listed  in the appendix to article R122-2, and consequently is  aligned with the DNSH criteria because it is subject to  an environmental assessment or case-by-case review; 	- the type of facility is not listed in the Annex to Article  R122-2, which means that, in the sense of Directive  2011/92/EU, the project is not likely to have any  significant impact on the environment, and as such is  deemed to satisfy the DNSH criterion. For activities carried out outside of the European Union,  BUs have analyzed compliance with local regulations  (when existing) or international standards.  ===== PAGE 80 ===== 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N TA L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 80 6.1.3.3 | DNSH Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources Following the example of biodiversity due diligence, the  generic DNSH criteria for water, whose requirements are  detailed in Appendix B, follows the same approach: in  accordance with Directive 2011/92/3U, the environmental  impact assessment (EIA) identifies, describes, and  evaluates the environmental effects of projects likely  to have a significant impact on the environment. The  environmental impact assessment (EIA) must include a  water impact assessment in accordance with Directive  2000/60/EC. SUEZ water and waste activities aligned are subject to  and comply with the DNSH Water criteria, see paragraph  6.1.3.2 on DNSH Biodiversity. 6.1.4 | Minimum safeguards In accordance with guidelines concerning the minimum  safeguards described in article 4 of the Taxonomy  regulation, economic activities contributing substantially  to one of the climate objectives and complying with the  relevant generic and specific DNSH criteria must also  implement procedures to align themselves with the OECD  Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN  Guidelines on Business and Human Rights (including the  principles and rights set out in the eight core conventions  listed in the International Labour Organization's  Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at  Work and the International Bill of Human Rights). The ''Final Report on Minimum Safeguards'' published by  the European Sustainable Finance Platform in October  2022 clarified the scope of requirements to be met as part  of that first alignment process. The report highlights four  areas which must be covered by minimum safeguards:  human rights (including worker and consumer rights),  corruption, taxation, and competition law. The Group's  compliance with minimum safeguards has been analyzed  in the light of the non-alignment criteria proposed in that  report. These criteria are designed to ensure that the  Group has not been at the origin of any violations of rights  and regulations in those four areas, and that procedures  are in place within the Group to identify, assess, avoid,  and mitigate any such violations. The Group's review of minimum safeguards was carried  out centrally via workshops with the relevant departments.  In light of these analyses, the Group has concluded that  the minimum safeguards are met, based on the following  guidelines: Human rights SUEZ is committed to respecting and promoting  recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms.  Details of SUEZ initiatives to support the respect and  promotion of human rights are detailed in chapter 2.6.2.2  of the non-financial performance statement. The Group has not been condemned for any human rights  violations. No referrals have been accepted by an OECD  National Contact Point (NCP), and no allegations have been  made against the Group and published on the Business  and Human Rights Resource Center (BHRRC) website. As described in section 2.6.2.3 of the non-financial  performance statement, in 2024, SUEZ also publishes  its new Vigilance plan covering the activities of all its  subsidiaries for 2023, available on its website. Fighting against corruption The Group and its executives have not been condemned  for any corruption offenses. Anti-corruption procedures are in place within the Group  and are described in section 2.6.2.1 of the non-financial  performance statement. Best practices in taxation The Group has not been condemned for any violation of  tax law. The company considers tax governance and compliance  as important elements of oversight, and adequate tax  risk management strategies and processes are in place.  Managing those risks is part of the Enterprise Risk  Management (ERM) process described in the ''2.1.2 Risk  and opportunity management approach'' section of the  non-financial performance statement. Competition law SUEZ has not been condemned for non- compliance with  competition law. The company makes its employees aware of the  importance of complying with applicable competition laws  and regulations, as set out in section 2.6.2.1 of the non-  financial performance statement.  ===== PAGE 81 ===== 81 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 6.2 | Methodology for identifying and calculating              indicators in SUEZ taxonomy report The financial information used for this analysis was subject  to additional reporting as part of the annual accounts  closing process.

The aligned revenue corresponds to the sum of  consolidated net revenue generated by Taxonomy-eligible  and aligned activities, i.e. activities that both correspond  to the definition of Taxonomy activity and meet all the  technical criteria, divided by the total consolidated net  revenue of SUEZ in the financial year 2023. Numerator The eligible and aligned numerator corresponds to  the sum of consolidated net revenue generated by the  proportion of revenue derived from products and services  associated with economic activities eligible and aligned  with the Taxonomy. The identification of eligible and  aligned revenue was carried out in consultation with  technical and financial teams. Denominator The denominator of the revenue eligibility and alignment  indicators is based on consolidated revenue for the year. Accounting principles applied to consolidated revenue  can be reconciled with financial statements.

Those two ratios are defined respectively  as Taxonomy-eligible CAPEX (numerator) divided by total  CAPEX (denominator), and Taxonomy-aligned CAPEX  (numerator) divided by total CAPEX (denominator). The CAPEX considered for the analysis of eligibility and  alignment with the European Taxonomy are not part of a  CAPEX plan. Numerator The numerators of the ratios include capital expenditure  linked to the associated assets or processes, i.e.: •	 Activities that are eligible (for the eligibility ratio), or  aligned (for the alignment ratio) with the taxonomy; •	 The ''purchase'' of products from activities that are  eligible (for the eligibility ratio) and aligned (for the  alignment ratio) with the taxonomy under individual  measures. Denominator Total CAPEX, the common denominator of the two  ratios, comprises acquisitions of tangible and intangible  fixed assets during the year, before depreciation and  amortization and excluding changes in fair value. It  includes acquisitions of fixed assets (IAS 16), intangible  assets (IAS 38), new concession work (IFRIC 12) for  models classified as intangible assets, and lease  repayments (IFRS 16).

Those two ratios are defined respectively  as Taxonomy-eligible OPEX (numerator) divided by total  OPEX (denominator), and Taxonomy-aligned OPEX  (numerator) divided by total OPEX (denominator). Numerator The numerators of the ratios include operating expenditure  related to assets or associated processes, i.e.: •	 Activities that are eligible (for the eligibility ratio), or  aligned (for the alignment ratio) with the taxonomy; •	 Individual measures enabling activities to become low-  carbon, or individual building renovation measures. Denominator Total operating expenditure (common denominator for the  two ratios) includes direct non-capitalized costs related to  R&D, building renovation measures, short-term rentals,  maintenance and repairs, and all other direct expenses  related to the day-to-day upkeep of property, plant, and  equipment by the company or a third-party subcontractor  that are necessary to ensure the ongoing, efficient  operation of these assets. Direct costs for training and  other human resource adaptation needs are excluded  from the calculation of the ratio in the numerator and  denominator, as Annex I to art. 8 of the delegated act only  includes these costs in the numerator. As SUEZ doesn’t have the granularity required to isolate  these OPEX in its consolidation tool at Group level and to  ensure the robustness of the reporting, each Business  Unit CFO has signed a report confirming the numerator  and denominator amount to be used for OPEX as defined  in the taxonomy above.  ===== PAGE 87 ===== 87 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N T A L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 6.2.3.2 | Regulatory tables Proportion of OpEx from products or services associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities – disclosure covering year  202313 _ _ 13 2022 published figures were the consolidated figures for only eleven months (February 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022).

In carrying out our limited assurance  engagement on the Information:  •  we obtained an understanding of all the consolidated entities’ activities and the description of the main  risks associated;   •  we assessed the suitability of the criteria of the Guidelines with respect to their relevance, completeness,  reliability, neutrality and understandability, with due consideration of industry best practices, where  appropriate;   •  we verified that the Statement includes each category of social and environmental information set out in  Article L. 225 102 1 III of the French Commercial Code as well as information regarding compliance with  human rights and anti-corruption and tax avoidance legislation and includes, where applicable, an  explanation of the reasons for the absence of the information required under Article L. 225-102-1 III,  paragraph 2 of the French Commercial Code;   •  we verified that the Statement provides the information required under Article R.225-105 II of the French  Commercial Code where relevant with respect to the main risks;  •  we verified that the Statement presents the business model and a description of the main risks associated  with all the consolidated entities’ activities, including where relevant and proportionate, the risks  associated with their business relationships, their products or services, as well as their policies, measures  and the outcomes thereof, including key performance indicators associated to the main risks;  •  we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to   o  assess the process used to identify and confirm the main risks as well as the consistency of the  outcomes, including the key performance indicators used, with respect to the main risks and the  policies presented, and   o  corroborate the qualitative information (measures and outcomes) that we considered to be the  most important presented in Appendix 1; concerning certain risks (Human rights, Ethics), our  work was carried out on the consolidating entity, for the others risks, our work was carried out  on the consolidating entity and on a selection of entities : R&V France, Eau France, Asia Water  Operation, R&R UK et R&V France Infra UVE.  •  we verified that the Statement covers the scope of consolidation, i.e. all the consolidated entities in  accordance with article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code within the limitations set out in the  Statement;  •  we obtained an understanding of internal control and risk management procedures the Entity has  implemented and assessed the data collection process aimed at ensuring the completeness and fairness  of the Information;  •  for the key performance indicators and other quantitative outcomes that we considered to be the most  important presented in Appendix 1, we implemented:  o  analytical procedures to verify the proper consolidation of the data collected and the  consistency of any changes in those data;   ===== PAGE 94 ===== 2 0 2 3  N O N - F I N A N C I A L  P E R F O R M A N C E  S TAT E M E N T     G R O U P  E N V I R O N M E N TA L ,  C O R P O R AT E  A N D  S O C I A L  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  P O L I C Y 94   Suez  5  o  tests of details, using sampling techniques, in order to verify the proper application of the  definitions and procedures and reconcile the data with the supporting documents. This work  was carried out on a selection of contributing entities  and covers between 38% and 83% of the  consolidated data relating to the key performance indicators and outcomes selected for these  tests (53 % of headcount, 65 % of recovered waste, 85 % of water volumes distributed and  consumed, 49-52 % of CO2 emissions scope 1 & 2) ;  •  we assessed the overall consistency of the Statement in relation to our knowledge of all the consolidated  entities.  The procedures performed in a basis for our limited assurance conclusion are less in extent than for a reasonable  assurance opinion in accordance with the professional guidelines of the French National Institute of Statutory  Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes); a higher level of assurance would have required  us to carry out more extensive procedures.  Nature and scope of procedures on the KPIs  With respect to Entity Selected KPIs, we have conducted work of the same nature as described in the ''Nature and  scope of procedures on the Statement and the Information” section for the key performance indicators and other  quantitative results that we considered most important, but in greater depth, particularly with respect to the  scope of testing.    The selected sample thus represents between 49% and 83% of the KPIs.   We believe that these procedures allow us to express reasonable assurance that the Information has been  prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.  Nature and scope of procedures on the Other KPIs  With respect to Entity Selected Other KPIs, we have conducted work of the same nature as described in the  ''Nature and scope of procedures on the Statement and the Information” section.    The selected sample thus represents between 24% and 67% of the Other KPIs.    We believe that these procedures allow us to express limited assurance that the Information has been prepared,  in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.

The chart below illustrates the percentage   of our top spend by category. The remaining expenditure is primarily associated  with outsourced mechanical work installations, sludge  management, self-perform maintenance works,   IT hardware and software, PPE and workwear, and  cleaning services. SUEZ WATER MODERN SLAVERY RISKS  Our review of our supply chain identified the potential of the following modern slavery risks. The purchase of uniforms, and hard   hats as well as hand, body and  respiratory protection. We purchase  these goods from suppliers that could  be sourcing and manufacturing goods  overseas with risk of modern slavery. Cleaning services is another risk of  modern slavery that could involve  workforces with a high proportion of   low skilled migrant workers who may  have limited English language skills   and understanding of rights under  Australian law. Computers and other electronics  pose risks of modern slavery for all  businesses due to risks of conflict  minerals and labour conditions  including the risk of child labour in the  production of critical components. SUEZ remains steadfast in its commitment to ethical  conduct and integrity in all business interactions, including  those with suppliers and subcontractors. The company  continues to enhance, implement, and enforce robust  systems and controls to prevent modern slavery within its  operations and supply chains. Addressing modern slavery risk management with  suppliers involves utilising various tools: •	 Annual supplier assessments,  •	 Enhancing onboarding processes, and •	 Engaging suppliers through questionnaire In 2023, SUEZ updated its yearly supplier assessment  protocol to further scrutinise potential risks among critical  suppliers. Additionally, the onboarding process was  revised to more effectively evaluate overseas suppliers and  associated risks. In 2023, SUEZ took action to address Modern Slavery  risks within our network of subcontractors and suppliers.  They were invited to participate in a Modern Slavery  questionnaire, allowing SUEZ to gather insights into their  strategies for managing this risk. During the year, SUEZ distributed the ‘Modern Slavery  Questionnaire’ (MSQ) to over 1400 suppliers in our  database. Out of these, SUEZ actively engaged with 685  suppliers and received responses from 16% of them. The  primary aim of the survey was to identify and address any  potential risks in our supply chain. Recognising the importance of robust supplier  engagement, SUEZ is investigating possible software tools  to be deployed in 2024 to enhance our ability to engage with  suppliers and streamline the process of gathering essential  information on modern slavery risks.   18.65%  Chemical and   treatment products   11.73%  Consulting services   9.00%  Plant equipment   8.67%  Site maintenance   8.43%  Electrical installation  and maintenance   43.52%  Other 2023 spend  percentage by  category PPE & WORKWEAR CLEANING SERVICES IT HARDWARE & SOFTWARE  ===== PAGE 8 ===== 8 SUEZ WATER   RISK ASSESSMENT, MITIGATION  AND REMEDIATION OF MODERN  SLAVERY RISK  Our governance mechanisms inform our approach to risk assessment and  mitigation of modern slavery risk.

Our governance mechanisms in SUEZ Water  governance framework The governance mechanisms in SUEZ Water are used to  implement and integrate our Ethics Charter as the local  standard for Australian market conditions and regulations,   to support our governance framework with managing  modern slavery risks which are set out below.  ===== PAGE 13 ===== 13 Objective Supplier Qualification and Assessment as Part of the Procurement Framework As part of the onboarding of a new supplier, the Procurement Team, is responsible and accountable for ensuring that the  supplier addresses the following minimum requirements:  •	 Compliance with legal regulations,  •	 Adherence to Business Line quality, environmental, ethical, security and social standards,  •	 Adherence to Business Line technical standards,  •	 Ability to meet Business Line needs and capacity requirements, and •	 Supplier pre-qualification as well as decisions regarding supplier selection and market price setting which must   be documented.  The Procurement Team  evaluates the supplier to ensure, and when necessary improve, the quality and  competitivitiveness of the goods or services provided to meet the strategic and operational needs of the business  including managing modern slavery risk. SUEZ’s Supplier Qualification process involves evaluating four major risk factors, detailed in the table below. If the  answer to any of the two questions  is ‘Yes’,the supplier needs to be qualified. Risk Factors  Key Questions Contract Value  Is value of the order above $50K? Criticality of the Goods/Services Will purchased goods/services put SUEZ at risk which will lead to contractual obligations not being met? Supplier Location  Will the order be placed with an overseas supplier? Monopoly  Are we impacted by supplier Monopoly situation? To qualify a supplier, SUEZ’s Procurement Team requests  that information is provided on the eight major aspects  shown in the diagram below.
